Mr. Jones, who was the Prisoner's Neighbour, took particular Notice of his coming home drunk, about 7 a Clock that Morning the Burglary was committed. And some other Circumstances concurring to raise a Suspicion of the Prisoner, he was apprehended. Some of the stoln Plate was found in his necessary House; and a piece of an Iron Bar in his Chamber, the other broken part of which was left in the Prosecutor's Cellar. The Prisoner was drinking in a Coffee-House near the Prosecutor's, till Mid-night; which was about two Hours before the Burglary; for betwixt 2 and 3 a Clock that Morning, the Prosecutor's Drawer was found in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made his Defence. I left the Coffee-House in Clare-street about 12 at Night, I was drunk, I crost the Way, and betwixt Mr.Cross's Ware-House, and the Fishmongers; I stumbled over something, and being just under a Lamp, I lookt about and saw lying there, the Plate that was found in my Vault, and the Piece of Iron that was found in my Chamber. From whence I went to Drury-Lane, and pickt up a Blackamoor Woman, and from her I went to the Night-House, and so home to my Wife in the Morning. <rs id="t17260302-26-verdict114" type="verdictDescription">

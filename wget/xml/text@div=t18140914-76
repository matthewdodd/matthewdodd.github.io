               <p>Q. When did you lose your notes - A. On the 30th of August, at Charing Cross, in the afternoon; I went up in a boat to Woolwich, and arrived at Charing Cross, in the coach; this man pretended to be my friend; he took me away from the coach to get some dinner, he was waiting there, and when I had my dinner, he asked me if I had any money; if I had, I had better leave it with him, it would be safe. I put two ten-pound notes, a five-pound note, and a one-pound note, on the table, bank notes; a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140048"></xptr>woman took it off the table, and put it in her pocket. The woman was waiting in the house. He called her his wife. The prisoner went out of the house; he left me in the house. Then I went out, I could not find my way back.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you groggy - A. No; not while I was in the house. When the prisoner was taken, he offered me a pound note to let him go. I am sure he is the man. There was no other man with me, but the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer. The sailor came to the office, and said he had been robbed by a tall man, in a fustian jacket. I took the prisoner at the Ship public-house. As soon as the sailor saw him, he said, he was the man. The prisoner said, is that what I am taken for; I never saw the man before in my life. The money has never been found. The coachman that brought the sailor up from Woolwich, said he could swear the prisoner is the man that look him away from the coach, but he could not attend here, he must drive the coach. The sailor could not point out the house to me where the prisoner took him in, nor have I been able to find it.</p>

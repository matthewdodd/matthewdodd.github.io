            . I had seen the ring about an hour before it was found upon Mrs. Green, the ring was in the glass. I saw Mrs. Green produce it, she said we had no occasion to make such a fuss about the ring there it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When she called me down stairs, she asked me if I had seen the ring, I said I had, I have got your ring on my finger, she said never mind, I am not in a hurry for it; this was on the Wednesday night, I delivered the ring to Mrs. Jones. On Saturday, he went for the constable, he told the constable all he wanted was to give him a night's schooling.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Was the ring delivered by her to you on the Wednesday. - A. No, on the Friday evening. I got a constable the next day at my dinner hour.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Friday evening you told Mrs. Green that you would take her up, and so there she sat still in her lodging - A. She did.</p>

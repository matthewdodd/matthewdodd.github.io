                  </hi>. I live in Milton-street, Gloucester-square. On 15th Nov., about half past 5 o'clock, I was in the New-road, near Park-square—the prisoner stopped me and spoke to me—he asked me if I would go on a message for him—I said I would—I went with him—he walked over into Park-crescent—that is on the other side of the way—he then gave me a letter—this is the envelope of it—I did not see the inside of it—it is directed to Mr. Horne, No. 9, Munster-street—it appeared to me to con<lb></lb>tain something—he told me to take it to Mr. Horne's, and wait for an answer, and to bring it back to Mr. Earl, No. 12, Park-crescent—I was to knock at the door and ring the servant's bell, and ask to see Mr. Earl, and he would recompense me for my trouble—I went to Mr. Horne and gave him the letter, and in consequence of what he said, I went back towards Mr. Earl's house, where I was told to go—I was going back with an answer, and when I got to the corner of Albany-street, which I had to pass to go to Mr. Earl's, I saw the prisoner—he came up to me and asked me if I was the boy he sent with the note just before—I told him yes, and he asked me how I got on—I told him what Mr. Horne had said, that he did not know me, and he would send an answer directly—the prisoner then said, "It is very awkward; run back, and ask him to send it by you directly"—I went back up Albany-street, and turned the first turning to the right towards Mr. Home's—I went round the corner, and I looked back and saw the prisoner and another man following me—I went down to Munster-street, and I saw the prisoner a few yards behind me—he put his hand up to his face and went into a doorway—I went on to Mr. Horne's, and in con-sequence of what he said I went back, and he followed me—when I got a little way from Mr. Horne's I saw the prisoner—I went up to him and took hold of him—I told Mr. Horne that was the man who gave me the note—there was another man walking with the prisoner—Mr. Horne took hold of the prisoner, and he sent me after the other man, who ran away—I have not the least doubt that the prisoner is the man who gave me the note and told me to take it to Mr. Horne.</p>

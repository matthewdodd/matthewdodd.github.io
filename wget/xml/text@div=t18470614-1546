I am the prisoner's wife—he is a lieutenant in the army on half-pay—we were married in 1820, and have three children—he is addicted to drink, and when under the influence of drink he is generally very violent—he has told me that he was not right in his head at times, and to be cautious what I said to him when he was under the influence of drink—he said he did not know what would be the end of it, as he knew his head was bad—we live at No. 105, East-street—on the 3rd of June he came home about half-past ten in the morning—he had been out all night, I think—he was very much agitated indeed—he had been drinking—he went into Mr. Crossland, the landlord's place—I could not hear what was said, but I could hear the tone of his voice—I do not know that he spoke to me—he kept talking to himself for two or three hours—I went down to the yard—he followed me round the yard—I went round because I was afraid he was going to strike me—he had not said anything to make me think so, but I saw he was in a violent passion—he did not say what he was in a passion about—he went up stairs, I remained down till nearly twelve o'clock—he re<lb></lb>mained quite still, and then I went up stairs—when I got up he came behind me with a knife—I did not see it, but I felt him stab me in my arm—he made no observation at the time, that I heard—I ran out of the room, went down stairs, and got away—I did not hear him speak—my recollection is not more faint now than it was before the Magistrate—he said nothing after he stabbed me—there was nothing said in the house at the time about my life—I do not know what was said out of the house, for the prisoner and the policeman walked on together—my son was in the room, and struck the prisoner's arm—I cannot say in what position the prisoner's hand was then,</p>

I am a son of the prisoner and prosecutrix, and live in the house—the prisoner was out all the Wednesday—he came home about ten o'clock next morning, and went out again almost immediately—I did not see him follow my mother at that time, he went down stairs after her about half an hour after that—he came back in the first instance, and spoke to me—my mother returned up stairs shortly before twelve o'clock—she came into the room, my father went behind her, and stabbed her with a knife in the arm—he had been quiet for a short time previous to that—the knife had been lying open on the table—this produced is it—he usually carried it with him—there was a table in the room, my mother went behind it, and he followed her, and struck at her a back-handed blow with the knife in his right hand—I cannot say what part he aimed at, it took effect on the left arm—I rushed forward and struck his arm as he was in the act of striking—I cannot be certain whether that diverted the blow from the direction it would otherwise have taken—I believe it is the opinion of the surgeon that the blow was struck very closely indeed to the heart—he struck from behind—I do not think he introduced his arm so as to strike before her—he made no observation at the time, but followed her down stairs after he had stabbed her—he then said he wished it had gone to her heart—about half an hour previous to the transaction, he said the flesh was drunk, but the spirit was not—my mother had not been in the room above a minute, when he followed her be<lb></lb>hind the table—he had been apparently quiet perhaps about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before she came up—I had heard him use expressions of resentment on other occasions—he has said that when he was in that state of mind he could not be accountable for the consequences, and he could not tell what the consequences would be.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, High-street, Newington. On the 3rd of June the constable brought Mr. Brock to my surgery about noon—I examined her left arm—there was a triangular wound through the muscles at the back part of the bone—it appeared to have been done by an instrument thrust through—there was one wound above, and one underneath the arm—the cut was continued downwards towards the elbow, almost forming a flap—if it had been continued a little longer the flesh would have been quiet disengaged from below—it did not appear to be made with the same blow, at the same time—there was a stab, and then an extension of the cut, as of a second action of the hand—it might have been done in drawing the knife out, because above the length was two inches, and below, where the knife had passed through, an inch and a quarter—the blow was behind the done—it passed through the muscles—it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140216"></xptr>
               <p>went down to the bone—it was through the thickness of the arm—upwards of an inch and a half of the knife went in—the knife produced probably would cause the wound—it is beveled on both sides, which formed the triangle—it was not of a dangerous character—if it had passed in front of the bone it might have been so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How near the position of the heart was the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was in a true line between the fourth and eighth rib.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the knife to be in the wound, a blow under or above would lengthen it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it might be attributable to that cause, or to the mode of drawing out the knife—I think the arm must have been close to the breast when the side was struck, and that the prisoner stood somewhat backwards—I think it was a back-handed stroke.</p>

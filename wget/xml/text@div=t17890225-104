               <p>I am an officer of the excise, I was stationed at Lare Delahoy, near Colchester; on the 22d of December last I went on the look-out at Beldon, to the Rose public-house, which is by the sea-coast, about half a mile from Mersey Island; when I was at the Rose public-house, I observed a number of horses and asses going towards the island, they were going by the house which is close by the road side, I observed the prisoner at the bar to be one of the party, I knew him before, he was upon an ass; upon this I informed my brother officers; when I saw them it was about four in the afternoon, I went to Colchester for some assistance, and I brought back with me Drawbridge, Eddy and Storer; one of them is the Collector's clerk, the other two are officers; we returned back some time between eight and ten, then we went to a place called <placeName id="t17890225-104-crimeloc468">Manwood</placeName>

               <p>I am an officer of the Excise; I went in company with the last witness, and two others, to Manwood; when we got into the middle, we heard some men and horses coming; the men were talking; we went aside, and Eddy and Storer were behind us; as soon as the smugglers came opposite to us we went out, and I asked, what they had got? they said, what is that to you? there appeared to be eight or nine of them; I told them we were King's officers, and must see what they had got; there were two men on horses, one a dun, and the other a brown; they had five tubs on each, with sling cords; Rowe was further on than me; the two men alighted, and went towards Rowe, and one of them struck at him, it appeared to me to be with a large bludgeon, or whip; when I saw them dismount, before they went to Rowe, I called out to my brother officers not to hurt any one unless they resisted; I went up, and seized the dun horse; and, in a minute or two after that, I heard Eddy cry out, Drawbridge! Drawbridge! come to my assistance, for I am down; he was about four rods from me; I went, and found him closed with one of the smugglers in the bushes; they were down, and he told me, the smuggler would not let him go; Eddy was uppermost; I desired the smuggler to let him go; if he did not, I must strike him; I had a drawn cutlass in my hand; he would not let Eddy go, and I struck the smuggler; and he let him go, and I desired Eddy not to close with any of them any more; I then went back, and took hold of the horse; two or three of the smugglers came and struck the horse to make him go away, but I held him fast; one of the smugglers then came up, and with a long stick about four feet and a half long, which he held in both his hands, and struck me on the back of the head; I had an iron cap on, but notwithstanding I was stunned; and while I was staggering, I heard a voice say, damn you, Dawbridge, now we have you we will do you, and I fell; and three or four of the smugglers were beating of me with large bludgeons; while I was down, I called out to Rowe to come to my assistance, or I should be murdered; I got up, and staggered to the road, where I fell again; and the smugglers came up and laid on me again; then Rowe came to my assistance, and beat them off, and I got up again: we got the two horses with ten casks, which we tasted at Colchester, and I found it to be geneva and brandy; me and the three officers took them to Colchester, and Rowe followed us; I am sure the defendant is one that struck me; I struck him again; three times with the cutlass, I struck him on the head; I am positive he is the man.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon in Colchester; I dressed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250152"></xptr>the prisoner on the night of the 22d of December, about two miles from Manwood, at a house between Mersey Island and Manwood; I believe there were six of them all wounded; the general tenor of their conversation was, that they had had an affray with the Excise officers in Manwood, and that they were all wounded; the prisoner was one of them; I dressed them all; he had three long cuts on the forehead, and a blow on the skull; that I took several pieces of bone out of his skull; he appeared from his wounds to be almost in a stupid state; he had a most terrible cut on the wrist, about three quarters through the bone, so that I was obliged to get a board sawed, to lay his arm on and bind round to keep it together; I expressed my surprize at seeing men in that state, and in liquor; at the time I dressed the prisoner I did not think he would recover from the state of the wound in the skull.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys addressed the Jury on the behalf of the prisoner, and called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

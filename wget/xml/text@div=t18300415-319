            . On the 18th of March the prisoner came to the shop - I saw him put part of this leather into a bag, which he laid on the counter; he then went on buying some other leather, which he paid for - he was going away; I said he had more leather, which he had not paid for - I put my hand on the bag, and these four pieces of leather were in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went with a friend to buy two pairs of soles; he selected a pair, and paid for them - I said, "If you will pay for the three pairs, I will settle with you when the boots I have to sole for you are done." Witness. There was one pair paid for.</p>

            . I am a shopman. The prisoner came in with another person, and said I was to look out a pair of 1s. 2d. soles for this man; I showed him some at 1s. 2d., and 1s. 3d. - he said, "I don't think these are quite good enough," and while I turned to get a pair at 1s. 4d., he put these two pairs in his bag -

               <p>Q. When you saw it did you know it to be your master's property. - A. Yes, a paper was pinned to it with our private mark; the print was fastened to a rail at the door with a pin, I had seen it there ten minutes before it was taken, a constable was passing by at the time, the prisoner and the print was delivered to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 1, Ann Street, Bethnal Green—I keep a school—on the night of 8th August I went to bed at 11.30,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187309220047"></xptr>
               <p>my daughter awoke me at 1.30, and I heard a noise on the roof—about 2 o'clock the house door suddenly gave way; it is a large door—it was taken right off the hinges—I looked out at the window and called "Police!"—a policeman was passing, and I saw the prisoner soon after at the station—I did not see who burst the door open—my house adjoins the school—the door that was forced was bolted, but the school-room window was cut out—it was all safe when I went to bed—being in the school-room, a person could get into the house by the inside door, which was cut out.</p>

About 2 o'clock on the morning of 9th August I heard a cry of "Police!" from the window—I ran into Union Street, at the back of the school, and saw the prisoner coming over a wall 10 feet high—I was about twelve yards from him—he ran as fast as he could—I followed, crying "Stop thief!" and springing my rattle—he turned into Wilmot Square, and I saw him stopped by <hi rend="italic">K</hi> 140—I ran up and said "I want you for coming over from the rear of the schools"—the constable told me he had thrown something away into the square—the prisoner was taken to the station—an entrance had been gained to the premises by cut<lb></lb>ting a window out, about 16 by 15 inches, which led to the school, and then a large door had been completely forced off the hinges—Holder gave me this chisel, which exactly corresponds with marks on the door—I found on the prisoner a small wedge and a key.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 140). I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" about 2 o'clock a. m., and a rattle, and the sound of running—I saw the prisoner running through Wilmot Square—as he passed the corner where there is a lamp, I saw him throw something into the square with his right hand—he threw something else away when I was close to him—I stopped him, and a constable ran up and said "Hold him, he has been in those schools"—I took a knife out of the prisoner's hand—it was shut—when daylight came I went with Holder to Wilmot Square—he got over the rail<lb></lb>ings, and I saw him pick up this large chisel and this small one—the prisoner was the only person about at that time, except the constables.</p>

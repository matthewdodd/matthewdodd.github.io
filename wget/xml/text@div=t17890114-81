               <p>Were the feather-bed, bolster, sheets, and flat iron let with the lodging? - They were part of the furniture.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140113"></xptr>What have you to say against her? - She was not there above four days before she was gone with my things without notice; when she had been gone about a week, I enquired after her. I never had the key. I got the door open by another key, in a weeks time; and I missed the bed and the bolster; the bolster was not a feather bolster, but the bed was a feather bed. I missed a flat iron and a sheet; the things I missed, were a part of the things I let to her. I never got them again. I found her about twelve days after she went away. She was going into a tallow-chandler's, for a candle, and I laid hold of her. I think it was about a week or ten days after I opened the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether I had not a room of you for almost three months, and paid you honestly and truly; and when I went away I met you, being very much in liquor?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Lack-a-day, how can you say so!</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took a pair of sheets off the bed, the coverlid, the candlestick, and all the things, and put them to a neighbour's, next door; she had her key the next morning, and was very well contented, till she said I had robbed her of a brass candlestick, and she would trouble me; I heard of it, and came; I came with my husband to her, and told her where I was; at last she pulled the candlestick out of her pocket. That is the first room I had of her; now, Sir, I never took any room of her; it was a little bit of a place she gave me leave to lay in at night. I asked her what she charged. I treated her with a quartern of liquor. I gave the key to the granddaughter. The next evening, I went to her own daughter for a halfpenny candle. It is all spite, because we owe her a trifle of money.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Is the prisoner a married woman? - I do not know any such thing.</p>
               <p>Did she and a man, by whose name she went, lodge together in any room? - Yes, she lived with a man; but she never called him her husband.</p>
               <p>How long ago was that? - About two months. She owed me twelve shillings. She told me she belonged to the Hall; I went down and enquired, and found she did; that she had so much a quarter from it; so I let her into the other room, hoping she would pay me.</p>

               <p>I am a granddaughter to the prosecutrix. I was thirteen, the 12th of September. I know the prisoner; she lodged at my grandmother's house twice; the first time, I believe, it was six weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Was there any man lived with her then? - I do not know; but she said there was a shoemaker lived with her then; but that was not her husband. She came again to lodge in about six weeks or a month; she had a room of my grandmother; a ready furnished room. She staid about two days. She came the 15th of October for the key; and on the 16th, she came for a flat iron; about noon; and about seven, she came for a sheet; and said, she must have it; I said I had not got it; she said, she had met my grandmother, and she said, it hung by the fire; I said, it did not: she took the candle off the table, and stole this apron from off the line, which was in our kitchen, just close by the chimney; that was the room where I was. I took the apron from underneath her. She sat herself down in a chair, and said she would not stir till my grandmother came home. I looked, and saw the apron hanging either from under her gown or her petticoat; I said you have something of my grandmother's; and I pulled the apron from underneath her; and another witness came down and saw it: she called me a good-for-nothing, dirty slut; and said, if she had got it, she had got it; I pulled it from underneath her covering; there was my grandmother's name on it; in pulling that apron down, this apron that I have on, fell down with it; and a cinder fell down on it, and burnt it. I saw her no more till she was taken up. A woman came down, and heard a great noise,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140114"></xptr>and saw me pulling it from underneath her; and she called her a good-for-nothing woman, and shoved her out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I come at ten at night, and ask for the key? - I was in bed. It was a girl in the house heard her; I did not hear her.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether any body that was in the house did hear her? - Yes; there was a girl, not near so big as me, said she did hear her; and she answered her, and said we were gone to bed.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did your grandmother miss the things? - I believe she went up on the Sunday, and called up to Mrs. Banks.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you sure that the apron did not lay on the chair, and that therefore she was sitting upon it? - No. This apron and another were hanging upon the line. I had been ironing.</p>
               <p>Might it not drop off the line? - No, it did not; for in taking this off, it pulled this down, and was burnt; I called in a witness, and shewed it her.</p>

               <p>I live in the house. I saw the things in the prisoner's possession. She came to lodge in the house, in a one pair of stairs back room. There were two beds in that room. She came the 15th of October; and I never saw her after the 16th. I heard, on the 17th, in the morning, on the stairs, about a quarter past six; I never saw her after.</p>
               <p>Did you know she was gone to any other lodging? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether she had paid, and taken her leave? - It was but two days. She did not pay, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, do you remember opening the room? - Yes; that was the Tuesday following. My landlady came on the Sunday, she does not live in the house; and said she believed the woman laid there. I said I had not seen her since the 16th of the month; she told me concerning the apron; and the Thursday after, which, I believe, was the 25th. She came to me, and said she was afraid she had lost something; her arm was lame. She asked me to open the door with a key, which she had on a bunch; the door was locked; and when we opened the door, one bed was there, but not the other; one was gone. I do not know that the things were ever found again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She mentioned nothing of the apron before the Justice; the apron hung on the chair. I never touched it; but sitting down on the chair, the skirt of my gown rubbed it down.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I never had the key from that time to this. I missed my apron that night. There was a little girl, ten years old, who said she heard the prisoner call. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court to prisoner. Where did you go to from this woman's? - To one Mr. Berry's. They are not here now. I was ill of the fever last sessions. I had witnesses then.</p>

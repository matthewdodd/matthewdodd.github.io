I watched the prisoner—I saw him leave Mr. Hardy's premises, at Cowley, with a basket on his shoulder, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon—I said, "You have some wood here, Tidd"—he said, I said I would take him into custody—he said he hoped not; it was the first he ever took, and if I would let him go, he would never take any more—he said he had a job to do—I took him to Mr. Hardy's—he was not at home—I then took him to the station—he there repeated that he was very sorry—the basket contained three pieces of mahogany, and six pieces of deal—I went to the prisoner's house—I found some more boards, a sash-line, some glue, and other things.</p>

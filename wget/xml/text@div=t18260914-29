The prisoner came into my employ before Christmas, and went away on the 17th of August, at night, informing me he had got other work, and should not return to me. After he was gone I went into the tripe-house, where there was tripe, udder, and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140020"></xptr>bullock's gall; I cut the letter A in the udders. I directed Gould and Harrison to watch. Next morning Belsham brought me a sack, which I knew to be mine - it contained four bullocks' udders, two tripes, a bullock's feck, and fifteen penny bundles of tripe; the udders were part of what I marked the night before. I went into the tripe-house, and missed them - there is a door goes from my dwelling-house into the slaughter-house, and then into the tripe-house: they all join together, and are under one roof; there is a back door to the tripe-house and stable, opening into a court in Banner-street; the tripe-house has been added to the building since I have lived there. I and my family all slept at home on this night; the house was fastened up, and in the morning I found somebody had broken into the stable, from the court, by moving one of the wooden staves - it has been cut so as to be moved in and out, to admit a person through the window; I had not examined it for two or three days, and cannot say when it was done.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received directions from Mr. Allen, and at four o'clock in the morning placed myself so as to have a view of his house, and the court leading to his back premises - at five o'clock I saw the prisoner coming up Banner-street, with a sack or something under his arm; he looked through the prosecutor's door and shutters, and then went down towards the back door - he looked about, and then went up the court; Harrison came up - we waited about twenty minutes, and saw him come down the court, with a bag on his back; he turned round, saw us, threw the bag down, and away he ran; Belsham came up, and we gave him the bag; we followed him to South-street, Finsbury, and there secured him. I said to him, "You are the confidential servant, are not you?" he said it was the first time - we took him to the watch-house. I was present when the udder was marked the night before.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I joined Gould at five o'clock, and in about twenty minutes saw the prisoner come down the court, with a sack on his back, which he dropped on seeing us, and ran away; we followed him nearly a mile, when a waggoner stopped him- he said it was his first time. As I took him to the watch-house I said to him, "How came you to rob your master?" I did not threaten or make him any promise - he said it was through distress; I said he had plenty of work - he said he only had three days work in a week, and had a wife and three children to support.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On this morning I saw the prisoner go down the alley into Banner-street, with the bag on his back - he looked, and saw he was pursued, and cropped it - he ran off; I minded the bag while they pursued; I carried it round to Allen's front door, and gave it to Gould when he returned; I never opened it. Allen afterwards gave it to me to take to the office - I have it here.</p>

On Tuesday morning last, at half past 2 o'clock, I met the prisoner in Dock-street, Whitechapel—I asked him what he had under his blouse—he said, "My coat"—I asked him where he got it—he made some answer, which I did not understand—I lifted up his blouse, and took from under it these two Mackintoshes—I took him to the station—these have since been owned by Mr. Hall.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Whitechapel-road. This coat is my father's—this other is mine—I know it by its being chafed under the left arm, it lets the water in—I had had it about three weeks—my father's coat was hanging in the counting house, and mine was on the kitchen stairs, on the ground floor—I saw them safe at ten minutes to 10 o'clock on the Monday night—the shop was then all shut up and fast—I went to bed a little after 11—I saw the window of the counting house, which looks into the yard, was shut—I cannot say whether the sash fastening was on—I was awoke about half past 2 by three policemen, who were in the house—I came down, and found the shop door wide open—the lower part of the counting house window was up about twenty inches, large enough for a man to get through—if a man got through there he would be where one of these coats was, and the other was on the same floor—there is no way from the street to the back yard, into which the window of the counting house opens—on one side of the yard is a wall at least eleven feet high—on the other side of the wall is a large garden—on the other side of the yard is a wooden fence between the yard and the people who live next door—the house was not broken into by the street door; it was broken out of—there was just one mark perceptible on the wooden sill of the window—this pair of gloves and knife, which were found in the coat pocket, are mine.</p>

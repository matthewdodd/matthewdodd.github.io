             sworn. - On Saturday, the 28th of April, I went by the direction of the officers of Worship-street, to the prisoner's house, in <placeName id="t17980523-38-crimeloc201">Three-tun-court, Smithfield</placeName>

               <p>Q. Do you know if any mark was made upon it? - A. I did not see it made, but Armstrong shewed me the mark upon it, before I went to Mrs. Carlton's; the officer searched me before I went; when I went in Mrs. Carlton was in bed; she asked me how much I wanted, I told her half-a-crown's worth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or she say of what? - A. No. She gave me seven pieces, bad shillings, and I gave her the half-crown that Mr. Armstrong gave me; there was another woman in the room, and Mrs. Carlton gave her the half-crown to get her an ounce of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230030"></xptr>tea, and I staid in the house till she came back with the tea; when I came away, I carried the bad money to Mr. Clarke, the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. From what place did she give you this bad money? - A. From a comb-box under the bolster.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that woman any more that day? - A. Yes, at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Were you an acquaintance of the prisoner? - A. No, I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. You know this Court? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been here before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in the same trade as you were before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were here a Sessions or two ago, were you not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the Jury would not believe you, and the prisoner was acquitted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did it merely to assist the public, in detecting a bad offender? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is as true as all the rest you have swore? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade do you follow besides that of an informer? - A. I go out a chairing.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not earn any great deal? - A. One shilling a day.</p>
               <p>Q. And so you have given up for the good of the public, six days work-merely for the good of the public? - A. I have sworn the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. The officers searched you, they did not put their hands in your bosom, or any other place that would not have been decent, where you might have had shillings? - A. They could feel whether I had any without putting their hands inside my bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know she was very ill at the time? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What other woman was in the room at the time? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was sick in bed? - A. She was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave the other woman half-a-crown to get some gin to enliven your spirits? - A. No such thing, I gave it to Mrs. Carlton, and she sent out for some tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you give it her, and desire her to send for some gin? - A. She brought in some gin with the tea.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk of seven pieces, you have been in the copper trade, I suppose you know five shilling's worth of halfpence wrapped up are called pieces? - A. No, I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. And though you were a stranger to her, she carried on this traffic, and you were also treated with gin into the bargain, besides having seven shillings for half-a-crown? - A. No, she did not treat me with gin.</p>
               <p>Q. You sat down on the beside by the prisoner? - A. Yes, while she gave me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the officers take the other woman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They would not have this woman, though they could, to corroborate your honest story? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you will swear that you did not take in these seven bad shillings with you, and that this is not a trick to get something for your lost time? - A. I did not.</p>

             sworn. - On Saturday, the 28th of April, I gave Mrs. Mulberry a half-crown piece to purchase some bad money, which half-crown I marked with a pin in the form of an A on the woman side. I pulled Mrs. Mulberry's shoes off, and searched her stockings, her pockets, and her bosom, and she had no money about her; I went to the room, in company with the other officers, where I found Mrs. Carlton and another woman, Mrs. Carlton then was near the side of the bed; on the bolster of that bed stood this little comb-case, which, when I took it, I found eleven counterfeit shillings in it, which are here, (produces them). Mrs. Carlton being taken into custody, I went, with the woman that was in the room with Mrs. Carlton, to Mr. Ward's, and there I saw a half-crown that he had from that woman; I desired him to keep it, I took his address. The prisoner was taken before the Alderman, and committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You searched her thoroughly? - A. As far as decency would permit, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that women very commonly carry their money in little bags inside their bosoms? - A. No; I have searched many, and never found such a thing.</p>

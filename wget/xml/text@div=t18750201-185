                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 475). On Saturday evening, 26th December, about 7.30 I was on duty in Brockley Road, near Rokeby Road—I saw three men loitering outside 6, St. David's Terrace—the prisoner was one of them—I have no doubt whatever about that—I saw one of them come from the garden of 6, St. David's Terrace, Brockley Road—I went and knocked at the door and asked the people if anybody had knocked there—I then spoke to two females who passed, and in consequence of what they said I followed the men—when passing 40, Rokeby Road I heard a noise like the breaking of glass—I went to No. 40 and turned my bull's-eye on and saw the prisoner coming from under the doorway—the two others were standing outside—I spoke to them and said "What are you doing here?"—the tallest man said "We are not drunk, you are mistaken"—the prisoner was coming from under the doorway at the time—there was a recess—he came from the recess and came out of the gate, and was in the act of shaking hands with the men—he said "Good bye, old fellows, I will see you one day next week"—I said "Before you go I want to know what you were doing in the door<lb></lb>way"—the prisoner attempted to go away—I seized hold of him by the left arm—I tried to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> hold of the tall man but I lost him—the prisoner attempted to close with me and I threw him down—the landlord of No. 39 came out and we took the prisoner to the station—when I went to the house I found the glass panel of the door broken, and there were marks of an in<lb></lb>strument having been used near the lock, and the stop of the door was nearly broken away from the frame—they looked like the marks of a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—I found 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., an eye-glass, and a pen-knife on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was about 100 yards from 40, Rokeby Road when I saw the three men first—the gate opens on to the road, there is about 5 or 6 yards of garden in front of the door, and there is a recess to the door—I was looking after the men when I heard the glass breaking—I lost sight of them for a few minutes in the bend of Rokeby Road, and I heard the noise as I was turning the corner—I lost sight of the whole three for about half a minute as they turned the corner, and when I saw them again two of</p>

               <p>them were outside the gate of No. 40 and the prisoner was coming from under the doorway—there was a shutter up inside the window—no one was with me—I could not swear that it was the breaking of glass that I heard, it sounded like it—the prisoner did not say he lived in the house, but he wanted to make out that he did, they all appeared to come out of the house—I saw Mr. Taylor—he was not in the house then—it was empty—the door was shut and locked inside—the other men soon <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi>—I had spoken to two women in Brockley Lane, some distance off—I don't know who they were—I asked them if they heard any remarks by the men they passed, and they said the man that came out of the garden of No. 6 said there was a light in the window—there were no other people about—the landlord of No. 39 is not here—he was at the Police Court, but he was not requited—his son went down to the station with me—I met the two women about 100 yards from No. 40—I will swear there were not two other men there besides the three, I wish there had been; I dare say I should have got assistance then—it was about 7.30 or 7.35 in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 40, Rokeby Road, Deptford—I am a clerk—on Christmas morning I left the house securely fastened, locked in the usual manner—I returned about 11.30 or 12 o'clock the same night to see if everything was right—I went out again locking the place up as before—I went to the house again about 10.30 the following night—I found the glass panel of the front door broken—my attention was afterwards called to the door, and I found chisel marks—the jamb of the door had been forced, and the lock inside was loosened—the beading was started.</p>

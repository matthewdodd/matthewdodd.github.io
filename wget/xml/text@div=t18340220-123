            . I keep the public-house - when the prosecutor and prisoner left the house, the prosecutor was very drunk, and very sick - I sent my boy to see if he got safe home - when he was in front of the bar, leaving the house, he had his watch safe - he came back and complained of his loss in about eight minutes - I went out with him, and saw the prisoner going up Upper Whitecross-street - the prosecutor called to him, but I do not think the prisoner heard him - the prisoner went up a yard - we went to the end of the gateway, and the prisoner had then got about two steps out of the gateway - the policeman took him in charge - I went up the gateway, looked about, got a light, and found the watch behind a stone, with the chain and seals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What stone was it? A. It is put to stop vehicles from going against the wall - the stone is fixed - the watch was not broken that I recollect - I do not recollect that the glass was broken - I did not see Brett then - they had both gone out of my house together.</p>
               <p>RICHARD ALLBURY re-examined. I cannot say whether Brett went with him - he was not with him when I saw the prisoner hugging the prosecutor - I was about twenty yards from them then - I went up to them - Brett was not there.</p>

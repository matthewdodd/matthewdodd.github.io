That he heard the Words, where are you going, the Deceased would not tell presently but then said, going Home; it was Moon-Light and about two in the Morning. A Gentleman deposed that as he was going to Bed he heard a great Blow, then two more before he could get to the Window, then he heard more Blows, that he lookt out at the Window and saw the Deceased lye cross the Kennel, and the Prisoner about eight Foot from him, who said, you, would you stab me! get up you Dog or I'll knock your Braius out. That another came up, and they carryed him off; that the Deceased's Sword was upon the Ground drawn, and the Prisoner took it up and broke it. A Watchman deposed that as he was going down Dover Street about two a Clock, he heard a Voice cry Down you Dog, will you stick me? It was like the Prisoner's Voice who stood some way off, and had the Deceased's Sword in his Hand out of the Scabbard and broke; that he help'd to carry the Deceased to the Round-house; who was very loth to go in, and one of his Legs hung out, and the Prisoner threatened that if he would not draw it in he would break it. and abused him as he came along.

Mr. Westbreek the Surgeon deposed that he went to the Deceased at St. Jame's, and found that he had a large and a small Wound on the Right side of his Head; but perceiving them to be very dangerous he would not depend upon his own Judgement, but got Mr. Green and another to consult what was proper to be done, he was of Opinion to proceed to the Trepan; but't was concluded to try one Medicine first, and then made use of it; he was in Hopes of some Success, and found him sensible tho' Speechless; but he grew worse, and had no Rest; that when Mr. Green's Affairs call'd him out of Town, we had the Advice of Mr. Gheekir now Master of the Company, but could not preserve his Life.

Others confirm'd the Deceased's being Speechless, the forcing him into the Round-house and his Leg lying out.

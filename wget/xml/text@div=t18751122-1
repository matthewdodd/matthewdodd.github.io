                  </hi>. I am deputy surveyor to the metropolitan police force—I know the premises 215, Whitechapel Road, they are on the right hand side going from London—this model (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a correct model of the premises made to the scale of a quarter of an inch to one foot—it also embraces Mr. Pinnell's and Mr. Wiseman's premises—it extends back to the back of Mr. Pinnell's premises, and goes beyond at the back into Vine Court which is shown here, and so are the outbuildings—I have also got a ground plan of the premises made to scale, showing the exit from Vine Court in this direction—it is in fact a chart of the immediate locality—I have taken it from the Ordnance Map; it shows the premises 215, and 84, on the other side of the road, and Sidney Square and the neighbourhood—I also produce a model of the Hen and Chickens which I made myself—this is a model of the cellar of the Hen and Chickens—the only entrance to the cellar is down these stairs, and when you get into the cellar there is no window or any light, or any access whatever except down the steps—at the bottom of these stairs there is an inner cellar of brick work, and a hole in the brick work of about 2 feet 6 to 3 feet, which I believe has always been there from its appearance—it is long enough for a person to creep through—I got through it—in the inside there was a large quantity of loose earth, and there are props propping up the inside of the shop as shown here—this shows the way down stairs at the Hen and Chickens which leads from the shop to the first floor—this is the entrance to the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 34, Baker's Row, Whitechapel, and am a brush maker—in September this year I was in Mr. Martin's service as manager, at 78, New Road, Whitechapel—the prisoner Henry Wainwright was also in his service as a manager—I was in the service five or six weeks, and Henry Wainwright about eleven weeks before the particular Saturday—I have known Henry Wainwright between seventeen and eighteen years—he carried on a brushmakers business formerly at 84, Whitechapel Road—that was the shop at which the articles were sold—I worked for him away from the premises, and used to take my work home to the shop—I have worked for him on and off for between seventeen and eighteen years—I know the premises 215, Whitechapel Road as a packing place—a man named West used to live there first—I am speaking about the time when Wainwright had the premises—West was his chief clerk and lived there—West left somewhere in July, 1874, after which the premises were unoccupied so far as to persons living there, but they were used for packing premises down stairs—they remained unoccupied as a residence till Rogers went there in November, 1874—they were shut up at night, and I believe the keys were always put in the counting house at No. 84, until the fire—Henry Wainwright went out of business about a month before he went into Mr. Martin's service, he then told me that he lived at School House Lane, Chingford, but I never went to his place—on the Thursday or Friday before Saturday, 11th September, 1875, I told him that I had bought a chain for the scales (we were then in Mr. Martin's shop)—he said "Oh yes, it is very useful," and then he said "I have a chopper and a shovel to sell likewise, which will be very useful," I said "So they will, sir, as we require them for the place"—nothing more was said at that time—we were at work on the Saturday afternoon about 6.30 in Mr. Martin's presence, and he said "Will you carry a parcel for me, Stokes?"—I said "Yes sir, with the greatest of pleasure" we then left together and went to 215, Whitechapel Road—we went in at the back through Vine Court—he took a key out of his pocket and opened the door—we both went in and he asked me to go upstairs and fetch down a parcel—I went upstairs underneath this part, and through by the sky light into the dwelling rooms—that was 80 or 90 feet from the spot where we came in—I looked for the parcel but could not find it—I went down found him at the furthest end of the place, and told him I could not find any parcel—he said "Never mind, Stokes, I will find them where I placed them a fortnight ago, under the straw"—there was some straw there, not in the corner but just on the stone work—as you enter from Vine Court there are some flag stones—I saw the straw up in a corner and saw two parcels tied round with rope and some black American cloth—he said "These are the parcels I want you to carry, Stokes"—I lifted them up and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220005"></xptr>
               <p>I says "They are too heavy for me, sir," and I put them down again—he said "Wait a bit Stokes, here is the shovel and the chopper that I want you to sell for me"—they were lying on the floor and a" hammer also—(he had told me that he wanted me to sell them to Mr. Martin, my employer)—I said "All right, sir," and I picked up the axe—that is what I call the choppes—I said "What is this, sir, it stinks?"and I saw some mess on it—he said "It is only cat's or dog's dirt," and took his hand wiped it off, and then wiped it on a piece of newspaper and laid it on the floor—then he said "Come along Stokes," and I went to go to the door, and picked up both the parcels and said "They stink so bad and the weight of them is too heavy, for me"—he said "I will take one off of you at the bottom of Vine Court"—as I walked to the door he said "Wait a bit, Stokes, let me see if old (or Mr.) Johnson is a watching us"—I know Johnson, he is a decorator in the Mile End Road—his premises do not overlook the place—he was not there then, but he generally was there on the look out when anything was being removed—I have often seen him there—he then said "All right, Stokes, no one is look<lb></lb>ing, come on"—I had the two parcels in my hand and carried them out of Vine Court into Whitechapel, where he took the lightest one off of me—we walked to Whitechapel Church, which was about a quarter of a mile—while we were going along I said "I shall have to rest, sir, it is too heavy for me, I cannot carry it"—he said "Oh for God's sake don't drop them or else you will break them"—when we got to Whitechapel Church he said "Mind those parcels Stokes, while I go and fetch a cab"—I said "All right, sir"—he went for a cab and put his parcel down by the side of mine opposite Blyth's the wire workers—while he was away I looked at the largest parcel, the one I carried myself; I felt as if I must do it—I opened it, and the first thing I saw was a human head, and then proceeding further I saw a hand which had been cut off at the wrist, and then I had the presence of mind to <hi rend="italic">kiver</hi> it up again quick and wait till Mr. Wainwright returned with a four-wheeled cab—I had been left with the parcels about five minutes before he came back—he then asked me to help him to the cab with the parcels, which I did with a little hesitation—I put one parcel in and Mr. Wainwright put the other in at the bottom of the cab, and said he would see me in the evening at my place—I said "All right, sir," and then he got in the cab—it drove off up Church Lane towards the East India Docks—he was not smoking when he got into the cab, he was when he got out—I heard him <hi rend="italic">give</hi> the order to drive to the Commercial Road—he said "Round to the left"—the cabman drove down Church Lane which leads to the Commercial Road—the cab turned to the left—we were at the top of Church Lane at the time—I saw them to the corner—Church Lane leads to the Commercial Road—turning to the left leads away from the City—the cab went on as far as the chemists shop in the Commercial Road on the left—I ran after it and it stopped outside the chemists shop—I know the neighbourhood; it is by the Plumbers Arms close by Greenfield Street, and about 70 yards from the end of Church Lane—when the cab stopped Henry Wainwright got out and walked towards the West India Dock, away from the City—I saw a young woman called Alice Day meet him, and he accompanied her back to the cab, after talking with her for about a minute—she was standing at the corner of the street as if waiting for him, and then they both got into the cab—I was hiding in a doorway opposite—he said to the cabman "Drive on as fast as you can over London Bridge to the Borough"—he turned his head round directly to the City way, and I ran</p>

               <p>after the cab until I saw two constables by Leadenhall Street—I called their attention to the cab as I was then exhausted, but they laughed at me and said "Man, you must be mad"—I called to them to stop the cab—I did not tell them why—I could not speak at the time—the cab was then 30 yards ahead of me, I ran after it again; it went by Leadenhall Street and Fenchurch Street over London Bridge and stopped outside the hop factory on the right hand side of the Borough, which is part of the premises of the London Joint Stock Bank—you can see the Hen and Chickens pretty well from there, by standing a little on one side—I saw Wainwright put not his hand which caused the cab to stop at the entrance—he got out and took out the lightest parcel and went towards the Hen and Chickens—I told two con<lb></lb>stables Turner and Cox, No. 48 and 290; I said "For God's sake run after the man with the high hat with the parcels in his hand, there is something wrong," and Turner done it instantly—I then told Cox and he went to the cab—I told Turner not to touch him, but to follow him and see where he was going with it—Cox spoke to Alice Day but I could not hear the words—I saw Turner follow Wainwright to the Hen and Chickens on the other side—shortly afterwards Wainwright returned and went to the cab te get the other parcel, but I did not see what he did as I ran back to my employer, Mr. Martin, knowing that they were in good hands—when he spoke about the shovel and chopper he said "Ask him to buy them in the presence of me, and I will say that they are very useful"—I said "How much shall I ask for them"—(I have stated this before)—he said "Will you call for them on Monday morning, Stokes?"—I said "All right, sir, how much shall 1 ask for them I"—he said "I will leave that to you"—I was to say that they were my own and sell them in my own name—this was said both at Mr. Martin's and at the other premises—I have known Alice Day between three and four years—she was employed at the Pavilion Theatre, the front entrance of which is next door to 84. Whitechapel Road—she was ballet girl there—I have seen her with Henry Wainwright many and many a time in public-houses, and walking out together in the street—I had seen him with her in the Commercial Road I believe a fortnight or three weeks before—I remember Thomas Wainwright coming in and out of the shop in Whitechapel Road when he was only a young man—I knew him as the brother of Henry—he used to keep the Hen and Chickens in the Borough—I have been outside the door very many times waiting for Mr. Wainwright—I do not know where Thomas lived in September 1874, or in September last—I had noticed a smell for a few months before the 11th September—I should say it was in June or July this year—it was supposed to come from the rubbish in this corner close to the paint room, which is under the warehouse—the rubbish was dirt and cabbage leaves which had been lying there for months and months—I spoke to the clerk and to Titiens, the porter, about the umbrella—I-was not in Wainwright's service; I was employed by him—I made up the work and took it home—I then noticed the smell, but I did not notice any particular time, because I always put it down to the rubbish—the rubbish was not removed till after this was found out.</p>

               <p>premises three tires a day—if I took them to 84, I used to take them to 215 to have them peaked—I did not go to 215 to receive the materials—I received them from 84 until the time of the fire, and then from 215—the fire was on the 27th November, 1874—sometimes I have been at 215 two or three hours waiting for a job, and at 84 at all hours of the day while business was going on—I am familiar with the warehouse premises 215—when the place is open there is a glass front, an ordinary shop front; both the shop fronts were more like gates—they both used to be opened as a kind of warehouse; you could see from the street back to the end of the warehouse if the warehouse doors were open—on entering the shop you could see direct to the back of the warehouse; it is not fitted up as a shop, but was all shelves—there are gates half way down which admit light—it is full 80 feet from the Whitechapel Road to the back of the house, and it may be more—in the day time owing to the circular sky lights at the back of the warehouse you could see all over it, except at the side where the stone flagging is, but you cannot see that because it went in a nook, and you cannot see into the paint room—the stone work which was raised up was by the paint room—there is a recess like a fire place there—you cannot see where the stones were raised, from the street—from the glass skylight it would be exceptionally light at that part; there are three sky lights, and they have gaseliers, the first is a two branch burner, and the next the same, and one had an eight branch burner, but only six of them admitted lights, so that you may call it a six light burner—there is also one gas light in front of the shop as you go in—there is most light at the furthest end of the warehouse—I have not the least doubt that I was at No. 215 in September, 1874—the "gas lights were lighted every evening when the place was open, but sometimes it used to be closed at dusk—the ordinary time of closing was 8 o'clock—after the fire the business was carried on at No. 215—I should think I went to 215 twice a day in September, 1874—Titiens was porter there and Vostius was clerk, they were pretty well always there—Mr. Rogers used often to go out, because he was traveler—I did not go to the back part of the warehouse as much after September, 1874, as before; I never went to the back part till we took the fixtures out—I was Mr. Martin's manager some months, and then I went to be my own master—I served Mr. Wainwright's brother—I should say that 1 ceased to work for Henry Wainwright about the latter end of June, 1875, as nigh as possible—I left Mr. Martin about eight weeks before the particular Saturday—Henry Wainwright was manager at Mr. Martin's at the same time I was, he looked over one side of the way and I the other—Mr. Martin had three establishments, with his own trade as well—I found Henry Wainwright working for Mr. Martin when I went there five weeks before the 11th September—I have mentioned before to day that I noticed the smell at 215, I thought it arose from the cabbage heap and I don't know any otherwise—the fixtures at 215 were sold to Mr. Martin, and I was present when they were taken away—I can't exactly fix the date of that—I believe it was the latter end of July or the beginning of August—I believe it was in August—it was after I had ceased to do work for Wain-wright, and whilst I was foreman to Mr. Martin; I did not take any notice of the smell then, because I had very often smelt a disagreeable smell before, and 1 knew the rubbish was there and thought it was from that—I was examined before the magistrate on 13th September and 13th October—I don't know that I mentioned Johnson's name on 13th September—I</p>

               <p>don't think I mentioned about Henry Wainwright speaking to me about the chopper and spade—I believe I did mention about his saying "All right, no one is looking, come on"—I believe I said it at the Treasury—I know I did say it, whether at the inquest or at the court I cannot say—what he said was "Wait a bit, Stokes, let us see if Mr. Johnson or old Johnson is looking, for he always is if we are doing anything"—perhaps I did not say that before—he said "I wonder he is not watching us as he always is, and he told me to wait to see if he was watching"—I have stated before to day that when I first took up the parcels they stunk so bad, and the weights was too heavy for me—they did smell very bad—I thought it was hair till I got up to Whitechapel Road, because we had been talking about hair on the way to 215—I said either at the inquest or before the magistrate that whilst I was carrying the parcels I said to Henry Wainwright "I shall have to have a rest, it is too heavy, I can't carry it"—I can't say on which exami<lb></lb>nation it was, but I know I said it—I have not been to the Treasury since 1 was bound over before the Magistrate, nor has any one been to me—I have not had any writing put into my hand—I have never seen this model till to day, till it was in Court—I noticed when I went upstairs that the place was quite empty, except an old umbrella—I said I could not say—whose umbrella it was, I was never asked particularly whose it was—I was asked whether it was the umbrella of the lady I had seen talking to Mr. Wain-wright, and I said, I could not tell.</p>

I think the father has been dead twelve or thirteen years—after that William and Henry carried on the business as partners—after they ceased to be partners Henry and Mr. Sawyer carried it on—Mr. Sawyer came in about November, 1873, and they dissolved partnership in July, 1874—after that Henry had the place to himself, and carried on the business at both places until the fire—there are gates or folding doors at the front of 215 with a sort of fan-light over the top—when you get in at the front there are no doors to go through; it is all open space right to the end—at the end of the warehouse where the sky lights are, there was formerly a paint shop partitioned off from the rest of the room—the flooring of the paint shop was a little raised from the rest of the floor, one step; it was not used to keep paints in, but for storing painting brushes in; it is called a paint room in the trade—there was a door in the partition leading from the body of the warehouse into the paint room—on the right as you go in there is a door leading into Vine Court—a little way in front of that doorway the place was flagged—the partition was there when I worked for Henry Wainwright, but it was pulled down—I believe in June or July last, when Mr. Rogers was there—when the fixtures were sold to Mr. Martin the remainder of the fixtures were left, and the gas fittings—there were two lots of fixtures taken away; the last lot were taken away about August, and the first late in June or the beginning of July that Wainwright bad been taken away; the partition was there then, but not at the time the last lot was taken away; it had been removed—I don't believe it was part of the fixtures there—what had been the paint room was open to the</p>

               <p>rest of the room—the flooring of the paint room was boarded, and so was the rest of the warehouse, except the part that was flagged—that was at the furthermost end—the floor of the paint room was raised a little, and then the stone work of the other place was <hi rend="italic">ris</hi> higher still—on entering from Vine Court you would first place your foot upon some flagging which ex<lb></lb>tends a few feet from the entrance—that flagging is a little above the floor of the warehouse, and there is a fire-place in the warehouse, about the center on the right—when I spoke about hair I was referring to hair that we use in our trade, pig's bristles—if they are not cleaned and dressed they smell rather peculiar, but not quite so bad as that did—we do not use size; we use pitch or glue—I thought the parcels contained hair.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Court Q.</hi> Was anything said to you by Henry Wainwright with reference to those parcels that led you to think they contained hair? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; as we were going on the road to 215 he said to me, "We want some hair for so and so." I said, "Yes, we do sir." He said, "Well we must get it on Monday, or else the men won't be able to finish the work. "That had no reference to the hair at 215, but I thought it was hair for all that.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 48). On Saturday evening, 11th September, at 5.4, I was on duty in High Street, Borough, at the corner of St. Thomas Street—whilst there the witness, Stokes, spoke to me; he seemed very much exhausted, he had his hat in his hand and perspired very much in the face; he made a communication to me, in consequence of which I went up to a cab which was just drawing up; the cabman was just commencing to rein up at the corner of Southward Street—I went up to the cab, I saw Henry Wainwright get out of the cab really before it had stopped, he was carrying a parcel in his right hand—I walked a little way down on the other side of the road to see where he went; I saw him go into an empty, house called the Hen and Chickens; he put the parcel down on the footway, took a key from his pocket, unlocked the padlock, and went in—I then went back to the cab, which was then about 45 yards from the Hen and Chickens—Cox 290 came up—there was a female in the cab who I now know to be Alice Day, and there was a parcel on the front seat tied up in American cloth with a large string, it was about 18 inches long and about 9 or ten inches wide—I spoke to the female and had some conversation with her—Cox stood behind the cab—I joined him—I waited till-Henry Wainwright came out, I could see him come out from where I was standing, he put the bolt on the door and came and walked straight on towards the cab—he did not lock the door, he had the padlock in his pocket, he was smoking a very large cigar; I did not observe whether he had been smoking before, his back was towards me at that time—he went to the off side of the cab, the side nearest the street, and opened the door and took out the parcel with his left hand—I said "What have you got there, sir"—he said "Why do you interfere with me, I am only going down to an old friend of mine"—I walked alongside of him under the Town Hall until we got to the Hen and Chickens, the door was shut, but the padlock off—he seemed to want to pass by it—I caught hold of him and we stopped—I said "Do you live here?"—he said "No"—I said "Have you got any business here?"—he said "Yes, and you have not"—I said "Go inside"—he seemed very reluctant to go in—Cox then joined me and we pushed him inside—when we got inside I said "How came you in possession of this place, I thought it belonged to Mr. Lewis?"—he said "So it does now, say nothing and ask no questions and there is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each for you"—I had him inside at this time—Cox then barred the door, there was a bar</p>

               <p>inside, there was no fastening—we walked a few steps down the shop together, he had the parcel in his left hand all the time—I said to him "What did you do with the first parcel that you brought in here"—he said it is only on the first floor—I told Cox to go up and see if he could see it—I had hold of the prisoner then—we walked down the shop together about half a dozen steps when I saw the parcel in a dark corner on the cellar steps—I then called Cox down and said "Get hold of this man and I will see what is in the parcel"—Cox took hold of him and I went and put the parcel on an old counter en the left hand side of the shop; it was then I perceived what a dreadful stench it was—before I proceeded to open the parcel Henry Wainwright said "Don't open it, policeman, pray don't look at it, whatever you do don't touch it"—I then pulled the cloth over and my fingers came across the scalp of a bead, across the ear—I found that it contaned part of the remains of a human body—I then got hold of the prisoner and Cox went to get the <hi rend="italic">ceb</hi>, which at that time was still in the same place—the prisoner said "I will give you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will <hi rend="italic">give</hi> you 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and produce the money in twenty minutes if you will let me go;" he said nothing more—the cab was then brought up to the door, Cox put the first parcel in, the prisoner was still holding the second parcel in his left hand all the time, from the time he took it from the cab till it was taken from him by Cox—<hi rend="italic">Cox</hi> came back for it, and as he went to take it from him the prisoner threw himself round as if to throw the parcel away from him—they were put into the cab and the prisoner also; the woman was still in the cab—we were then all driven to the station—from the place where the cab was first drawn up you could see the Hen and Chickens by standing 2 or 3 feet out in the road, from the back of the cab, not if you stood on the footway—from where the cab stood to the Hen and Chickens was between 40 and 45 yards—on the way to the station the female said to the prisoner "Mr. Wainwright, you have done a fine thing for me," or words to that effect, to which he made no reply—the parcels were put down in the yard at the station, they were found to contain portions of a female body much decomposed; the features were not recognisable, the hair on the head was very much clotted with blood, lime, and dirt—Mr. Larkin, the surgeon saw them and they were taken to St. Saviour's dead-house the same evening after Mr. Larkin had seen them—at the station Henry Wainwright and Alice Day were placed in the dock and were charged with having in their possession a human body decomposed, supposed to be murdered—they both made a statement which was taken down by Inspector Fox in writing—I saw a black leather bag in the cab, it was an ordinary black travelling bag, it was empty; I did not notice whether there was a newspaper in it, as far as I know it was empty.</p>

On Saturday, 11th September, a few minutes after 5 o'clock, I was on duty in High Street, Borough—Stokes drew my attention to a cab—I went to it and saw a woman sitting in it, and a parcel on the front seat wrapped in American cloth; also a black leather bag—Turner said something to the woman—in a short time as I was standing near the cab; I saw Henry Wainwright coming from the direction of the Hen and Chickens, smoking a cigar—he came up to the cab, opened the door nearest the pavement, and took out the parcel that</p>

               <p>was on the front seat—Turner asked him what he had got in the parcel—he took his cigar from his mouth, laughed and said "All right policeman, I am only going to a friend of mine"—he then turned round to me and said "Why do you interfere with me"—I was standing on his left side, and Turner on his right—I said "We have received information that what you have got in that parcel is wrong"—we all three then walked towards the Hen and Chickens—I went within about 10 or 15 yards of the door of the of the Hen and Chickens, and then turned back towards to the cab; I saw another policeman 310, and I left him in charge of the cab and the woman—I then joined Turner and Henry Wainwright, at the door of the Hen and Chickens, they were having some altercation, and I heard the prisoner say "No, perhaps you had better"—we then pushed him inside the shop door, the door was partly open at the time, a little wicket door; when we got inside Turner said to the prisoner "How did you come into possession of this place, it used to belong to Mr. Lewis"—the prisoner said "Come with me to Mr. Lewis, and we will soon settle the matter, say nothing, ask no questions, and there is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each for you"—I said "No, we are going to do our duty, and we don't want your money"—I then said "Wait Turner while I fasten the door," as there was a crowd outside—I picked up an iron bar that was lying on the floor and placed against the door as there was no proper fastening on the inside—Turner then said "Will you tell me where the other parcel is that you brought in here—the prisoner replied "It is only on the first floor"—I went up five or six stairs when Turner said "Come down Cox, here it is in the corner"—I came down and took hold of the prisoner, and Turner went and lifted the parcel on to an old counter oh the lefthand side of the shop—the prisoner then said "Oh, for goodness sake don't touch it"—twice I believe he repeated "Don't touch it"—Turner partly pulled the oil cloth open—we found it contained some of the remains of a dead body—I then sent 324 to bring the cab down to the door; I remained inside—I heard nothing further said Turner, and the prisoners were at the extreme end of the shop—the prisoner and Alice Day were taken to the station with the parcels—I ulti<lb></lb>mately conveyed the parcels to St. Saviour's dead-house.</p>

I said' Yes, I am always willing to make money, or something of that sort. He said 'I can put a sovereign or two in your way.' I then enquired how, and he said 'By taking two parcels over to the borough.' I said it was a big price for so small a job.

               <p>went with Stokes to 215 Whitechapel Road—we went in at the back entrance in Vine Court—Stokes took me there and pointed out the door, and with one of the keys that I had taken from Henry Wainwright I opened the door—as you first enter there is a stone flagged floor, and 1 saw a little further on a small chopper wropped in a piece of newspaper, also a spade, a hammer, and an open pocket knife—it is a common pocket knife—I produce it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the axe or chopper, which is a common little axe—I noticed nothing on the knife; on the chopper there was a deal of matter—it smelt strongly, similar to that of the body—this is the spade (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which is a new one; it was marked with lime and clay, covered with lime and clay and some hairs—I think there is some on it now—at the extreme end of the warehouse the floor was raised a few inches higher than the rest; that was the original construction of the floor—I found some boards loose, I took them up and found that some of the joists had been cut—I was induced to look there by finding the boards loose, and also by a smell which attracted my attention to the spot—I took up three of the flooring boards and found that four of the joists had been cut upon which they rested—the joists rested on the earthen floor, they were not fastened to the boards—I saw then that the earth underneath was mixed with chloride of lime—I did no more on that occasion—I put the boards back again, locked the door, put a policeman in charge and left; it was then light—next morning (Sunday) the 12th, I went to the place again and made a further examination—I had all the loose earth removed, and found that earth had filled a grave 5 feet long and 2 feet wide, and 2 feet deep, and I found the mould in that grave to be very largely mixed with chloride of lime—I picked up one lump amongst a number of others as a specimen—I found some hair amongst the earth, and took a specimen of that, it was human hair of a light colour—I have part of it here—I saw the hair that was on the body, and it seemed to me exactly the same colour—I have some of the hair here which I took from the body (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—that portion has been washed since by the surgeon—I noticed that on the flags as you enter by the back door there was a large amount of rubbish on one side and straw on the other—on the part where the straw was it was raised; it had the appearance as if something had been concealed, or as if some person had slept in it, or as if some person had been covered with it—on the other end of the flag portion was about a cart load of ashes and other rubbish—I had the rubbish cleared away from the stones, and underneath 1 found red irregular blotches which appeared to me to be blood—on the ledges of the stone I found marks as if done with this small axe in chopping—there were cuts or indentations in the stone, and a small part was broken away—it had been recently broken, quite fresh—I found a piece of rope underneath the boards on the grave, on the loose earth—it was an ordinary piece of rope with a loop at the end which was cut—that was all 1 noticed at that time; I gave directions to have the place properly searched—I was there about two hours on Sunday morning—Inspector McDonald and detectives Forster and Newman were with me—I have two rings which I received from the detective Newman, also two jet buttons which I received from Inspector McDonald, and two earrings—I have also two jet buttons that I received at the police station from Mrs. Allen in Mrs. Taylor's and John Lane's presence; I have also a pair of boots which I got from a box in Mr. Lane's house at Waltham—I produce a pad which I got from Mr. Larkin, and also three bullets, one from Mr. Larkin,</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. The first words Turner said in Henry Wain-wright's presence were "I think this man and woman have got parcels, something wrong," the parcels were there; it was then that Henry Wain-right said "I don't know what they contained, a gentleman gave them to me to carry—it was after Mr. Larkin made a communication to me that I asked Wainwright's address, and he gave me his address" 78, New Road, Whitechapel, where you will find Mr. Martin"—I was absent about two hours before I came back to the station—I waited at 78 to search the premises—Stokes was not at the station before I went to 78, I found him there when I got back—I have a list of the things I found on Henry Wainwright (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—amongst them I found a pocket knife, it was an ordinary pocket knife—I have not said before to-day that my attention was directed to the loose boards by the smell—I was examined three or four times at the police-court, beginning on 13th September and ending on 13th October—I gave my principal evidence as to my visit to 215, Whitechapel Road, on 13th September—an ordinary con<lb></lb>stable was placed outside the premises—Newman and Forster were to be in the neighbourhood and to assist in searching—the hair I have produced was found by myself in the grave—I have not shown the stone to any stone mason; I showed the stains' on the stones to the doctors after we had cleaned and swept the rubbish off, they had dried up and were trampled upon and were then scarcely perceptible—I attended all the examinations both at the police-court and the inquest—I showed the earringsto Mrs. Taylor, Miss Wilmore, Mrs. Rogers, and to Mrs. Izzard at the last examination before the Magistrate Mrs. Izzard turned out to be the owner of the earrings—they had been shown to the previous persons for the purpose of identifying them as the earrings of Harriet Lane—I was present when McDonald found the buttons—I believe the burnt ashes in all the grates in the house have been microscopically examined, I gave Mr. Bond specimens of what I found there—McDonald searched the ashes—there was only one rate in the house, that had the appearance of having had a recent fire in it—I have not heard at all that Henry Wain-wright has made a confes<lb></lb>sion to me, I have not seen a statement to that effect in the "Weekly Dispatch" newspaper; I have not had my attention called to it. (Mr. Besley <hi rend="italic">read the paragraph as follows</hi>:" We understand that the prisoner Henry Wainwright has made several statements to the police which amount to a confession that he cut up the body of Harriet Lane but that he accuses his brother Thomas of being the actual murderer. It is owing to this circumstance that there will, probably, be a change in the form of the indictment against him, whereby the relative accusations against the two brothers will in part be changed, both being accused of murder as well as of being accessories before and after the fact.) There is no truth in the assertion that any confession has been made to me.</p>

I am chief inspector of the H division of police—I went to the premises 215, Whitechapel Road, and searched the ashes that were in the grate there, on 16th. and 17th September, I found in the ashes two jet buttons, about two yards from the grave—Newman put the ashes through a sand sieve screen, and what did not pass through the screen I turned off with a stick, and in turning it over I found these two buttons; I gave them to Inspector Fox; I noticed that the fasteners were in them, and they appeared as if they had been in the fire, they were cracked; the upper part is unbroken—I afterwards searched the upstairs room on the first floor, which is called the kitchen, found I there found two earrings underneath the grate on the hearth, among some ashes—I gave these to Inspector Fox, these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the ashes appeared to be ashes of wood burning, and I found a quantity of small wire in them, as if the backs of brushes had been burnt there—there were a large number of brushes about the place—some teeth and pieces of bone were given to me by Newman; I was present when they were found; I gave them to Mr. Bond, they were part of a kneecap, a piece of bone and two teeth.</p>

I did not go with Newman, on the first night; I went on the Sunday morning, I did not commence the sifting until the 16th September—at that time the mould from the grave had been put into a separate and distinct heap, care had been taken to do that—I think the mould was sifted first, and after that the rubbish heap—the rubbish from the different parts of the house was not brought down an sifted also—that was examined casually, afterwards more <hi rend="italic">strictly</hi>—the sample was taken from the grate; in which these earrings were found, and I gave it to Inspector Fox—he joists were cut on a slope, but at an angle, they dropped in and stood firmly—one or two of them were cut straighter than the others, and the others were cut a little on a slant—I can produce them if necessary—they were cut at each end—each joist would require two sawings to get out the piece; I examined the boards that were over this part, they were not very clean, they were the same colour as the rest of the floor—I examined to see if there were any nail marks, and there were, and the nails were in the boards that were taken up from the floor<lb></lb>ing, which rested on the joists.</p>

               <p>and nothing more was said that morning that I can remember—I afterwards received this letter from the Charing Cross Hotel by post in an envelope addressed to 6, The Grove, Stratford—I had not told Wainwright where I lodged, because he knew; Mrs. King had told him that I was going there—he had not asked my address at the previous interviews—I received the letter about three weeks after the disappearance, that is after 11th Septem<lb></lb>ber as near as I can tell—I gave the envelope with the letter to Mrs. Taylor and I do not know what has become it—I took the letter to Mr. Wainwright first at No. 84, the next morning after receiving <hi rend="italic">it late</hi> at night; he was in the shop, I believe, and I said "I have just received this letter, sir"—he said "And so have I"—he took it in his hand and read it, and fetched up one very much like it—he said "I have one very much like it"—he fetched it out of his desk, and I saw it in his hand—I can read writing, but I did not read it; he read it to me—what I saw was very much like this writing—I was near enough to see the writing, about as near as I am to you, but I did not take much notice—he read a portion of it, which stated that he had got the lady under his protection, and it said "I dare you or any one else to interfere, as I intend to marry her"—I don't remember what else it said—I bade him good morning—he gave me this back and kept his own—I am sure I was alone when I showed him the letter first—I took it straight to Mrs. Taylor from No. 84—I cannot say that Wainwright read the letter through, but he appeared to. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "Charing Cross Hotel. Dear Miss Wilmore,—I am very much surprised at not receiving a reply to my last letter, in which I gave you all particulars of our arrangements. She is now quite content and has solemnly promised not to speak to King or any of his friends and family again, as if she did I have told her we should have to part. If her promise is kept I intend to marry her in a few weeks. I distinctly tell her that I will not allow her to see any of her old acquaint<lb></lb>ances, as it will only cause unpleasantness. With kind regards, yours truly, E. Frieke. We are just off to Dover.") I am quite sure I never received any letter before that—I went straight to Mrs. Taylor and read it to her, and we both went to Waltham to see the father and mother, and returned together—I took no more notice until I received a telegram a few days after<lb></lb>wards at 6, The Grove, in one of the ordinary envelopes—I opened it and read it, and the next day Mrs. Taylor came to see me and I read it to her, and we afterwards, but not on that day went to see Henry Wainwright together, taking the telegram with me—I do not know whether it was the next day or the day following—we saw Henry Wainright at 84, Whitechapel Road—I said "I have received a telegram from Mr. Frieake from Dover"—I showed him the telegram and he read it—he did not say anything, but he fetched one like it and read it to Mrs. Taylor and myself—I cannot remember the substance of what he read, but he read it to Mrs. Taylor I know and I left her—I saw the telegram in his hand; it was very much like mine—I know telegram paper—he came out with us and asked us to have a glass of wine each and we had it—that was all that passed that day—before I left my lodgings I had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in advance and when it had expired I went again to him—the first 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid after the telegram, and 1 did not go to Mr. Wainwright again till some days over the month, and then I got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more for the keep of the children in advance and asked him if he had heard of Mrs. King; he said that he had not—he continued to pay the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in advance every month up to June, 1875—I took care of the luggage till January—previous to my giving them up</p>

               <p>they were examined at my lodging by Mrs. Taylor and Mr. Eeles, who passed as Fowler—Mr. Eeles opened them—he pushed the lock on one side; it was easily unlocked—I saw the boxes myself; there were several letters in them—I had her letters, she always left them in my charge—they were in another box—after the things had been examined they were all put back and corded up—I did not give the letters up until I received this from Mr. King—this is exactly the writing he used to write to me—I cannot swear that this "Percy King" is his-writing, but it is the writing he always wrote to me—I went to him and asked him if I should give up the boxes—he said "You might as well," and I said "Please send me a paper"—he said that he would do so, and an authority for giving them up was brought to me by Mr. Eeles—I also got one from the father and gave it to Inspector Fix—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mr. Fowler and another young man took the boxes—there was a large box, a portmanteau, and a bonnet box—that was about 21st January, as far as I can remember.

I did not tell Mr. King, that my address was 6, The Grove; I left her to tell him that—I do. not know whether I told the Coroner or Magistrate that Wainwright said that he had seen her or some one else had seen her about London, but he has told me so, and I told him that I thought I had seen her in a cab, it was so immensely like—I said that I almost could have sworn it, but I had one of the children with me and could not follow her—this was near the Bank of England, about 5 o'clock in the day, about six weeks after 11th September—I reckon it by weeks—it was very cold weather, and I think it was before Christmas—I saw a Hansom cab, and a lady and gentleman in it, the colour of her hair struck my attention, being an uncommon colour, and the same as Harriet Lane's—the traffic impeded the cab to a certain extent, and I should have followed it if I had not the child—I was always on the look out for her—I never saw Mr. Wain-wright once at Sidney Square, but I saw him at Mrs. Wells, in Peter Street, several times calling and remaining a very short time—Mrs. King told me that Henry Wainwright gave her the lot of money I saw her with; I don't know how much she had, but I think there must have been 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by what she laid out, and she gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it—her wedding ring was larger than the keeper, which is usually the case—I cannot speak to the two buttons the police showed me, but 1 can say as a milliner that they are of the same kind—Mrs. King's cape and dress was trimmed only with buttons, quite two dozen were used—I never dressed her hair, but I used to see her dress it, from August 4th to 11th September, 1874, when she went away—I saw it when she went away, the rolls of wool pulled out makes it into the shape of a pad; that was all that was done to it; I had sent on the letter to Mr. Martin's, and I had written to him before—I had expressed a wish to keep the children, but I had talked of applying to the relieving officer, that was the only threat I used; I thought he might spare something for the children—he did not tell me that in consequence of the fire he was in litigation with the office; I think he was in difficulties, or he</p>

I am the wife of William Taylor, a coachman, of 7, Claredon Mews, Hyde Park—I am a daughter of John Lane, of Waltham, who is employed in the Gun Powder Works there—Harriet Louisa Lane was my youngest sister—I can't remember when she left Waltham—I have several other sisters—Mrs. Allen is one of them—I remember my sister Harriet living with Mrs. Foster, prior to that she had lived at several other places in London—she passed as Mrs. King—I knew that she had two children—before she went to Mrs. Foster's at Sidney Square she occasionally came to see me, and my husband and I went to see her—I went more than once, and found she was living there as Mrs. King with her children—the List time I saw her there was the second week in August—that was the last time I saw her alive—at the end of August I went to Weymouth with my husband for a fortnight—an my return I found a letter from Miss Wilmore—I knew that she was a friend of my sister's—in consequence of the letter which I received I went to Miss Wilmore, and then we we went together to see Henry Wainwright—I spoke to him and said I was come about a very unpleasant affair; about my sister being missing—I said "I am her sister, that you can see;" and he said "Oh yes; no doubt of that"—we were like each other—he said he did not know where she was, but that he gave her 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the day before she left Sidney Square, and afterwards, the last time he saw her, he gave her 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for an outfit to go to Brighton—he said he gave her that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when she came into his shop at Whitechapel; that he thought she had gone to the Pavilion Theatre with one Teddy Frieake, who had come in for a large fortune; that he waited for them at his shop till 10 o'clock, but that they did not come in—after that interview I heard nothing of my sister for some weeks—afterwards I received this letter from Mr. Wain-wright—at that time I used to speak to him as Mr. King, though I had then found out that that was not his real name—after receiving that letter I and Miss Willmore had a second interview with him—I said "Have you seen anything of my sister?"—he replied "No; but my foreman has seen hour in a cab"—he got a letter and a telegram—he kept the letter in his</p>

               <p>hand and read it out, something to this effect: "I have the lady under my protection, and I dare you or any body else to annoy her in any way"—he also read the telegram, which was: "We are now off to Paris, and mean to have a jolly spree"—that' was the second time I saw him—I saw him three times altogether—when he read the letter he did not read the signature, but he said he expected it came from Teddy Frieake—I think he also said the telegram was from Teddy Frieake—the third time I saw him was at the latter end of October or beginning of November—I saw him at his place of business—he gave me a little brandy and water—I asked him if he had heard anything of my sister—he said he did not know where she was, but he had no doubt she was all right and enjoying her luxuries, and that when they had had their frolic out he supposed they would return—I never saw him again and I never heard any tidings of my sister—I got Mr. Eeles to make some inquiries—he was a friend of mine—I think my sister was 24—she was not quite so tall as I am—she was of very slight build—her hands and feet were very small, and her fingers were very long—she had a nice quantity of very light hair, rather bright—she had a decayed tooth in the upper jaw on the right-hand side—it was next the eye-tooth, and was rather observable when she talked or smiled—she had a very nice set of teeth—I remember my sister having an accident; a burn—I was not at home when it happened—I know she had the mark—it was just below the knee, about the size of a florin, and looked like a mark produced by a burn—my sister, Mrs. Allen, can speak to that; she knows more about it—she has been unfortunately taken ill to-day—Harriet wore a wedding<lb></lb>ring and keeper—I saw the remains at St. Saviour's dead-house—the hair was very much like my sister's—she used to wear a pad and hair-pins over it to fasten it—it was a kind of frizzette—I have had a pad shown to me,. it was similar to that which she wore—I used to see her and she came to see me—I have seen her with her children—she appeared to be very fond indeed of them—I was in frequent communication with her; she used to write to me—Mr. Allen, my brother in-law, gave a number of envelopes, five I think; one of them had a letter in it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; I gave it to Detective Forster—it is my sister's writing—I do not know Henry Wain-wright's writing—some time in October Miss Willmore showed me a telegram; I went to her place to fetch it, No. 6, The Grove, Stratford with Mr. Eeles—I gave it to Mr. Eeles, and have not seen it since; I have made diligent search for it and cannot find it—I am quite confident that I never had it back from Mr. Eeles—Mr. Allen also brought me two buttons on a card, just as you get them from a draper's—my husband gave them to Inspector Fox in my presence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. At the first interview I had with Henry Wainwright I was accompanied by Miss Wilmore—I said to him "Can you tell me where my sister is?"—he said "I cannot tell you where she is; I only wish I could"—he said "The day before your sister was missing, I gave her 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and she said she was going to Brighton?"—he also said he gave her 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for an outfit before she went—it was at that same interview that he spoke of having waited at the shop till 10 o'clock, expecting her to return from the Pavilion Theatre; and that he had never seen her from that time—it was at the second interview that he told me some one had seen my sister in a cab—and at the third interview he said he should not continue to do as he had done for the children, and when the first child was old enough he would give it an education—the children are both girls—on the same oc<lb></lb>casion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220027"></xptr>
               <p>he said "Should she return again I shall not take to her, can you blame me?"—I replied, "Certainly not, under the circumstance"—all my interviews with Wainwright were at No. 84, Whitechapel Road—I never went to No. 215—when he referred to the letter he held it in-his hand and read it, and I only know the contents of the letter by what he said—I could see the letter sufficiently to see there was writing on it, but whose writing it was I could not possibly tell—I am not certain whether I was the first member of the family who saw the remains—my father and my husband went with me—I had not given any description of my sister to the police before I was examined as a witness—my attention was drawn to the length of the feet and hands—my father drew attention to them and to the hair, as we were looking at the remains together—my attention was also called to the decayed tooth—several teeth were missing when I saw the remains—I had thought before of the particular things to which I would direct my attention when I saw the body—those points were her hair, the decayed tooth, and her hands and feet—the feet were very small, and her hands were also small, with very long fingers—the mark on the <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> had not then occurred to me—she had not a scar on each leg, only on one <hi rend="italic">leg</hi>—I am not aware of two—I am quite positive she had not two—I received five envelopes from Mr. Allen and gave them to detective Forster—I am unable to say out of which envelope I took the letter, I saw it before I took it out of the en<lb></lb>velope—I had the other envelopes with me at the time; the others were empty—I am quite confident that I put the letter back into the same en<lb></lb>velope I took it from.</p>

This is the envelope directed by my sister—she wrote well and easily—she had had some education—at one time she was a governess; I could not tell exactly when—she wrote with facility, and was a very good scholar—when I said that some teeth were absent, I mean absent from the jaw of the body that was shown to me, not that my sister had lost any teeth—I remember my father giving evidence before the Magistrate, and speaking about the scar; that was not till after I had given my evidence—I did not recollect it till it was drawn to my attention—I have no knowledge of whose writing these envelopes are—this letter (A) is in my sister's handwriting.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now in the service of Messrs. Hounsell, Brothers, in the Minories—I was formerly in the service of Henry Wain-wright—I know his handwriting well—I also know the handwriting of Thomas Wain-wright—to the best of my belief these letters marked B and I and the envelope which contained I are in Henry Wainwright's writing, also all these envelopes, and the signature to the letter marked G, dated 21st January, 1875, not the body of the letter—also the envelope and letter marked F. addressed to Miss Wilmore, 26, Maryland Street, Stratford; there is no date to this one of 15th or 16th February, 1874, but both letter and envelope are Henry Wainwright's writing—the letter marked E, headed "Charing Cross Hotel," to the best of my belief is in Thomas Wain-wright's writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Clarendon Mews, Hyde Park Square, and am a coachman—my wife is a daughter to Mr. John Lane—I knew her sister Harriet Lane as Mrs. King—she frequently visited Clarendon Mews; once in three weeks, and a fortnight sometimes—sometimes she would write to us—she had been in the habit of visiting us at the Mews very nearly four years—I and my wife went out of town together on Saturday the 30th August last year—three days before that I had seen Harriet Lane at my house—I saw her, but my wife was out of town at the time she called—she was then well, and I saw her and chatted with her—that was the last time I saw her alive—at the time I and my wife were out of town at my uncle's, near Yeovil, a letter came from her in her writing—that was early in September, the 4th or 5th, I won't be certain which—after our holiday we returned to town—on Wednesday the 15th September in the present year I and my wife went to the dead-house at St. Saviour's Church—we were shown portions of a body there—in my opinion the body was that of Harriet Lane—I knew it by the small feet, and the hands, and the colour of the hair—when she was at my house I noticed that she complained of toothache—I did not see the tooth, but she pointed to me where it was—it was on the right hand side of the upper jaw (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>)—two of her teeth projected out a little when she laughed—I did not observe any teeth that were bad, only one, and that I could see was regularly decayed—it could be seen when she laughed or smiled—that was the tooth she pointed to me—two upper front teeth projected a little—they were a little promi<lb></lb>nent—I remember two jet buttons on a card being brought to my house by Mr. Allen, my brother-in-law—I gave them up to Inspector Fox in the same state in which I received them—my wife was not present at the time I gave them up.</p>

I went with my wife to see the remains, and both Mr. Allen and I were examined at the police-court the next day—I had been told before I saw the remains that I should not recognise them, and that there were no features that I could recognise them by—I knew that I was going to see remains that were an recognisable by features—when' I was before the Magistrate I told them that there was a decayed tooth, but I omitted to say anything about toothache; it did not occur to me at the time—the hair I saw was the same colour, and I said that by the decayed tooth, the hair, and the small hands and feet, I had no doubt that it was Harriet Lane.</p>

I am the wife of Edwin Allen, and I live at Oldfield Road, Maidenhead—Harriet Louisa Lane was my sister—I am older than she was—there were seven sisters living, with Harriet; she was the seventh daughter; I am the fifth—she might have been a trifle taller than me; I have compared heights with her several times, standing back to back, measuring ourselves—I cannot recollect how tall I am, but I have been measured; she was the tallest; the difference was perceptible to any one—her feet were small, and she had small hands, and her fingers were small in pro<lb></lb>portion—I remember an accident happening to her some time ago, and she had a scar on her right leg through it—I was present at the time—a poker had been put into the fire, and whilst she was sitting down on a little stool by the side of the fire-grate, the poker fell out of the fire on to the out<lb></lb>side of her right leg, and she was a good deal burnt, and she cried very much—as far as I can recollect she was about ten years of age at the time—it was some time before the burn healed up—I fetched the oil for it to be dressed—after it was better there was a mark left, and the skin was drawn very much—the mark was about four inches below the knee to the best of my recollection; I never measured it—it had the appearance of a scar, and seemed to be drawn round at the side—I was about 19 years old then—I last saw the scar when" we were at home together about six years ago—it is three years come the 19th January since I left my father's house—my sister Harriet left home about a year or eighteen months before me—she was well educated—she was brought up as a milliner—at one time she was a governess in a family, but I really cannot say how long—she was what is called a nursery governess—I and my sister about six years ago were photographed together at Shoreditch in a standing posture—this is (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), the photograph that was taken—I was dressed in a blue silk, and my sister in a black dress—my sister is the lady on the right hand—she had light hair of a golden tinge.</p>

I understood that for some little time she had been a governess after she was out of her apprenticeship—she went to London as I thought to go into business with another young woman when she was out of her apprenticeship—it might be two or three weeks after she had gone to London that I knew she was living in Whitechapel, I can't speak to the time—I never had her address and never went to any lodging of hers—from the time she left home I believed she was provided for—I knew nothing of the pawning of her clothing—I am sure it was in August, 1874, that she last came down to Waltham, either the beginning or the middle of August; it was not the end of July—sometimes six or seven weeks occurred during which she was absent—when Mr. Eeles and I went to Henry Wain-right Mr. Eeles said to him "Here is a letter that has come from Mr. Frieake, the auctioneer"—he mentioned the word auctioneer—Wainright immediately said he was not the man; I think he said that after he read the letter, but I will not be certain—I do not recollect that the conversation was going on at the time he had the letter in his hand, I do not believe it was—he stopped for a time and looked at the letter, and then the conversation went on—I am not perfectly certain, but I believe he was silent at the time he was looking the letter—to the best of my belief I have always said the same—I mentioned the word "exposure" first, but I cannot say at what part of. the story I mentioned it—he said "If it comes to an exposure it must," and 1 rejoined "If it does it will be heavier for you than for me"—I believe Mrs. Taylor is the tallest of my daughters, slightly taller than Harriet I cannot say how much, she is the tallest of all my daughters, but Harriet was not the shortest; I cannot say that she was the next in height to Mrs. Taylor; I have two daughters, I believe, shorter than Harriet; Mrs. Allen is not one of them; I judge her to be nearly the same height as Harriet—I judged Harriet to be more than 5 feet, I never measured her—before I saw the remains I had heard that the features were not recognisable—Mrs. Taylor and I saw them together, I said I was satisfied it was my daughter;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220032"></xptr>
               <p>I was quite satisfied—I had not talked with Mrs. Taylor or anybody as to the particular points to which our attention was to be directed; I went away thoroughly satisfied—the scar on the leg occurred to me directly I went to the police-court and I named it directly—that was the next day, or the day after I had seen the remains—she was perhaps seven or eight years of age at the time the accident happened; I had not seen the scar for many years; I knew there was one.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the office of the Charity Organisation at Wandsworth—I am the inquiry officer there—it is part of my business to make inquiries about persons—I have known Mr. and Mrs. Taylor for some years—I saw Harriet Lane once, I knew she was a sister of Mrs. Taylor's—I knew that she was missing in January of the present year—I had a con<lb></lb>versation with the Taylors about her—they gave me some particulars, in consequence of which I instituted inquires at their request—Harriet Lane knew my right name, and I thought, probably, if the name of Eeles came to her as the name of the person who was making inquiries it might have an opposite effect to what was wished I therefore represented myself to be a Mr. Fowler—I went to see Henry Wainwright at 215, Whitechapel Road, as near as I can say about the 16th January of the present year—I saw him first outside the house; I came up rather behind him, put my hand against his shoulder and said "Mr. Wainwright, I think"—he said "Yes"—I said "I wish to speak privately for a minute"—he said "Step inside"—I said to him "Do you know a person named Mrs. King or Harriet Lane"—he said "Yes"—I said "You have known her about four years"—he said "Yes"—I said "She has had two children by you"—he said "Yes"—I said "Where is she now," or "Do you know where she is," I cannot remember the words exactly, he said "I do not know"—the surveyor for the Sun Fire Office was outside as he told me, and they were going across to measure the premises at 84—he said "Axe you in a hurry"—I said "No"—he said "Will you step across—I said "Yes," and we went across—there was some measuring done at 84, and after it was over we returned to 215—I then asked him when he had last seen Harriet Lane—he said "Some time ago now"—I said "Where do you think she is"—he said he thought she had gone away with a man named <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake, who had lately come into about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; "there are five brothers who had had 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left between them, no doubt they are enjoying themselves and she will turn up again when the money is all spent"—he said that Frieake was an auctioneer—I am under the im<lb></lb>pression that he said so; I know that he did on a subsequent occasion, if he did not then—I am not quite sure that he said it at that time—I gave him my name as Fowler and my address at the Post-office, High Street, Wands-worth, if he should want to write to me—my impression is that I gave it to him as some sort of satisfaction at the time—shortly after that interview I saw Mrs. Taylor, and she gave me this letter marked E and a telegram—I have lost the telegram—I have made diligent search for it and cannot find it—I have no recollection of having giving it to anybody—I then went to Mr. Frieake of 11, Coleman Street—I saw his address on <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the handbills</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220033"></xptr>
               <p>notifying that a sale was to take place at his auction-room, Aldgate—I went there first and then to Coleman Street—I saw Mr. Frieake and showed him the letter that I had got from Mrs. Taylor—I am not quite positive whether I showed him the telegram or not—I had some conversation with him, and he showed me his letter book and some of his writing—after a little time we left the office and went together to Henry Wainwright, 215, Whitechapel Road—I should think that was about a fortnight after my first visit—we saw him and I said to him "Mr. "Wainwright, I have found Mr. Frieake"—he said "Oh, this is not the Mr. Frieake, this is a mistake"—Mr. Frieake said "What is this <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>"—he said "Oh it is a mistake altogether"—this happened outside the house on the opposite side to 215—we then crossed the road and went into the front room upstairs at 215—Mr. Frieake said "You are getting me into a mess that I know nothing of, and may do me a serious injury"—Henry Wainwright said you are not the <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake I mean, the <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake I mean is a billiard player and have seen him frequently at Purcell's, at the Philharmonic, and the <hi rend="italic">Nell</hi> Gwynne"—Mr. Frieake said "Do you mean to say you have ever known another <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake and not enquired who he was; I don't believe you will find another <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake with the name spelt the same as mine in the 'London Directory;' if you know anything about this affair why don't you tell them at once? I saw you with a fair-haired girl a short time ago, is that the one?—Wainwright said "No; I can produce her in five minutes"—he said that he was a young man with no whiskers, and scarcely any moustache, not above a dozen or a score "of hairs—after that conversation I left—I left just before Mr. Frieake, I think—I saw Mrs. Taylor again, and afterwards Mr. Lane—I went with Mr. Lane to Mr. Frieake's auction rooms—I and Mr. Lane at that time had a conversation with Mr. Frieake—he gave me this letter marked A (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in an envelope—I afterwards gave the letter and envelope to Mrs. Taylor—I think the letter was not in the envelope; I did not get the letter back from Mrs. Taylor—when I got the letter and envelope I and Mr. Lane went to see Henry Wainwright, at 215—he was not in at first—we waited for him and he came in after a short interval—I said to him "This is Mr. Lane, Harriet Lane's father"—he asked us to go upstairs, and we went up—Mr. Laue said "Where is my daughter?"—he said "I do not know"—Mr. Lane said "If she is dead tell me, and if alive let me know where she is"—Wainwright said that he did not know where she was, but would do all he could to try and find her—Mr. Lane said "I am determined to find her, if it comes to an exposure it must, but that will be worse for you than us"—during the conversation Mr. Lane was pacing backwards and forwards wringing his hands in great agony of mind—I showed this letter to Mr. Wainwright, told him I had received it from Mr. Frieake, and asked him whether he could give any explanation of it—he appeared to read it, and while he had it in his hand 1 said "Can you tell me what this part alludes to?"—pointing to that part "If <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> and yourself could see me to-morrow evening, we may be able to arrange matters satisfactorily as the time is now very short"—he said he did not know what it meant—he appeared to read the letter, and afterwards (luring the interview he gave it back to me—I do not remember that he made any further remark upon it. (<hi rend="italic">Bead</hi>: "Sunday night. My dear Mr. Frieake,—I trust you will pardon me writing to you, but I feel I ought to apologise for my rude behaviour to you last evening, after the kindness I have received from you. I had been very worried and annoyed during the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220034"></xptr>
               <p>day, which caused me to be very excited. I felt very sorry you left me so cross. I did not go out after, as you wished me not to. I have well con<lb></lb>sidered the subject we spoke of, and think if <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> and yourself could see me to-morrow evening, we might be able to arrange matters satisfactorily, as the time is now very short. Please write by return, and let me know if you will call, or if I shall meet you anywhere. For the future, I will pro<lb></lb>mise to behave more ladylike. Should I not hear from you, I shall consider I am not forgiven. I remain, very truly yours, L. King.") I have no means of fixing the date of my second interview with Henry Wainwright—I called upon him after that interview, several times, and asked him about the missing woman—on one occasion he said that one of his workmen had seen her in a cab, somewhere at the West End, but I forget the place he named—on another occasion he said that Miss Wilmore had seen her in a cab, and named the place, somewhere at the West End—he said on another occasion that she would turn up again some day, when the money was all gone—the last time I saw him I made inquiries about her—to the best and my recollec<lb></lb>tion it was in the early part of July, this year, I think—I cannot find the telegram, Mrs. Taylor gave me, but I read it—it was on the ordinary telegraph paper, I think—it was from E. Frieake, Dover, to Miss Wilmore, 6, The Grove, Stratford—I cannot recollect the date "We are just off to Paris, and mean to have a jolly spree."</p>

Frieake—I read it and expressed my astonishment to Eeles; it was not written by me, and I know nothing about the matters referred to in it, or of a telegram which he also showed me—I produced my letter book, and said that he could look at any letters in it to see my writing—I then went with him to see Henry Wainwright at 215, Whitechapel Road—I asked to see Wainwright, and I said "<hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, I want to see you privately"—Eeles was behind me and Wainwright who met us, ushered us up into the first floor sitting-room—I then said "This individual (<hi rend="italic">alluding to Fowler</hi>) has been to my office and accused me of taking a girl away by the name of King, and has said that you are his informant to that effect"—he said "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi>, old man, it is not you; it is another <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake"—I said "Well, it is a very serious imputation to cast upon my character, and should it get to the ears of the lady I am engaged to be married to, it will very likely ruin my happiness," or something to that effect—I said "What sort of man is this <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake, who has represented me"—he said "Oh, he is only a young fellow about 23 or 24, with a slight, black moustache; "I think he said" and a very little whisker, and has lately come into a lot of money"—I then appealed to Fowler, and asked him whether he was satisfied that I was not the man alluded to—before that I asked him where he had known this <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake, and he said at the King's Head billiard-rooms, Fenchurch Street, and the Philharmonic—I asked him whether he had ever seen me at either of those places and he said "No"—I said "Well, it is a strange thing that you should have known another <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake and not have asked him whether he had relations living at Bow, as mine is not a Brown, Jones, or Robinson name"—he said he had principally known him as <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi>—I said "If I had met another Henry Wainwright, and been introduced to him, I should have asked him whether he had any relations in Whitechapel," and that as mine was a very peculiar name I was surprised that he he had not made any inquiries about the said <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake when he first met him, and I turned round to Fowler and said "As far as 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would go I would give it willingly to find out the person who has represented me, as it might be a very serious matter for me"—I said "Who is the fair girl I saw you with a few weeks before or since?"—in fact I had followed them into a public-house—Fowler then left and I had some conversation with Wain-wright alone—I said "<hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, old man, if you know anything about this girl's whereabouts why don't you ease their minds and let them know"—he said "<hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi>, old man, this is a only a get up to extort money from me, the girl is all right"—I think that was all that passed—when I heard of this matter I went to the police-station, Borough, and gave my card, and saw Superintendent Garforth, to whom I gave information—the entries in my diary of this year (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in my handwriting, all but one—from that I have very little doubt that 1 saw Henry Wainwright on 11th September, 1874—he asked me to send a cart down at 6 o'clock on that evening to 84, Whitechapel Road—it would be early in the morning as I passed up to town</p>

We were young fellows together in the neighbourhood of Bow—that was the commencement of my knowledge of him—I have not been as intimate with him for the last two or three years as I used to be—I have not gone about with him lately, but I used to see his family several nights in the week—there had been no coldness between us, we were on perfectly good terms—the transaction of my selling goods for him was about July or August, at the time of his difficulties, when he was making his composition—the goods were some of his surplus stock—I think the goods were only partially looted when his manager Rogers came and finished them at my rooms—the goods were not considerable in number—I believe the van only went twice for them, and I believe it went in the evening and in the morning; the entry in my diary is Friday, September 11—I made that as soon as entered the office, and I have no doubt that I saw Wainwright on the morning of the 11th, and received directions to take the van there at 6 o'clock—this "evening, 6 o'clock," is in my writing—I am certain that the order was executed, because I have been paid for the cart—the goods were in my possession some time before they were put up for auction, and the fire occurred in November, some six weeks after the sale—I did not act for Wainwright in any way after the fire—I was asked to be a witness by the Company, and also by Wainwright—Fowler came to me in January, 1875—the fire was in November, 1874, and my visit to Wain-wright was early in 1875—I was to be a witness for him in reference to the action against him—I supplied him with an account for the sale, and I have a claim against him, and he has one against me—it is unsettled—he said that Frieake had come into a lot of money, and as soon as it was spent the girl would return he also said you will hear nothing more about it—when he said "This is a get up to extort money from me," Fowler had left.</p>

I live at 3, Sidney Square, Commercial Road, and have lived there since Christmas, 1873—my daughter Lucy lives with me—I know Henry Wainwright, he came to me as Mr. King somewhere about May, 1874—I had "Apartments" in my window—he came in and said "I see you have apartments here to let; would you mind taking a lady, her nurse and two children in?"—after some conversation I agreed to do so—I said I could not let them at lees than £l a week; he agreed to that—I said "I suppose it is Mrs. King?"—I cannot be positive that he said his name was King, but all his transactions were in that name—he did not say whether the lady was his wife or not, as I know of, but she always passed as his wife; I fancy he said she was his wife; I am almost sure he did—I asked what reference could I have; he said "I can give you a deposit if you wish it, and a reference," he did not give me any reference; he paid me a deposit instead—he said he should not come very often, that he was a traveller, and his business called him very much away from home—he came next morning and said "Is Mrs. King come yet?"—I said "No, she has not been here"—he then left and came again about 11 o'clock with Mrs. King in a cab to look at the apartments—the arrangement was then con<lb></lb>cluded and she came in the evening with the nurse and two children and Mr. Rogers—they brought their luggage with them—the nurse stayed about seven weeks—Mrs. King stayed till 11th September—whilst she was there Henry Wainright never came to see her; never to come in—I saw him once at the door—Rogers used to come very frequently, and most times he went upstairs to Mrs. King—Miss Wilmore use to come to see her very often, almost every Sunday, and about the end of August she came to stay altogether—whilst Mrs. King was with me I remember a gen<lb></lb>tleman coming to see her about twice or three times—he went up to her rooms on the first floor; I think one time she opened the door to him herself, or we opened it, and said "It is Mr. Frieake, come in," and he went upstairs—she said she expected a gentleman, and she opened the door, and he went upstairs oh one occasion—once he pronounced his name as Mr. Frieake—I think that was the second time he came, I am not quite certain; but I am almost certain it was the second time of his coming—I let him in both times; I don't think I announced him the first time; I think he went upstairs; I think Mrs. King was looking out. for him and expecting him—I announced him as Mr. Frieake because she was saying in the day time that Mr. Frieake was coming to talk about some furniture, and when he came he said his name was Mr. Frieake</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220042"></xptr>
               <p>—he asked whether Mrs. King was at home, and said it was Mr. Frieake—I first knew about Mr. Frieake because Mrs. King said that there was a gentleman of the name of Frieake going to give her furniture for two rooms, and he gave his name as Frieake when he went upstairs; that was the second time—I think the first time he went up without giving his name—it was when I showed him upstairs that he gave the name of Frieake, and I opened the door and said "Mr. Frieake"—I did not know that he was the gentleman who was going to give her the furniture till he gave his name—I did not know it on the first occasion—it was the same gentlemen that came on both occasions—she said that he was going to get her furniture, not to get rid of it, and she even said that he was coming to get her to choose what colour she would have—on one of the two occasions that he came he brought a bottle of champagne, and Mrs. King asked me for some champagne glasses, and I went out and borrowed some—I saw him bring in the bottle under his arm or in his hand in a paper, it was a champagne bottle I saw it next day up in the room; I think it was a quart bottle—I got the glasses at the Princess Royal, nearly opposite Mr. Humphreys is the landlord, I went for them myself—I got three glasses, only two were used—I saw nothing more of Mr. Frieake that day, he went out shortly afterwards—I think that was the second time he came—on another occa<lb></lb>sion after that, I can't remember the date, about 10 o'clock at night, there was a knocking at the door by one of my neighbours on account of a little disturbance in the street—I went out and found Mrs. King with Mr. King as I thought it was, and another gentleman, I think it was the same gen<lb></lb>tleman that came before, Mr. Frieake—I only just saw them with a passing glance—I am certain it was the same gentleman that came with the cham<lb></lb>pagne—the other gentleman was Mr. King, I am certain—I think Mrs. King was rather intoxicated, she seemed very much excited—I asked her to come in with me, and she said I had no business to interfere with her and her husband, and of course I came in again directly—she appeared to be quarrelling with the gentlemen; they left her on the step of the door and knocked and rang and went away, and she ran down the street after them—I went to the corner and said "Do come in, Mrs. King;" one of the gentlemen was standing on the corner of the kerb, and the other a little distance from him; at last Miss Wilmore went and got her in—next day I gave her notice—I told her I should like her to leave that day week, which I think was on the Wednesday following—she asked me to let her stay two days longer, and I did so, that would be the 11th—champagne was brought on two occasions, once a pint bottle, and once a quart bottle; Mr. Frieake brought it, not the same day, it was some days before, about a fortnight before Mrs. King left, I think, the first time he called—I am almost sure it was the last time he called that he brought the pint, and the other time he brought the quart, he went out for it after he came in—I am almost certain it was the small bottle that he brought last, now I come to think, the first was a large bottle—it was a week afterwards I think that he brought the second one, I know one was a pint and the other a quart—except on this one occasion Mrs. King was a well conducted person, I never saw any<lb></lb>thing wrong in her—twice before I think she came home very much excited, but nothing to speak of, a little the worse perhaps for a glass of anything—on other occasions she conducted herself quite as a lady, as we thought—once about a month before, she came home about 9 or 10 o'clock in the evening, she had been out the whole afternoon and she was a little more talkative,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220043"></xptr>
               <p>and made herself a little more free with us, that was all—she seemed very fond indeed of her children; they both slept in her bed when she had not got the nurse; before that one slept with the nurse—she left on Friday, 11th September, and she paid me all that was due to me—we parted on friendly terms, we shook hands and I bade her good bye, and watched her round the corner of the street—I never saw her again alive—she had with a small paper parcel which she carried on her finger with a piece of twine, and a new umbrella—I don't know what was in the parcel—Miss Wilmore left later on the same day, with the children, about 6 or 7 o'clock—I saw Thomas Wainwright at the Borough Session-house—I was taken to see him—I had seen him before at Leman Street, but I could not recognise him then, when he was in the Borough I thought he was the same gentleman that brought the champagne; he had very little whiskers at that time—I did not notice whether he had any moustache, I only just let him in at the door as he passed through the passage, and I could hardly say.</p>

It was only after some remains had been discovered which were said to be the remains of my late lodger, and that Henry Wainwright was in custody, that my mind was carried back to the taking of my lodging in April, 1874—I had no reason to think of my lodger from September, 1874, up to the time that the discovery was made; there was nothing resting on my mind—I saw Henry Wainwright when he took the lodging—he came three times altogether, twice the day the apartments were taken, and once before—I never saw him in the house afterwards—I saw him in the cab on the night of the disturbance, that was quite 10.30 at night, at the latter end of August or the beginning of September; it was the same gentleman that had taken the lodging—I tapped him on the shoulder, and said "Mr. King I will go and try and get her in," and she said "How dare you interfere with me and my husband."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MOODY</hi>. The person who passed as Mr. Frieake, was the only gentleman that called on Mrs. King—I saw nothing more of him after 11th September, 1874—I don't know whether my daughter let him in once—I think I let him in most times; I have not said that Mrs. King let him in once—she was at the top of the stairs and asked him to come up, that made me pronounce his name—there is only about a dozen steps from my passage—the stairs are right opposite the door, about 4 or 5 feet, and about ten or twelve steps up to the first floor—it was quite evening, I think it was gaslight—she said "Come up," and he stepped up at once—that was the only occasion on which I had to announce him—I heard of the discovery of the body on the Monday morning, I think, not till Mr. Forster came, I think I was taken to the Leman Street station, after Thomas Wainwright was taken into custody—I did not know that I was taken to see the man who had passed himself off as Mr. Frieake—I don't believe I had heard that—I was shown some men together in the police-yard; I was told to have a good look, and I did have a good look, and I could not recognise anybody there, it was not till I saw Thomas Wainwright sitting in the dock at the police-court with the other prisoner, that I began to have any recollection of him—I then said he was about the size and stature of the man—I. said he looked very much like the gentleman, and I believed very possibly he was the man—I said there the man had very light whiskers and a very light moustache, and I have said to-day that he had rather light whiskers—that was my impression at the time—the only time I speak to was his coming on one occasion when Mrs. King was at the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and keep the Old Red Lion, 339, Strand—I was proprietor of the Princess Royal public-house, I and 2, Sidney Square, in August and September—that is immediately opposite Mrs. Foster's—I knew the prisoners—I have known Henry six or seven years, and Thomas four or five years—sometime in the autumn of last year I saw both the prisoners in my house together—the last time I saw them was Saturday, the 5th September—I saw them only once before at the Princess Royal, about a week previously—they were together on that occasion—I fix the date by my day book—I had to give the necessary notice for the transfer of the license, but I do not fix it by that date, but by an entry I made in reference to lending some champagne glasses—I remem<lb></lb>ber the circumstance, it was on 5th September, and the two prisoners were at my house from 4 to 6 or 7 o'clock, they smoked two cigars and had some soda and brandy divided—my barman in my presence supplied them with a pint bottle of champagne first, and then with a quart, within an interval of half-an-hour or an hour—the pint bottle was taken away, I do not remember who by, but it must have been by one of them because they were the only persons in the private bar—I did not see it taken away by them, but I infer that it must have been; I saw it on the counter waiting to be taken—after the champagne was taken away Mrs. Foster came to borrow some champagne glasses—there must have been two or three, because I made this memorandum to remind my storekeeper that our cabinets were short of champagne glasses—within an hour I should imagine after Mrs. Foster borrowed the glasses, Thomas Wainwright had a quart bottle of champagne which he took away with him and did not return—Henry was not there when the second bottle was taken away—on the same night between 9 and 10 o'clock, I saw both the prisoners outside Mrs. Foster's house, when a disturbance happened, and several other people.</p>

I was keeping one public-house at that time, but I have four, my own property; one is in Long Acre, one in the Strand, one in Sidney Square, and one in the Whitechapel Road—the licenses are held by different people, one of whom is my brother—I conduct the business by means of managers, who are my servants, and go about from one to the other, giving all my time and attention to them—I had had the Princess Royal about two years and was going to transfer the license to my brother's name, which was done on 28th September—I devote my time prin<lb></lb>cipally to the Princess Alice—I was transferring Mr. Forster, my billiard marker to the position of manager—I had two barmen and two barmaids—the person who was to succeed to the license was not there—the transfer of the license docs not mean the transfer of the public-house, but a transfer from one servant of mine to another servant of mine—it was about to go into the name of Robert Humphries, my brother, and until the license was transferred Forster was manager—he is not here, nor are the barmen that I know of—</p>

I did not notice the smell after putting down the second quantity of chloride of lime—I did not hear Henry Wain-right give directions for the rubbish and ashes to be removed—they had been accumulating for a long time—there was quite a cartload, if not more—it was all ashes—it was not removed when I left in July, 1875—the Rogerses were living there at the time upstairs, they went out in April—I worked at No. 84, and I had to go to 215 as well—when the Rogerses were living at 84 there were complaints of the smell of the drains at 215—I did not notice any smell at 84 myself—Rogers complained of the smell of the drains at 215 before he went to live there—Mr. West was living there at that time—that was before July, 1874—I am sure it was Rogers who complained, and West as well—I do not know how long West was living at 215—r do not know whether complaint was made of the drains at the time West was there—I never heard of complaints made of the drains at 84—I had forgotten about the taking the case to Mr. Baylis until Detective Forster came to me about the 23rd September this year—he asked me if I remembered it—that was how it arose—I was working at 215 usually, all the time the place was opened—I remember the things being brought from 84 and being loaded at 215 for the purpose of going to Mr. Frieake's sale rooms—I believe only two lots were sent there—I remember a van coming one evening about 6.30, and it came the following morning to take the rest of the things—I was there with Rogers in the evening, when the van came—I do not remember Vostius being there—I did not notice how long it took putting the goods out into the van—we shut up from about 7.30 to 8 o'clock—very likely that evening we may have been later than usual—8 o'clock is my usual tune for leaving work—when it became dark the gas was lighted at 215—it was dark by 8 o'clock in September—we had not the gas alight when the goods were being loaded in the van—we had finished by daylight—we worked by-gas light when it was needed, but on this evening we had finished before we had occasion to light the gas—I and Vostius generally packed the goods at 215—that was the ordinary place for packing the goods—Saturdays were not very busy days—from July to November, 1874, Mr. Wainwright generally made it a practice to clear up on Saturday—he always paid us our wages on Saturday—what I mean by clearing up is getting the place ready for Monday morning's packing—I used to leave before Rogers.</p>

I live at 11, Teddington Ter<lb></lb>race, Tredegar Road, Bow—I was formerly in the service of Henry Wain-wright—I entered the service the 11th August, 1873, and continued there until April of the present year—during that time he had the premises 84 and 215—up to July 1874 Mr. West lived at 215—from that time until Novem<lb></lb>ber, 1874, they were not used as a residence—shortly before the fire I went there to live with my wife and continued to live there until April of this year—before going there 1 had been living at 84 with my wife, from July until the beginning of November—I knew Mrs. King; I first saw her at St. Peter Street at Mrs. Wells'—Henry Wainwright asked me to take a letter with some money in it, that was in February, 1874, I believe; he said "Will you take this letter for me to Mrs. King? say it is from Mr. King, there is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it, and obtain a receipt"—he did not say who Mrs. King was, the letter was directed to her—I took it there and gave it her—Miss Wil-more wrote the receipt out, and I gave it to Henry Wainwright the next morning—I do not think Mrs. King signed it, it had a stamp on it, I found the stamp; that was the first time I had seen Miss Wilmore or Mrs. King—I think 1 went to that lodging again on two occasions afterwards with mes<lb></lb>sages or letters from Henry Wainwright—rill usually left them in the tea hour after 6 o'clock—he did not say what the letters were—I remember Mrs. King leaving these lodgings; I went there on that day—Mr. Wainwright told me to go and get a cab to take Mrs. King and the two children to No. 3, Sidney Square, and he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for the expenses—that was in the even<lb></lb>ing in the early part of May—I went to the lodgings as directed, got a cab, and took Mrs. king, the two children and the luggage—Miss Wilmore did not go with us, we picked up the nurse at the corner of the Bethnal Green Road, and then went to 3, Sydney Square, I helped the luggage upstairs and left them there—I saw Henry Wainwright the next morning and told him what I had done—I think I have been to 3, Sydney Square perhaps four or five times with money and letters from Henry Wainwright—I saw Mrs. King there—I took 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on one occasion and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on another and gave them to her; I did not get receipts for those I think the last time I took money was when I took the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Mrs. King threw them on the table and said "That is no use to me, as I have to pay my rent;" she appeared dissatisfied—I think that was one evening about the middle of August—I saw Henry Wainwright afterwards and told him Mrs. King was dissatisfied with the amount—he said "Oh, all right, never mind," some short answer, I forget the words—I have sometimes been there without taking money; I was sent by Henry Wainwright to say that he would send it to her shortly—on one occasion the message was that he would send to her shortly when lie had settled his business with Mr.</p>

               <p>Sawyer—Mr. Sawyer had been in partnership with him, and there had been borne disputes—I think it was sometime in July, that I took that message—it must have been the commencement of July, that I took the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on one occasion when I went there Mrs. King showed me a telegram like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I could not positively swear it was this, but the words are the same—she handed it to me and I read it—she made some statement to me about it; I left it there; I afterwards saw Henry Wainwright—I told him that Mrs. King had received a telegram from him stating that I and he had gone out of town, and it was false, because he knew that I had not left town—he said "Oh, never mind," or something short; I need not trouble myself very much about it—this was sometime, about the middle of July; I could not say exactly; I think that was the last occasion that I went to Sidney Square—I have seen Mrs. King, at 84, Whitechapel Road, at least a dozen times from the time I entered Henry Wainwright's employment—she used to come to the shop, and I have seen her and Henry Wainwright talking together—the first time I saw her there after I had Last seen her in Sidney Square, was I think the end of July I don't think she saw Henry Wainwright then—she came again some time in August—the last time I saw her there was almost the end of August—during July and August, I saw her there two or three times—the last time I saw her there she saw Henry Wainwright (at that time he was living at 40, Tredegar Square, Bow, with his wife and five children)—she saw him in the front of the shop; I was sitting in the counting-house—I heard nothing that took place; I saw them apparently very quarrelsome, gesticulating—I could not hear a word—that was the last time I saw her—I can't give the date—it was sometime in August—I remember on one occasion Mrs. King being ill at 84; that was at the commencement of August 1874, I saw her for a moment—my wife told me of her being ill; I only know it from my wife—no one lived at the premises, 215, from July, to November" 1874; during that period the premises were locked up, and the keys kept at 84, behind the counting-house door, and the counting-house was. not locked up at night—there was a broom rack on wheels with a door to it, and the key of that door was always kept by Henry Wainwright—it was a sliding broom rack which formed a passage to the dwelling-house—when the shop was shut up; it was a partition with a door in it, and that locked up the counting-house and the shop; that would lock up the keys—Henry Wainwright always took home that key home with him—when I came in the morning I could not get to 215 to do any work there, and I have sometimes said to him jokingly "I shall fine you if you are not earlier," that was when I wanted the place open—I remember in September last he speaking to me about some chloride of lime; I think it was on the 10th, he asked me to inquire of Mr. Baylis the price of chloride of lime, that he had got an order from South end for a I cwt.—I went and inquired at Mr. Baylis, which is only a few hundred yards from 84, and took him the price, I forget the quotation, but he said it would do; I don't think I. ordered it—Henry Wainwright only dealt in chloride of lime for the police contract when he had it, which was sometime afterwards—the police contract was for small stores—we only obtained that contract in the early part of this year—at that time he did not deal in chloride of lime—he was the manager there, and I was the chief man; I did not know of any customer at Southend—on that day after the shop was shut up, I saw a box on the premises—I we it arrive from Baylis', that was the same day I had inquired the price,</p>

               <p>after the shop was closed, which was at 8 o'clock; it was brought in a hand truck and placed in the passage by Baylis' man—I saw that done—I could tell by the smell that it contained chloride of lime; it was so pungent—my wife saw it and spoke to me about it—it remained there during the night, and next morning before the shop was opened I saw it lying in the passage—I did not see it removed, and do not know who removed it, or where it went; I missed it while I was upstairs at breakfast, that would be about 8.30 or 9 o'clock; when I came down it was gone—Henry Wainwright came to busi<lb></lb>ness, sometimes at 8.15, 8.30, 8.45—there were complaints of the drains at 84 while I was living there—no chloride of lime was need for them to my knowledge while I was there—the premises at 215 at that time were only used specially for large orders, sometimes nobody went into the premises for days, only for opening and shutting them, they were opened and shut everyday, and kept open till the time of closing at 84—the shutters were taken down, so that there would be light for any packing that was wanted, but the place was thoroughly closed—the doors would not be open; nobody could get in, we had the keys at 84—at the time I and my wife were living at 215, I noticed a smell at the end of the shop—I could not say when I first perceived it; I should say shortly after Christmas—I put it down to the accumulation of ashes and other vegetable refuse, we had no dusthole there—I spoke about it to Henry Wainwright; I told him the smell was very bad and the ashes had accumulated—he said "When Ladbrooks' men pass get them to clear it out"—Ladbrooks are brushmakers, they used to burn all the refuse in their furnace—they were cleared out on one occasion; I smelt the unpleasant smell again as they accumulated—I only spoke about the smell on one occasion, to my knowledge—at the latter end of July, 1874, Henry Wainwright showed me a revolver; it was in the counting-house at 84, he took it from his desk, it was in a green baize bag; it had five or six chambers, I could not say, it was about 9 or 10 inches long, including the barrel—he asked me to pawn it—he said "I am short this week, I bought it of Sawyer, I gave 6. for it; get 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it"—he did not tell me where to pawn it—it had no case to it—I said these sort of things usually had a case of fittings, and I did not believe they would take it in—he said "<hi rend="italic">Yes</hi>, they will"—I then left 84 and took the pistol with me in thegreen baize bag to a pawnbroker in Mile End Koad—I am not sure which pawnbroker it was as there are two close together—I offered it in pledge, but was only offered 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., so I took it back to 84, and told Henry Wainwright so; he put it in his desk and I have not seen it since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—we lived from July to November, 1874, at the upper part of 84, Whitechapel Road—while I was there a young woman, whom I knew as Mrs. King, came to the house to visit Henry Wainwright—I have seen her there on several occasions with him at the end of the shop and in the counting-house, which was at the end of the shop; I have seen her in the shop, I cannot say whether she has remained there—I have seen her sitting in the room with him as I have passed through the shop, but I have not heard what they said when they were together—one evening I heard loud talking, but I did not hear what was said; it appeared to me as if they were quarrelling—the particular evening I am speaking of was about the beginning of September—I heard the talking for some minutes; I saw her go out that night, through the fanlight of the door, and Henry Wainwright followed immediately after—I remember on another occasion hearing a noise or disturbance at No. 84—it was in August, as far as far as I can recollect; I cannot say the exact date—I heard loud voices in the shop, and the words "Don't! don't!"in a woman's voice in a loud tone, and then Henry Wainwright called my husband—the voice was in the shop—my husband went downstairs—it was after the shop was closed, after 8 o'clock—immediately afterwards the shop door shut; I heard it slam, and Henry Wainwright went out, I believe—soon after that the bell rang and I went downstairs and answered the door, and Henry Wainwright came in; but before 1 opened the door I saw the door in the passage which leads to the shop, open—I looked into the shop and saw Mrs. King lying on the floor, but I did not go in, I went and opened the door—'Henry Wainwright came in—i said "Mr. Wainwright, there is a woman lying on the shop floor"—he. said "Oh, is there? she has only fainted; will you give me a little vinegar, please?"—I returned upstairs and brought some vinegar down and saw the</p>

This was between 5 and 7 o'clock in the evening—I only get at the date by the book, you—will find the date of the year on the outside leaf of the book; inside—I put the date of month without the year—I read the entry as '"September 11th"—the second figure is much longer than the other—it look like <hi rend="italic">two</hi> strokes to me—I have said that I would not like to swear it was not the 19th—my employer copies from this book when he makes the bill out, perhaps a week or a fortnight after, perhaps longer—he copies it into a book of his own—I don't recollect saying that I would not swear it was not "17th"—my attention was called to the figures since I have been a witness, and I have looked at the figures—I don't think there is much doubt that there are two strokes—it cannot very well be the 17th, it does not look anything like a 7—we generally do Mr. Martin's work—he has two vans, and this was the largest—I am quite sure the job was not finished because something' was hot which induced me to call back my brother and Mr. Wiseman—the tyres were not on—the next entry is "oiling the big van"—we should oil the front wheels when we put on the tyres—we only had the front wheels off—the big van came to be oiled something less than every month, and then there would be a separate charge—we should make the entry in the book when the work was finished, and previous to its going out of the yard—we should put down the details—I cannot say how soon the van went home—it was in the yard when I went away—it went home the same night, or early in the morning before I got there—I had frequently heard shots fired in Mr. Pinnell's yard—I was a witness at the Inquest on the 1st October—that was the first time I gave evidence on oath—my brother William was called as the next witness to me—young Mr. Wiseman was not there—the charge against Henry Wainwright caused a great deal of excitement and gossip in the neighbourhood—before I recollected anything about this matter I heard that the surgeons had found bullets in the head of the remains—before I recollected that, a gentleman connected with a newspaper saw me and my brother at Wiseman's place and made inquiries without introducing himself—I do notthink he asked me whether I remembered hearing any shots, nor did he ask my brother in my presence—I have said "I did hear the surgeon say that bullets were found in the head of the deceased, and a gentleman from the newspaper asked me if I recollected hearing any shots fired, and I said "No;' then walked out of the shop, that was on Friday"—that was true, I did not remember at the moment, I was busy with the work, and did not stop to talk to him—I know he was connected with a newspaper because he called on the Saturday a second time, and told me so—I was not there when he asked my brother, but when he came again on the Saturday my brother and I were there, and he spoke to old Mr. Wiseman, and to my brother—it was my brother who first recollected about the shots—I do not know that before he recollected it he said that he did not recollect it—my brother and I and young Mr. Wiseman, might have had half-a-dozen words about it after that, if that is what you cull talking it over, but we did not do so to my recollection—Sergeant Forster called on me, and after that I talked it over with my brother and young Wiseman—I told Forster that my brother recollected it first, and I then did—that was before I was examined at the Inquest—if! recollect rightly I bind that the</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oilman carrying on business at 214, Whitechapel Road, next door to Wainwright's, and did so in September, last year—I have a pistol, a small single barrelled one, only a toy, I have it in my pocket; it is not a revolver; I have been in the habit of firing it in my back yard—I have fired it several times a day frequently, with small bullets and cartridges, for amusement—I generally kept it hanging up in my shop e—I have known Henry Wainwright for many years as a neighbour—I re<lb></lb>member Friday 10th September of this year, I was in my shop and he came in about 11 o'clock or 11.30 in the morning, and asked for some cord—I sold him eight yards, for which he paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and took it away—it was the day previous to his apprehension, I recollect it perfectly—it was rope similar to that produced, but I cannot swear to it.</p>

I have had this pistol four or five years—I have been in the habit of practicing with it from time to time during the whole of that period—it loads with a cartridge in the breech, you can load it pretty quickly—I had nothing particular to fire at, I fired at anything I happened to see, merely for amusement—I did not use it at night—very probably I might fire a dozen or half a dozen shots—I keep the cartridges in my pocket, you simply lift up the hammer and put the cartridge in.</p>

               <p>we carried on business in partnership from November, 1873, to January, 1874, as brushmakers at 84 and 215, Whitechapel Road—I did not reside in either of the premises—my clerk, Mr. West, resided in the house portion of 215 till about 15th July, 1874—the partnership was dissolved on 8th of January, 1874—after July 1874 I believe 215 remained unoccupied for some time—after the partnership was dissolved I acted as receiver under the Court of Chancery in getting in the estate—I took possession of the keys of both 84 and 215—I examined the property on the premises; there was a private office at 84 on the first floor—I and my partner had the use of that—I afterwards examined the desks and other things in the office, and in one of the drawers I found a packet of bullets, in a small tin box, or a brown paper parcel—it was in a drawer of one of the pedestal desks I had both keys of that desk—they were conical-pin fire bullets, bullet and cartridge together—I passed them over to Henry Wainwright as I found them—he said they were his—I have not seen them since—I have a revolver of my own; I have here a bullet belonging to it—I never sold a revolver to Henry Wainwright—I should say the bullets Henry Wain-wright took away were a size larger than mine—here was another desk downstairs in the counting-house of which he had the key—he had that exclusively to himself—I allowed him to have that key because he had his own papers there—I never opened that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor—in September, 1874, Henry Wainwright was introduced to me and some money was lent to him through me by a client; as security for which I took a mortgage on the premises 215 and 84, Whitechapel Road, and some life policies also formed part of the security—I have the mortgage deed with me—sometime in 1875, about May or June, I wrote to him about the repayment of the money, and I have no doubt I also spoke to him about it—it was to have been repaid in the early part of the year—I threatened to eject him, and I issued a writ of adjustment; but at his request I never served it—I took possession of 215 as soon as I saw that he was a bankrupt—I saw the ad<lb></lb>vertisement of the appointment of a trustee in July—I put a man named Albert Francois in possession on 14th July, 1875—afterwards, on the 18th July, I put Mrs. Izzard in possession; the authority was to her husband, but I always saw her—he was recommended to me by a constable in the police force—Mrs. Izzard brought me the key either on the 31st July or 1st September—when I got possession I instructed a bill to be put in the shop window at 215 to advertise the place—I also instructed Frangois to paint and fix large boards outside—I never saw the bill; I saw the board announcing that the premises were to be sold, and application to be made to me—I think it was "The lease of these premises to be sold "apply to me at such an address—the lease was sold in the early part of October.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now an invoice clerk to Messrs. Venables Son, of Whitechapel—I have known Thomas Wainwright eighteen months—I entered into his service in January of this year as an assistant—he opened the business of an ironmonger's at the Hen and Chickens; the house had been closed before—I was the only person in his service at that time—a stock of goods was brought into the premises—I remained with him four or five months, until the latter end of June—during that time I have occa<lb></lb>sionally seen Henry Wainwright there, perhaps five times; I never saw them there together—goods passed from one to the other—I remember an execution being put in, a man being put in possession about the middle of May—there was a sale after that, in June—the sale was under the control of Mr. George Lewis, who is an accountant in the Borough—Herrick's man was in possession (the auctioneer)—the door was fastened by a padlock out<lb></lb>side to which there were two keys—after the sale a new padlock was put on, I believe, by Mr. Lewis' instructions and he had the key of it, which he kept at his place; I do not believe there was more than one key to that padlock—after the sale, the business at the Hen and Chickens was discontinued, and all the things were cleared away, and I left—I went into Mr. Lewis' employ temporarily—from the time of the sale I remained there almost a fortnight—at that time the key of the padlock was 'in Mr. Lewis' place—Thomas Wainwright came to Mr. Lewis' a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> days after I had been there and asked me for the key of the Borough, (meaning the Hen and Chickens), Mr. Lewis was out, but I gave it him—he asked me if I would have a glass of stout, and afterwards with Thomas Wainwright I met Mr. Lewis—I went into the office while Mr. Lewis and Mr. Wainwright had some conversation which I did not hear—I told Mr. Lewis I had given the key to Thomas Wainwright—on the following Friday I saw Thomas Wainwright again, but nothing passed about the key—I noticed a change in his appearance, he had some hair missing from his face; I do not exactly remember whether it was his moustache or any hair shaved off here—in his ordinary appearance, he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220064"></xptr>
               <p>wore a slight moustache, not particularly light, nor yet particularly dark—I do not remember whether he wore whiskers or beard; he used to shave, and the difference in his hair was parting it down the middle—this is the key of the padlock, to the best of my belief, that I gave to Thomas Wainwright.</p>

Rowlandson, of 83, Whitechapel Road, upholsterers—I have known Henry Wainwright seventeen or eighteen years—on the 10th September of the present year from 1 to 2 o'clock, I saw him at our shop, he asked for two yards of thick leather cloth, and I supplied him with it, it was common black American cloth, the commonest we have—the price of it was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—he did not say what he wanted it for—I have been shown the American cloth by Inspector Fox, it was similar in quantity and colour to that, just the same.</p>

I am a clerk in the Bankruptcy Court—I produce the file of the proceedings there with reference to the affairs of Henry Wainright—there was a proceeding for the liquidation of his affairs in 1874, the first instalment in seven days—there was a meeting on 15th May, 1874, at which a resolution was come to to accept 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in seven days, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. within a period of three months, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. within a period of sis months from that time—on 30th June there were proceedings in bankruptcy by a petitioning creditor, and Wainwright was declared bankrupt—those proceedings are pending still—the dissolution of partnersnip was on 10th July, 1875, and Robert A M'Cleaa was appointed trustee.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Red Lion Square—I have made handwriting my study, and I have had a large experience, extending over many years—I have examined letter E and the documents placed in my hands, together with one headed "Statement of Facts," written and signed by Thomas Wainwright—the papers I have before me are the Statement of Facts, numbered 1; a letter from Thomas Wainwright to Mrs. E. Lewis; another letter, signed Thomas Wainwright, dated Wednesday evening, May 29th, 1875; a letter signed "Thomas Geo. Wainwright," which is dated July 26th, 1875, it does not say to whom written; and a letter dated November 21st, 1874, to Mr. George Lewis, signed "T. Wainwright"—I have not seen the memorandum dated May 29th before—those documents are all in the same writing, and there is no doubt in my mind that the person who wrote the letter E wrote these other documents—I can point out a number of instances of similarity between them—letter E, in my opinion, is not dis<lb></lb>guised, it is in a natural handwriting, and is no doubt the <hi rend="italic">bond-fide</hi> writing of the person who wrote it.

               <p>17 the word too is characteristic—besides the characteristic letters in the two documents I am quite satisfied that the general character of the writing is the same—I cannot rely wholly upon it but it is an element in my con<lb></lb>sideration that there is a similarity between the one and the other—it is good writing but of a common stamp—I did not take those two letters and form an opinion at once,; but there is a strong resemblance, so that they appear to be the writing of one person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in practice at 44, Trinity Square—on Saturday, 11th September, at 5.30 in the afternoon, I was called in to see the remains of a human body—I was shown two parcels containing the remains of a female—I made a short examination then, and on the Monday I gave some evidence about them—some portions were in a mummyfied state, dry and shrunken, and some in a state known as <hi rend="italic">adipo-cere</hi>, decomposed and moist—the parts had been separated very an scientifi<lb></lb>cally—the body was divided into ten parts; the head and neck one part, the two hands, two arms, one trunk, two thighs, and two legs and feet. connected—some portion of the pelvis was absent—I noticed that on the first occasion fragments of the pelvis were attached to the thighs, and a por<lb></lb>tion of the knee-cap was attached to the right thigh—a part of the knee<lb></lb>cap was also connected with the left leg—at my first examination I noticed the hair; there was dried blood upon it—the body had been recently divided—I could not at that time form an opinion as to how long it had been dead, no more than a long time—I made another examination early on Monday morning, the 13th, before giving my evidence, simply to identify the parts as constituting one entire body—I found that the parts put together made up a body—I did nothing more on that occasion—I made another partial examination on the 14th with Mr. Smith; simply to remove the viscera, and I then observed a cut in the throat—I removed all the viscera except the brain, which was in such a soft watery condition that I could not remove it—I put each viscous into a separate glass jar, which had been thoroughly cleaned out with distilled water, for any possible subsequent examination; they were scaled up and I locked them up in the vestry and kept the key—on the 16th I made an examination together with Mr. Bond—I formed an</p>

               <p>opinion that the woman was about 25 years of age, from the condition of the wisdom teeth; all the wisdom teeth were cut except one, which was evidently being cut at the time—she was of a slender make, about 5 feet in height; the hands and feet were proportionately small with the other frame of the body; I mean they were small for the body—in order to ascertain the height we put the parts as nearly in position as possible, and repeatedly measured them—the cutting up had been done very roughly and very recently—it must have been done by some chopping instrument—I have seen the chopper produced; it might be done by such an instrument—I could not say that a knife had not been used; it might have been used for some parts—there was a very great deal of dirt on the body mixed with chloride of lime—chloride of lime thrown upon a body would tend to pre<lb></lb>serve the external parts more especially—it is a disinfectant, and I believe it has a tendency to preserve anything put upon it; it retards the decom<lb></lb>position of those parts with which it comes in contact—its principal agency is to deodorize—I found no quick-lime—we found a fracture of the skull, just behind and nearly level with the top of the right ear; that was an old fracture—on inspecting the interior of the skull we found a bullet in the back part of the brain in the portion known as the cerebellum—that corre<lb></lb>sponded with the fracture—we could trace the course of the fracture to the place where we found the bullet—we also found a second bullet lying on the base of the skull on a part known as the sphenoid bone, and by tracing the direction of that bullet outwards we found another hole or fracture in the skull, just in front and nearly level with the top of the same ear, just above that prominence of bone which every one can feel, called the zeugmatic arch—one of those bullets had certainly entered the head during life; the one behind the ear—I was led to that conclusion by the extravasation of blood underneath the scalp for a considerable distance around the wound, having a diameter of at least two inches, and also slightly within the skull in the direction in which the bullet had gone—that led me to the conclusion that the bullet had entered the head during life, whilst the circulation was active—there was not so much appearance with regard to the second bullet—there was slight extravasation underneath the scalp—my inference from that would be that the first bullet had pene<lb></lb>trated the brain during life, and the second when the first had so far pro<lb></lb>duced its effect that life was fast ebbing—either of those shots was quite sufficient to account for death, not necessarily instantaneously—I have read of a remarkable case where a person might still live with a bullet in the brain—it would not necessarily destroy life instantaneously, but I should conclude that ultimately it would cause death if it lodged there a sufficient time for an abscess to be formed—a person might live till then—it would be enough to cause death, and might cause it instantaneously—we next turned our attention to the cut throat—it was a cut from right to left, just beyond the medial line on the right side of the neck, across the neck to a point about opposite the angle of the lower jaw on the left side—it had severed all the structures from the wind-pipe down to the vertebra—it ex<lb></lb>tended about two inches upwards and backwards, below, and opposite the angle of the lower jaw; it must have severed the carotid artery; it was too dry to dissect those parts carefully—that cut must have been made either immediately before or immediately after death—I was led to that conclusion by the extravasation of blood in and about the part—the extravasation implies that the circulation is still going on, because had it been done at a</p>

               <p>time very remote from death it could not have taken place, because it would have been congealed; the blood would not have been circulating—it is only while the blood is in a fluid state that extravasation of it can take place—that would be a wound quite sufficient to cause death in a few-seconds, or rather I ought to say in a minute or two—it was an old cut—I took off a pad from the back of the head and took it home and examined it, and in that I found a third bullet, sticking very closely to it; there was an immense quantity of hairpins in the pad—I also took home a piece of velvet ribbon—the hair pins were bent, broken, and rusty—there was an innumerable quantity of them all over the pad, enough to have arrested the passage of the bullet—the pad itself would help to do it, and of course the hair pins also—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the pad and the ribbon—the velvet was in a very rotten state, more especially that part which had been saturated with blood—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the three bullets—we gave them to Inspector Fox—I gave the one found in the pad, and Mr. Bond gave the others—this is the one I found in the pad; they are of a different shape—these are the two found in the head; the flattened one is the posterior one, that might be done from the way in which it entered the skull—they are both somewhat out of shape; but the other not so much—the one found in the pad is almost flattened, more so than either—Mr. Bond and I made a little examination of the remains to endeavour to ascertain whether the woman had borne a child, and I subsequently made a further examination myself—I did not minutely examine the hair I took some of it away with me, washed it and gave it to inspector Fox—the washing made it a little lighter, reasonably lighter—I noticed that one tooth was decayed down level with the gum, or jaw and only one, as far as I could see—it was the next behind the eye tooth on the right side—from its position I think it might have been visible when she laughed or smiled—there were some teeth missing—with the exception of the one tooth I should call it a good set of teeth; the remaining incisor tooth at the top indicated that it might have been slightly prominent—I could only see the remains of one ear—I could see that that had been pierced for an earring—I think I have now described the various matters to which my attention was directed on the 16th, when I was with Mr. Bond—I made several subsequent examinations for the purpose of ascertaining whether the woman had borne a child, the result of which gave me a very strong idea that the uterus was that of a person who had been a mother—I should speak nearly as positively now as I should if the body had not been in a state of decomposition—I give my opinion; I won't go further than that—my attention was not at first directed to any alleged scar on the <hi rend="italic">leg</hi>; not until I heard it in the police-court from Mr. Lane; I can't recollect the date; it was when he was examined before the Magistrate—I was there—the body was in such a state from decomposition that it would have been per<lb></lb>fectly impossible for any one to have found the scar unless diligent search was made for it—after Mr. Lane had given his evidence Mr. Bond and I made an examination for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was a scar or not; we made that examination in the presence of Mr. Aubyn, a surgeon, who was there on behalf of Henry Wainwright; we first examined the left <hi rend="italic">leg</hi>, and then the right, and we found a scar on the right leg, about four inches below the middle of the knee—it was very much puckered; it was an elongated scar, about as big as a shilling the scar itself, but the puckering was much bigger, that is, the way the skin was drawn such a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220078"></xptr>
               <p>scar could have resulted from some hot material; a red hot poker falling on the place would very possibly produce it—I afterwards heard Mr. Lane and Mrs. Taylor examined before the Coroner—I had not said anything about the scar I had discovered before they had given their evidence—I purposely said nothing about it—I think Mr. Lane, before the Magistrate, had de<lb></lb>scribed it as on the outside of the leg; he thought it was the right—I have seen a pair of boots produced by Inspector Fox—I have compared one with the corresponding foot, and in my opinion it would fit—I went to 215, Whitechapel Road—I saw some remains of stains on the flags; but I could not say what they were; they might have been produced by chopping up the body—I found a tooth in the parcel containing the remains, and others Mr. Bond had given him—both the upper incisors were missing from the mouth, I think the left eye tooth on the upper jaw, and I think both the lower incisors; but they were found and replaced—that left the only missing teeth the left lower incisor and the right upper incisor, they have never been found—I think four were found, two are missing—when the gums are in a dried state the teeth are very apt to fall out—it would net require any violence—those teeth had come out since death—upon a rough idea I should say the woman had been dead from nine to twelve months—chloride of lime would be apt to retard the progress of decompo<lb></lb>sition—I don't think it would affect the viscera—it would affect the ex<lb></lb>ternal parts, and I don't say it might not to a certain extent affect the v is cream.</p>

I am speaking roughly when I say death might have occurred from nine to twelve months—it is impossible to give the exact date—when I say extravasation, oozing perhaps would be the correct term—there may be extravasation of venous as well as arterial blood; venous blood will not coagulate in some subjects—I do not know of in<lb></lb>stances of blood extravagating and coagulating four days after death, or two days—I have not directed my studies to that subject very minutely—the head was in a similar condition to the rest of the body, it was not more decomposed than the rest; it was in an advanced stage of decomposition—I think more of the body was mummyfied than in a greasy state; <hi rend="italic">adipocere</hi> means a greasy state—in the stage <hi rend="italic">adipocere</hi> gases may be evolved; I have not gone into that; I have heard of it, so that the gases may actually be burnt; I am aware by my reading that that is scientifically true—I should not think that the stage is well defined between the period when gases are evolved and <hi rend="italic">adipocere</hi>—I could not say when gases cease to be evolved from a dead body—I have never had such a case as this before; I have never had such an examination to make—I have never examined a dead body in that state of decomposition—I made extensive reports of my examinations, adding piece by piece as I went on—I think I had made about four exami-nations before the scar examination—I think Mr. Bond was present at one or two of those examinations—I did not see him cut out the scar from the leg; I did not see Mr. Aubyn cut out a small portion of the other leg, but I heard him say that he should—he called my attention to the idea that there might be a scar on the other leg, what he said might be a scar—I make no doubt that slight examinations and all, I have made twelve ex<lb></lb>aminations, either of the remains or portions of them—they were very dirty and dark—a small portion of flesh was left on the right side of the face, but all the soft parts were decayed—the eyes were in a very shrunken condition and sunk to the buck of the sockets—it was quite impossible for any one to</p>

               <p>recognise the features unless it was the cheek bones—I should have thought that chloride of lime would tend to bleach the parts, but have made no ex<lb></lb>periments to know—the scalp was not entire; a great deal of the back of it was there, but not all of it, especially where the wound was; it was drawn back—there was the most scalp where the wounds were, at the orifice of entrance; but perhaps I am not quite right in saying that at that spot there was more—the scalp at the two orifices was capable of being dissected surgi<lb></lb>cally, more especially one wound, at the front orifice—the orifice behind the ear was an elongated fracture—the bone was not carried completely away, the back part of it was pressed inwards, but it was not gone; there were very, very slight fragments—the other was perforated and nearly round—some of the bone was carried away—the brain was in such a pulpy state that I did not like to remove it, and in following the course of the bullets I only fol<lb></lb>lowed the direction of the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, the covering of the brain—I should be guided by a little mark on the skull internally, where the bullet seems to have struck and rebounded—it was by looking at the orifice and drawing lines to the other side, and by the manner in which it had entered the skull that I came to a conclusion—in gun-shot wounds death may arise from a shock to the system or from hemorrhage—I have not studied gun-shot wounds, but I can only imagine those to be the modes of death—I think it is possible that there are instances of a man living sir days with a bullet in the brain—it is quite possible for a person to cry out on receiving a bullet in the brain—I do not know that men have shot themselves through the brain, cried out, and purposely placed themselves in a studied attitude afterwards—if a person had delivered—two, or even three shots within three seconds I cannot pledge myself that death would necessarily result after the first shot—I cannot fix myself to these exceptional cases; I only give it as my opinion that the extravasation being less in one line than the other the lesser one was the more likely one than the more extensive one; I do not say "in one line" but round by the scalp—I cannot say so as a matter of fact, but what I contend is that if the first wound behind the ear had been inflicted shortly after death, or closely after death, I think it would have been perfectly impossible for the bullet to have got so far under the scalp as it evidently had done in this case—the diameter was about 2 inches extending inwards—the extravasation extended 2 inches on the surface to the depth of the 16th of an inch; the adjacent parts were lacerated—I could not point to the exact spot in the scalp where the bullet had got to the skull, because the scalp was retracted—I have formed a conclusion from some exterior appearances and the slight extravasation internally; very slight—I could not say whether the bullet in the head was the first, second, or third shot; it is impossible—the cut in the throat may have been done with an ordinary knife—I am not quite clear as to the extent of that cut into the vertebra¦—why I am inclined to the opinion that the body was that of a person who had borne a child, is because the measurements of the uterus were greater than those acknowledged to be the measurements of a virgin uterus—virgin uteruses of adult women are very much the same in measurement, also in weight and in general size, provided they are healthy—the external measurement of a virgin uterus, including the sub<lb></lb>stance: the extreme length would be about 2 1/4 inches to 2 3/4 inches, and the breadth about an inch and a third, while this uterus that I examined was, as near as possible, 3 inches, and its breadth about 2 1/2 inches—another reason for my opinion is the thinness of the walls—I should say, taken</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220080"></xptr>
               <p>conjointly, the front wall and the back wall of a virgin uterus would measure about an inch, 1/2 an inch one side and 1/2 an inch the other—there is no cavity; the surfaces lie flat—after child-bearing the walls become thinner, and as near as I could say the measurement of the walls of this uterus were five-eigthths of an inch—I think it is not a fact that the walls get thicker after child-bearing, I certainly shall not admit it; I cannot explain why they should get thinner; I adhere to my opinion; perhaps it is not worth much—another ground for my opinion is, that I have compared this uterus with the several uteri in the museum of Guy's Hospital, both those of the virgin and those of persons who have borne children, and it is certainly inconsistent to think it is that of a virgin, because it is so unlike all what I see there of virgin uteri—another reason is, the condition of the walls of the abdomen—in the state of decomposition it was possible for me to form an inference—I do not give positive testimony to any of it—at the lower part of the abdomen I observed what appeared to be a scarred-like surface, a whitish colour, and lower down the decomposition had progressed very rapidly in between what appeared to be little cicatrices, little scars, and as the surface of the abdomen would be there a little irregular, uneven, I can quite under<lb></lb>stand that the decomposition would in between those scarred places have gone on more rapidly; that is the only inference—I gather from all this that after a woman had borne a child, of course the abdomen being very much stretched during pregnancy (especially the latter months of preg<lb></lb>nancy), when the child is born, of course it leaves the abdomen in a flabby condition, and these scars are the result of that, the contraction of the abdomen to a certain extent—this appearance is just as consistent with a person who has suffered in their lifetime from fever or dropsy, but I take it in conjunction with what I have observed else where—if I had had the best opportunity of noticing what are called cicatricies, I should not have formed any different opinion—I met two or three gentlemen with the uteri at Guy's Hospital, once before I was cross-examined at the Southwark police-court—I did not find any hair on other parts of the body besides the head to recognise it—I have not made any experiments as to the effect of chloride of lime respecting its colour—I think it would be a natural inference to find a furrowed finger if a woman had worn a wedding ring for three or four years—I do not say that the hands in this case were unusually preserved; they were certainly not in such a state that you could trace the furrow of a wedding ring—I made a very careful examination for that purpose, but I could not see anything—it might possibly be traced on a fresh subject—the condition of the hand was similar to the rest in its greasy state—the boots were never put on the feet; I judge from the size of the feet, they measured as near as possible 8 1/2 inches from the very top of the great <hi rend="italic">toe</hi> nail to the back of the heel; I cannot say. that the feet were very much smaller than I should expect to find in a person of 5 feet 1 inch in height, but they were not larger, there are plenty of women of 5 feet 1 inch with <hi rend="italic">feet</hi> like that; I have measured the boots, they are as near as possible 9 inches long—I did not measure either hand—the uterus weighed as near as possible 12 drachms, and one source says that a virgin uterus weighs 8 drachms—Dr. Alfred Meadows is an authority who differs; he says in his book from 8 to 12 drachms—I mean the gentleman sitting there, he is an acknowledged authority and the only anthority who bears that out—I have referred to authorities during this examination—I took the measure went of the body from head to feet, independently of Mr. Bond, and as accn<lb></lb>rately</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220081"></xptr>
               <p>as I could; I made it 5 feet—I do not say that on the supposition of death many months previously and decomposition at that stage having set in, the length would be rather in excess of that during life, but it might be—I can understand that the decayed tooth could be seen if she laughed very much, and in smiling it must have been seen—I do not know whether that is one of the teeth the least covered with enamel, or whether that tooth is the first to decay in fifty people out of a hundred—the two incisors did not project very much, but very slightly—I should not describe the whole of the upper set of teeth as projecting very much, I do not say that by any means; there was nothing extraordinary about the teeth, except that the central incisors were slightly prominent—I have been qualified five years this month.</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I live at 50, Parliament Street, Westminster, and am assistant-surgeon to the Westminster Hospital, and lecturer on forensic medicine at the hospital—on the 16th September last I saw the remains of this body at the dead house—Mr. Larkin was present—the body was that of a female of short stature, about 5 feet in height, of slender make, limbs, and body; I thought she was from twenty to twenty-five years of age, and that the body had been dead many months; she might certainly have been dead as long as twelve months-—the hands were slender and covered with a greasy substance; the skin underneath was dry and shrunken; the feet were in the same condition—I think if there had been any deep furrow from wearing a wedding ring I should have found it, I looked to find it and did not notice one; I do not think I could have found a slight furrow—the the hand was a very slight one, the fingers were very thin—a wedding ring would obviously make a deeper furrow on a fat hand than on a thin one—I do not know whether the furrow would remain if the ring was discontinued for a time—the feet were slender and the skin dried, and in the same con<lb></lb>dition as the hands—I have seen these boots and am distinctly of opinion that they could have been worn by the deceased—I found four teeth absent on my first examination; those in the head were all sound, with the excep<lb></lb>tion of one, that was the first bicuspid of the upper jaw, which was decayed almost to the bone—I have seen that tooth decayed in persons when they laughed—there was no means of telling whether the mouth was small, as the features were quite gone—in the upper jaw the left wisdom tooth was still uncut; I exposed it by cutting away the mucous membrane—I noticed that the one remaining upper incisor was prominent, when my attention had been called to it by Mr. Aubyn—the marks upon the body where it was cut appeared to be comparatively fresh, but the throat had been cut for a long time; it commenced at the thyroid cartilage, which is the top of the wind<lb></lb>pipe, the larynx in fact: it commenced at the left ear and reached as far as the angle of the lower jaw from right to left; the arteries and part of the windpipe were severed—I cannot say that that was done during life, but I believe it was, or very soon after death—I believe it was done at a long period anterior to my seeing it; it was a wound which would require considerable force, and it would undoubtedly occasion death—I examined the head and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220082"></xptr>
               <p>hand—Mr. Larkin described the fracture behind the right car; he described it quite correctly—I agree with him that it was an old fracture—I found a bullet in the head—I was able to trace its course from the place where the fracture was behind the ear, and it lodged in the cerebellum—I can say that it must have entered the brain during life—I am led to that opinion by the blood, which was extravasated under the scalp and likewise under the dura mater, which is the lining of the skull—blood was extravasated under the scalp for a circumference of about three inches, and to the depth of about one-sixteenth of an inch into the substance of the scalp—I afterwards found a second bullet in the base of the skull lying on the spheroid bone—I traced the course of it outwards, and in doing so I found a fracture of the skull just at the front of the right ear—that was an old fracture—I formed the opinion that that bullet had entered during life or immediately after death—there was extravasation of blood under the scalp, but not to so great extent as where the first bullet had entered—I form the opinion that the posterior bullet entered first from the greater amount of extrava<lb></lb>sation, and what is more important, from the extravasation inside the skull—either of those bullets entering the skull and lodging there would in my judgment cause immediate death—it would be quite impossible after the bullet had entered her head for her to have cut her own throat, and if her throat was cut first it would be absolutely impossible for her to have fired the shots—I am inclined to the opinion that the uterus had been impreg<lb></lb>nated, and more than that, that the woman had borne children, but I believe it is quite impossible to give a positive opinion by the inspection of the uterus—when I examined the body on 16th September I found no scar; no scar could be seen in the state in which the legs then were to the eye of a person unskilled in such matters—I was at Southwark police-court when Mr. Lane, the father, was examined—I heard him make a statement in the witness-box, in consequence of which I made a special examination for the purpose of finding a scar—I examined the left leg first—it was necessary to scrape off the greasy matter first—I found no scar—I then scraped and examined the right <hi rend="italic">leg</hi>, and found a scar on the outer side of the leg, about two inches below the head of the fibula—that would make it about three inches below the joint of the knee—it was a very distinct scar, about the size of a shilling—it was elongated from above downwards and slightly backwards, thick and fibrous—the skin was puckered a good deal in front of it, and was white at the back part of it; that describes it accurately—it was perfectly consistent with the appearance of a burn from a hot poker; that would be likely to have produced it—I cut the piece out—it is mounted—I have it in my pocket—it is mounted (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—the cut which I made goes direct through it—I think the bullets are conical—I weighed them—the first weighed 66 grains; that is the one that entered by the back; the one partially flattened—the second weighed 78 grains, and the third, which Mr. Larkin found, weighed 82 grains—in coining in contact with the bone it would strip some of the lead—I know from ex<lb></lb>perience that lead is lost when striking a bone—I saw the hair—I went to 215, Whitechapel Road; before I went there I noticed marks of chloride of lime and earth on the remains, and at 215 I found chloride of lime mixed with earth—there were lumps of it—I have been shown a quantity of it picked out by Inspector Fox—I took some of it away and examined it—it was chloride of lime—I did not find any hair in the grave; I saw some on the shovel—I took some of those and compared them with some of the</p>

               <p>hair from the body with a microscope—they corresponded in colour and substance, and in the marking of the medullar substance—I was shown, some hair by Inspector Fox—I examined that in the same way with a microscope, and that also corresponded with the hair from the body—I saw the chopper at the station—it looked dirty, and it smelt very like the re<lb></lb>mains—I did not notice any trace of dog's or cat's mess on it—that chopper might have been used for roughly cutting up the body—I saw marks on the stone, and a piece of broken stone, and there was a faint outline of smears—the marks on the stone were undoubtedly recent bits chopped off the edge, and one piece chopped off one large corner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. In the process of decomposition gases are evolved very soon after death; I believe to such an extent that flame can be kindled with them, sometimes in a much shorter period than a month or six weeks, sometimes in two or three days—I am of opinion that the remains were those of a woman who had borne a child, because the cavity of the uterus was large in proportion to the thinness of the walls; that was my reason then for that opinion; there were no indications to lead me to a contrary opinion—I have since had another reason for thinking she had had a child; I have had the uterus soaked and it has swelled to at least three times the size that it was when I first examined it, and now the walls have become very much thicker and the whole organ heavier and larger than the healthy uterus of a virgin; the inference I draw from that is that the uterus was then about its proper size; when I first examined it it was exceedingly shrunken and dry—I differ from Mr. Larkin that the bearing of children thins the walls I think it thickens them—the soaking process commenced after my first examination, after the first evidence at the police-court and after I was examined at the inquest, within—a day or two—Mr. Larkin soaked it; I did not—he told me it was soaked in spirit and water—I saw it in the spirit and water—I believe it has been kept there ever since—I did not measure the walls before the soaking process, they were very thin, a little thinner than thick brown paper—I have measured the whole uterus since the soaking process, not the thickness of the walls—my measurement of the whole uterus was just over 3 inches long, and the width about 2 1/2 inches, and the thickness over an inch—the wisdom "teeth sometimes come late in life, sometimes over thirty years of age—I think it is impossible to fix the age of the person whose remains these were within ten years—I don't know that the decayed tooth is the one with least enamel and most subject to decay—I had an impression the other way, that the wisdom teeth were the first to decay, the last to come, and the first to go; such has been the case with me—chloride of lime takes away some colours—I don't know that it will take away colour from hair—I would not say it would not, but I don't think it would—it would take it from unstable colours—it undoubtedly retards decomposition—I was present when Mr. Aubyn took a piece from the other leg; I looked at it as he held it; I saw him cut it out; I examined it as he cut it out and as he held it in his hand; I am quite prepared to say that it had not a scar—I measured the height very exactly several times; I did not make her quite five feet; I made her 4 feet 11 inches and five-eighths; I think it was not one-eighth—if you will allow me to refer to my notes I can tell you <hi rend="italic">referring) I</hi> beg pardon, I was wrong, it is 4 feet 11 inches and one-eighth—I think the fact of death having occurred so long back as nine months would not lengthen the height; it would shorten it; I don't think to any great extent;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220084"></xptr>
               <p>it might to the extent of an inch; I was of the same opinion at the police court—I made four examinations altogether—the cut in the throat was done with great force—I am most undoubtedly of opinion that it was done by some other hand than that of the individual whose remains I saw—I cannot pledge myself to what period of time after death that injury was inflicted.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. I say that the deceased could not have fired the two bullets into the brain and after that cut the throat, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>, she could not have cut her own throat and then have fired the bullets into the brain—the force with which the cut was done is one reason why I say she could not have done it herself, and another reason is the direction it was not a direction in which a suicidal wound is caused; it has scarcely ever been found except in the case of a left-handed person; a person would not cut up in this way (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>); they would cut downwards with the right hand; the cut was carried deeply in under the jaw; it must have been commenced in the medial line; what I say is that, from the position of the cut, it could not have been done by the person herself unless she was left-handed; I have a very strong opinion that it could not have been inflicted recently, because of the retraction of the tissues and the great dryness of the tissues quite down to the bone.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I could not say positively at what date it was done—I say positively that to me it appeared not a recent cut; it was quite different from the other cuts I saw—as to a positive opinion, it is not for me to give it—when the muscles and ligaments are relaxed shortly after death, I believe persons measure more after death than in life—I have never actually found the measurement longer myself—I have not had occa<lb></lb>sion to do so; but I think it would be the reverse after the drying of the tissues—I think the inter-vertebral ligaments would shrink and the liga<lb></lb>ments retract—I am not able to give a definite opinion as to that from experiments, but I can tell you as a fact that all these tissues do contract—I know as a fact that immediately after death they relax, and retract when dryness takes place—I have not had occasion to examine remains in such an advanced stage of decomposition for the purpose of measuring height—I have disected bodies much longer decomposed, but I did not know them in life or measure them in life.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. I had some difficulty in put<lb></lb>ting the parts together so as to measure accurately—I was guided by the exact anatomical position of the parts—it is not on easy thing to get them exactly placed in position—I did it to the best of my ability—in the condition of the body that I examined the ligaments are contracted, and the inter-vertebral cartilages must have contracted from the extreme dry<lb></lb>ness, in fact 1 cut out the vertebra, so I know as a fact that they were con<lb></lb>tracted and dryed; I think it might make the difference of an inch—the wisdom teeth usually appear from 20 to 25, and even earlier sometimes—as to the cut in the throat, I cannot say whether it was inflicted during life, or im<lb></lb>mediately after death—there was nothing to lead me to tell which—there was nothing to lead me to say that it was not inflicted during life—there was blood around the cut, but I can't say that that blood came from the cut—it might have come from the gunshot wounds—if I had seen blood in the cut I should have said that it must have been done during life, or otherwise before the circulation had ceased—the cut extended just to the left oar, and the ear around that particular part was exceedingly much clotted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220085"></xptr>
               <p>with blood directly at the end of the cut, but I cannot tell whether it came from the cut or the other wounds—the blood from the wounded head might have flowed over—if I could have traced the blood to the cut and nothing else, then I should have been certain that it must have been in<lb></lb>flicted during life, or before the circulation bad ceased—I saw no blood in the cut; the cut commenced on the right hand side, in the cartilage, and it went deeper and deeper until it got very deep, quite under the angle of the lower jaw—in my opinion it was a cut upwards, because the only way <hi rend="italic">to make</hi> it downwards would be quite to make a slanting cut under the jaw and then draw it down, which would be a very unlikely thing to do; in my opinion it went from the center of the throat up, under the left angle of the lower jaw, going deeper as it went on towards the left ear; the head was severed from the trunk lower down, underneath the cut; the cut had nothing to do with the severance from the trunk—there was greater extra<lb></lb>vasation below the scalp where the first bullet had entered, and below the dura mater than the other—I think the pistol-shot wound would produce death instantly—if it did, that would account for the less quantity of extravasation from the other wound.</p>

The heart would probably stop within a minute when death was caused by the shot—I have said that it is difficult by the inspec<lb></lb>tion of the uterus after death to form an opinion whether a woman has borne a child or not; but I should expect after child bearing to find the walls of the uterus thickened—that would <hi rend="italic">give</hi> me some material upon which to form a judgment; thickened walls is compatible with child bear<lb></lb>ing, but it is also compatible with inflammation of the uterus or other diseases of the uterus, therefore it would not be a safe inference—I should expect to find general enlargement and thickening of the walls of the uterus—I think no reliable judgment is to be formed as to whether a woman has had more than one child—I think that is impossible, because I do not believe it makes the slightest difference to the uterus whether she has borne one child or two or three—since the parts have been soaked they have become much thicker than they were; but I do not say much thicker than in a virgin uterus—the walls of the uterus of a woman who has borne children are not much thicker than a virgin uterus; but they are thicker—in my judgment it was impossible to form a confident opinion as to whether this woman had had one child or more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Physi<lb></lb>cians, a lecturer on midwifery at St. Mary's Hospital, and physician to St. Mary's Hospital—I have made obstetrics a considerable subject of study—I was present in Court yesterday during the examination of Mr. Larkin and Mr. Bond—I examined the uterus at my house on the 3rd September in order to form some opinion whether that uterus was that of a person who had borne a child—the points are principally two to which I look for the purpose of forming that opinion to determine the question, and they are the size and as to the cavity of the walls, but more particularly the shape of the uterine walls; the walls in the present case were exceptionally thin, instead of being, as I should expect to find them, somewhat thicker than an unimpreg<lb></lb>nated uterus—at the time I saw the uterus it was in a liquid of some kind, I believe spirit and water—with regard to the second point, I found the walls of the uterus projected in a convex manner into the uterine cavity—it is not possible to express any distinct opinion as to whether the uterus had had been pregnant or not; my opinion, considering the points mentioned, is that the uterus had not been pregnant—it is not possible, with any accu<lb></lb>racy, to form an opinion as to the age, owing to the decomposition and the long time the body is supposed to have been buried—chloride of lime is called a decolorer I have no experience as to its effect—I think it possibly might reduce black hair to a light shade—it would undoubtedly have a bleach<lb></lb>ing effect.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. I did not examine the body of this woman at all—I should probably endeavour to find out the age by the teeth; I am not aware that it could be found out in any other way; wisdom teeth make their appearance from twenty, perhaps a little before, to twenty-five or twenty-six; they vary a good deal—I am not sure that I should come to the conclusion that a woman was not over twenty-five if I saw her dead body and from whose jaw the wisdom tooth was just protrud<lb></lb>ing, probably I might—I do not think it could be stated with certainty that the uterus of a woman recently dead had been impregnated—the walls were convex, which is certainly not due to the muscular degeneration—there was muscular degeneration <hi rend="italic">very</hi> considerably; the whole mass was very flaccid,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220087"></xptr>
               <p>but not at all difficult to measure; I measured it—the uterine cavity was 2 1/2 inches—I only speak of two measurements, the other was one inch and a third in depth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">He-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. I measured each wall separately; the ante rior wall was a little under a quarter of an inch, and the posterior wall a little over a quarter of an inch—I should expect to find the uterus of a woman as large twelve months after death as just after—I have not had practical expe<lb></lb>rience of the inspection of a uterus twelve months after death, but I have had experience of the examination of the uterus in bodies a few weeks after death, and I am able to express an opinion that the measurement would be the same after the lapse of twelve months—I think there is no shrinking of the uterus after twelve months, probably there may be of the whole body—I think as regards the uterus it would be infinitesmal; a virgin uterus is subject to considerable variations, even in what we call the normal state—if a body shrinks, the uterus might participate to the extent of sixteenth of an inch, which I think would be a fair proportion, because it has been found that after the womb has been developed it very seldom returns to its original shape again; it is exceptional if it does; I was not speaking of it as an invariable rule, but it is regarded as an indication of a nulliparous uterus—I do not know in what way the uterus had been treated when it was taken from the body.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and practice at 519, Commercial Road—I have been in the profes<lb></lb>sion about eighteen years—I was desired to inspect the remains of the deceased woman by the solicitor for the prisoner on the 24th September, and attended with Mr. Bond on the next morning at 9.30 to do so at the mortuary at St. Saviour's Church—we examined the body three or four times; it was in a very advanced stage of decomposition—from examination, I should think the age was from twenty-five to thirty, not more, I judge by the sutures of the anterior part of the skull not being invisible; after thirty we expect to lose them, we cannot say to two or three years—I examined both the legs—the scar produced, is the one discovered on the right leg below the knee—I discovered also a scar on the left leg which I cut out (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I cannot say what it is the scar of, but from some injury, where it has been struck on this part, or it may have been from a burn—I think the skin has been destroyed—the scar is about the size of a shilling; I will swear posi<lb></lb>tively that it is not the result of decomposition, but in my opinion it is a scar—I examined the mouth; there was one bicuspid tooth decayed down to the bone, and some others were missing—I would not give an opinion upon dental surgery, nor whether that tooth is one that decays sooner than the others—I examined the uterus with care, for the purpose of forming an opinion whether the woman bad been pregnant or not, and the signs to which I looked were the length and the size of the cavity, the general appearance of the womb, and the thickness of the walls—I also observed the shape with Dr. Meadows—I do not give a decided opinion as to the having been pregnant, but my opinion is that she was not pregnant, that the womb hid not been gravid, that she had not borne a child—I examined the hair; I did not detect any curl in it; I produce it—I took this off the back of the head myself—it was all hanging down when I saw it, and I took it off at the last examination from a piece of the scalp behind, which was loose—this other piece which has been produced was, I should say, taken <hi rend="italic">from</hi> near where the hair pins have been; it is of a lighter colour and my probably</p>

               <p>have been washed—mine is rather darker and has not been washed; that would make a difference—mine contains all the elements I took with it, the lime and the dirt—I cannot say whether, after being washed, this would be the natural colour; but it is more likely to be than mine, which may be affected by the chloride of lime—the effect of chloride of lime upon hair as a decolourer is not a thing likely to have been tried—I have made my measurements with great care and they are the same as Dr. Meadows arrived at—I measured the body with Mr. Bond; it measured exactly 4 feet 11 2/8 inches—I also examined the feet and hands; there was nothing remarkable in them, nothing unusually small, considering the size of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. I come to the conclusion that the deceased must have been 25 or 30 because we generally find the anterior sutures of the skull disappear from 28 to 30, and they had not dis<lb></lb>appeared, only at the posterior part—the wisdom teeth appeared as I should have expected them to appear; but Mr. Bond told me that he had cut through the gum and made one appear, and I only saw it afterwards; but in such a disputed question I cannot give an opinion—if the tooth was just making its appearance she might be 25 or 26, it is sometimes earlier and sometimes later—wisdom teeth vary in the time they make their appear<lb></lb>ance, but they usually appear from 20 to 25 or 26—I take my opinion that this woman was at least 25 years of age from the condition of the skull, because the anterior sutures had not disappeared—after 25 you lose the posterior sutures, they had gone, but not the anterior ones the posterior I could not detect, but the anterior I did—there is always room for varia<lb></lb>tion with age in all these cases, especially in the condition of a body like this—the sutures disappear altogether about 30; there is just a mark by which anatomists can detect them, but not ordinary persons.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the anterior sutures disappeared? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You have just asked me that question. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you again; had the anterior sutures disap<lb></lb>peared? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the anterior had not disappeared. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the posterior sutures gone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, they had not—I came to the conclusion that she was 25 because I take the sutures as my guide—I base my evidence on the sutures and on the teeth—I know nothing about the teeth except what I was informed by Mr. Bond—he said that he had cut down to one of the wisdom teeth—I understood him that one side of the tooth was through and the other not, and I started from that and said that the woman was 25 years of age—there is no particular rule for the wisdom teeth making their appearance, but I came to that conclusion because she had cut one—I did not hear that she had cut three and that this one was not cut; I only sup<lb></lb>posed she had one through—the others were through and she had one to come—I have no other reason to give you why I say that she was from 23 to 30—I only found the scar on the right leg on the last examination—I conducted that (examination with Mr. Larkin and Mr. Bond—we scraped both legs, and on the first examination we could not find the scar, but we</p>

               <p>did on the second—we scraped the leg before we found it—we scraped the legs on the first examination but did not find a scar on either, but we did ultimately find one a little below the knee on the Tuesday—I have no doubt about it being a scar, and I think it might have been produced by a burn—we did not discover it on the first or the second examination, not till a fortnight afterwards, the day before the remains were buried—they had then been removed to a dark vault under the church, and we went down with a lighted candle—I did not notice whether we had one or two endless—I did not notice dark patches here and there, but there was one patch on the leg which struck me, though not till the day before the body was buried—Mr. Bond looked on the left <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> and I looked on the right—I did not look at the left leg till the nextexamination, and then we had two examina<lb></lb>tions before we found either of the scars—we cut out the piece of flesh containing this scar—I will not swear what the scar was produced by—if the woman during life had received a blow on her leg she might have had a scar—a blow inflicted on the leg would produce such an appearance if it suppurated—I will not swear that this is not an appearance produced by decomposition—I examined the uterus with Dr. Meadows.</p>

I should have given it to him—I think I have paid part before the work was delivered—I think you will find that the two amounts in the cash-book were sufficient to pay both these bills—the next payment was on the brush—my clerk looked nearly all night for the bill for the large van and could not find it, and I have tried to find it myself—I do not know whether I had a bill—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bill for the work done in June which was delivered on the same date as this one of 29th August—I did not produce these two bills before, because they were both shut in the books—all these things were paid for at the time, we never let a thing like this 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. stand; it would not be entered—I do not say that we never enter such amounts, but in this cash-book it is very rare—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the whole amount due from me on 4th September, and this 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account was the whole amount I owed him at that time—that included everything up to that time, and the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for repairs to the big van and the work done to the little van—we have thousands of papers in the course of a day, they are kept on a large file; we have searched three or four large files on several occasions to find the bill I paid Mr. Wiseman—we probably did have a bill for repairs of the large van—I do not usually hire vans when my own vans are being repaired, I do now, as we are busy—if my vans were being repaired I should make shift with a one-horse van till mine was repaired; he would not keep it more than a day or two—Mr. Wiseman has been told by me always to take his money as soon as he has done his work—I don't suppose I should pay him for it until I had seen what he had done to it—I probably paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. because 1 saw what he bad done to it, I only speak from my books; I have no memory of the transaction—the small van did go several times, it did two loads on 10th September, and the big one one load—the small one would hare to go, I suppose, 3 miles, it was generally used for all purposes, taking out corn and all small loads, but it would not carry 116 bags of rice at the same time—I had the little van oiled in September; it was generally paid for when done, it was only a shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger of 291, Oxford Street, close to Davies Street—I know Thomas Wainwright—he entered my service as shopman on March 30, 1874, and continued with me until the 10th October—I employ various countermen, and I have a sheet on which are entered each day the takings of each counterman—I have the sheet here—each counterman enters into a separate column his sales—during the time Thomas Wainwright was in my employment he was very regular, except</p>

               <p>that he was late in the morning—he was absent four or five days, which by reference to my sheet I find to be May 11th; Monday, June 22nd; August 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 13th; and October 7th—August 3rd was the Bank Holiday; the 4th and 5th were holidays I gave—while he was away in August, I received a telegram from him from Ramsgate, dated August 3rd, asking me to let him stay another day—he was not late every morning, but usually on a Monday—he ought to have been at business at 8 o'clock a.m.—he left at 8 o'clock p.m., when my shop closed—we begin to take in goods from the door at 8 o'clock, and in about ten minutes the shop is closed, unless there are customers in the shop, when it might be a little longer—he generally got away at 8.10 or 8.15—during the time he was in my service he wore a full dark moustache, but no beard or whiskers—I am not a locksmith, but I deal in locks—this is about a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. padlock—they are made in large quantities, and it would be extraordinary to find a key that would not fit it—there is no doubt this key fits the lock best, but even that I should not call the proper one—I am not sure that it was not intended for the lock, but either of them will do equally well.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY GENERAL</hi>. Both would do because both will open it—my shop is on the further side of Oxford Street—I don't know whether Baker Street or Portland Road Station of the Underground Railway is the nearest to my house—Thomas Wainwright was engaged as manager, but I used occasionally to send him out—I don't seek orders out of doors—he used to go out occasionally and collect debts if they were difficult to get hold of—I had four countermen at the time he was with me, including him—I believe the same countermen were with me from March till he left me, but I should not like to swear it without looking at the sheets—the sheets are placed on a desk, and it is the counterman's business to put the cash down in the column assigned to him—if Thomas Wainwright's writing is on the sheets I know that he was there—these are the sheets for the whole of September (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—"W" represents Wainwright, "Alf." represents Alfred, one of the other countermen, and George Lewis was another—on this sheet of September 1 both these columns are entered for the first counterman, the next column is the money received, shillings and pence—Thomas only sold five articles on September 1—I should infer from that that he was absent in the morning, because there is an entry here which I do not remember, "store edgings"—they were supplied to a publican opposite; the order he took himself, and I remember distinctly the money being received just before we closed in the evening—that would be from 6 o'clock to 8 o'clock—on 5th Sep<lb></lb>tember Thomas appears to have sold only a few articles compared with the other countermen; but that was Saturday, and we then close at 5 o'clock—Alfred has sold a column full of articles that day and Wainwright only seven; so he must have been engaged in the window, or else he was out, and if he was dressing the window, which is a difficult task, he would be left entirely undisturbed, and would not have much to do at the counter; sometimes we have a general clear out, and it takes two or three hours to dress the window—we should be more likely to dress the window on a Saturday, because it is a slack day; or Wainwright might be out or he might come late—I never had his equal as a salesman—there is one counter, and it is—30 feet long—on 10th September Thomas is down thirteen times—his sales seem to have been equal to Alfred's, and I should say that he was there all day—it was a full day and possibly it might have been wet—September 11</p>

               <p>was a worse day as far as the till was concerned—there are small matters which we do not pretend to take notice of, such as pence, and he would be doing his window when he had not customers to serve—he made ten sales on September 11, amounting to 46<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; more than double any other man's—on August 13 he was away altogether; but you will find he was there on the 14th—he was living somewhere at Fulham; but I do not know of my own knowledge—I discharged him for two reasons—he had been very irregular of a morning, and it came to my knowledge that he had deserted his wife—I never spoke to him about living at Parson's Green—I did not know it—I never spoke to him about Mrs. Raper—I do not know The Rosamonds at Parson's Green—he never told me that he lived there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of the Supreme Court; formerly I was an attorney—my offices are 13, Railway Approach, London Bridge—Thomas Wainwright was a client of. mine—he came first to con<lb></lb>sult me in February, 1875, at which time he was about to open the Hen and Chickens—I was employed to draw up an agreement between him and Mr. Moore, but it was never completed—the lease was not executed in consequence of Mr. Moore not carrying out his part of the agreement—the partnership fell through—after the failure of the business at the Hen and Chickens I was consulted by Thomas with regard to the surrender of the premises—I corresponded on the subject with Mr. Stuckey, the solicitor for the lesser at Brighton—I had but one interview with him; that was about the 9th or 10th of August—I believe no rent had been paid for the Midsummer quarter, and Mr. Stuckey wrote to me and said that if he accepted the key the quarter's rent and the costs of the lease should be paid—I have experienced in such cases that by the time a second quarter's rent is due the difficulty disappears, when there is nothing to distrain—the earliest time at which I was spoken to about the surrender of the premises to Thomas Wainwright was the beginning of August, or it might have been the last few days of July—I met him in the street, and he spoke to me about it.</p>

I have known Thomas since the beginning of January, 1875—I had never seen him before that—I have no idea what his private residence was then—he had started in business then—the agents had given him possession—he had some goods in the shop—he told me he lived at The Rosamonds at Fulham—I do not think I wrote to him there, but he told me so that I might communicate with him on hearing from Mr. Stuckey in reference to the lease—the partnership with Mr. Moore went off at the beginning of June, when I was first made acquainted with it.</p>

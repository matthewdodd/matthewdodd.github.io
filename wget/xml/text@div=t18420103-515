                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Pugh, and live in Caroline-place, Marlborough-road, Chelsea. The prisoner occupied a furnished apartment in the second floor in our house, for four months, all but one week—I went into his room on the 31st of December, when he was out, and missed the articles stated, which belong to my husband—I afterwards saw them at Mr. Hyam's shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It was not my box—I told the prosecutrix where the box was—I meant to have remained in the lodging, and to pay the rent, and get the things out again, being in distress at the time—I merely sent the box away to get rid of the woman, who was not my wife. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I was not aware the woman was not his wife—he told me he was going to take</p>

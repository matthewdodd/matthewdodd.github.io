                  </hi>. I was watching the premises of Messrs. Cleaver on 30th March. A little before 7 o'clock I saw Thomas come off Messrs. Cleaver's wharf; he went towards Bridge-street—he returned in a few minutes, and Wood followed behind with a pony and cart, and went down the wharf—I saw Wood in Earl-street—I could not see what street he came from—Thomas went down first, and Wood followed with the pony and cart; I followed them, and saw Thomas and Sweeting put something into the cart—I then went on to Blackfriars-bridge, and as I turned to look towards Earl-street, I saw Wood coming with the cart—I followed him over the Bridge—he went at full trot through various streets, and came to Vine-street, York-road; he was about going into the yard of a Mr. Martin, an iron founder, and I stopped him—I asked him where he got the pig iron—he said, "Over the water"—I asked him what he paid for it—he said 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him what the quantity was—he said there was 5 cwt.—I asked him who he paid—he said "A man on the wharf"—I told him I should take him to the station house, which I did—I weighed the iron; it weighed 5 cwt. 37 lbs.—I afterwards saw Mr. Cleaver, and he sent for Thomas to the counting house—that was about 9 o'clock, or a little after—he asked Thomas if he had sent any pig iron away that morning—Thomas said yes, he had sent 5 cwt to Mr. Martin—he asked him whether he paid for it, and where the money was—he said Mr. Martin had not paid for it—he then sent for Sweeting to the counting house, and asked him if he had loaded any pig iron that morning—he said no, only in their own carts—he asked him if he had sent any away in Mr. Martin's cart—he said no, he had not—I then took them both to the station—on Thomas I found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on Sweeting 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Wood—Mr. Cleaver asked Thomas what he had done with the money—he said, "I only had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it"—when I was taking him to the station he said, "I only had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it"—Mr. Cleaver said, "Where is it?"—he said,</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMPSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there not a practice of delivering iron before 7 o'clock in the morning 9 <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When we sell pig iron the usual method is different from any other—when a man applies for iron, we give him a note out of the book, of which we keep a counterpart—the man who loaded the iron returned with the counterpart—it is to see that it was all right—there is no entry here to the effect of any iron having been sold on the morning of 31st March; that is the reason why I asked Thomas if he had sold any—the price of the iron at that time was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton—the men in the yard have no authority to deliver iron—we never sold pig iron without entering it in the book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You know Martin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—he is a regular cus<lb></lb>tomer—I believe he is a respectable man—he live* at Vine-street—he had been a customer two or three years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So Thomas was in the position of superintendent of the other workmen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was merely foreman, if we may so term it—to make it more specific, we will say foreman of the labourers landing goods—he has no control over any one—I do not depute the authority to him to control anybody—he is employed by us to give us an account of the cargoes he and others land, that is his duty; and occasionally, when customers come into the yard, he fills the cart, and with pig iron more particularly—as foreman he would not have control or authority over any One from me—what he might use, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We understood from the policeman that you asked him the question, when you called him into the counting house, whether he sold the pig iron, and he said, "Yes?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At first he denied it, and then he admitted it—I said, "Did he pay you for it?"—I had a previous knowledge that he had sold it—if he had said he had paid him, and had handed the money, I should not have been satisfied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

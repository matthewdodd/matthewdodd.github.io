I held him till another person came up, who picked up the bundle, which he had dropped.</p>

I was two or three yards from the spot - the prisoner passed me with the bundle, and ran into Hoxton square; he turned to the West side of the square - I knew there was no way out there, so I turned to the East side, and met him; I saw him in the possession of Smith.

I am a detective officer of the City police—On 10th February, I was on duty by the Mansion-house, in Princes-street, about half-past three o'clock—I saw the prisoners standing at the comer of Mansion house-street, near the middle of the pavement, talking together, Taylor was smoking a cigar—I saw Bushby leave the other two, and step two or three steps on the kerb, where a lady was standing with a child in her arms—Shelly went and stood with his back against the wall, Taylor went and stood behind Bushby—I saw Bushby with his hand close to the lady's pocket, on the kerb—I went and stood in a doorway, about three yards distant on the right—I had not been there above a minute, before I saw Bushby start in a moment from the lady towards Cheapside—as he ran past me I caught hold of him by the collar—he had this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on his right arm—when I seized him, he fell on his knees—I</p>

I am a detective officer, of the City Police—I was with Webb on Friday 10th Feb., about twenty minutes past 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I saw the three prisoners together in Princes-street, walking together in conversation—I saw them go to the right hand side of several ladies, who were passing along Princes-street—I saw Bushby walk to the right hand side of a lady, and Taylor and Shelly were close behind him—they then went a short distance, and Bushby stopped and spoke to the other two—shortly afterwards they all three went to the corner of Princes-street and Mansion-house street—I saw Bushby go by the side of the prosecutrix—Shelly placed himself a short distance from him, with his back to the wall, in Mansion-house street—Taylor stood close by the side of Bushby and the lady—as I passed, Shelly looked towards me, and appeared to recog<lb></lb>nize me—I passed on towards the European—I turned my head, and saw Bushby running—at that moment I saw Webb, and he stopped Bushby, who at that moment threw this purse in a doorway—I picked it up—I then went to the corner of Princes-street, and in eight or ten minutes I saw Taylor coming from the direction of Lombard-street—I took him, and told him the charge against him—he said I was mistaken—I handed him to Webb, and immediately after I saw Shelly going along with his coat collar up towards his face and his cap pulled over his eyes—I took him, and told him the charge—he said I was mistaken—he had before had his collar turned down and his cap up.</p>

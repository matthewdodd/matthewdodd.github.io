On the 9th of January, I was coming from Goldsmith's Pall, and taking this plate to my master, in Little Sutton-street, between five and six o'clock in the evening; I saw Hepburn, and went with him to a house in <placeName id="t18240218-62-crimeloc356">Bell-place, Bell-alley, Goswell-street</placeName>

The two men came after me; one took hold of my shoulder, and pulled me round, and said I was a thief - they pulled out a staff; the prisoner was not one of them. One of them took this property from me; I ran after him, and then the prisoner King stopped me, and asked what I was hallooing about; I was then about five yards from the spot where I was robbed. I told him two men had robbed me; he told me to stand still, and he would go after them - he then ran away. I ran after the men, but could not see them, so I ran back towards King, and then another man stopped me, and asked what was the matter - King had run away a hard as he could. I went to him about an hour after with the officer, and knew him to be the man who had stopped me; they took him into custody - he had taken nothing from me. The property has not been found.</p>

She was up in the room; Hepburn asked for Bill; she said she would fetch him - I did not mention what I had about me - it was buttoned in a bag inside my coat; they could see that I had a bag; the string was twisted round my arm; it belonged to Mr. Britton, a silversmith. Hepburn had taken me there once before - we were kept waiting for Bill about eight minutes, and then he came up. When I came out some men tried to hold me under the archway, by the side of the house. When we first went into the room, Blackwell asked me to come to the fire, and said she had been ill; she did not press us to stop. I went back after the robbery, and found King with her.</p>

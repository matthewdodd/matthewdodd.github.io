I live at Holywell-lane, City-road, with my father-in-law, who is a licensed victualler, and keeps the Prince of Wales public-house—on Monday morning, 11th September, about 5 o'clock, I was roused by a police-constable—I got up, made a search, and found the kitchen window had been forced open by some instrument—the catch had been force aside—I missed three night-gowns, and several other articles of wearing apparel, and a metal teapot, which were afterwards found in the adjoining yard—I received them from the private watchman—these are the articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which were safe in my house on the preceding night—I went to bed about half-past 11—I saw the house all secure then—I saw the prisoner on the Sunday evening in our house—he left about a quarter to 11—he had been having some refreshment—he was not intoxicated.</p>

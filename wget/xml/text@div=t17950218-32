               <p>Arthur Keating was called on his recognizance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These things that were pledged, were not pledged by me, though not without my knowledge; there was a week's rent due, and I told her I was only going away for a couple of days, and meant to go back, and take the things back again. On the Saturday following she took me in Rathbone-place; she knocked me about the street, telling every body I had robbed her; when she took me to Bow-street, she said, if I would pay her a fortnight's rent, she would do nothing with me. On the Thursday following Mr. Connolly said, if I would release the things and pay the rent for the time I was absent, he would not prosecute me; I could not do it, I sent to my sister to do it, and she was willing to release the things, but not to pay the rent.</p>

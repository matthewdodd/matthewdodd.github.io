               <p>Bloomsbury. On the 26th of October, I and my brother and friends proceeded to Gravesend in the <hi rend="italic">Bachelor</hi> steam<lb></lb>boat—we went from the Adelphi-stairs—we took many parties on board going down the river—I saw the prisoner on board coming back—I cannot be positive that I saw him going down—we returned by the same boat—it had been engaged for the purpose by a friend of mine, and I assisted my friend in collecting money for refreshments, which were served on board—I received money from many persons for refreshment—I am positive I saw the prisoner on board on our return—my attention was particularly called to him—we arrived at Adelphi-stairs about seven or half-past seven o'clock—the ma<lb></lb>jority of the passengers left before me—I was among the last that landed—I was dressed in a frock-coat, and a macintosh, in the pocket of which I had a silk handkerchief and metal flask in basket—I had given over the money I had received to my friend—I might have collected about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as soon as we landed, (my brother was with me) I was attacked by the prisoner, who struck me two or three times about the face and head—I could not say whether it was with his hand or any thing else, but he put his hand in my macintosh pocket, which contained the flask and hand-kerchief—I said, "What are you doing, what are you about, <hi rend="italic">Scotty</hi>, I know you?"—I was then knocked down and severely kicked about the head and left side while I was down—there were other persons with him—my brother interfered to take my part, and he was also ill used—I was rendered almost senseless—I was in a very bad state—I have not re-covered my flask or handkerchief—one skirt of my macintosh was cut off—this is the macintosh—the pocket is cut away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor and accountant, and live at No. 105, Star-street, Edge ware-road. I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Bachelor</hi> on the day of the fight in company with Smallwood and a friend of mine named Floyd—I also met a gentleman I know named Cousins—I was on hoard from Gray's to Blackwall—the boat did not go to Gravesend at all—I saw a person strike the prisoner—I think I should know the person again—(<hi rend="italic">looking at Lynch</hi>)—I would not swear to him, but I think he is the person—I do not know the prisoner, I never saw him before, nor Banks, nor Drake—I do not know whe<lb></lb>ther the prosecutor was on deck at the time the man struck the prisoner, I could not distinguish—I went with the boat to the Adelphi Pier—there was a great rush to get on shore—I did not see the prisoner leave the boat—I saw him pass me, as I was compelled to push my way through the crowd—there were from twelve to thirty people quarrelling and fighting—I should say they were all drunk going down and coming back—there were provisions on board—the prisoner passed me at the Adelphi Pier, and two or three people with him—Cousins, Floyd, and I came up the steps to George-street</p>

               <p>together—the prisoner and the persons with him were a couple of yards I before us—I went away from the place as well as I could—the pier leads into George-street—I saw the last prisoner in the Strand—he was going towards Charing-cross—I went towards King William-street—I saw the prisoner twice—the last time he was about fifty yards from the court lead<lb></lb>ing into the Strand, and I suppose three hundred yards from the pier—that was I suppose about a quarter of an hour after the first time I saw him—when I saw him first was just as I got into George-street, out of the boat—I lost sight of him—he went towards Charing-cross.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a broker and appraiser, and live at No. 16, Castle-street, Long-acre. I was in company with Mr. Harrison on this occasion—I saw the prisoner at the Adelphi Pier when the boat arrived—he went up George-street just before me and Mr. Harrison—I lost sight of him in the Strand, about five or six minutes after leaving the boat—I saw him two or three times before we got into the Strand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a portmanteau-maker, and live in Wild-street, Drury lane. I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Bachelor</hi> steamer on the day in question and saw the prisoner—I believe I saw him after I left the boat, in George street, with another person—I imagine he walked before me a short dis<lb></lb>tance, and likewise passed me in the Strand—I and a gentleman went and called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> out of King William-street—the prisoner was going towards Temple-bar—I was going that way—I was in King William-street—that is a little nearer to Charing-cross than George-street—I did not hear a cry of "Murder," or "Police," or "<hi rend="italic">Scotty</hi>," on the pier—I was in company with Harrison.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house and estate agent, and live at No, 58, Marchmont-street, Brunswick-square;—my offices are in Mitre-court, Fleet-street. I was in company with the prisoner on the day in question—I left the boat at the Adelphi Pier with him—he went with me from the steam-boat—I took him away because there was a general fight ensued at the pier—I saw him from the time he left the boat, and went with him to a public-house, No. 45, Strand—I was in his company, for about half-an-hour after he left the steam-boat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the time he left the boat with you till you left him did he interfere with the prosecutor or strike him at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he did not—his mouth was bleeding at the time, and he had a white handkerchief</p>

               <p>smothered with blood—I gave him my card to take out a warrant against the party who struck him—he did not strike the prosecutor, or interfere with him on the pier at all—I did not see him do so—I must have seen if he had—seven or eight of us went to the public-house—I went on shore with him from the steam-boat with all the rest of them—they all rushed—he did not strike the prosecutor there, or any person.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You know the prisoner very well? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never saw him in my life before that day—I took him away from the general fight because his mouth was bleeding—he had been very much ill-used on board the steam-boat—I did not take him away from the general fight—he went away—I persuaded him if he stopped there he might get worse served—there were several more there—I did not hear "Murder" called, nor "Police"—I did not hear the man say, "I know you, <hi rend="italic">Scotty"</hi>—I did not hear the word "<hi rend="italic">Scotty</hi>" that day—if that had been called out during the general fight, while the prisoner was there, I think I must have heard it—six or seven of us went away in company together; I, the prisoner, and four or five others—we all walked together up George-street and into the Strand, till we reached the public-house, which is towards Temple-bar—it is three or four doors from the little court which goes up the steps—I walked to the public-house—I have been a house-agent two years—I was with two friends on board—one was named Martindale, and the other Ser<lb></lb>geant Leslie, who was out in Portugal—they had nothing to do with it—I did not know the prisoner or the other party.</p>

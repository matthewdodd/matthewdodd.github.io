                  </hi>. I am a carrier—the prisoner was in my service—I have known him two or three years; he has lived with me before, but this last time he has only been with me three weeks—on Friday, 10th Dec, I gave him a sovereign to pay for an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi>; I do not know whether I gave him the advertisement, or the man who takes the orders, but I gave the prisoner the money to pay for it—I asked him next morning for the receipt; he said he was too late, when he got round the office was closed—I had given it him between 2 and 3 o'clock on the Friday afternoon, when I was ten or twenty yards from my own office door in Greenwich; the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi> office is in Fleet-street, London—I told him on the Saturday afternoon to go again and take care to be in time; he left at three o'clock, or half past, and did not return again—he ought to have returned on the Saturday night, and he ought to have come on Sunday to look after the horses—on the next morning, Sunday, I found the advertisement on the desk in my office—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the Monday about 12 o'clock, I saw the prisoner on Croom's-hill, at the corner of Greenwich-park gates—when he saw me he walked away as fast as he could; I called after him, and said to him, "What is the reason you have not come to settle with me?" he said, "I suppose I can come when I like"—I said, "Give me the sovereign I gave you to pay for the advertisement?" he answered that I and the sovereign might both be b—, and I then gave him in charge.</p>

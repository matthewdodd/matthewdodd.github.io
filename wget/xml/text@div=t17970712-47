               <p>- HOULDITCH sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Fisher: On Friday the 5th of June, between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120033"></xptr>one and two in the afternoon, the prisoner came in for a cockade, he wanted blue, red and white, and was very particular in colours; I shewed him a great many, there were none that he seemed to like, he wished to take three pieces with him, saying, that he came out of the neighbourhood, and would return them immediately; I told him I could not suffer that, I would give him patterns; when I was going to cut the patterns, Mr. Fisher came, and thought he could find some that would suit him: I then left him, and went to another customer; I did not see him take any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he appear then as he does now? - A. Yes, and I think he had an apron on; after I was informed that he had taken the ribbon, I went out into Mitre-court after him, and told him, Mr. Fisher wanted him, and he immediately pulled out the ribbon, and said, he supposed that was what he wanted, and then he went down upon his knees, and begged for mercy.</p>

             sworn. - I was in the shop of an errand for my mistress; I saw the prisoner put a piece of purple ribbon in his pocket, and I informed Mr. Fisher of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What pocket did I put it in? - A. His left hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had not a pocket. (The ribbon produced.)</p>
               <p>Houlditch. I know these to be Mr. Fisher's ribbons; this piece of purple ribbon he took out of his pocket in Mitre-court; these other two pieces were found upon him by the constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was very much intoxicated at the time; I have been in his Majesty's service many years, I have been wounded twice in my head, I was with the Duke of York the whole of the last campaign; I have had some splinters taken out of my side, which causes me to be delirious at times, especially if I get a little liquor.</p>

On the 8th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the shop - the prisoner came in and asked to look at some ribbon; I showed her the drawer - she desired me to cut three quarters of a yard off one of them; while I was doing that I saw her take a piece from the drawer, and put it under her shawl, then under her handkerchief, and then under her shawl again; I went and told Mr. Sewell - he sent the next witness to conduct her to a passage; this ribbon was dropped in the shop, eight or nine yards from where I had been serving her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many persons were in the shop? A. I should think fifty or sixty - I did not take her at first, as I waited to see if she took it away; Mr. Sewell was at the bottom of the shop -I put away the drawer, and left her with the ribbon while I went to him; it is possible she might have gone off, but there was a young man in the shop; she was five or six yards from the door when I served her - I should not have seized her without telling my employer; if he had not been there I should have told the young man.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GUYTHER. I attend in the shop, but do not serve; it is my business to attend the customers when they come in; after Mr. Sewell told me of this I went to the prisoner, and begged her to come to another part of the shop; when she had got six or seven yards I saw her shifting something, and this ribbon fell from her person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there many persons about? A. Yes, the shop was full; the place where she dropped the ribbon was further from the door than where she had been served; she came further into the shop when I begged it as a favour - I do not know what part of the shop Mr. Sewell was in; he came to me in the middle of the shop - I do not think it possible for this ribbon to have hung to the prisoner's person - I never knew such a thing.</p>

            . This is the ribbon - there are nine yards and a half of it - she had bought some other ribbons, but none of this sort; she laid out about 3s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had she not paid you? A. Yes, after I had told Mr. Sewell; I had not made out the bill when I told him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she pay for it before she dropped this other ribbon? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I followed this gentleman a considerable distance up the shop; they said they suspected I had taken something - I said I had not, and opened my shawl; they left me two or three minutes, and then said they had picked up a piece of ribbon which I had dropped; the gentleman first said he saw me put the ribbon under my shawl, then into my pocket, and then take it out again, and yet he did not take me; I have been married twenty years, and was never accused of any thing of this kind in my life.</p>

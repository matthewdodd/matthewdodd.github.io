            , and lodge in Labour-invain-yard, Old Fish-street-hill - my husband is a tailor; I never saw the prisoner before this happened. On the 1st of December, I went into <placeName id="t18281204-242-crimeloc1282">Red Lioncourt, Holywell-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q.Could you at all conjecture the reason of these people having this resentment against you? A. I do not know, unless the prisoner mistook me for somebody else; or she never could have a spite against me; I am very much in dread of my life, for her family are outside here to-day, threatening my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this appear to you to have been done with a knife, or any hard thing that might have torn the flesh? A. It was done instantly; I cannot say what it was done with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Have you any recollection of the surgeon saying he thought it must have been done by a blunt instrument? A. No, not exactly; he said it bled profusely, but was not a material hurt, and not dangerous at all; Pritchard is my brother - he was there before I went to Mrs. Matthews'; I found him there - I did not perceive that he was in liquor; I will not swear that he was sober - I swear I was sober myself; I had not been drinking at all, except one glass of gin in the morning; only one glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a general row outside? A. There was nothing but confusion and riot, knocking at Matthews's door with stones, after I got in; there was quarrelling and confusion before I arrived.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.You do not know that it was done with a sharp instrument? A. No. - no medical man is here.</p>

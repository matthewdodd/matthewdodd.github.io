               <p>Q. As you were going along did you observe any thing - A. I thought I observed a leg or a thigh of something by a tree at the corner. I thought it to be the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. It struck you that it might be him - A. Yes. As I advanced I saw perfectly it was him. I stopped the horse and chaise cart; then instantly he presented the blunderbuss, and I saw that he meant to shoot. He said, d - n your eyes. I saw he prepared to shoot.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any person near the prisoner at the time that this took place - A. No; I cannot say I did at that time; it was done so momently.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you lately before had any intercourse with him, either friendly or contrary - A. On the Wednesday before that happened he and I were talking very friendly.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps your recollecting the Wednesday you can tell us now the day that happened - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the subject of any thing that passed between him and you; what was that about. Had any thing been done by you with respect to the prisoner or his property, or something that he claimed - A. I never considered that it was his property. Why, a few trees I had lopped.</p>

               <p>Q. You have had frequent opportunities of observing him and his conduct - A. Not lately. I saw him on the Wednesday before that happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any thing particular about his conduct which induced you to attend to his conduct or behaviour - A. I saw nothing the matter with him that Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. But any time before - A. I saw nothing myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been consulted. Have you observed any thing particular respecting his conduct and behaviour previous to this unfortunate accident - A. Myself, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes. You saw him on the Wednesday, had you seen him several times before the Wednesday - A. Oh, yes; several times pass in a chaise-cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing strike you considering the state of his mind - A. I had not conversation enough with him to know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing from his appearance to make you suppose whether he was in his right mind or not - A. I cannot pretend to say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been nothing in you that begat a suspicion that he was not in his right mind - A. He spoke to me very well at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say at any time that you thought a commission of lunacy should be taken out against him - A. Me, sir. I have heard his son-in-law say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Attend to me, Mr. Burrows. Have you never said that you thought that a commission of lunacy should be taken out against the prisoner - A. I do not think it is in my power to answer it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you hear the question - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you never said that it was your opinion he ought to have a commission of lunacy taken out against him - A. If I did I have forgot it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you will not swear you did not - A. No, I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been speaking about the lopping of the trees, since March, was it - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Oh, yes, you must know. Has not he lent you two hundred pounds - A. That was before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he has not lent you the money since the lopping of the trees - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe not - A.Surely not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it paid since the lopping of the trees, and he refused to take interest. Did you pay him since March - A. I have the receipt at home. I cannot exactly tell now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he refuse to take interest after March, when you paid him - A. At the time I paid him he refused taking interest.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that since March that he refused taking interest - A. I cannot say that exactly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. On the Wednesday when you saw him before, was there any thing in his conduct then that led you to suppose that he was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010012"></xptr> in his right mind - A. Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you remember any time saying that you thought he was a mad man - A. About two years ago, when he sell off his horse. I saw him one morning; he said, I have been all under here; I have seen all the churches.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is that - A. I cannot say. He certainly said, that he had seen all the churches.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that ago - A. I cannot pretend to say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it about two years ago - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. About this money that you borrowed and returned; about what time did you borrow it - A. I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the course of this year - A. To the best of my knowledge it was in March.</p>
               <p>COURT. What, last March - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Did he then give you a receipt for the money himself - A. Not himself. He sent it up by his son-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, concerning the returning the money. Did he give you any reason why he would not take the interest - A. I was very angry. He sent me short notice to return the money. I throwed the money down, and said, I did not mind a thousand pounds no more than he did. He said, he would not have the interest. I throwed it down in the house, and afterwards his son-in-law brought it back to me.</p>
               <p>Q. About how long had you had the money - A. I cannot say. It is immaterial, I think, of going on in this way. I cannot pretend to say how long I had had the money.</p>
               <p>Q. You can tell whether it was one year or more - A. It is of no use I think.</p>
               <p>Q. You certainly can tell me whether it was a year, or more than a year - A. It was not a year.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount of the interest - A. Three or four pounds. I threw it down for him to receive.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the principal - A. Two hundred pounds.</p>

He stood so as to conceal himself until a person came within twenty yards of him coming over the bridge. He might stand perhaps two minutes and a half. It could not be more.</p>

             got off the mare, and Bowler was getting on. At that time Bowler's hat flew off; he took his foot out of the stirrup, picked it up, and mounted the mare, saying to the boy, d - n your eyes, follow me. He rode away as hard as he could gallop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a mare of speed - A. Yes. Then I saw no more of him. Mr. Burrows fell across the shafts, forward. I thought he was dead. His horse rode away with the cart as hard as he could gallop.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as you saw the boy get off the horse, and the prisoner get on, where was the blunderbuss - A. It was in the ditch. I did not see him throw it in. Mary Church picked it up. It was the blunderbuss that I had in the shop. It appeared to have been recently fired off: the powder dust was all in the pan. I looked in the cart; there was blood in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you converse with Bowler - . He talked about the fine growing weather; he said, it was a fine growing time. He said, nothing prevented our business; meaning the weather did not. I said, no, nothing but want of business.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you worked for him - A. Yes, and I generally took in the bill myself; sometimes my wife. The Sunday before that he paid me my bill, and left eleven pence unpaid.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, between the former Saturday and Sunday, to the 30th, had you seen him about - A. Sometimes he would come into the shop without saying any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, in the course of that week come in your shop - A. Yes; and talk as he had done before.</p>
               <p>Q. On this morning did you observe any thing about his manner that struck you as singular - A. No; it was always as it had been. He seemed very cool and deliberate. He talked to me as such.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you do any thing to the blunderbuss to improve the priming - A. No. The blunderbuss was left down there.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither did you, nor did he ask you, to do any thing to improve the priming - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were going away if he had not called you back - A. Yes; I was going over the bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore if he had not called you back you would have been a considerable way - A. Yes; I should have passed Mr. Burrows's house a good way.</p>
               <p>Q. He called you back; you went in the shop; he kept you in conversation; he kept you there a good while - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had not called you back you would have been away; by which means he had the opportunity of your seeing him shoot Mr. Burrows - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did go away: he bringing you back, you were an eye-witness to it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He stood, you say, as not for Burrows to see him, but where you could see him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Just between your cottage and house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you and your family could see him, within an hundred yards of his own house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And within two hundred yards of Burrows's house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A mile and a half on towards London there might be a more private place than that - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not there be a more private place, without a blacksmith to look on - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. You told me you were going down to the boats - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you were going down in a direction towards the barges when he desired you to come back - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the spot from the canal where the barges lay - A. Sixty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him that you were going down to them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the spot to which you told him you were going, in sight of the place where the blunderbuss was fired, and could it have been as easy heard and seen as in the shop - A. Yes, and sooner.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when you were coming up towards the shop, and talking about the priming, was his grandson, Barnjam, near you - A. Yes; within five or six yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he near enough to have heard what Bowler said - A. I cannot say exactly. Mr. Bowler did not speak over loud. I cannot say whether he did or did not.</p>
               <p>MRS. JONES. Q. You are the wife of the last witness - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the morning that this took place Mr. Bowler coming to your husband's shop - A. I saw him go in and out about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When last he came out had he any thing in his hand - A. The last time I saw him I was going towards the bridge; I passed my husband's shop. I saw him come out with a blunderbuss in his hand. He placed himself opposite the tree, as I saw; but I passed him then.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say you were going towards the bridge - A. Yes; I saw Mr. Burrows and spoke to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. When was it you first saw Mr. Burrows; was it on the bridge - A. He had passed the bridge, and was coming towards our shop, as I passed the shop to go to the bridge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Had Bowler placed himself by the tree - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Burrows came near the tree, what happened - A. I heard the report of the blunderbuss, that made me turn round, then I saw smoke proceed from the blunderbuss.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Bowler at that time - A. No, not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010014"></xptr> exactly at that time. I saw Mr. Burrows fall down in the cart. He laid on the shafts. The horse in the cart took fright, and ran down the road.</p>
               <p>COURT. When did you see Bowler next - A. I looked round, and saw the smoke. I saw Bowler instantly afterwards, and Barnjam standing by holding the horse. Mr. Bowler throwed the blunderbuss into the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this - A. Yes. He put his left foot on the stirrup, and his hat fell off. He dismounted, and picked it up; and when he was mounted on the horse he said to Barnjam, d - n your eyes, never mind; follow me. He went over the bridge as hard as he could go. I gave a loud scream. He came round, and gave me a very angry look.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you scream - A. I do not know exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. He turned round, and gave you an angry look - A. Yes, and rode away as hard as he could. I found a ball close by the side of some blood that came from Mr. Burrows.</p>
               <p>Q. About how soon was that afterwards - A. About a couple of hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else - A. I was present when the hat was found. Mrs. Barnard picked up the hat and wig, and Mrs. Barnard picked up a ball. Her ball, that she picked up, was near the hat and wig, mine was near the blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Bowler speak to you that morning - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>MRS. BARNARD. I live in Mr. Jones's house; I have part of it. I am a married woman. On this morning, about a quarter before seven, I saw Mr. Bowler, in company with Mr. Jones, coming towards the bridge, and young Barnjam with them on horseback; they were going to Mr. Jones's shop; and at that time Mr. Bowler had the blunderbuss in his hand. I saw him several times after that walk in and out of Mr. Jones's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go into Mr. Jones's shop with the blunderbuss - A. Yes; and I saw him afterwards walk in and out Jones's shop without the blunderbuss. I saw nothing more until I heard the report. I saw Bowler come out. I could not see where he stood. As soon as I heard the report of the blunderbuss I looked out of the window. I saw Mr. Burrows fall. I saw Barnjam get off the horse at that time, and Mr. Bowler got on, and ride away very fast towards the bridge. I then went into the road, and saw the hat and wig.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you heard the report of a gun you looked out of window - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any smoke at that time - A. The smoke, as he fired, came direct to my window; I instantly went into the road, and picked up this hat and wig. As I saw Mr. Bowler ride away I picked up this hat and a wig and a bullet. The bullet was as close to the hat as it could lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any hole in the hat - A. Yes; two. I took the hat and wig down to where Mr. Burrows was sitting in a room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Bowler before - A. Yes; ever since I could remember.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a native of that part of the world - A. Yes. I delivered the hat to Mrs. Street. I am sure it is the same.</p>

            . I am a blacksmith. I live at Alperton. On the morning of the 30th of May I was standing in Mrs. Street's garden; I heard the voice of murder. I ran out of the garden into the lane. I saw Mr. Burrows coming down the lane: he was sitting on the front board of the cart; one of his feet was hanging over the near side. We stopped Mr.Burrows's horse. He was running very fast. He said the rascal shot him. I asked him, who? He said, Mr. Bowler.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Bowler - A. I have known Mr. Bowler six years. I had seen him a fortnight before this; he was coming by the shop where I was at work. I said, it is a windy morning. He said, yes: have you seen my shepherd boy. He seemed as well as ever I knew him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any body standing on that side where you saw the smoke - A. I could not see, because there was a tree. I was going over the bridge: I met Mr. Bowler coming over it; he was riding very fast. I was going to speak to him. I did not, seeing him anxious of going his journey. I went up to Mr. Jones's shop.

            . I live in Perrywell parish, near Alperton. I am a farmer. I went to Mr. Burrows's house. I heard Bowler was come home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Tell us when that was - A. On the 6th of June. I immediately went away down to Bowler's house. I sent for Payne, the constable. I went and took him. Before he came, I sent for a crow to break the door open. I went into the house, and there I saw Mr. Bowler. He was sitting in a chair: the constable came directly afterwards, and I gave him in possession. The constable's name is Payne.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did any thing pass before the constable came - A. Yes; I went up to him, stript and searched him, to see whether he had any fire arms about him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Did any thing pass between you and him before the constable came - A. He begged me not to take him away from home. He said he would give himself up. I said, very well; I would consider of it: in the mean while I sent after the chaise. When the chaise and constable came, I asked him if he was agreeable to go along with me. He said he would. He went into the chaise with me and the constable; and, as we were going along in the chaise, he said to me, pray consider my family, and let me come back again. He said, you being a relation to Mr. Burrows, you can do a great deal for me. He said, if you will let me come back again to my daughter and grandchild, let me come back again and be confined there, I shall be satisfied. I will give you ten, twenty, or thirty, thousand pounds. I said, I have only got one voice: I will do what I can for you. My meaning was, to bring him where he is. We had no more conversation until we got to Marlborough-street. I gave him up there, and I had no more conversation afterwards. I have known him thirty-five years. His grand children live with him. He has a woman keeps his house. He has not a wife living.</p>

            . I am the Ealing constable, the upper side. On the evening, of the 6th of June, I was sent for. I went to the prisoner's house, and saw the prisoner. I assisted in taking him in custody. I said to Mr. Bowler, you will consider your self as my prisoner. I was taking the handcuffs out of my pocket. Bowler said, d - n my eyes if I have them on: however, I charged Mr. Eamer to aid and assist me. I rode, to oblige Mr. Eamer, along with the post-boy. I did not ride in the chaise.</p>

            . Q. We understand you are an attorney - A. I am. I am son-in-law to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any dispute between Mr. Burrows and Mr. Bowler, respecting the cutting or lopping of some trees - A. There was some trivial dispute between them.</p>
               <p>Q. About some trees that were cut by Mr. Burrows - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, were you sent by Mr. Bowler to Mr. Burrows about it - A. I went. I told Mr. Burrows, that I thought there were little damage done. That Mr. Bowler meant to bring an action against him. I stated to Mr. Bowler, that I had delivered the message. He said, never mind; I shall not think any more about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wetherall. What relation are you of the prisoners - A. A son-in-law. I married one of his daughters, about ten or eleven years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Since that period, have you been much in the habit of being with your father-in-law, the prisoner - A. Yes; a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his having a fit - A. Perfectly well: a fit of apoplexy, about a year ago, July, 1811; I saw him on the night of the fit; perhaps about seven o'clock, in company with Mr. Burrows.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he attacked with this fit in his own house - A. No, sir, I believe in the hay-field. I rode home with Mr. Burrows, from London: that evening he went with me to Mr. Bowler's house, to see how he was. We heard of the fit.</p>
               <p>Q. I presume, at this time, Mr. Burrows was friendly with the prisoner - A. Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was attacked with the fit, was he in a state of insensibility - A. Yes; I conceived he was so.</p>
               <p>Q. That evening of the fit, was there any medical person with him - A. I think Dr. Hyatt.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, sir, at that time, did you perceive any alteration in the state of your father-in-law's mind - A. A great deal at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known instances in which his memory has failed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him in a passion without any cause or reason - A. Yes, I have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard him talk nonsense and incoherent - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard him quarrel with his relations and servants without any apparent cause - A.Yes: d - ning their eyes without any provocation that I knew of. I saw none. I have seen it three or four times since he has been attacked with this fit, when he has been playing at cards with his house-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you, since the month of March last, have you seen these symptoms increase upon him - A. Yes; particularly as to losing his memory; he could not count money rightly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his telling you, that he was exchequered, and was going to lose his estate - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010016"></xptr> Yes, several times. The last time I heard about that was in March last, or a month before.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there the least foundation as you know of for his being exchequered, or losing his estate - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner had purchased his land-tax - A. I heard of it; and I enquired at the land-tax-office, and found it was right. He said, several times, that he was certain his land-tax was purchased wrong; in consequence of that he was sure he should be exchequered, and further than that, he was certain he should lose his estate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire at the Land-tax office - A. I did, in Lincoln's Inn Fields. I found that he had purchased it right. I told him so when I went back. He then gave me a blank check for me to fill it up with the sum, that he might have done it wrong. I could not persuade him that he had done it right. I gave him the check again. He said, he was sure it was not all right; he was satisfied he had done it wrong; that his estate would be forfeited.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his writing you a letter about his insanity - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. How did you receive that letter - A. It was sent up to me. That letter is destroyed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive that it is destroyed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wetherall. Was not the purport of that letter for you to advertise that he, the prisoner, was a madman - A. Yes; that was it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that ago - A. About four months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him about receiving that letter - A. I received another letter sometime afterwards. That other letter is not destroyed. I have not got it with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his threatening to destroy himself - A. Yes. That is about four or five months ago. That was at his own house. He asked me, what would become of his property if he destroyed himself, and if I ever knew any one that had destroyed themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he state how he would destroy himself - A. No. He wanted to know if ever I knew any person that had destroyed themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his asking you to dance once - A. Yes. That may be about four months ago. That was at his own house. I was at his house about three or four o'clock in the afternoon. He said, I had had a good education; he wondered I could not dance; and if I would get up and dance he would play upon the gridiron.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect this unfortunate man talking to you about the subterraneous cavern - A.Yes: that he had been under ground. That is about four or five months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say he had been the under ground travels to - A. He had been under Perrywell and Harrow. He had seen people that were dead forty years ago. He had seen them that were happy, and them that were not; and he has mentioned it at other times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you often at his house, to know when the prisoner arose, and when he went to bed - A. Yes; sometimes he got up between three and four o'clock in the morning. Before he had the fit he would get up about five or six in the morning, and after the fit he would get up between two and three; he would breakfast in half an hour, and then sit down to cards. I have seen that several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you observed him several times playing at cards - A. I saw him once playing at all-fours: he said he should like to play at all-fours; at the same time he was not conscious that he was playing at cards. He would dine at half after eight in the morning. He would eat his meat half done, sometimes raw. I have seen it on the table raw, so that I could not eat any when he asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had dined what would this unfortunate man do - A. He would walk out. He wandered about his yard generally; sometimes in the street. He has talked to me very incoherent, so as to appear quite absent.</p>
               <p>Q. What time would he take his tea - A. About two or three o'clock in the afternoon; and he has left me when I have been talking to him; when he has done tea he has left me in a very abrupt manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this his general habit - A. Yes: since he had the fit. When I have been in the house I have generally seen him in bed by four o'clock, sometimes between two and three. I considered him as deranged all the time since the fit. It increased upon him since April and March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever consult with any person, and when, of taking out a commission of lunacy - A. I did, with Mr. Burrows himself, at the Angel in Oxford-road. Mr. Burrows and I have been in the habit of riding together to London. I met him at this house where his horse was put up. I told him I thought my father was in a strange way; I thought it proper that a commission of lunacy should be taken out against him.</p>
               <p>COURT. When was this - A. This was between three and four months ago. Mr. Burrows agreed with it; that he thought it was right. I had mentioned to him several times that he was in a strange way. I thought that a commission of lunacy should be taken out, but I thought it a matter of delicacy; and the only motive that I did not do it was, that the world should not say that I had my father-in-law locked up for the sake of getting his property. About two months ago I went up to Mr. Bowler's house one morning. His father has been dead several years. He asked me if I knew his father. He was dead before I was born. I said, no, I did not. He said, he was a strong man; perhaps he was the strongest man in the kingdom; he could carry three sacks of beans at once; and that he could carry half a load of deals up a ladder.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever recollect the prisoner ever taking you to the window, and telling you that it snowed - A. Yes; and that it rained when it was fine sunshiny weather. That is about two months ago. I was in the habit of attending him two or three times a week, and sometimes in the course of a day, he would send for me, and then would forget that he had sent for me to come.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, a short time before this unfortunate affair happened, his telling you that he was going to leave the country - A. Yes. He said, that his property would be exchequered; that he must leave the country; or, that he should leave the country.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010017"></xptr> I considered him to be in a total state of insensibility. When he was in a sober state he was shy; he would not let me have a pound; and when he talked about being exchequered he would let me have any sum.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. When he said he should leave the country this surprised you - A. Very much.</p>
               <p>Q. He was what is called a stingy man - A. Yes, quite so.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it ago that he told you he was going to leave the country on account of his going to be exchequered - A. The first time is about four months ago, and the last time between two and three months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you why he expected to be exchequered - A. That he had not purchased his land-tax right. I could not get it out of his head that it was not so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he accompany the expression that any person had threatened to exchequer him. Have you any doubt that he told you that Mr. Burrows said he should be exchequered - A. I think he said it was in consequence of Mr. Burrows and his neighbours that he should be exchequered.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that Mr. Burrows said he should be exchequered, or threatened him - A. No, I cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know, Mr. Withers, whether that was after you had carried the message to Mr. Burrows about lopping the trees - A. I think it was before, but I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the habit of borrowing money of Mr. Bowler - A. Not for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you borrow money for Mr. Burrows more than once - A. Only once I borrowed the money for Mr. Burrows. I think that was about four or five months back. I applied for it to Mr. Bowler. I took the draft up from Mr. Bowler to Burrows for two hundred pound upon Mr. Bowler's banker.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he kept a large account - A. Sometimes he did. I do not think he has drawn any drafts himself within these two months. I have not seen him draw them. I used to receive the money of the salesmen, and pay it over to Mr. Bowler. We settle the commission since, once every three weeks; and I have been in the habit of receiving his rents: last quarter-day I received some: at lady-day I received thirty or forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. The farm of two hundred acres, where he lives, is his own - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that he threatened to destroy himself. He consulted with you what would become of his property - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What woman has he to take care of his house - A.

               <p>Q. Who manages his farm - A. He himself employed his men. It is a meadow farm. He superintends his hay-making, and sometimes he left it to an old man, who rode about, and gave directions. He used to pay his men chiefly. When I have been there I have observed that he paid his men. I live about three quarters of a mile from him.</p>
               <p>Q. This last five months have you been much at his house - A. I have, perhaps, every day, and sometimes I have not been there for a fortnight. I used to walk up there every day, knowing him in this situation.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you have heard him use this expression, d - n your eyes, and that, to his housekeeper - A. He was a man of course expressions.</p>
               <p>Q. What near relations has he - A. The nearest relations are me and my wife, and Mr. and Mrs. Barnjam.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect who used to shave this man - A. I believe he used to shave himself.</p>
               <p>Q. After he mentioned of destroying himself, how came you to permit him to use a razor - A. I do not know. I was not always there. I could not help it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take some step of having his person taken care of - A. For the reason that I before said: a delicacy. That is the reason we had, or we should have taken out a commission of lunacy against him. I saw him shave himself once. I was not in the house at the time he shaved himself then.</p>
               <p>Q. After having told you that he meant to destroy himself, you permitted him the use of such a dangerous weapon. Do you mean to state that it was from motives of delicacy that prevented you from having his person taken care of - A. Nothing but that. I was afraid the world would have said that we had taken his property improper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your wife know that he had made that threat of destroying himself - A. I think she did, and I think she mentioned it to Dr. Hyatt.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know, why you did not take some steps to secure this man - A. Only for the reason that I have stated; from motives of delicacy; that the world might not say that we had locked up the man for the sake of taking his property; I being only one. There are two more brothers.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say, that he used to rise at an early hour in the morning - A. Yes. He used to rise sometimes at three in the morning, within these last three or four months. He used to send for me as soon as he was up, two or three times in an hour. I have seen him at seven o'clock, and at six o'clock, playing at cards. I found them playing at cards when I went there. After playing at cards he has walked with me down the road; he would leave me by myself, and return home to his own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not seen him superintending his farm the same as other farmers would do, who had farms of the same description - A. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Down to the 30th of May - A. I have seen him in the fields, walking across, but I cannot tie myself to any time.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say the first day he called upon you - A. He said he wished to make an alteration in his former will. I told him, I would wait on him in the evening.

I took down the alteration that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010018"></xptr> wished to be made. I have destroyed it, as I always do when I make the will.</p>

               <p>Q. Open the will. Look at the signature of the testator. Was there any body else in the room besides the witnesses - A. There was a person of the name of Foster; he was present when the will was read.</p>

               <p>Q. From all that you observed at that time have you any doubt that he was perfectly capable of executing his will - A. I thought he was in his proper senses at that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What do you mean by</p>
               <p>="that time:=" do you mean that he was not, or had not been, in a fit state, when you made use of that expression</p>
               <p>="that time=" - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you speak of a former period that he was not fit to do it, when was that - A. Near two months before.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Withers thought he was not in a fit state at that time - A. Yes. I said, I thought he was quite correct. Some time before that he appeared in a low desponding way. He told me that he had made some mistake on the subject of his land-tax. He had considerable property about his abode.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Did that low state that you describe give you any caution about him - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. You had made wills for him before - A. Yes, one.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this desponding state that he was in. You were a collector of taxes - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you received any of him about two months before - A. I received some on the 5th of April, and about the 16th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. At these times did he appear capable of conducting his own business - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he count out, himself, the bank-notes with which he paid you - A. Certainly. He asked me the amount the last time he paid me, and he gave me the amount.</p>

             - A. Yes, for thirty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you during that time been in the habit of transacting business together - A. I have been at parish business with him. I have been at parish meetings. He was not there at Easter. He was in a low desponding way. On the 28th of May last I was at Bowler's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect hearing of Mr. Burrows being shot - A. Yes, on the Saturday. It was Thursday when I heard the instructions. Mr. Bowler said he wished to make a fresh will. Mr. Wheatley prepared it the day before, and he read it over by the desire of Mr. Bowler. I was present when Bowler first gave instructions about the will. It was at Bowler's house. I heard him tell Mr. Wheatley what he wished to do with his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe Wheatley writing of what he said - A. I did. I was there until Wheatley had taken the whole of the instructions. I went to retire, but Bowler desired me to remain there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the whole of the instructions given by Bowler himself - A. By Bowler himself.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time when he was giving these instructions how did Bowler appear - A. He appeared to be very well, to what I have seen him since Christmas. From what past, and what he said, I thought he was in a perfect state to do business. I attended the next day, when the will was executed. I heard the will read over. No one was in the room but Wheatley, and Bowler, and me; no one else. The three witnesses came in at the desire of Mr. Bowler. Mr. Bowler opened the door, and called in the witnesses; and even Bowler sent his servant for Mr. Oby and Kidney. I was present. He went part of the way for one, and returned again, and said, that Oby would be there in a few minutes, and Mr. Kidney too. He mentioned the names of both of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You were present when he executed the will in the presence of these two persons - A. Yes. They all three came in, and they were all three in the room when the will was executed by him.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came in, and when Wheatley read the will over to him, was there any thing in Bowler's manner that induced you, in your mind, to believe that he was not capable of executing his will. Was there any thing about him that he appeared to be a man not sound in his senses - A. Not that day, but before there had. Two months before that time I thought the man would drown himself. I thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010019"></xptr> him in a poor low way.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately, before he gave the instructions, had you seen him - A. About a fortnight. I called at his house to know how he did. He seemed to be mending very fast. I saw him, at one time, laying on a bed in the kitchen. I persuaded him to go into the country. I told him I thought it would be a great benefit to his health. He said, he was going to Mr. Penfold, in Oxfordshire, 60 or 70 miles off.</p>
               <p>Q. How long, before the execution of this will, was the conversation about Penfold - A. About a fortnight or three weeks. He did not tell me what he wanted to see him for. After the will was executed, I should think I remained there about an hour. He told me that Mr. Lovett, his banker, was in the same way that he was in, his low desponding way. A conversation took place, concerning farming; Mr. Bowler joined in conversation; he talked rationally, and very well collected in his mind to what I had seen him before. I saw nothing wrong; if I had, I certainly should have mentioned it to Mr. Wheatley about the will not being executed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Q. to Mr. Wheatley. Shew Mr. Kidney the signature in that will.</p>
               <p>MR. KIDNEY. That is my signature and handwriting. I am a farmer. Mr. Bowler sent a boy after me, and I went up to Mr. Bowler: when I came there I found Bowler and Foster together, and Kelsey, another subscribing witness. Mr. Wheatley told us what we were wanted for, in Bowler's presence. Mr. Wheatley asked me to witness the will. Bowler said nothing to me: it was all prepared and laid down. I saw Bowler sign and deliver it as his last will and testament. He appeared to me calm and collected. At that time I saw nothing the matter with him. I saw him the morning he shot Mr. Burrows: he walked up to me, in the road by Jones's shop: he asked me to tell

             to buy him a load of straw, and to send it to Lord Canarvon: I told him I would: that was all that passed between us. This might be ten or twelve minutes before the blunderbuss went off. He had not the blunderbuss in his hand at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were you when the blunderbuss went off - A. Some way on towards London.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time that he was talking to you to send the straw to Lord Canarvon, was another man, of the name of Kidney, with him - A. No, not when I was.</p>
               <p>MR. OBY. I live in Ealing. I am a victualler. I have known the prisoner twenty years. I have seen him frequently pass my house, as it is between his house and London. On Thursday night I went to his house to attest a will. Mr. Bowler sent a boy for me. When I went, Mr. Bowler met me in the yard; he told me, he found himself in a middling way. He said he would trouble me to witness his will. I told him I would do it certainly. When I went into the room Mr. Foster was there, and Kelsey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Bowler write his name, and put the seal to it. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him declare it to be his will - A. After he had put his seal to it, he sealed it, and delivered it as his last will and deed. Mr. Wheatley recalled it, and then he delivered it as his last will and testament.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when you first saw him in the yard, and when he executed his will, how did he seem in his mind - A. I did not notice him out of the regular way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear a man capable of performing so serious an act - A. Yes: I was particularly attentive in consequence of a circumstance. I met Mr. Bowler about a month before: I asked him how he did; he said he was quite well. I found myself surprized, and told him, I was glad to hear it. When we were parting, he put his hand to his head. He said, I have a complaint in my head. I have frequently a giddiness coming in my head. It struck me from the report that went about the neighbourhood, there might originate his disease. I considered him in a fit state to make his will. If I had had any reason to suppose that he was not, I should have objected to it.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, at Harrow.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Bowler - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose desire did you attend the execution of that will - A. By Bowler's. Mr. Bowler opened the door, I believe. The door was opened; I went in: Bowler might say, sit down; if he did, that was all. I waited for Oby and Kidney.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation with Bowler during that time - A. I do not recollect any.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his executing the will - A. I remember his signing the will: at that present moment he appeared to me to be perfectly in his senses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You say, at that present moment, he seemed to be in his senses. You knew before that he was not - A. I only knew that by report.</p>
               <p>COURT. Would the prisoner, Bowler, say any thing for himself to the jury, he is now at liberty to do it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>MR. HYATT. Q. You are a surgeon and apothecary, living at Ealing - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you have known the defendant full twelve years - A. Full that time. I have been in the habit of seeing him frequently, by attending a servant of his. On the 9th of July I was sent to him: he was taken in a fit, as he was on horseback, in an hay-field.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you first saw him, was he in a state of sensibility - A. He was in a complete state of insensibility. I attended him for that about ten days: he recovered by slow degrees; but his memory never was perfect from that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What effect did the fit produce upon the body - A. It left a very serious effect upon the head.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he when first you came to him after the fit? Did he foam at the mouth - A. Yes; there was a slight portion of saliva at his mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. You bled him, I believe - A. I bled him largely. In consequence of that bleeding he recovered, by degrees; in a few weeks he got tolerably well, so that he could walk about.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him frequently since - A. Frequently. I don't think he has ever perfectly recovered his memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010020"></xptr> Q. From his complaint, he had a considerable injury in his head; did that continue - A. He complained of a something in his head; from that time, until this unfortunate business took place, he complained that he had an uneasiness in his head: but, he was so positive a man, I could not prevail upon him to take any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being called to him in March - A. On the 19th of last March I was sent to him by one of his daughters, unknown to him. I saw him. I found him labouring under a great depression of spirits, and his head was seriously affected. I told him I wished him to let me do something to relieve it. He put himself in a violent passion, and swore he would take nothing. On the 30th of March I was sent for again. I found him labouring under a severe affection of the head, and a great depression of spirits. His pulse was small at ninety. I said, friend Bowler, what is the matter with you? He said, I do not know; my head is not well. He said, they want to take my estate from me. I said, you must endeavour to rouse from the idea of their taking your estate; who can touch your estate, or a guinea, or a shilling that you have in the world? but he still persisted in the notion. I endeavoured to free him from that affection, but without effect. I saw him on the following day. I sent him a blister. I found that gave him some relief, but still he had this idea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you continue seeing Bowler from the 31st of March - A. I was in the habit of calling upon him after I had done attending him. I had a number of patients in that village, and frequently called upon him, almost three times a-week, until the time of the unfortunate accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his symptoms a continuing sort, as that which you have described - A. Either more or less. He was never entirely free from that lowness of spirits, and the affection of the head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. You say, when you left attending this man, you were in the habit of seeing him two or three time a-week - A. Almost every week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him riding about his fields - A. Yes; but not lately. He has entirely neglected his business for the last eight or nine months. He has always neglected every thing. When I saw him I met with him at his own house. Sometimes I have met him walking over the bridge of the canal, walking about carelessly as if about no business. I went to him at his house at first. During the whole time I have known him he never was at my house. I have asked him years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. In July, when you first attended him in that fit, his head was affected - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state that the appearance of this person was such that he was incapable of transacting his own concerns - A. He certainly has, latterly.</p>
               <p>Q. In July, 1811, and a little time after that, do you mean to state from that time, until the month of March in this year, that he was a person, and you considered him incapable of managing his own affairs - A. That is my opinion; and I beg leave to state as to his insibility from the disordered state of his mind and intellects. One morning I went in, he had a small bit of paper with figures on it. He said, Hyatt, sit down, in a few minutes I will speak to you. It was a very trifling thing. He threw it down, and said, Withers must do it.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is this: from July, 1811, to the 30th of May, do you think he was in a fit state to be trusted - A. I do not think he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Thinking he was an unsafe person to be trusted did you ever recommend to his relations to have him put under restraint - A. We had a consultation upon this subject prior to the unfortunate accident. I did not give a positive opinion. I said, I would see him again in the course of a few days. It had been in agitation some days to take out a commission of lunacy against him.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is this: during that period, when you think it was unsafe his going about, on account of his own hands, did you, during that period, recommend him being put under restraint or confinement - A. I unfortunately did not. I am very sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the first time you had some consultation was the Wednesday before this unfortunate affair took place - A. We had some consultation, not particularly on the Wednesday, about a fortnight or ten days before.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was some conversation at that time - A. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it proposed by other persons - A. It was proposed to me; it did not originate with me. I then intended, the first opportunity, to give my opinion to the family. It was my full intention to recommend him being put under restraint, the next time I had seen any of the family.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing whether he was a violent man or not - A. I always considered him a positive and violent man, both before the 11th of July, and more particularly since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do I understand you right? At the time that you ceased to attend him as a medical man, you saw him down to the month of May every week - A. I think I can safely say I never missed a-week without seeing him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, during that time, you think he never perfectly recovered the lowness of spirits, and the affection of the head - A. It is my firm opinion that he never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he was in such a situation he did not know what he did - A. I do not think he did at times. He acted under a wonderful depression of spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is: during the whole of that time whether he was not in a state to exercise his mind, to know whether he was doing right or wrong - A. I do not think he was, perfectly. His recollection was much better at times than others.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not think, at any part of that time, he was a man that knew what he was about - A. Not entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have a complaint in his head: do you mean to say that it was to that extent that he was incapable of acting as a rational being - A. I think he was, a greater part of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you distinguish what part he was, and what part he was not - A. At times, as I observed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010021"></xptr> before, he was better than at others, but never had his intellects perfectly clear.</p>
               <p>DR. AINSLEY. Q. I need not ask you whether you are a physician - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the symptoms that the last witness has described the symptoms of an apoplectic fit. He saw Mr. Bowler at the termination of the fit - A. The symptoms of apoplexy and epileptic are so much alike, being a kind of a stupor, that I cannot say which it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Insanity is sometimes the consequence of fits of this kind - A. Very frequently.</p>
               <p>COURT. From both kinds - A. From both kinds, but not so frequently from apoplexy; from epilepsy very frequent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I believe you were called upon to attend this man after he was in confinement - A. I was, on the 11th of June. I found him in a deranged state, that derangement arising from false conceptions, from preceding events. Perhaps I should give you the account I received before I saw him myself.</p>
               <p>Q. We cannot hear that. Was he violent at that time - A. By no means so; very quiet; extremely so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you continue to visit him a good many times - A. I visited him four times, I think four successive days, then I omitted one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him the two following days. Did the continuance confirm or shake your opinion of derangement - A. Confirm it.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your practice you must have seen a great number of persons deranged - A. Certainly, a great number.</p>
               <p>Q. From the experience that you have acquired did it appear to you that his derangement might have been of a considerable standing - A. I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. And in the fit of last July, you find the adequate cause of it - A. I have no doubt it proceeded from that moment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You had never seen him before the 11th of June last - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the nature of his derangement at that time such as to act constantly, or subject to lucid intervals - A. Not to lucid intervals, but subject to various acts of violence, where there is a delusion on the subject; upon all other subjects the man can act as well as any person. Upon all subjects, except the subject of delusion they would think rationally and clearly. In the present state these parts of intellect are considerably weakened, and his memory imperfect, so that, perhaps, he has not a sound mind upon any subject, in any case where the derangement remains.</p>
               <p>Q. This man fell in this state from a fit in last July. Go into what you have observed. Your observation began upon this man on the 11th of June, last month - A. On the 11th, 12th, 13th, 15th, and 1st of July, I was with him. I was with him long enough to satisfy my own mind he was precisely the same. The second visit I was alone with him. I found he was perfectly quiet.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not believe, at any time previous to that, he could have given instructions for making a will with a perfect cognizance - A. If I had seen him the day before he made that will I should have said that he laboured under derangement.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day that he committed this act, from what you observed on the 11th of June, should you have supposed that on the 28th of May he had been executing his will - A. No, I should not. I conceive the disease to be in a regular progress.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The old delusion, acting on his mind, will lead him to do any act - A. Undoubtedly it will; and you will find the person, though he may mention it, yet will put his purposes into execution.</p>
               <p>COURT. Not conscious that he is doing wrong - A. Most likely.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember your master being attacked with a fit - A. Perfectly well. He was brought home, as I thought, a dead man.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, describe what happened in this fit. You will answer upon these general questions. Since that fit has his faculties and reason been affected - A. Ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have his habits of life been altered since that fit - A. Very much indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this fit, what time used he to get up in a morning - A. Four or five o'clock in summer. Since he had the fit, this summer, he has been up at two o'clock in the morning, or three o'clock in the morning. He has, for these three or four months past, got up at three in the morning. I do not recollect he did in winter.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he done so constantly, or has it only been once or twice - A. Constantly. He has his breakfast sometimes by five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he got his breakfast how used he to employ himself - A. He used to go in and out of doors, wandering about his premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear as if his mind was occupied about any business - A. He appeared to stare about, as if his mind was absent.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had got his breakfast what did he use to do then - A. He used to order me to bring the cards to him about six o'clock, after he had breakfasted.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he played at cards with you at that early hour, before he was visited with that fit - A. Oh, no; he was attending to his business then.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of playing at cards did he express any words of irritation - A. Yes, he did. One morning he told me that I was a d - d liar, and took up his stick, and went out. I had said no words to provoke him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it his general habit of playing at cards every day after breakfast - A. Every day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean since July last, every day - A. For two or three months past.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wetherall. Now, what time did he order his dinner to be got ready - A. Sometimes between eight and nine in the morning, and sometimes ten o'clock. This was constantly his habit the last two or three months. He would have his meat taken up when it has hardly been warm through.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether that was his mode of eating his victuals before this fit - A. Oh, dear, no; nobody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010022"></xptr> was more particular than him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he actually eat it in that state - A. Very hearty.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in that state that the rest of the family would eat - A. No; we were obliged to eat bread and cheese.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it his habit, before the fit, to have short commons - A. No; none kept a better house than he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his going to walk out when it was going to rain - A. Yes. He would go and lay in the yard. I have frequently found him laying on the wet grass.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen any thing of this sort before the fit - A. Never. I would not let him lay down. I watched him narrowly for the last three or four months. I expected he would do some mischief to himself; then I used to watch him. When he laid down I used to go to him, when the grass has been as wet as it could be.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, since he has had the fit was your master in the habit of singing - A. Yes: psalms and songs. He very seldom sung before except when he was tipsy; and since the fit it has been common for him to sing psalms or songs in the morning. I never knew him do it before, except when he was tipsy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him say any thing with respect to his destroying himself - A. He very frequently said he would come it thus. He made a motion with his hand to his throat. I heard him say he should like to get on the top of the house to have a very nice jump.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he to jump - A. Into the yard, I believe. I understood that was what he meant: and he said, he had written a letter, to put in the newspaper, that he was mad.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect at any time taking a rope from him - A. I saw him coming out of the parlour with a rope in his hand. I took it out of his hand. He took a rope out of his pocket, and put it in the kitchen drawer. Soon after he took it out again. He said, he was going to wring some pigs. There were no pigs to wring at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure the rope afterwards - A. Yes; I took it out of his pocket. I went into the shed. He kept looking up at the beams. He said nothing at all, but walked out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this about the time that he had the rope - A. Yes; the very day that he had taken the rope.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and your fellow servant watch him of nights - A. Yes. We have set up for weeks together. We were fearful that he should do some harm to himself. I have gone to his bed-room and taken away his garters and his knife. That was the last time I thought he would murder himself. My master's own daughter desired me to do this.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her name - A. Mrs. Withers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the Thursday before Mr. Burrows was shot at - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What state was your master in on the Thursday - A. Much in the same state that he was in for the last two or three months. I did not see much difference.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to know whether on that day he was wandering about, and laid down on the grass - A. Yes; and he played at cards a good part of the day. I believe he went to London in the morning: I would not positively swear it. On the Friday he was playing at cards nearly the whole day, and nearly at night he played with his daughter. He expressed a wish that he should like to play at all-fours; and he was actually playing at all-fours at the time. He went to bed between two and three, and on the Thursday and on Wednesday the same.</p>

               <p>Q. On the Saturday morning how did he set off - A. He got up in the morning: he ordered his chaise-cart, and about an hour afterwards he altered his mind, and ordered his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that morning had he ever rode to London on horseback - A. Not for four or five years. He always went to London in a chaise-cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him set out in the morning - A. No. I was backwards, feeding the fowls.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any blunderbuss in the house - A. Yes; this blunderbuss laid in the corner of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. When your master went out did you miss this blunderbuss - A. No, I did not. I was busy. I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you aware of his taking the blunderbuss with him when he went out that morning - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. On that morning, when he went out, do you recollect his leaving the premises - A. I was not in the house; he got up about four o'clock that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sleep alone - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you had the first apprehension of his cutting his own throat - A. About three months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the habit of shaving him - A. He did it sometimes himself. At the time that he was ill he had a man to shave him.</p>
               <p>Q. After he recovered, for this last twelvemonth, has he shaved himself - A. Yes. He kept the rasor in his own drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did he use to shave himself - A. Sometimes once a-week. When he was well he shaved three times a-week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate to the family, to his daughter, that he made that threat - A. Yes; and he said the same to his daughter. She gave us instructions to take care of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it he kept the razor locked up - A. In his bureau.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he keep the key of that bureau. You went into the room and took out his knife and garters, why did not you take the key where he kept his razors - A. Because I did not like to go to the bureau, where the money was.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you take the key, and take his daughter, or some of the family, to his bureau, to see what you did - A. It ought to have been done.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did not do it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you put the fire arms away - A.I ought to have done it. I did not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, that after he had the fit, July 1811, he was in the habit of going to bed about two or three o'clock nightly - A. Yes; for the last three or four months past, that was his constant habit; and sometimes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010023"></xptr> he would get up at two o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. And you say, on the Thursday, before this happened, he went to bed at the same time, and got up at the same time. Did you see him go to bed on Thursday - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he get up the next morning - A. At four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure he was in the room all that time - A. I am positive; and, on the Friday, he went to bed between two and three.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps, after he went to bed, on that day, you went in his room - A. No; I did not, as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him get up the next morning - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On Thursday, between two and three o'clock, where were you - A. About the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you on the afternoon of Friday - A. At home.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body came in or out, could they come in or out without your seeing them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he come down stairs without your seeing - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He went to bed, on Thursday and Friday, at what time - A. Between two and three o'clock, and was up stairs till four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive to that time - A. Yes; and I will swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have mentioned, in the hearing of the Court, that, for the last two or three months, it has been his daily habit: do you mean, that he did that on the Wednesday, before Mr. Burrows was shot - A. He did; and there he was until the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. And your business keeps you to the lower part of the house - A. It does.</p>
               <p>Q. No person can come in without your seeing it - A. No; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. So, that if your master had been down stairs, with any person, transacting business, you must have seen it - A. I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, to the questions I put to you, you are sure of all this - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. The fact of Mr. Burrow's being shot, on the Saturday, brought to your mind, and that makes you so sure of it. You know Mr. Wheatley, the man who has been examined here, and you know Mr. Foster - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the habit of seeing your master - A. Yes, frequently; I know their persons well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. Wheatley coming there on Wednesday - A. I do; he was there on the Wednesday afternoon. My master did not go to bed so early.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go to bed - A. I cannot positively say what time he went to bed, on account of Mr. Wheatley and Foster being the.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he went to bed so soon on the Thursday - A. Yes; I am.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of - A. I am: Mr. Wheatley and Foster were there on Wednesday afternoon. There was Mr. Oby there, and Mr.

               <p>Q. Where was your master at that time - A.At home.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, recollect what time he went to bed the time of night you have been stating, positively - A. Yes; I have; but I did not recollect their being there. I ask pardon.</p>
               <p>Q. I asked you the question, whether he went to bed at the usual hour? you told me, over and over again, that you were positive, at the usual hour. How came you to tell me, when I put these questions to you, over and over to you, that on Wednesday and Thursday you recollected that he went to bed between two and three o'clock - A. If no one was there he was certain to go to bed at that hour. He usually used to go to bed if nobody was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know what they came about - A. They came about some business. I did not see them do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the room while they were there - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any papers there - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe Foster and Wheatley there on Thursday - A. I did, on Thursday or Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, it was the day that Mr. Oby was there. Did you see them there the day before that - A. Yes; my master was in bed when they came, and I called him up. I had hard work to prevail upon him to get up.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell me, that your master went to bed at the usual hour, and never got up until that early hour. How came you to tell me so positively; and now you tell me, that on Wednesday he was gone to bed? Why did not you mention that before - A. I did not think of it. My master has been in the habit of going to bed, for two or three months past, so early, I did not recollect them people coming when you asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. During the last two or three months, who paid the bills - A. Mr. Withers has been in the habit of paying the bills.</p>
               <p>Q. How many day labourers has he - A. Three, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not he employed so many as five, six, or seven men - A. Not in winter time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid them men weekly - A. Himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Who ordered them to go to work - A. He ordered them himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave orders to them to where the hay was to go to - A. Master; and sometimes he told them wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect your master giving orders to bind hay for particular customers - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. During these three months, was not he walking about his grounds as usual - A. No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear, on those days, to know what he was about - A. No; he did not. I think he did not know the difference between right and wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went out with him on Saturday morning - A. I do not know that any body was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went out with him - A. I was not in the house when he went out, so I could not see any body go out when I was not in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wetherall. Has he appeared for the last three or four months to know his business - A. No; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010024"></xptr> has not. He went into the rick-yard, and ordered them to bind clover, when there was no clover in the rick-yard.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have you any recollection what your master did, and how he conducted himself for the four or five days previous to this day the fact took place with Mr. Burrows - A. I saw no difference in him, to what it was for the last four or five months.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that he used to go to bed about three o'clock in the afternoon. You first said he did so on the Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, before this happened to Burrows; since, you recollected - A. Yes. I ask your pardon.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you perfectly recollect - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke of one day, when Foster and Wheatley came, your master went to bed; you called him up again. Did you shew them into the house - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did you shew them into - A. Into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them that your master was gone to bed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that correct. Have you a perfect recollection of it - A. I have a perfect recollection of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he came down - A. A little while.</p>
               <p>Q.He staid to dress himself, I suppose - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time Wheatley and Foster came to him - A. No, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your master gone to bed the other day, before they came - A. No; only one evening. The day that Mr. Foster and Wheatley came by themselves my master was in bed, but not the other day; he had nobody with him the second day.</p>
               <p>Q. When Oby and Wheatley came - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they come - A. I cannot positively say what time they came.</p>
               <p>Q. What kept him up - A. His daughter was with him I believe, but that would not have kept him up.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember the time the man at the bar had a fit - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state of mind has he been in since - A. I have considered him to be in a very agitated state of mind, and particularly at the times I have seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing him on the 26th of May - A. Yes. I saw him at his own house, or rather in his garden. He appeared extremely agitated. He was laying on a bench, under an oak tree. His hand was under the bench. He did not appear to see us, or take any notice, and on one of the gentlemen speaking, he jumped off the bench in a wild and agitated way, and he came and shook hands with us. I asked him, how he did. He replied, very well, and he immediately left me. He walked down his garden. He made some ridiculous observation. A short time afterwards he came in doors, took up his hat, and left us. He said, he had given one of the carriages in the yard to Dr. Hyatt. I said, what is the good of it; it is a rotten one. He said, oh, no, it is a good one. He was going to have it new mounted, and hung round with Morris bells: and, in our walking down to the bridge, I observed that Jones's was a good house. He observed, it was a good house, but he built it for a ballad-singer. At that time, Jones, the blacksmith, was living there. I was satisfied in my own mind that he did not know what he said, or what observations he made to me.</p>
               <p>Q. After he was taken in custody, and was taken to prison, did you visit him - A. Yes. I visited him on Sunday morning, after he was committed. He appeared to be in the same state of mind as when I saw him before he was in custody. He told me that he had shot a cow, and a sow, and a child; and he should have shot me if he saw me; and he had shot Burrows.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he shot any cow or sow - A. Not one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You are the brother of a son-in-law of the prisoner - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were there on the Tuesday - A. Yes. It was then near two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And you talked about going to see his daughter - A. I asked him if he would go and see his daughter; and when we had walked about an hundred yards beyond this blacksmith's shop he went back again.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you dine with him last - A. Perhaps two or three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been at his house - A. Only that Tuesday, since Christmas, I believe, not for a length of time, I was not at his house. I have been there since Christmas, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day used you generally to call - A. I called very seldom. If I looked in by chance it was in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. On these occasions did you observe any thing particular in his behaviour - A. One morning I had my gun in my hand; he said, he had a good deal of game in his fields. He wished me to go round them. He did not offer to go with me. I did not go. I knew there were no hares there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever ask you to dine with him - A. No; not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him in prison - A. I saw him twice in New Prison, and I think once in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went there with you - A. Mrs. Barnjam and his other daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him in his house, was he walking about - A. Yes; mopeing by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at his house on the 30th of May - A. Yes; I called there. I did not see him. I don't know where he was. I was at his house the next day. I did not see him then.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and neighbour of Mr. Bowler. I have known him forty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him within the last two or three months - A. Yes; once or twice a-week.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made any observation upon the manner he has conducted himself; was it like a sensible man, or otherwise - A. Not like a sensible man at all. He talked as though he was out of his senses. He complained of his head being bad. He laid across two or three chairs at his own house, before a large fire.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Have you seen him in the rick-yard with his men - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you usually go there - A. When I had an opportunity: sometimes in the morning and sometimes in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010025"></xptr> Q. Have you gone as late as four or five o'clock - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Within the last three months, previous to the 30th of May, have you been there at four o'clock - A. Very seldom at that hour. Sometimes he has been gone to bed. I seldom called so late as four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him an horseback within the last two or three months - A. I do not think that I did.</p>
               <p>CHAREOTTE PEARCE. Q. You are a servant to Mr. Bowler - A. Yes. I have lived with him upwards of seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember that he fell off his horse, and had a fit - A. Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his conduct before that time the same as after the fit - A. No, sir, not at all like it.</p>
               <p>Q. After the fit he was attended by the doctor - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was attended by the doctor, what used to be his way then - A. He talked in a very wild way. He said, that he went under ground to Harrow church, and he saw the angels.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his saying any thing about going up to the top of his house - A. Yes: he said, he should like to go to the top of the house, and have a jump down. Within this last three or four months he has talked about leaving his home. He mentioned, that something was the matter at the office about his land-tax. He has gone to bed by three o'clock, and from that till four.</p>
               <p>Q. For the last three or four months how has he employed himself in the morning - A. Sometimes walking about, and sometimes playing at cards with his housekeeper, Mrs. Hagan.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he attending his business when he was walking about - A. No, he was not. He was walking about like one quite lost, and sometimes he would sit down, and sometimes lay down in the wet grass until we called him. He has got up at three o'clock in the morning. He has dined at half after eight in the morning; and he has provided two pounds of meat for half a dozen people.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to stint you before he had the fit - A. No, nobody kept a better house. After the fit he has had it taken up raw. I heard him talk about cutting his throat</p>
               <p>Q. Within these last three or four months you frequently saw him playing at cards; did it appear to you that he knew what he was about - A. No; he seemed quite ignorant. One day, when he was playing at cards he said he should like to play at all-fours; he did not know he was playing at all-fours. Sometimes he would sing psalms, and sometimes songs.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you of opinion that he was in his right mind - A. No, sir, I don't think he was in his right mind. He always appeared, since the fit, to me to be in a state of derangement.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You have lived with him how long - A. Upwards of seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not prefer living with a madman more than living with a man in his senses, would you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Notwithstanding you have not left him to go in another situation - A. We did not think him so bad as he was. In March we sat up with him a week, and several times, when we found him at the worst, we never went to bed and left him</p>
               <p>Q. You never had such an opinion of him as that he did not know good from evil - A. I knew he did not know what he was about very often. I don't think he knew good from evil.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he always a passionate man, and always a scolding - A. He was as most other people are. He did not scold so much since he had the fit as he did before.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did he talk of going under ground and seeing angels - A. Frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that at the times that you sat up with him - A. It was during these last three and four months.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was in bed, and could not sleep, he used to talk about angels - A. Yes; ever since the time he had the fit, at nights and days too.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever put your candles out of nights since he has been in this strange way - A. Sometimes we have burnt a light all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how long has it been since you have burnt a light all night - A. This three or four months.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the meat; he got it, did not he - A. No, he sent for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it ago since he talked about cutting his throat - A. Ever since the beginning of March; and about his hanging himself.</p>
               <p>Q. You never put the razors out of the way - A. They were locked up in a drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the key - A. I do not know: mistress I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you call the housekeeper, Mrs. Hagan, your mistress - A. Yes. We took the razor away; and when he was ill we sent for some one to shave him.</p>
               <p>Q. He could not take the key, and got the razor any time he pleased - A. No; and there was always one by when he did.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to his singing psalms and songs, what time of the day was this - A. Eight or nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. That was dinner time - A. Yes. He did not take long to eat his dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to his playing at cards with your mistress; did that happen every day - A. Not every day.</p>

               <p>Q. Sundays excepted - A. He would ask for them on Sunday, sometimes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean to say, that you have seen him shave himself - A. Yes, I have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have seen the housekeeper give him the razor - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that was the constant course - A. Yes; when we thought him at the worst.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you thought him at the worst, and the housekeeper used to give him the razor - A. I cannot tell you the particular day we used to give him the razor.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it; the days that he was better, had he the care of the razor then - A. Not within the last three or four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Then within the last three or four months he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010026"></xptr> never had the charge of the razor - A. No; not when we thought he would hurt himself.</p>
               <p>Q. And then the housekeeper kept the key - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you have seen done - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MRS. WITHERS. Q. You are the daughter of Mr. Bowler - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your father having a fit in July last - A. Perfectly. I was sent for. I live about half a mile off my father.</p>
               <p>Q. What state was he in when you arrived at his house - A. He appeared to me lifeless. He remained so for some time, until Dr. Hyatt let him blood; then he shewed symptoms of life.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, from that time has his mind been in the same state it was before, or in a different state - A. Very different. Before the fit he had the perfect use of his understanding.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he ever been in his right mind since - A. I don't think he has.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, shortly afterwards, seeing him with a relation of your's - A. Yes. He came after me. He produced a lock. He said, it was a lock the shepherds used to look the sheep with, in the time of our Saviour. He conversed in a very incoherent way. He said, he had been under ground, to the different church-yards. He had been to Perrywell and Harrow. He had seen people whom he had formerly known. He knew who were happy, and who were otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this conversation once or twice, or many times - A. Many times.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of this last spring what state has he been in - A.Apparently getting worse. He appeared less capable of looking after his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he low - A. Yes, very at times. He has distressed me very much. About the 26th of March he said, he was very ill. He said, I must come this. I begged him not to distress me by so talking. He said, he should not live long, and he was fearful that I should not enjoy the estate. He wished me to come and take possession of the estate. He has another daughter and grand children. He told me at another time that he wished to have a ladder placed to reach the top of the house; he thought it would be a very nice jump. He first said, he wished to be buried at Perrywell, and then he again said it was of little consequence, he would be buried at Harrow. He would have a stone, but they would break it, and if they did he would hang them for it. I sent for Mr. Hyatt, and gave orders to the servants to take every thing out of his way, knives, &amp;c. I thought he would make away with himself.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before this unhappy business did you recommence your visits to him - A. I think the first time I saw him again was a week or ten days before the 30th of May. His mind then was very confused and disordered. He did not appear to be in his right mind then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there on the day it happened - A.No. I saw him on the day before. I called on him on the Friday, and staid there a short time. He did not appear to be in his right mind then. I saw him on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the day he executed his will, we understand - A. I believe it was.</p>

            . I am a farmer. I live in the parish of Ealing. I have known Mr. Bowler forty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his having a fit about a year ago - A. Perfectly well. I found him altered within this seven or eight weeks back. At this time, that I have been with him, I have been doing a job for him. On the Thursday before this unfortunate business happened, Bowler said to me, are you going home, Filby. I said, yes. He said, stop a bit, and I will go with you. When he came to me, he said, I have altered my will. So I find, said I. He then said, what do you think I have left Will Withers? I have left him Drury-lane, St. Giles's, and the Pantheon in Oxford-street. I said, you are a joking. He said, if it is a joke, it is a true joke. A few days before, he said, Filby, I must leave my home: they are going to hang me. He said, I can live an hundred miles off as well as I can here; and I have chose you to look after my business. I have seen him playing at cards three times in one day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You had worked for him, in the course of your long acquaintance, before this time, I take it for granted - A. I worked for him twenty-eight years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he himself give you any orders - A. No other than the first day he asked me if I would come and bind some hay. He had discharged his hay-binder. He would ask me what I had done. I said, I had bound so much; he would say, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he pay you - A. I was paid so much per load.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you accompt to - A. Mr. Barnjam, after this affair happened. I was only there about seven days. Mr. Bowler gave me victuals. I dined with him one day. We had a shoulder of mutton for dinner. It came on the table at half after ten in the morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wetherall. After you came to him did he give you any orders - A. No: the foreman.</p>

            . Q. Are you acquainted with the prisoner - A. Yes. On the 26th of May I went into his house. I found him in the garden, laying on a bench, under a tree. He appeared agitated. I mentioned it to other people, that if he was not taken care of, he would do himself, or somebody else, a mischief.</p>
               <p>MR. PARNELL. I am a brewer at Isleworth. I have known Mr. Bowler twenty years, or upwards. I have been very intimate with him. On the 27th of May I saw Mr. Bowler at his own house. I was desired to see him by both his sons-in-law. I understood they wanted a deed of trust. When I went into the house, he came to me, and said, I was going to send for you next Thursday. I was going to make my will. I said, I was very happy to hear it; a had will was better than no will at all. I told him, I should be glad to speak to him in the parlour. He went into the parlour, and I followed him. I said, Mr. Bowler, I understand you are going to settle your affairs by way of deed of trust. I wished him to consider what he was going to do, and to be thoroughly satisfied, as Mr. Withers was a relation, and he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010027"></xptr> interested. I wished him to let some friend, or gentleman, examine it, before he signed it. He assured me he would, or he never would speak more.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not Mr. Withers, the attorney for the prosecution - A. No. The prisoner said he should not sign it without I was present, and suddenly he started up in the chair; he said, I have left one Hedge-lane, and the other St. Giles's. I said, what did you say? Why, said he, I have left one Hedge-lane, and the other St. Giles's: what do you think of that?</p>
               <p>Q. What did you think of that conduct - A. I certainly thought he was not right in his mind.</p>

            . Q. I believe, for many years, you have had the care of insane persons - A. Yes, I have seen many thousands in my time.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoner was in confinement, you visited him - A. I first saw him on the 9th of June. I then had a long conversation with him, from which it appeared to me, that he laboured under mental derangement. I saw him every day, up to the time of the commission of lunacy being taken out, from the 9th of June to the 18th. I saw him daily. I had sufficient opportunity to confirm my first impression of his being a lunatic.</p>
               <p>Q. From the observation that you made, did it appear to you that this had been of some standing - A. It had the character of derangement arising from epilepsy.</p>
               <p>Q. You have the account, from the witnesses, of his state for some months past - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Supposing him to have had that fit, described in July, would these appearances have been the consequences of that fit - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Does his derangement consist in delusion of mind - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it common for deranged persons to conceive a dislike against some particular persons - A. It is the character of mental derangement, brought on by epilepsy. In that it is more characteristic than any other.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very common for them to conceive that enmity to the most dear friend - A. Frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereas, had they been in their right mind, they would do them the greatest good they could - A. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. In that kind of mental derangement, they would do the particular person the greatest injury, but not to another - A. Yes. I think it is very common for them to express it prior to the committing the act, expressing resentment towards the person, even, perhaps, that they would do the act. That is very common.</p>
               <p>Q. You apprehend that he did labour under some particular delusion - A. I am satisfied it applied particularly to Mr. Burrows. He imagined Burrows to be his secret enemy; that he had instigated the whole country against him; that he could not pass from his own house to the next village without being insulted by the women and children, in order, as he imagined, to deprive him of his property.</p>
               <p>Q. In ten days you found that - A. He was uniformly in that story, and stating a number of instances wherein Burrows had injured him; and I think it more likely that he would mention this circumstance, the injury and cure; more especially as he was under that delusion. I should have been surprised if it had not been mentioned. He never went into particulars. He did not state them as causes for shooting him. He stated, uniformly, that Burrows was the only person to whom he had resentment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. From the opportunity you have had many years of observing insane persons, have you any means of discerning whether they they are deranged, or whether they are not - A. I have not the least doubt, in this instance, that he is insane. He is uniformly the same, since the commission of lunacy as before, from all my observations. I am quite satisfied he has not imposed upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not a common symptom of derangement of one man to suppose that another man means to deprive him of his estate, and, under that delusion of mind, they would proceed to vengeance - A. No doubt, they uniformly do, if not taken care to prevent it.</p>
               <p>MR. WEBB. Q. You are the surgeon of Clerkenwell prison - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you called in to see Bowler - A. On Sunday, the day after his being committed: he was brought there on the Saturday night; and on the Sunday I saw him. From that time I have seen him from one to three times a day. At all the times I have seen him, his mind laboured under delusion, and that very strongly. And the first time I saw him he was in an irritable state. He was very obstinate. I desired that he might be removed to a room, and a person placed to have the care of him; and that no person should go near him. After that violent irritation went off, on Monday, he was more quiet: the delirium continued at that time even to the present.</p>
               <p>Q. You concur with Mr. Warburton, that he is in a state of insanity. That he is now insane - A. Perfectly.</p>
               <p>COURT. You have no doubt that he continues in a state of insanity. You mean, that he labours under that delusion - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated your opinion, that he still continues in a state of insanity. Is that from your being of opinion, that he labours under delusion of one particular subject, but not so upon others - A. On that one subject.</p>

               <p>Q. So as to be persuaded that certain persons have used him ill - A. His chief conversation was about Burrows; that he had been doing all that he could to get him in a jail.</p>
               <p>Q. In other respects, did he appear to know the consequence of his actions, and to know whether his actions were right or wrong - A. I should suppose he did at times.</p>
               <p>Q. From the examination and conversation you had with him, do you know whether he was sensible of his killing and shooting Mr. Barrows was a wrong thing - A. I don't think he had any idea he had shot Mr. Burrows, or, that he had been doing a wrong thing. He said, he had not seen Burrows; he had shot his cow, a sow, and a child. I said, you must have loaded your piece a good many times. He said, no; he had done it all at one shot.</p>

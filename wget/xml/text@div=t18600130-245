                  </hi>. I am a servant living at 4, Vauxhall-terraoe, Vauxhall<lb></lb>walk—on the night of 10th January I was walking along Dorey-street, Lambeth; it was about half-past ten as near as I can judge—two men came behind me, I never heard them, they sprung on me and grasped me with their hands round my throat—I placed my hand in my pocket to secure my watch; one of them after that let my throat go and made a snatch at my guard—I still kept hold of my watch—as they turned round, one of them came back and struck me in the eye—as they turned round to let my throat go I recognised the prisoner to be the man that struck me—I had never seen him before—he was brought back to me about five or ten minutes I afterwards—I have not the least doubt that the person brought back to me was one of the persons so engaged.</p>

               <p>me I could not have recognised either of you—you came behind me at first, and when you came and struck me in the eye I recognised you.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). I was on duty in Dorey-rtreet—I heard cries of "Police," and proceeded to the spot—I saw the prosecutor, and made some inquiries of him—I saw two persons running—I immediately sprung my rattle and pursued them—I did not catch either of them—when I got to the end of the street they had turned round the corner; I found the prisoner in the hands of the witness Kirby, and I took him in custody—they turned from Dorey-stroet into Regent-street—that is next to Prince's-alley—the prosecutor identified the prisoner immediately I took him back.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Regent-street, Lambeth—on the night, of 10th January, I heard the cries of "Murder" twice—I was in the Prince Regent public-house—I ran out to see what it was, and saw the prisoner running down Dorey-street from where the cries came—he turned to the left and was coming up Regent-street—the policeman cried out, "That is him, stop him"—I pursued him, caught him, and gave him up to the last witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was not in Dorey-street. I came from Kennington-road down Regent-street and was going home when this man stopped me, and said "I want you; you have been doing a murder." They took me to the station and then charged me with robbery, which I never have done in my life. I have been in a regiment these two years; I only came from Ireland last month. I came up on pass to see my father; I had to be back the next night. I am still a soldier; I have not a stain on my character.</p>

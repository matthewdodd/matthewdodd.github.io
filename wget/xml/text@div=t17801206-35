               <p>I came home on Tuesday night, the 14th of November, from work, and found my door broke open; I had padlocked it when I went out. I found the padlock broke off, and a box containing the things mentioned in the indictment, was taken from under my bed. I found the box broke open, and empty, in an uninhabited room under my room.

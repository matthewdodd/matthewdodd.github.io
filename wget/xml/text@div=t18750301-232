                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 4, Saunders Street, Lambeth—I have been living with the prisoner since June last—I had a child in No<lb></lb>vember, which was registered as Eliza Williams—on 23rd June I went to the Fountain public-house where the prisoner was talking to a young man—I gave him twelve shillings, and said "Take it and spend it with other girls"—I went out directly and he followed me and said "What is the matter, Suite, come in here and have something to drink"—we went in and he called for a glass of rum and hot water for me—we stopped there till about 8.30, and then left and got some meat for supper—we then went home to<lb></lb>gether, and were at home by 9 o'clock—we then had some words, and I said "Go and spend your money with other girls"—he said "Come and have supper," and I said "Go and get other girls to have supper with you"</p>

               <p>—I repeated that several times, and at last he got in a temper and stood up to give me a blow—he went to hit me, but the blow fell on the baby, which was in my arms, on the side of its head—I did not know that he had hurt the baby then, but he went to give me another blow, and struck the baby in the eye, and I fell down—after the first blow, I called out "Oh, my baby!"—Mary Taylor, who lodges upstairs with her husband, came down, but the prisoner did not do anything after that, though he remained quarrelling—I had been drinking from 6 to 8.30, and I had been drinking before that—I was not sober, and the prisoner was very drunk indeed—the baby seemed all right that night; it took the breast all right—the pri<lb></lb>soner took me round the neck and said "Come into bed, Susie," and I did so—he stopped there that night, and in the morning I saw a bruise on the baby's eye—it seemed very queer in the afternoon, and the prisoner said "Take it to a doctor"—I took it to Dr. Oswald between 2 and 3 o'clock, and he gave it some medicine—it had a fit in the evening—the doctor came next day, Monday, and it was still in fits, and the same on Tuesday, till about 9 o'clock, when the fits left it, and it died at 12.55, in the middle of the day.</p>

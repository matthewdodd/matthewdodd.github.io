                  <hi rend="italic">Mirage</hi>, merchant ship—I shipped at Shanghai, in China, last autumn—the prisoner was chief mate, Mr. Carter was the captain—there was a seaman on hoard of the name of James Tonson, a Frenchman—he shipped at Shanghai—we were not short of hands there that I know of—I do not know how many hands we had on hoard—I do not know the tonnage of the ship—Tonson was not in good health when I first saw him—he was lying in his hammock when I first saw him—he was sick at that time—I have no idea of the time at which we left Shanghai—we armed in the port of London six weeks yesterday—on the voyage home Tonson worked in the ship—he might sometimes work for a week, perhaps more, or less—at other times he was off work; that was from illness—I have seen the man shaking with fever and ague, till I have told him to go below and turn in—I remember being off the Western Islands—I saw Mr. Travers ill use Tonson about that time—he was in irons at one time—I do not know who pat him in irons, I saw him in irons—I do not know about what time that was—we were somewhere between the north east trades and the Western Islands—I do not know how many days' sail we were from the Western Islands—it might be three, four, or five days before the man's death that I saw him first in irons, I will not be rightly sure—I saw him in irons on the main deck, in front of the poop—it was by Mr. Travers's orders that he was put on the main deck in irons—I did not hear him give the orders—I saw him brought on deck, he had his hands in irons at that time—a seaman named Brackett brought him on deck, he placed him in front of the poop, with his back leaning against the front of the poop, and then Brackett put his feet in irons—he was very ill at that time—Mr. Travers went and got hold of the irons on his feet, and dragged him out in front of the poop, and said he should not have that much ease as to lean against the back of the poop; he should torture him as much as he could—this was about 8 o'clock at night—he was brought on deck after I came on deck, at 8 o'clock at night—he was kept in that state all night, lying on the wet deck, in irons, hands and feet, with his hands behind his back in irons—the weather was pretty cool at that time, cold enough for us to keep a monkey jacket on on deck—Tonson had on a cotton shirt, a pair of cotton wowsers, and a flannel sing<lb></lb>let; that is a thing that you wear underneath the shirt, a sort of jersey——he remained on deck in irons till I went below at 12 o'clock—I came on deck again at 4 o'clock next morning, and saw him lying there in the same manner—about 6 o'clock Mr. Travers went and took the irons off his feet, and off one hand, and told him to get up—the man looked up in his face, and made a motion with his feet, and could not, and he made a sort of groan, to try to speak—Mr. Travers then went and took the end of the main sheet—that is the end of a rope, about three inches thick, or between that and three inches and a half, and with that he beat Tonson all over all parts of the body, and over the head—I do not know how often he struck him; there were several places in his shirt where the blood was—I saw' that at that time—I do not know exactly how long he was beating him in that way; he gave him, it might be, ten or a dozen blows, more or less—Tonson did not say anything while he was being beaten, only moaned—after Mr. Travers had beaten him, he told him again to get up—the man tried to get up, and fell down—he then kicked him twice or three times in the ribs—I do not know what the prisoner had on his feet at the time—he then lifted the man up, and hove him between eight and nine feet on the deck, close against the mainmast—he lifted him bodily up by the back of the neck—I saw Tonson after he fell on the deck—he</p>

               <p>was then bleeding—one of the midshipmen, Mr. Parrani, wanted to go to the pump to serve out the ship's company's water for the day, and Tonson was in the way, Parram told Mr. Travers that he was in the way of the pump, and Mr. Travers came and told him to get up—he could not get up, and he took the end of the foretopsail brace and beat him in the same manner as before with that—that was a rope about the same size as the other—he beat him all over all parts of his body—I did not hear Tonson speak to the prisoner at that time, I never heard him speak anything that could be understood—he was able to talk English when he was well—after this beating, I perceived that Tonson was bleeding in several parts of the body and head—when the beating was over, he was sitting on the com binge of the after hatch—the prisoner picked him up and hove him to the after part of the hatch again, and hove him across the hatch—he was then trying to get up, and just as he got on his hands and feet, he fell with his cheek across the gunwale of a small boat that we had on deck (he had a swelled cheek) and cut his cheek across—that was from the fall—Mr. Travers then ordered a man of the name of James Long to go and wash him—I saw him washed, his shirt was not taken off—he then ordered me to go and get some warm clothing out of his chest, and dress him—the directions which the prisoner gave to Long were, "Long, go and get some water, and wash Ton<lb></lb>son"—I stripped him that day after he was washed—I observed marks of the rope all over his body, and marks of two kicks, and his head was cut in several places—the marks of the rope were bleeding—after Tonson was dressed in the warm clothing, he was placed in front of the poop, still on deck—the deck was wet at that time—I went below at 8 o'clock, and stopped till 12, and when I came on deck again, at 12, he was on deck again, sitting on the after hatch, and he was on deck those four hours—at 4 I went below again, and stopped till 6—I came on deck at 6, I am not sure whether Tonson was below or on deck then—I never saw him ill used after that—I saw him next morning—I saw him several times rolling about the deck as the ship rolled—I saw him next day on the quarterdeck, sitting on the hatch—he seemed to be very ill—his hands and feet were free at that time—I never saw them in irons after that—he was put into a spare cabin at night, below, in the cuddy—I recollect his death; it might be three or four days after he was beaten, or two or three days, I am not exactly sure—I was not with him when he died—I do not know where he used to mess between the time I first saw him in irons, and his death; I never saw him eat anything—the rest of the seamen used to mess together in the forecastle—I never saw anothing done to Tonson from the day I saw the prisoner beating him, up to the time of his death—I did not see him I after he was dead—I went below at 8 o'clock, and turned in, and after I had turned in one of the men came forward and told me he was dead—I did not see him after that; he had been thrown overboard before I came up.</p>

I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Miraye</hi>, on her voyage home from Shanghai—I shipped at Shanghai; Tonson was on board when I shipped—he was laid up sick when I first saw him—in the course of the voyage home I saw him in irons—I cannot tell the exact date of that, it was the latter part of Dec., or the fore part of Jan.—I think we were in about 27° or 28° N. at that time, as near as I can judge—I remem<lb></lb>ber seeing Tonson in the after cabin—he was then in double irons—he waa lying down—Mr. Travers took me into the state room where he lay—his hands were shackled behind him, and he had shackles on his feet—I think it was about five or six days before he died, as near as I can judge—I have got no memorandum—when Mr. Travers took me into the cabin, he told Tonson to get up—he made a faint move to get up, but he did not get up—it appeared to me that his hands being shackled behind him, he was too weak to rise in that state—upon that the prisoner kicked him twice with his foot, but not very heavily; he kicked him on the shoulders—I lifted Tonson up, and he was then brought on the quarter deck by Mr. Travers—the irons were first taken off his feet in the state room—I was left behind to bring him out—when he same on deck the irons were put on again—Mr. Travers put them on—while this was going on, Mr. Travers told him there would be no mercy shown him; and he told him if he wanted a stool, to do it in his pantaloons, a bucket of, water would wash it out in the morning—Tonson continued to be on the quarter deck till I went below, at 12 o'clock that night—it was a little past 8 o'clock in the evening when he was brought on deck—I came up again at 4 o'clock in the morning, and he was still lying on the quarter deck in irons—the weather was quite cold—the pri<lb></lb>soner was on deck when I came up at 4 o'clock—I did not hear him say anything to Tonson till a little past daylight; he then took the shackles off from his feet, and off from one wrist, and left them hanging on one wrist—there was then some talk between Mr. Travers and the deceased, I could not say what it was—Mr. Travers then picked a rope up from the port side, and commenced beating him over the shoulders and back—it was a main brace or a main sheet, I cannot swear which—those ropes are about three inches thick—the main sheet would be a little over three inches; I cannot tell the exact size, it was the tail of the rope—I stood about from twenty to thirty feet off—I heard the sound of the blows, and saw them—they were heavy blows—I cannot tell the number of blows he gave him at that time, several blows were struck—Tonson had no coat on, I think he had a thin striped light shirt on—after he had finished beating him at that time, Tonson tried to get up—he made a number of attempts to get up, and at last he straight<lb></lb>ened up, and staggered ten or twelve feet or so forward, and sat on the combings of the after hatch, that was close to the water tank, and he sat in the way of the pumping water, and Mr. Travers came and ordered him to get up and go away further off—the pump was wanted at that time—he did not get up—he did not appear to me to have his right senses about him, he took no notice at all—I should think this was not more than ten or fifteen minutes after he had been beaten first—when he did not get up Mr. Travers picked up a rope from the mainmast, and commenced beating him over the head and face—I cannot say what rope it was, I think it was the main try<lb></lb>sail brace, but I cannot say—I should think that is about a two inch rope—he beat him over the head and face with it—there was a little blood on one</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on Friday, 1st Feb.—I told him I took him on suspicion of causing the death of a man, James Tonson, by assaulting him and beating him on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Mirage</hi>, on the high seas, within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty of England—he said, "As to assaulting and beating, his imme<lb></lb>diate death was mortification of the cheek, brought on by himself, pricking it with a piece of bamboo, which was poisonous, to make it swell the same as other men's who had the scurvy, but his previous illness was syphilis; the man was completely rotten"—I told him he must accompany me to the station—on the way he said he would rather pay 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than this should get wind, on account of his wife and family, as it would be the cause of the death of some of them—I went on board the ship the following day, with the first witness—he pointed out to me two ropes that had been used in beating Tonson—I took possession of one, and have it here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—this is the tail of the main sheet—the main brace was pointed out to me—that was a different rope to this, and appeared much thinner from its being more open—it was Manilla rope instead of hemp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he point out this as one of the ropes, or did he point out both the ropes that were used? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me that both the ropes were used, but the running rigging had all been taken down—this is about a three and a half inch rope when new.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the proprietor of a china warehouse at the corner of Southampton-buildings, Holborn. The prisoner has been in my employ for between three or four years—it was part of his duty to serve goods in the shop and receive money for them—he was so employed on Fri<lb></lb>day the 25th, Saturday the 26th, and Monday the 28th of Sept.—he ac<lb></lb>counted on those days for petty cash, for articles that he might sell for ready money—it was his duty to enter the amounts in this book—the entries here are his writing—here are the entries of Friday, which are 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on Saturday, 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and on Monday, 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he did not account to me</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you not tell all this to the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not asked—I have a dozen or thirteen persons in my employ—there is a ledger kept and a day-book—I do not know that there is a book kept entirely by the principal posting clerk—he is not the only per<lb></lb>son that makes the entry—there is a day-book in which the collecting clerk makes entries—I do not know whether he is the person who keeps it or not—there is a little book kept by the prisoner—the men have nothing to do with the books, only to sign their names—there is one kept by Hoyle, one by myself, one by Fisk the collecting clerk—there is one now kept by Morris, but it was not entirely kept by Morris then—Scott was in my service before the prisoner—there was a dissolution of partnership on account of the dan<lb></lb>gerous illness of a brother—the cashier then left, and I asked the prisoner to fill the situation—I have no recollection of having promised him that I would get another as soon as possible—I anticipated getting another—the prisoner has not repeatedly stated that he could not undertake to carry on both the businesses—it has never, to my knowledge, been the practice of men in my employ to retain the money till they recollected whom they received it of—I am not aware that it has ever occurred with Fisk—if it had I should not have approved of it—Hoyle has had money over—I am not aware that that has arisen from my giving them so much to do—I have two shops—I never knew the prisoner to hand to Fisk monies that he could not account for, at the end of the day or the week—I know the prisoner has re<lb></lb>ceived money from people whose names he has forgotten, and he has retained them—I have reproved him, and told him to enter them as from persons whose names are not known—on the 27th of Aug. I was informed he had money in his possession, and did not know from whom he had received it—I think I had that information from Hoyle—the amount was 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner was always remarkably correct as I thought, in the ready money accounts—there</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember an occurrence in which Fisk was 42<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">plus</hi>, and did not know how he received it, and at length a bill was brought in with a re<lb></lb>ceipt of his on it for 42<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., by which it was made right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no re<lb></lb>collection of it—it was not mentioned to me—it would have been the duty of any one to have told me, but Fisk or Hoyle might have been unwilling to mention it—they might have been reproved for their negligence—the same unwillingness might have occurred here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Saunders.

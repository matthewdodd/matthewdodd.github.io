            . The Beginning of May, the two Prisoners came into my Shop, and asked for some Cambrick, I shewed them some which they said was too fine for them. I went to take down another Box of Cambricks, and as I was doing it, I saw the Little One in the Red Cloak, ( Chaloner,) shuffling something downward into her Pocket, or into her Cloaths. I could not discover which as she stood close to the Counter; I was very much surprized, and stood a Minute or two where my Box stood, and had hardly Power to stir; I fixed my Eyes upon her, and she her's upon me: I stood still for some Minutes, and did not speak a Word. Poole, pretended to fall into a Fit, says Chaloner to Poole, Molly, my dear, Molly, what are you a going? Molly, my dear Molly; Sir, I hope you will not take it amiss, this Gentlewoman is frequently troubled with Fits, four, five, or six, in a Day; says I, I believe this a Fit of Conscience, if it was a real Fit I should discover it. I saw some Tears come out of the Corners of her Eyes, and I thought it was a Fit of Sorrow; she was about ten Minutes before she came out of this Fit; then they looked upon me, and I upon them a good while, and said nothing: At last says Chaloner, Pray, Sir, what is your Cambrick a Yard; I said 4 s. she said, cut off a Quarter of a Yard; I cut off a Quarter of a Yard, and she gave me a Shilling: Upon which as they were going out of the Shop, I said, Hark you, young Woman, I must have a Word with you before we part; upon which I led them both into the back Shop, says I, I am very sorry that I have Occasion to say it, but I am positive of what I am going to say, I am sure you have robbed me of something, and I will search you before you go out of my Shop; I shall be sorry for what I have said, if you are not guilty. When I was going to search them, this Piece of Lawn of Mr Brown's was dropped in the Shop; they stood both close together, and it was found under them upon the Ground: One Mr Bishop, who was in the Shop at that Time, took it up, and asked me, before the Prisoner, if this was not my Property; says he, I saw her, (Poole,) lay it down; No, said I, I have nothing of this Quality in the House, but no doubt but it may belong to one of my Neighbours; said I, do you keep them here, and I will go through the whole Street but I will find out the Owner, if 'tis possible. I went among my Neighbours and into Mr Brown's, and asked if he knew any Thing of it; he owned it, and came to my Shop, and charged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174306290029"></xptr> the Prisoners. Then I took them into a farther back Room, and put my Hands on the outside of their Petticoats, but found nothing; so I desired my Wife to search them, and sent them up Stairs, and I saw them drop a Piece of Lawn upon the Stairs. I did not know I could indict them for it as it was dropped in the House; if I had found it upon them, I would have put it into another Indictment. Mr Bishop said, I have seen you several Times at Guildhall: Poole said, she had been lately deluded by Chaloner, and said she had not been used to this Part of Life, and had been honestly brought up; that her Friends live in the Country, and that she came to Town very lately. I asked her how she came acquainted with Chaloner; she said, she met with her in the Street one Evening, and said she wanted a Lodging, and Chaloner said she should go and lie with her, and the Lodging was upon the bare Boards. - When Bishop said he saw her lay it down, she did not deny it. - I cannot say that she owned it.</p>

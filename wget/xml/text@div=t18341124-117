                  </hi>. I live at Messrs. Hodge and Nunn's, Regent-street. On the 13th of November the prisoner came between seven and eight o'clock for two skeins of silk—I served him—he offered me a shilling—I saw it was a bad one—he said he did not know it; that he got it of a pork-butcher, in Clare-market—the officer was sent for—he had the shilling before it was out of my sight.</p>

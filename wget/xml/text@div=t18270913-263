               <p>WILLIAMS' Defence. He was quarrelling with a woman whom he struck, and I struck him - he pushed me into a passage; Wilson was chief evidence against Murphy, and he gave charge of him, because he should give no more evidence against him.</p>

Williams gave this account at the time I took him - Murphy keeps a lodging house in Church-lane - I afterwards saw his purse - there was a piece torn or bit out. I saw Minns that evening; she said Murphy had struck her, but said nothing about a kick - I found Williams in a room with Minns.</p>

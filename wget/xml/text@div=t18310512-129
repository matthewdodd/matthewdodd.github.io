               <p>JAMES HENRY STARBUCK. I was employed by Mr. Grisdell to paint some houses in Norfolk-street - I went there on the Saturday before the 11th of April; I took off some brass knobs and buttons, in order to paint - I left them on the top of a mahogany sideboard; I left them safe that night, and locked the door - I went there on the morning of the 11th; I found the lines of the sashes cut, the sashes taken out, and the glass gone - I went, in consequence of some information, to the watch-house, in Denmark-street; I found some glass, some knobs, buttons, screws, a tinder-box, a handkerchief, a knife, and some screw-drivers - I believe they are all the prosecutor's; the prisoner was there, and was taken to Lambeth-street.</p>
               <p>JOHN WRIGHT. I am a Police-constable. I was on duty on the 10th of April, and met the prisoner in Cannon-street-road, coming in a straight direction from the prosecutor's premises, with a bundle under his right arm- he crossed the road, and went up James-street; I stopped him, and asked what he had with him - I lifted up the corner of his handkerchief, and found it was glass; he said he was going to his employer's to put it in - I took him to the station, and in his pocket I found four brass knobs, four buttons, a box of a lock, a knife, and some screws; in his trousers pocket I found a box with tinder, flint, steel, and matches.</p>

            . This is a piece of the handle of the lock of a door - here is the other know of it; the screw we cannot find - these knobs are of the same description as those we lost; this glass fits the sashes exactly - I cannot be positive about those screws; this staple is the one that was lost, I believe, but it has no mark on it - this hammer was left on the premises.</p>

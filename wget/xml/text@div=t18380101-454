                  </hi>. I know the prisoner, and knew the deceased, Charles Ragan—he was a labourer on the railroad, and the prisoner is the same—on the 10th of December I was in at Mr. Bentley's, at the Post Boys, at New Cross, near Deptford, in Surrey—I do not know what parish it is in—it is about a mile from the town of Deptford, on the side nearest London—the prisoner and the deceased were in the house—I did not hear them speak a word to each other—the prisoner rose from his seat and said he should go home—I then saw the deceased rise off a bench and strike the prisoner in the face—the prisoner had given him no provocation—I had not heard them speak a word to each other that evening—Ragan was an Irishman—I believe the prisoner is a Suffolk man—Ragan struck the prisoner in the face, and he reeled back against the fire-place, and when be recovered, he returned the blow—there was then a scuffle and a row between them, partly in the room and partly in the passage—the doors were open—I saw scuffling, but cannot speak to more than the two blows I have mentioned—they went out, and I remained in the house—I did not me from my seat, and saw no more of it—I saw blood come from the prisoner's face, and run down from his nose or mouth, I cannot tell which.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the public-house when the quarrel began—I saw the prisoner getting up after he was struck, but I never saw the blow struck—he was getting up from out of the fire-place—they afterwards had a scuffle in the house, and at the door as soon as he could recover himself—they then went out of doors into the road—I went out in about five mi<lb></lb>nute or more, and then found the prisoner and the deceased fighting—I went before Ragan, and said to him, "I think there has been quite plenty of this, you had better give over," but he rushed by me, and began fighting with the prisoner again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner willing to go on fighting, or did he wish to get away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say exactly, for I do not think he had time to say any thing before the deceased was fighting him again—I tried to part them—Ragan was desirous to fight most certainly—they kept on fighting several rounds after that, in the road—Ragan was stripped naked, but Smoker was not—Ragan had his shirt or some of his things on, or whether he had more things beside his shirt I cannot say, but I believe he had some of his things on—they had seconds to pick them up—I believe Ragan's second was a man named Samson—I cannot exactly say who was Smoker's second—I did not take that notice, but he had somebody—I cannot say how many rounds they had after I came out—they had several—they were both down on the ground by turns—Ragan at last went down some steps, into an area, to make water—he staid there a considerable time, trying to make water, as I thought—he leant over the top of the area—he then walked up the steps again, and the landlord's son went home with him—I do not know what made them part—I did not hear any thing said—he walked down the area himself and came up himself—we all went away then—I did not see the deceased again till he was dead, which was on the Friday following—I cannot tell who was uppermost at the last fall—they</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the public-house, it is in the parish of Deptford—the first thing I saw was Smoker rising off the bench—he said he thought he had had beer enough, and should go home—I then saw Ragan rise off his seat and knock him down instantly—as soon as he re<lb></lb>covered a scuffle ensued inside and through the passage, till they got out of doors—I went out with them—Ragan's clothes were then off, and he was stripped to the skin—Smoker had got his smock off—I did not hear any words between them before they fell to fighting—they began to fight directly—Ragan began before Smoker could get his clothes off—he bad got his smock off, but not his other clothes, and he had not time to get them of—they fought for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, as near as I can tell—they both had seconds—they stopped between the rounds a short time, and then stood up and went on fighting again—after they gave over fighting, I saw Ragan go down the area, and stand there for a time, and come out again—he then went away and went home—Smoker asked me where he was gone to, when he was down the area—I showed him where he was—he said he would go and shake hands with him, and ask him whether he would give up, or what he would do, as he would not give up before—he went, and they shook hands together—Ragan bid him good night, and said he would fight with him again in the morning—I did not see Ragan again alive.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Peckham, close to Dept<lb></lb>ford. The Post Boys is in the parish of St. Paul, Deptford—I was called in to see the deceased on Monday—the fight was on Sunday, the 10th—I found him with symptoms of severe injury in the region of the bladder—I did what was necessary, and attended him up to die time of his death, which was on Friday, the 15th—I had some conversation with him on the day that he died—I told him he was dying, and wished him to give me a statement of the occurrence as well as he could recollect—he was it that time in a dying state, and likely to die very shortly—it was perfectly clear to me that he must die—when I told him he was dying, he said, "Oh, yes, Sir, I know I am a <hi rend="italic">doner"</hi> signifying that he was a dead man—he appeared perfectly sensible that he must die.</p>

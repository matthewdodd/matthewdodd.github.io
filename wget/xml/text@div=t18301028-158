On the 23rd of September, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and requested me to go to Lady Arnot, No. 11, Russell-square - he left the shop; I went there immediately, and found no Lady Arnot lived there - on my return my daughter gave me information; my little boy was in the shop when the prisoner came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. I believe at Bow-street you said you thought it was the 11th of September? A. Yes - I am not certain of the day of the month, but I know it was on a Thursday; I always said it was on Thursday, but am not confident of the date.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter. I remember his going out last Thursday five weeks, to a lady's house - I attended the shop in his absence: the prisoner came in, and said he wanted some tortoiseshell combs for Lady Arnot to look at - I think the prisoner is the person; I had heard my father was gone to Lady Arnot's - he said they were to be very handsome ones, and I was to make haste, for he was in a hurry; I gave him four, and as he went out he said, "I suppose your father knows the price?" I said Yes - my father came back in ten minutes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe at Bow-street you only said you thought it was the prisoner? A. Yes, I am not certain.</p>
               <p>RUE LANGLEY. I sent nobody to the shop for combs; I saw my combs again on Thursday last, in the window of a hair-dresser's shop, in Holborn, named Phillips; I sent an officer there, and he gave them up.</p>

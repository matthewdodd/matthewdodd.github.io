               <p>Upon this agreement, Mrs. Drathgate, previous to her marriage with Mr. Hewlett, on the 4th of November, 1768, transferred to Dr. Myonnet and Mr. French, 700 l. Consolidated Bank 3 per cent. Annuities, and also 700 l. 3 per cent. Reduced Annuities.</p>
               <p>This proposed marriage took effect; a letter of attorney was afterwards made out by the trustees to the prisoner at the bar,

            , to enable him to receive the dividends, and to apply it for the trusts upon which it was vested in Dr. Myonnet and Mr. French. Mr. Hewlett died about three years ago, I believe, and Mrs. Hewlett continuing to be entitled under this trust, the prisoner received the dividends for her; and she did, I believe, to accommodate the prisoner, agree to sell out the Reduced Annuities, and upon this occasion Dr. Myonnet and Mr. French executed a letter of attorney to the prisoner, to enable him to sell the Reduced Annuities. Soon after this, Mr. Sherwood became a bankrupt; and some suspicions arising, that the Consolidated Bank Annuities had also been transferred, as well as the Reduced Annuities, Mr. French, who is a trustee, upon hearing that, applied at the Bank, and there he found that the Consolidated Bank Annuities had been transferred, for which there had been no letter of attorney given, as well as the Reduced Annuities, for which there had been a letter of attorney given.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it appeared from the books, that the prisoner at the bar had transferred these Consolidated Annuities, under a pretence of being the attorney for Dr. Myonnet and Mr. French, and was authorized, by a letter of attorney from them, to transfer it; there was no doubt, nor, I believe, will be, that the letter of attorney was forged. If there is any doubt in the business, it will be whether the prisoner at the bar be the person concerned in that forgery, or in publishing the letter of attorney, knowing it to be forged.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall now state to you the evidence against the prisoner with respect to this forgery:</p>
               <p>The prisoner applied to a Mr. Nesbitt, a broker, to sell the stock under this forged letter of attorney. The stock was accordingly transferred, and the prisoner, as is usual, set his name as the person acting and authorized by this letter of attorney.</p>

            , salesman, of Houndsditch. Upon enquiry for such persons, it was found that the names were real, that they had actually subscribed this letter of attorney, as attesting the execution of it. They are both relations to the prisoner at the bar; but it will be proved to you, that they were desired by the prisoner to set their names as witnesses to the letter of attorney, that neither of them saw it executed by either Dr. Myonnet or by Mr. French, that the prisoner brought it into his shop folded up, and desired them to set their names to it as witnesses. I believe the witnesses at that time did not conceive that they were doing any thing wrong, depending upon the credit and integrity of the prisoner that he would not do a thing which was improper, or desire them to do a thing which was improper. They set their names to it, not seeing it executed by Dr. Myonnet, or by Mr. French, and, in truth, at the time they subscribed their names to the letter of attorney, the name of Mr. French was not to it, but the name of Dr. Myonnet was; the execution of the letter of attorney by Dr. Myonnet alone would not have answered the purpose, for this stock being vested in two trustees, jointly, both of them must concur in an act to transfer it; they must either both concur in the very act of transferring, personally, or they must authorize an attorney to do it for them; one of them alone would not be sufficient. The name of Mr. French, however, appears with a seal to that name to this letter of attorney; and under this letter of attorney it will be proved to you, that the prisoner at the bar applied to sell, and actually did sell, this stock.</p>

               <p>"At a Court of Directors, at the Bank,</p>
               <p>"on Thursday the 15th of January, 1778,</p>

               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>I object to the reading of that minute, it being proposed to be read for the purpose of shewing, that Mr. French, whose name is affixed to this instruments, which they say is forged, is a disinterested witness and capable of proving it; and in order to render him a disinterested witness they would shew that the Court of Directors have replaced the stock, so that it is indifferent to Mr. French whether the instrument be valid or a forged one. Now, if the Court of Directors have done so, they have placed themselves in the situation of Mr. French, and the Bank are themselves interested in proving this a forged instrument; because, whether it be true or forged, upon that will depend whether they are or not capable of demanding a repayment of that money by Mr. French, or the person whose name this imports to be. Therefore as the Court of Directors are themselves interested in the question, consequently no minute made by them will be proper evidence.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown.</p>
               <p>They state themselves liable to make good to Mr. French and Dr. Myonnet this stock which has been improperly transferred, and as they make an order to direct the stock to be transferred, so they act against their interest.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner is trying for forgery. This evidence offered is tending to prove that the prisoner is guilty of the forgery; if he is found guilty of it, the Bank can never have the money back again; therefore so far from its being a matter in which they are interested, they are in the strongest degree proving against their own interest.</p>

               <p>I have witnesses to prove, which is already very clearly proved; namely, his undoubted good character; the Court are in possession of that by the evidence of Mr. French; whether that is proved by one or ten thousand witnesses makes no difference at all. There is another thing which I would shortly submit to the court; we have some evidence, that this is the hand-writing of Dr. Myonnet. Dr. Myonnet, the counsel on the other side, are pleased to say is in an infirm state of health; I believe he is not so very infirm; I should be glad if the counsel will tell me whether Dr. Myonnet is here, or not?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180017"></xptr>Counsel for the Crown.</p>
               <p>Dr. Myonnet is near at hand, but he is of a very great age.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>He is a very old man, and is very apt to forget; supposing this is the hand-writing of Dr. Myonnet, but not the hand-writing of Mr. French, so that it is not Mr. French's deed; whether this being described in the indictment as the deed of both, can be truly said to be so, or not; it is a counterfeit deed, quoad Mr. French, but not a counterfeit deed, quoad Dr. Myonnet. I believe there is no count in the indictment, shaped to that particular case.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown.</p>
               <p>There is a count in the indictment to answer that objection.</p>
               <p>Court. Both the witnesses have said, that Dr. Myonnet was not present at the time they subscribed the letter of attorney.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>It is too common a thing, I believe, to obtain a subscribing witness after the party has signed a letter of attorney; it is frequently done in this way; it is not commonly understood, that two witnesses are necessary. A gentleman has signed a letter of attorney, in order to have some stock transferred, and has subscribed it in the presence of only one witness, thinking that sufficient. Afterwards the broker finding two necessary, he does not care who signs it afterwards; that is a very common, but a very improper practice; but it is not less his deed; the deed is complete before it is subscribed by any witness; therefore, supposing this to be the deed of Dr. Myonnet, the question is, whether the deed as described in the indictment can be said to be forged.</p>
               <p>Court. The charge is for counterfeiting this warrant of attorney, purporting to be the warrant of Dr. Myonnet and Mr. French; now allowing that Dr. Myonnet did execute that deed, yet, if it be necessary for the transferring the stock, that Mr. French should likewise have signed and sealed that deed, and if he did not, then the deed is forged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashhurst summed up the evidence to the Jury, who after having withdrawn for a short time, pronounced the prisoner.</p>

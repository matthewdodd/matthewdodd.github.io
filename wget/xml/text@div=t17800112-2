On Tuesday the 28th of December we went to bed about twelve o'clock having been at the Opera that night, otherwise we generally go to bed about eleven. It is my method to take a servant with me round the house to see if every thing is safe. I went that night particularly into the study, which has some windows toward the garden, and one door only which opens into the house; that study lies remote from the other part of the house. I saw the windows fast; I locked the door myself. The servant that warms my bed brings me up the keys at night; and she comes up in the morning for them to distribute to the rest of the servants. I got up about seven o'clock in the morning, and went down into the study; I found the sash thrown up and the window shutters broke; there was a writing table in the room belonging to Mrs. Bentham, which was broke open; there were two book-cases in the room, one opposite the chimney, the other opposite the window which looks into the garden; that opposite the chimney had mahogany doors, they were broke open. In the other bookcase opposite the window is a drawer, in which I generally put my money. I had the day before received of a tenant some bills and fourteen guineas, which I put in that drawer. The fourteen guineas were taken out of the drawer. The glass doors of that book-case were broke open. I do not know any thing of the spoons.</p>
               <p>Were there not other valuable things in the study? - Yes, silver candlesticks and a tea chest with silver cannisters; they were not taken away. The prisoner lived servant with me six years and an half, and behaved exceedingly well, till the latter part of the time, when he got connected with an infamous woman; I recommended to him to leave her, and go out of the kingdom, or she would be the ruin of him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. BENTHAM sworn.</p>

               <p>Was any thing lost out of that writing table? - Yes, two silver spoons; one was broke, the other nearly broke.</p>
               <p>How long had they been in that writing-table? - A considerable time. During the time this man lived servant with me they were broke; he brought them to me, and I put them into this writing-table.</p>
               <p>Court. When had you seen them there before you missed them? - I cannot positively say, very near the time I missed them.</p>

               <p>I write for Mr. Bentham, and live next door to him. I was present when the prisoner was apprehended at the Black Horse in Petty France, Westminster, where he lodged. On Wednesday the 29th of December, between the hours of ten and eleven in the morning; I searched him in the back room, and took out of his pocket three silver teaspoons, and about thirteen shillings and sixpence, in silver, two of the tea-spoons were marked J. B. the other A. B. the constable has them in his possession. While we were searching him, when we took the money out of his pocket, he said he would swear a robbery against us for taking the money from him. At first when I saw only the thirteen and sixpence, I thought him innocent, but when I saw the tea-spoons it gave me great reason to suspect he was the person who committed the robbery; upon searching him farther we found a pocket-book upon him.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120005"></xptr>We took him to Mr. Bentham's and examined the pocket-book, and found in it eleven guineas sealed up and four pawnbroker's duplicates.</p>

               <p>The prisoner was recommended to me as a servant by the prosecutor, in May last. He was in my service four months; he accompanied me abroad, and was three weeks in my service after I came home. I wish to be understood that I have the highest opinion of his honesty, diligence, and abstinence, as to eating and drinking. I allowed him board-wages; and I believe from the frugal manner in which he lived, he saved money. Between the 18th and 27th of December I had a conversation with him, and I advised him to get rid of his connexion with that woman, as I was persuaded he could not be safe with her; he said he was convinced of it, and should be glad to get on board a privateer. I understood that to arise not from any consciousness of his having done wrong, but merely to get rid of that connexion. When I was abroad, knowing the friendly design with which Mr. Bentham recommended him to me, which was that he might go out of the kingdom, I asked him if he wished to stay on that side of the water, or return to his own country; he said no, thank God, he had done nothing to be afraid to come to his own country, and he came with me to London, and was three weeks in my service after he came home. I beg to observe, that when I had that conversation with him after he came home, he appeared to be extremely lame, and was supported by a crutch.</p>

            . How did the prisoner appear when you took him into the chair? - He appeared sober enough.</p>
               <p>Was he lame at all? - I do not know indeed, he had just turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Had he a stick? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he a crutch? - No. I do not know whether the prisoner is the man or no.</p>
               <p>To Wilkinson. Did you see him go out of the chair? - Yes; he got out of the chair and walked up to the door.</p>
               <p>Had he a crutch? - No, only a stick.</p>
               <p>Dr. Chelson. On dismissing him on the 3d of October, I paid him the remainder of the account between us, amounting to fourteen guineas. I believe the whole I paid him during the four months he was in my service amounted to about thirty pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. On Sunday, the 31st of July, did you go to Church in the afternoon - A. On Sunday, the 31st of July, about three o'clock, my wife, daughter, and servant, went out of my house first; I went out about ten minutes after three o'clock; I left the door locked, as we usually do; the door of my apartment I locked myself; I took the key of the street door in my pocket, and pulled the street door upon the spring-lock; I left the door fastened upon the spring-lock. I went to Church, and staid until divine service was over. I was the last person that came out of the house; I left a widow woman in the garret, her name is

            ; I left her in the house that day. When I returned, I found the street door open, and the one pair of stairs door open; I missed some of the property. My wife can speak to more than I can. I found the drawer that the property had been in, was wrenched open; the things taken out of it are mentioned in the indictment, money and notes; my wife can speak to the money better than me. One note for ten pound two shillings and sixpence, given by one Mr. Shury, I can speak to; he is an attorney at law. I have a perfect knowledge of that note; that note was stolen out of the drawer that stands in the one pair of stairs room, just by the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. What business are you - A. I am a patten-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the house your own - A. No; I rent it; the house is entirely in my own occupation. I came home about five o'clock; my wife and daughter came home together, they were sent for; they did not know any thing about it. I am sure I fastened the door after me.</p>

He said, he had left his wife on Saturday morning, with the intention of getting some money for a bill, that he had been out all night, and money he must have. After talking together some time in Gray's-inn-lane, he asked me if I had got any halfpence in my pocket; I told him I would feel, I put my hand in my pocket, I pulled out a shilling, I gave it him, in silver. He said, he was going to get a pint of beer; accordingly, he went to the

             of Warwick, and had a pint of beer. While he was in the public-house, I met two City officers, I told them the transaction that was going to be done; one of them went into the George public-house, facing of Gray's-inn-lane. where he could have a view of the house, and see who went in, and who came out; that officer's name is Bray. While I was looking about, the prisoner came out, and said with an oath, the old woman is out, and her daughter, but there is the old man in He went into the public-house again for a quarter of an hour. He came out again, a second, time from the public-house, there, said he, now, the old man is out. He then said, his hand itched, he must have it; here goes! he went up to the door. I stood underneath the George window. He went up to the prosecutor's door; he opened it with a key in his hand; I was at a distance. I immediately went to the prosecutor's door, and as I got to the door to see how the door was, he came out: he said to me, my things will not fit, meaning his keys, but he said, he must have it. He immediately went back again to the house a second time, and went into the house; he stopped in some time, and then I crossed over the way. I saw the curtain of the one pair of stairs let down in the prosecutor's house; I stopped about ten minutes at the door. He came down; I observed his pockets were bulkey; I immediately then took him into custody at the door, and gave Bray the signal to come to me. I took the prisoner then to the public-house; Bray came. When I got the prisoner in the public-house; I searched the prisoner. In this breeches pocket, I found sixteen pounds in silver, three pocket-books, a little tin case, with six half-guineas, a seven-shilling piece, a pair of money scales and weights; and one silver spoon broken; in the pocket-books there were several bills; the bills are now in the pocket-books the same as then. I searched the prisoner in the presence of Bray.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he came to know how there was property in the house - A. He did; by his brother formerly keeping company with the prosecutor's daughter, and the family being well acquainted with each other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. How long have you been an officer - A. Five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Johnson, tell me honestly; did not you tell him first, you could tell him of a good place to go to - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him, you would put him in a way where he might get something worth while, and did not you give him one of the pick-lock keys - A. Certainly not. I took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw the watchhouse-keeper after you took him there - 
               <persName id="t18140914-69-person707">A. </persName>
            Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you a conversation there - A. No. In the confused state we were in at the watchhouse, we were in a hurry to get back to the prosecutor's house; we were not certain there was any person to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came out of the house, did not you say something of this sort, d - n your eyes, go in again, do not spoil a good job, there is nobody coming - A. No; that is false.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you have persuaded him not to do it - A. No; if his inclination led him to do it, let him do it, and bring him to justice, or else he would commit other depredations.</p>
               <p>JAMES BRAY. I am a City officer. On the 31st of July, I met 
               <persName id="t18140914-69-person708">Johnson</persName>
             a little before two o'clock in the afternoon. In consequence of what he said to me, I concealed myself in a public-house, facing Gray's-inn-lane, in Holborn. I saw the prisoner come across, and go to the door of the prosecutor, Mr. Snowsill; he was at the door about four or five minutes; he then came out of the door, and crossed the way. He then came to the door again, and went in at the door again, he was in some time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think he was within - A. Nearly a quarter of an hour; he came out, and went across the way; then Johnson gave the signal; I ran over to the house where he took him in. I saw him searched, and I saw Johnson find that property on him. Johnson said, where is there a watchhouse near; I said, in Eagle-street; we will take him there, and left him in the custody of the watchhouse-keeper. The prisoner asked Johnson for some silver which he said was his own; the watchhouse-keeper was present. Johnson said, he should have none; if the watchhouse-keeper would let him have a little bread and cheese, or beer, he would pay him on the next day for it. We hurried back again to the prosecutor's house, not knowing there was any body in the house to take care of it. We found an old lady in it; shewas up in the garret. We knocked a good many times before we could gain admittance; we acquainted the old woman with what had been done, and waited until the old gentleman came from church, and acquainted him of the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. to Johnson. Did the old woman ever go out while you were watching the house - A. No, not at all while I was in the street.</p>
               <p>MRS. SNOWSILL. My husband always trusts me with all his valuables; he never keeps any; he always gives them to me as soon as he gets them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you on the 31st of July, money and bills of exchange in your care - A. Yes. These pocketbooks are not finished, I can swear to all the three pocket-books, and I can swear to the silver-spoon, I broke it myself, I know this half-a-crown to be mine, it was in this bag with the other silver, I made the bag myself; I had six half-guineas, and one seven-shilling piece; they were in a little dirty tin-box; I know the tin box, it is an old acquaintance.</p>

            . I am the watchhouse-keeper of St. Andrew's, Holborn. I was up stairs at the watchhouse when the prisoner was first brought to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Johnson say any thing about any concern in the business - A. When he gave me charge of this business, I asked him if he knew the prisoner; he told me he did. He knew it was going to be done at ten o'clock in the morning; he saw him going into the house, he told me. I asked him how he knew it was going to be done; he told me he was introduced by one of the party, a crack; he saw him go into the house, he was in some time, and came out again; he did not see any thing about him; he went up to him, and said you d - n fool, go in again, do not spoil a good job, there is nobody coming, go in again; he went in again, and came out again, and then he saw he had got something about him; then he secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he had been in once - A. Yes. He went in the first time, he came out again; he had nothing about him; he then told him, you d - n fool, go in again, there is nobody coming, it is all right; he came out the second time, he saw he had something about him; he then secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. So that his going in the second time, was by the advice of this worthy officer here of Justice - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You are the watchhouse-keeper of St. Andrew's, and St. George, the Martyr - A. Yes, I have been in the service of that parish twenty-two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present when this conversation was - A. Another officer of justice.</p>
               <p>Q. His name is Bray, is it dot - A. I do not know his name.</p>

            Are you upon your oath - A. Certainly. I took it down at the moment; I have some part of it here; I do not know whether you can make it our. (Witness shewing a paper) I wrote it the moment they were gone. I did not like to take the charge until I knew the particulars.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in the habit of making memorandums when you take a charge - A. I generally do make a memorandum when there is any thing particular; I made it upon a piece of paper. They are all total strangers to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention it to the magistrate - A. No, I did not; I had no business. They told me there was a ten-pound reward in our parish; I told them there had been, there was not then.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was an extraordinary thing of an officer - A. I did. It is all truth. I have no interest either one way or the other.</p>
               <p>COURT. Johnson, stand up; you have heard this; did you make use of any such expression - A. No. There was not time to mention all that; I was not in the place three minutes. The man is a villain to say what he has; he is a villain for so saying.</p>
               <p>Q. Johnson, I understand you to say, you did not hold that language - A. I did not. There was not time then to say it; I was not there above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there time to say any part of it - A. The only thing I mentioned to the watchhouse-keeper was, when he asked for the money, I said, he should have none; if he wanted a little bread and cheese, or beer, to let him have it, and I would pay for it the next day.</p>
               <p>

            to Bray. Were you present during the whole time Johnson delivered the prisoner to the watch-house-keeper - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell this man, after he saw the prisoner come out once he went up to him, and said, you d - n fool, go in again - A. He never said any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Johnson has false sworn himself. Do you remember putting your hand into your waistcoat pocket, and pulling out a handful of bad shillings.</p>
               <p>Johnson. I had but two shillings in my pocket; they were not bad. You passed one of them, or else took another out of your pocket. It is false to say, I took out a handful of bad shillings. I had no other money in my pocket but the two shillings.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM REA. I am a commodore in the Company's employ. On the 28th of November I had charge of the room No. 83, on the third floor; the prisoner had no business there - I fastened that warehouse up at three o'clock; it was secured by iron doors - it contained chests of tea, piled up for delivery; a person could easily conceal themselves among the chests - on the Monday morning, about nine o'clock, I went to that warehouse, unlocked the door, and found some person had been there, and removed eight chests to make a platform under a loop-hole, which had been fastened up; a person could get on them, and reach the ceiling - there were marks of a crow-bar or instrument having been used to break through the ceiling, but it had not succeeded; there is a window in that room, leading to a staircase - I found the centre iron bar of that window was forced from the frame, and two squares of glass broken, so that they could get on the staircase; and that leads to a trap-door, communicating with a space between the ceiling and roof; there are steps on which a person could get up to the trap-door, and the hinges were forced off it - they could then get on the roof by unbolting another door; I informed French, the elder.</p>

               <p>JEREMIAH THOMPSON. I am a commodore in the Company's employ, and had charge of the rooms Nos. 68 and 69, in the Bengal department. On the 26th of November these rooms contained silks of various descriptions, crape, shawls, and very valuable property from China and Madras - I fastened both these rooms at three o'clock in the afternoon with iron doors; I returned on Monday at nine, and on entering No. 68 I found it in the utmost confusion, a number of presses were opened, silk goods taken from them, and scattered about the floor; no force had been used to the door of the room - a quantity of goods were gone from the tables and presses; I discovered two apertures in the ceiling, communicating with the roof - one would admit a man through it from the roof; I went into No. 69, found that in a similar state, and two holes in that ceiling, and a quantity of silk goods taken away; I found a bunch of small keys and a saw on the floor of that room - the boxes, containing the silk, had been opened; I am certain the ceilings of both rooms were entire on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>JAMES POPE. I am an elder, in the Company's service. I came to the warehouses, in Cutler-street, a little before nine o'clock: in consequence of an alarm, I went to the roof of the Bengal department, over Nos. 68 and 69, and found two large holes in the roofs of both rooms - a person could get on that roof, through the trap-door of No. 83.</p>

               <p>JAMES TONKIN. I am a labourer in the Company's employ; the prisoner was given into my custody - he told me voluntarily that he was at work on Bell's floor, and brought the crow-bar and saw away from there, concealed them in Rae's floor, and after the warehouses were locked up he began to work, got to the roof of the warehouses, and worked himself into the silk-room, made a bed of silk, laid on it till Sunday morning, then began to pack up the goods, and he hoped he had not gone so far as to touch his neck, for if he had he was out of his calculation.</p>

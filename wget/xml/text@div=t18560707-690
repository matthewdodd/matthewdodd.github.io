                  </hi>. I keep the Constitution public house, in Bed<lb></lb>ford-street, Covent-garden. On 1st July, about a quarter past 10 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came—a female was with him—he called for half a quartern of gin, I served him—he tendered a shilling—it was given to my wife, and she passed it to me—I examined it, and it was bad—I saw that the shilling which was handed to me was the one that the prisoner gave—I told the prisoner it was bad, and he tendered another shilling—I went for a policeman, but could not find one—I took the prisoner to the station and gave him in charge—I gave the shilling to the officer.</p>

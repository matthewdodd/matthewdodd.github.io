                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—in July last I lived at 30, Old Pie-street, Westminster—about 9 o'clock on Tuesday morning, 12th July, I was in bed with the prisoner in the first floor back-room—it is a lodging house—we had that room—he cut me on the head with the chamber-pot—he did not strike me with a ginger-beer bottle—I ran into another room, where a man named Murphy was, and got underneath his bed—blood was then streaming from my face—the prisoner ran after me, and tried to get at my hair—I kept from him—I afterwards came out and went down stairs—I was taken to the hospital—I was an inside patient—I have been at the hospital a week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer—on 12th July I was living at 30, Old Pie-street, Westminster—the prisoner and his wife occupied the back-room on the first-floor there—I occupied the front-room—they were separated by a partition—about 9 o'clock on this Tuesday, I heard a smash and a scream from the prisoner's wife—she screamed out, "For God's sake, Tom, save me; save me!" and rushed into my room—her head was then smothered in blood—the prisoner was behind her—he had a ginger-beer bottle in his hand with which he was striking her on the head—he struck her twice—she crept under my bed, which is about a foot and a half from the floor—the prisoner made several blows at her while she was there, but he could not lift his hand high enough to strike her—he had then a piece of the chamber-pot in his hand—he struck her twice when she was under the bed—he meant to give violent blows—they were both quite sober—he did not say anything when he was attacking her—I jumped to his side, and caught the ginger-beer bottle out of his hand—he snatched it from me again, and I snatched it back again, and then went down stairs and called for the police—they arrived just as I got to the door—the woman was then under the bed—when I next saw her she was down stairs in the back-room—I have known the prisoner about five months—he is not insane—he was always sociable, as far as I saw, very agreeable company—I have noticed nothing peculiar</p>

a month's imprisonment some time ago, and that preys on his mind, I believe—I cannot say what it was for—I did not hear the least noise before I heard the smash in the prisoner's room—the partition between the rooms runs about half way up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Oliver Morton Smart. The pri<lb></lb>soner was in our service, and quitted on the 19th of November—I was present that evening, with my husband and the officer, when her box was searched—it was locked—she unlocked it—we found in it a pair of gold drops, a pair of gold earrings, and some cuffs, belonging to us, and some shirts, and two night-shirts belonging to Mr. Walter Pemberton—I know them by the initials on them—this veil was found in her pocket, and several other trifling articles were found in her box.</p>

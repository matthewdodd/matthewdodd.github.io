                  </hi>. I am a draper, carrying on an extensive business in Shoreditch—I have known the prisoner about fifteen years—he was formerly in my service as a shop-walker—he first entered my service about 1856, and remained in that capacity two or three years—he left about 1858 or 1859—after he left I took a person named Gadd in my employment—that was in 1863—the prisoner was in my service at the time Mr. Gadd came—accord<lb></lb>ing to my recollection, he applied to enter my service again about six or nine mouths ago—I then took him in as fancy-buyer—he left about April last—he wanted an advance of salary, and I told him I could not give him any more—he said he had an opportunity of bettering his position—I said I should be very glad to see it, as he had a large family, and it was his duty to himself and family to do so if he could—at the time he left my service he was indebted to me—I afterwards applied to him for payment—I received this letter from him—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "12th November, 1863.—Mr. Lloyd.—Sir—I apologize to you for many foolish things I have done, but let that pass, if you will, I have been a faithful servant to you for nearly fifteen years, and am now in want of employment. I will call on you to-morrow, Friday, at 6 in the afternoon. Please to grant me an interview, and I will tell you all my troubles. You can extricate me without injury to yourself; and I shall ever remain your grateful servant, Robert C. Ward.")—He came the follow<lb></lb>ing day—he made a certain apology, and was sorry for what had passed, and I took him back into my service—he told me that the broker was in the house, going to sell his furniture for rent; that he Was in very great distress and trouble, and he had been out of a situation for twelve months; and I was induced to take him back—he remained with me three or four months, and it was then that he left, as I have stated, as he wanted an advance of salary—he was several times in my employment altogether in the fifteen years I have known him—I received this letter in April—it is the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th April, and stated that the prosecutor's application for repayment he should treat with contempt, and entered into particulars to show that he was not in his debt</hi>)—I don't recollect whether I saw the prisoner</p>

Q.</hi> In your belief, is it a feigned or genuine writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really do not know; I don't think it is the prisoner's writing—I really don't recollect whether the capital L is like his—I don't remember seeing a capital L of his—I have an invoice of his in my pocket—I have not had letters from him, merely invoices in the way of business—I can swear those were written by him, because I have seen him write a portion of them—I have seen him give me a receipt, at any rate—I can't say how many times I have had invoices and receipts; perhaps three or four times in the course of a year; not lately—he has not been in business lately, but Mrs. Ward has—I could tell by the invoice bow long it is since (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—that is dated September, 1863—I think the whole of this is in his writing—I did not see him write it—I think it is, I am not certain—it is the same writing as another one that I have in my pocket—that is what I found my belief on—I certainly think it is his writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am town traveller to Mure and Co.—I have known the prisoner some ten months, and have had a few opportunities of becoming acquainted with his handwriting, by correspondence and by signatures, and writing that I have seen—I have received letters from him, and have seen him write—I have never seen this letter before to-day—in my judgment, it is decidedly not the prisoner's writing, nor any part of it.</p>

Q.</hi> Is it at all like the prisoner's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing like it—I did not go to the Police-court—I heard that the prisoner was charged—it was adjourned two or three times—I knew that—I first heard of it while it was standing over—I did not go there to tender my evidence, or to look at the document—my name is Wallington—I have always gone by that name, not by the name of Tilsey; Tilley; Richard Wallington Tilley is my real name—I changed it because I have been a bankrupt—that was some</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs. Spence, Baggallay, and Co. of Love-lane—I have known the prisoner eleven years, and have had very many opportunities of becoming acquainted with his handwriting during the whole of that period until within a few months—I have seen him write, and have received letters from him, and in business—I have never seen this letter before to-day—in my judgment and belief no part of it is in the prisoner's handwriting.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> That you say positively? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Positively—I have not the slightest doubt about it—it is not the least like it—no one could positively mistake it for his—I have seen him write letters—I was in his employ for about five years—that terminated about 1860—he was in business in Brompton—he was in business for five years prior to 1860—I was with him five years—I knew that he was charged with this—I heard it in our warehouse, while he was before the Magistrate—I did not go before the Magistrate.</p>

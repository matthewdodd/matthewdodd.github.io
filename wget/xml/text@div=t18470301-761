                  </hi>. I am a tailor. I live at No. 10, Buckingham-place, Fitzroy-square. On Saturday, the 13th of Feb., between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner—he looked into Mr. Jerman's shop—he then went in and brought out a brace of pistols—I saw him come backwards out of the shop—I ran over and caught him, and took him back to ask Mr. Jerman if he had purchased anything out of the shop—she said, "No"—she then went to the window and missed the pistols—there was another person with the prisoner, but nothing was proved against him—I took the prisoner back, and he threw the pistols on the drawers—a bit of one of them broke off.</p>

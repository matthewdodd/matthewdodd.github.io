                  </hi>. I am a money scrivener; I belong to the Eastern Metropolitan Loan Society, held at the Red Lion public house, Whitechapel. A few months ago I had an application paper left, it is here—it was left about the latter end of Feb.—in consequence of that I went to the prisoner Lay ton, at No. 5. Nelson-street, Stepney—I saw her, and told her I called respecting an application her husband had made for a sum of four guineas—I did not say where it was made—I asked her which her apartment was, and she showed me into the front parlour—I asked her if she rented that apartment—she said she rented the house—I then asked her to produce her rent book—I asked her where her husband was employed, and other questions—she produced her rent book—she said her husband worked at the Commercial Gas Company—Layton is employed at Carpenter's as a carman or driver at the coal wharf—I do not recollect the whole that was said—she said nothing about letting any part of the house—she asked for the money—I lent it her, and then went out for the securities—I looked at the rent book, and told her to send her husband to the office—she went with me to the security, at No. 2 in the same street—I made no reference to Payne—I told her I was going to Mills as a security, and she went with me there—I saw the prisoner Mills, and Layton said, "This gentleman has come about the loan"—Mrs. Mills asked me into the parlour—I told her I called respecting a loan of money that Mr. Layton had</p>

               <p>applied for, and that her husband was proposed as security—I told her the amount of the loan was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she said the furniture in the parlour was her's, that she rented the house, and she produced her rent book to show me—she said her husband worked at the Commercial Gas Company, and had been there for years, and then I told her to send her husband to the office—about two o'clock the same day two men called at the office, producing two rent books—I asked their business—they said they applied for money—I asked their names—one said Layton, and the other said Mills—I paid the money to a person who represented Layton—I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., repayable by instalments of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week—I thought the parties were in a condition to pay it back from the representations made—had I known what I do now I should not have lent the money—we were induced to lend the money in consequence of the representations—we thought they were renting the house, and that their husbands were the men I expected they were—some part of it has been repaid, Layton paid one payment—I do not know whether there was any other—four instalments have been paid—there were forty two to pay at first—on 3rd May I went to No. 5, Nelson-street—previous to that I had seen a man named Layton, who is not the same man—I saw the prisoner Layton there—directly she saw me she said, "Walk in, Sir, I know what you have come about"—I was going into the same room I first went into, and she said, "Perhaps you will walk up stairs; I will tell you the whole truth of it"—I did not go up stairs—she then told me she only rented one room in the house, and it was a false statement she had told me; that her husband knew nothing whatever of the transaction—she said she was led into it by the prisoner Mills, and she had borrowed the rent; that she did not know who the men were—she said she filled up the application, and had part of the money for so doing—then I went to No. 2, Nelson-street, and saw the prisoner Mills—I asked her whether she occupied the house, and she said, "No," and that her husband knew nothing whatever of the transaction—I saw Payne at the house along with Mrs. Mils—she was present when the conversation took place between me and Mills—Layton was not there—I told Mrs. Payne that the prisoner Layton had told me that she had lent, her rent-book, and had received 17. for lending it—she said she had received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,. but that was what Mrs. Mills owed her—neither of them referred to the men who were acting for their husbands till I put the question—Mrs. Mills told me that Mrs. Layton would tell me.:</p>

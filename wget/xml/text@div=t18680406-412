               <p>it in small quantities, and it must be done at the hour of 3.30 or 4 o'clock; if you do not do that you ought to be shot"—that is all I recollect—there was more of it, but I only recollect that portion of it—there were three marks in the letter—you can see "The Noted Stout House" from the yard where the prisoners are exercised—the other marks are the sewer and the weak part of the wall—it might be that day or the next after I had seen the ink come out, that Murphy showed it to Barrett—after it had been shown to Barrett I met some others at a place called O'Donnell's, or M'Don<lb></lb>nell's—it was at a small street off Queen Street, in Holborn—it was at a private room in the top of a house—Barrett went with me, William Des<lb></lb>mond was there, a man named Lynch, Felix Fallon, Hayes, and Murphy—Murphy said that if he could not get money, he could not carry out the rescue—the money was to buy powder—some of the men present volunteered to give or get 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., some 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and some 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot tell how long this was before the explosion, but I think it was the same week—arrangements were made that evening to meet in the American Stores, Oxford Street, the next evening—I went there the next evening—the prisoners, William Desmond, English, and Barrett were there—there were several others present—Murphy was there, and Fallon, Ryan, and M'Carthy—the house was reckoned half-way between the Holborn and the West-end men—English said that he could get a place in Castle Market—we went there—it was a public-house—the only thing I heard was that one of the men said he had got 25 lbs. of pow<lb></lb>der—that was Ryan—he told me he got it at some place off the Dials—I did not know of anyone else having powder at that meeting—I did not hear of any—that night or the next day I heard of more powder being had—I heard it from Fallon and Barrett when they were together at, I think, Rice's public-house—Felix Fallon asked me for my address to leave a barrel of powder at—I asked him what he wanted with a barrel of gunpowder: I knew at the same time—and he said he and his partner were going to hawk it in the country—I think this was said in the private bar—Miss Rice was behind the bar—I told him I did not understand giving my address for it—he then said that he would send it to his lodgings—he told me it was to be delivered, I forget the day—I gave half a sovereign to Felix Fallon, but I received it back again from Captain Murphy, it was not expected from me—I was out of work then, owing to the tailor's strike—I was working on my board that day, and I saw M'Carthy with a half or quarter barrel under his arm—that was the same day that the powder was to be delivered at his lodgings—he was not the same man who had been present at one of the meetings—it was in Sherrard Street—I knew that M'Carthy—I think he is a shoemaker—he had been present at some of our meetings—I do not know what the powder cost—Murphy used to get letters addressed to my house—the postman brought them—I did not see anything done with them—I saw newspapers—Captain Murphy rubbed the stuff over the papers, and the writing on them came out—I think no one else was there—I saw Murphy write a letter in secret writing—on 11th December I was at a meeting at William Des<lb></lb>mond's—I went there about 9.30 or 10 o'clock—there were present English, Barrett, William Desmond, Captain Murphy, Ryan, Lynch, Hayes, Quin, the M'Carthy who had the barrel of powder, Fallon, and, I should think, about a dozen and a half altogether—when I went in I saw a man looking very pale in the face, with his coat open—I went over to see what was the matter with him—he was not shot, but it had grazed his skin—a revolver which English had in his hand went off by accident—Ryan was the man</p>

               <p>who was wounded—there were six or seven pistols in the room—it was there I learnt who was the man who had the barrel, and the man who had got something to carry the fuse—Captain Murphy said that they had the powder all right, and then asked what they were to do for a truck to wheel the powder on—someone in the room, I think it was I, said that a man named Maddox, living in Marshall Street, kept a truck—Felix then went out, and he was gone about the time that he would be gone there and come back again—when he came in he said, "All right"—I also saw Captain Murphy load a cavalry pistol there, and give it to a man who was there—Captain Murphy said that we were to meet at 12 o'clock the next day at Desmond's house, to go from there to the House of Detention, for the pur<lb></lb>pose of rescuing Burke—we were to go in twos and threes—I did not go—a tundish or funnel was spoken about: that is to carry the fuse—Felix said that he had got it—it was not said what the tundish was for, or what was to be done at the House of Detention, but they all understood it—they were to be at the House of Detention at 3.30—Burke knew all about it—nothing was said as to how Burke was to know anything about it, that I am aware of—on Thursday, 12th December, I was at home—I am not aware that I saw either of the prisoners on the Thursday, but on the evening of that day I saw Barrett at Cavanagh's public-house, Pollen Street—Felix, English, and Patten were there, I think there were some others: I do not know their names—it was about eleven o'clock: it was late when I went out—Barrett came part of the way home with me—Felix was with us—I asked Barrett how they got on that day with the barrel, and he told me that the Captain failed in lighting the fuse that day, but that he, Barrett, would light it to-morrow, and blow it to hell—Barrett always went by the name of Jackson—Ryan lived at Sherwood Place, across the street—on the following day I went to Ryan's, to know if he had done some work for me—I saw Captain Murphy and English there—Ryan was there too—I did not see Murphy after that day—I did not see one of the prisoners from that time until after the explosion—in the evening I heard of the explosion—it was about 5 or 5.30—I was in my shop, and went out to see if I could see anything about it in the newspaper—I saw Patten come into my front room, where I work—his ear was bleeding—a conversation took place between us respecting it—he went into, the back room, through a door which communicated—I did not see him again that night—I did not see Barrett at my house that evening—I saw him later in the evening at the Welsh Stores, at the corner of Glasshouse Street—I noticed that his whiskers were off, and he had a short coat on—up to that time his whiskers were something like mine; the whiskers and beard joined—I cannot say whether he had a moustache or not; I think he had a slight one—Barrett wore a blue coat previous to that night—the jacket that he has on now belongs to Patten—I began to chaff him respesting his whiskers being off, and he said, "Don't speak so loud; it was I who fired the barrel"—I asked him who was with him, he said, "Murphy"—he said that he got his whiskers taken off because he feared that he might be noticed: that he might be identified—I did not see Barrett after that until I saw him at the Bow Street Court—I was taken up on the Thursday after the explosion—I did not see Murphy, Fallon, or Patten after the Friday night—on the Friday night Mrs. Koeppl, a work<lb></lb>woman, came to the public-house—Barrett was there then—I was arrested on a charge of treason-felony, but some time afterwards I was charged with having assisted in this affair, and I then gave evidence before the Magistrate—I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it you first saw Barrett? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I do not know the date—he came with Captain Murphy to my house a fortnight or so before the explosion, I can't say exactly—I don't think I stated this before the Magistrate—he introduced Barrett to me by the name of Jackson—the first conversation we had about getting Burke out of prison was, I think, on the night that Barrett was introduced to me—I do not remember the date when this letter was produced—it may have been three or four days before the explosion; about that—it may have been a fortnight—it may have been seven or eight days before the explosion; but three or four days after I had been introduced to Barrett—the operation took place at my house—copperas is not used in my trade, I don't know anything about it—Murphy asked me to get it, and I did—he got some hot water in a cup, and a cloth, and rubbed it over the letter, and the writing came out—the paper was made wet—it dried up very soon—English, Desmond, and Barrett were present—they did not seem surprised when they saw these words come out—I gave the Crown solicitor information about this letter before I went to Bow Street; at least, I can't say, I am not quite sure—I did not mention about the letter in my examination in Bow Street, because I was not asked—I had told the Crown solicitor before that—I knew about the blowing up of the wall before it was blown up, and I gave a half-sovereign towards buying the powder—I asked Fallou what he wanted with the powder, because I did not think he wanted so much, and there was a person standing by who overheard the conversation—that was the reason I asked Fallon that question, it was to take the harm out of it, as a person was by—there was an arrange<lb></lb>ment</p>

               <p>about meeting at William Desmond's on the Thursday, the day before the explosion, between 12 and 1 o'clock, to go to the House of Detention—that was arranged at the meeting on Wednesday night, the 11th—it was arranged that we should go in twos and threes—there might be sixteen or eighteen persons present at the meeting at Desmond's—they were to go there, and of course to be of some service in carrying out this plot—nothing was said, it was understood—I did not go, because I was too busy, and another thing, I refused—I said it was not proper for any man of family or a married man to go there at all; I said that as well during the week; I always said so—I did not encourage the explosion at all—I knew they reckoned one traitor among them, so I thought that would be the best way to get out of it—I don't think I mentioned at the Police Court about going in twos and threes, or about Felix Fallon asking for my address in order to put the powder there—I think I gave that information to the solicitor of the Treasury previously—I don't think I mentioned to the Magistrate that I asked Fallon what he was going to do with the powder, and that he said he was going to hawk it—I did not think of it—I did not expect to give evidence on that day, and I did not think of these things—I think I had given information of it to the solicitor for the Treasury, but I am not sure—I saw Barrett on the Thursday, the day preceding the explosion: that is a thing I wanted to mention to-day—yesterday I was asked did I see Barrett—Barrett came to my room either on the Wednesday or Thursday of the explosion, I think Thursday, with another man—I thing it was Felix or young Casey, I can't say which, and at night I saw him at Cavanagh's—I did not expect to see him there—it was in the public bar—I was standing at the bar and they were inside the tap-room—there were a great number of people about there—I used to go there nearly every night—the conversa<lb></lb>tion about the attempt which had been made that day to blow up the House of Detention was on our way home—Fallon was with me at that time, and English was in company with him in the public-house, and so was Patten—I was by myself at the bar and they were inside the tap-room till we came out—I asked Barrett what became of the barrel of powder, or how they got on with it—he said they got it back all right—he said the captain had failed in lighting the fuse, but that he would light it on the morrow and blow it to hell—I asked him where the barrel was—he said if I went with him he would show me—I don't know whether anything more passed about the failure of the attempt, there may be—I did not inquire who took part in it then, it was too late—I can't say whether I said any<lb></lb>thing at the police office about Barrett's having said the captain had failed to light the powder, I am not sure—I don't know whether an arrangement was then made for the members to be present next day at the House of Detention—I was not with them, I was where they met—I saw that some of them met at Ryan's house—I was not required to be present—I had said I would not attend it—I saw Murphy on the morning of the explosion—I never saw him afterwards—no arrangement was made by Murphy for me to attend on that day, or for the other members to be there, that I am aware of—I saw Barrett again on the Friday evening, the day of the explosion, in the Welsh Stores, at the corner of Warwick Street and Glasshouse Street, or it may be outside the door, I don't know—I recollect my apprentice, Henry Morris, being examined before the Magistrate—I was at that time in the dock—I believe Morris then stated that on the night of the explosion Barrett came to my house, accompanied by a man whose ear was bleeding, and that he</p>

               <p>had been fighting; the man said so himself—I did not see the man whose ear was bleeding, at the Welsh Stores that night—I saw him at my house—he came into my workshop and asked for a needle and thread—I asked him what was the matter with his ear, and he said he had been fighting and a man bit it—I did not see Barrett—I have heard that he was in the back<lb></lb>room, since; I did not know it—Morris said so at Bow Street—I don't recollect that he said his whiskers were then on—when I saw Barrett the same evening his whiskers were off, and I chaffed him about it at the bar of the public-house—I knew of the explosion then—Mrs. Koeppl, and Barrett, and I were there—Mrs. Koeppl has worked for me about two years—I did not speak in the presence of a number of people, only Mrs. Koeppl—I do not know whether she was in the secrets of the brotherhood—I would not speak about the explosion in her presence, or anybody's, except somebody's who I had confidence in—Barrett said that it was he who lit the barrel, and he took his whiskers off as he should be identified if he kept them on—he said that about 7 o'clock—I was paying my wages, and met Mrs. Koeppl, who asked me for some money, part of her wages—I asked her in with me, and gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I do not know which—there was a change in Barrett's dress, he used to dress in a blue coat and an ordinary hat, but he was then wearing the jacket that he has on now—I never saw him after that night; and never saw Fallon or Murphy afterwards—I saw Ryan during the week after the explosion; I heard since that he was in France—I do not know whether the other men are in England, they may be.</p>

               <p>Detention House, on my way to Blackfriars Bridge—I was in Corporation Lane, and saw a man coming up with a truck, and a barrel in it, towards me—I was going towards Farringdon Street—the man turned the truck to the left, and shot it back against the prison wall—another man then came across the street, and assisted him to take the barrel—he threw a cloth over it, and the truck went on in front of me, down Corporation Lane, whecled by the man who brought it—the barrel was then against the wall—the man who threw the cloth over the barrel crossed the street, and stood at the comer of a court on the opposite side of the road—I passed him as I went on my way, and saw him looking after the truck as it went away—two other men were standing in the court or passage; that I saw as I went by—Barrett was the man who was looking after the truck, and who assisted with the truck, and threw the cloth over the barrel—William Desmond is like one of the men standing in the passage, but I cannot say positively—I was twice before the Magistrate, and on the second occasion I saw Barrett, and identified him—his appearance was then different—when I saw him by the barrel his beard was cut off away from his chin; he had long red whiskers, and a very slight moustache, if any—before the Magistrate, he appeared as if all his face had been shaved about a month previously, and his beard and whiskers were a month old since growing—about two minutes after passing the men, I heard the explosion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dairyman, of Turnmill Street, Clerkenwell—on 13th December, I was serving milk in Corporation Lane, at Mrs. Parr's, No. 6, and at other houses—it was about 3.45 when I was at Mrs. Parr's—I then saw a truck coming along with three men with it—it was brought about oppo<lb></lb>site No. 3<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, then it was turned round, and backed into the gutter—it came from Bowling Green Lane; but it was in Corporation Lane I first saw it—two men were drawing it, and one walking by the side—the two men turned it half round opposite No. 3<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>., just past the entrance of St. James's Passage—it was run back into the gutter, and the barrel fell out of itself towards the prison wall—one man spoke with a rough Irish voice to the one with the truck; I thought it was a signal to go on; it was not in English, or I should have understood it, and the truck was taken away by one of the men, back the way it came—one man twisted the barrel round, flung a mackintosh or tarpaulin over it, and walked away—the barrel was then on the pavement, near the wall, but at the edge of the kerb—two men wore there when the tarpaulin was thrown over the barrel; both then crossed the road, and went up St. James's Passage, and I saw no more of them—I was then, I think, at No. 5, Corporation Lane—I saw next a gentleman, in appearance, standing on the pavement by the prison wall—after the man had left the barrel this gentleman walked along by the prison wall till he had passed me, and then he crossed the road—he was not one of the three men—I saw him at the time the others were putting down the barrel at the Woodbridge Street end of Corporation Lane, the opposite end from which the men came—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186804060139"></xptr>
               <p>was standing still, with both hands in his pockets—after the two men went into St. James's Passage he walked towards the barrel, passed me, and crossed the road, so that I only saw his side face—I never saw his full face—he then re-crossed the road directly, and went to the barrel—he looked at the head of the barrel, as if he were looking for a name or a num<lb></lb>ber—the tarpaulin was across the belly of the barrel, and he could see the head without meddling with the tarpaulin—I saw him then take a fusee or match from his pocket, strike a light, and apply it to the head of the barrel—I saw it light something, and then he pulled the tarpaulin over the light, and walked into the passage opposite—I lost sight of him—I went into Japanner's Yard then, and-served two customers—that yard is at the Wood<lb></lb>bridge Street end of Corporation Lane—I think Mr. Crump lives there—I then came out into Corporation Lane again—I had a horse and cart with me; it was standing in the wide part, where three or four turnings meet, at the end of Corporation Lane—I there met the constable Moriarty, and spoke to him—I then went to the cart, and led the horse into Coburg Street—Moriarty walked towards the barrel after I spoke to him, and very shortly, perhaps not more than a minute, the explosion took place—I recognize Barrett as the man that put the light to the barrel—I cannot make any mistake—he was then dressed differently to what he is now—he had a long brown coat down to the calves of his legs, and a high hat—I saw him next at Millbank, when he was differently dressed, and his whiskers were off—he then had a different coat and a grey felt hat with a big brim—on 13th December, he wore long whiskers, which came down here, and had a flush colour on the side of his face, his whiskers were a kind of sand colour, rather fair and long—at Millbank I saw nine or ten men, and I thought at first that O'Neil was the man who fired the barrel—afterwards, when I turned Barrett round, I knew him directly—I saw his side face—I never saw him full face on the 13th December, and I did not recognize him, full face with short whiskers, at Millbank—I recognised him by his side face, and said I was very sorry I had made the mistake, for Barrett was the man and no other—I am now sure Barrott is the man—I have not the slightest doubt whatever—I believe that Timothy Desmond was one of the three men with the truck—I am not positive whether he was wheeling it or alongside it, but he is one of the three who were with it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you examined before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was examined by the Coronet before I went before the Magistrate—I was at the House of Detention on the Saturday afternoon—I then saw certain persons, whom I identified though I did not say so, because I was very ill at the time, through the explosion, and I did not feel confidence in myself—they asked me if I knew any of them, and I said I did not, but I had an idea—on the 28th, when I was before the Coroner, I believe I said I did not like to swear to any of the men—I was examined twice at Bow Street—the first time was after I had been examined before the Coroner; that was after I had been examined by Sir Thomas Henry, at Bow Street—I did not then say, "Timothy Desmond very much resembles one of the men who was assisting drawing the truck"—I believe I did say that—I went-to Millbank twice, and I saw him there—I also saw him in the dock at Bow Street—there were several witnesses called before I was—on the second occasion, when I was before the Magistrate, I said Timothy Desmond was a man who was with the truck.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it affect your memory? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it would not prevent me from identifying—I felt very nervous, and very much frightened—when I saw Timothy Desmond on the Saturday it was in the cell, by gaslight—I was examined before two different Coroners—I was five or six times before one—the prisoners were not present—when I saw the man in Corporation Lane I only saw his half face—he had his hat over his eyes, and his hands in his pockets—when I said Desmond was like the man, I said he was a little stouter—I had not then seen Barrett—at Millbank none of the men were pointed out to me—nine or ten stood round the cell, and I looked at them—I believe O'Neil was the first I picked out—I did not think William Desmond was the man: when I said he resembled him, I wished the Magis<lb></lb>trate to understand that he resembled him, though I was not confident he was the man—I might have said I did not believe he was the man—I did not mean him to understand that he was the man—he resembles him in features; I don't think he does resemble him, because one's whiskers were more carroty than the other's.</p>

I am a chemist—in December last I received from Moore a small sealed glass bulb, containing crystals—the contents were chloride of gold—no analysis was necessary to enable me to tell what it was, but I applied the necessary tests, to be sure—that salt, dissolved in water, makes characters on paper, which are invisible for some length of time; several hours; but they may be rendered visible by several means—copperas brings them out directly—this note (<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>) represents half the page of such writing brought out by copperas—it was written on Tuesday—the writing is never absolutely invisible, if carefully examined, and held up in a certain light; but it is practically so for a few hours—after the expiration of a sufficient time, the writing on the part not treated by copperas would be as visible as the other, the only difference beings that a yellow stain would show where the copperas solution had been ap<lb></lb>plied—writing with chloride of gold never is quite invisible, the change in the glaze of the paper being seen in certain lights and positions—on the 21st of this month I received a paper parcel from Moore—it</p>

On the afternoon of 13th December, about 2.50, my attention was attracted by Timothy Desmond and Anne Justice being near the prison—I was inside when the explosion took place—the prisoners usually exercised from 3.15 to 4.15 in the afternoon, some in one exercising yard and some in the other, so as to equalize them—both abut on Corporation Lane—on 13th December there was no separation between them but the open corridor of the prison—up to 15th December Burke exercised at that hour; but on that day the hour was, for certain reasons, altered to the morning—the part of the wall blown down had been a gateway made for the convenience of the contractor who, early in 1866, enlarged the prison—when the work was done, the gateway was taken away, and the wall was made good at the end of 1886—the new part of the wall was visible from inside the prison—there is a house the prison which has a board, visible from the exercising yard, on which is painted "Noted Stout House"—it can be seen from the exercising ground—Smithers is the landlord; it is the Bell beer-house, in Corporation Lane—Burke was lodged in a cell facing the part of the wall blown down; up to within ten minutes of the time of the explosion—he was then removed to another cell, in accordance with a custom of frequently changing the prisoners' cells—I am present when prisoner are received from the police-courts—I produce warrants of remand, of 7th December, of the Prisoners Burke and Casey—on that occasion I escorted the prisoners to Bow Street, having previously handed over the prisoners and the warrants to the inspector of police—I received them back the same evening—they first came to the House of Detention on 23rd November, were remanded to 7th December, and then to 14th December.</p>

Alexander Munro, on Thursday morning, 12th December, to the effect that the bishop disapproved of the demonstration—he wanted the names of the committee—I gave the names of some of them—I only knew three or four—there were fifty-eight at the last meeting—on the following night (Friday) a meeting was held in the Bell Hotel, Glasgow—I was the chairman—I told the meeting the result of a deputation to the bishop, and his proposal to have a requiem high mass instead—the meeting decided that the demonstration should not take place—no that evening I saw Barrett in the Bell Hotel—after the meeting a few members retired to a small room for a cup of tea—I and Barrett were amongst that number—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the paper that was published by me, it is the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Free Press</hi>, the name is now changed, but it is the same paper—it is dated December 21st, 1867, it contains a report of the meeting of the 13th December—that was the first paper published after the meeting of the 13th.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This paper, then, of December 14, published on the 13th, is your paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have no doubt I penned that article, "Scottish Catholic sympathy with the men who were murdered at Manchester"—it was not on Friday that I knew the requiem would be held, on Thursday—this notice of a solemn requiem for the repose of the souls of Allen, Larkin, and O'Brien, within a black margin is from my pen—this leading article, "Proposed funeral demonstration in honour of the three murdered men, Allen, Larkin, and O'Brien," I think is mine—I have no doubt of it—it begins, "It is with no little satisfaction we notice that the empty honour of a funeral demonstration has been changed for a solemn requiem high mass for our martyred brethren"—I was president of three or four of these meetings—they were not meetings of sym<lb></lb>pathy with the martyrs, they were preparatory meetings for the projected meet<lb></lb>ing on Glasgow Green—it was in honour of the martyrs, if it had taken place, but it did not—there was only one torchlight meeting—I attended no meeting before going to Glasgow Green—we did not meet at the Bell for the purpose of going there—I did not carry a torch myself—I was at a meeting in a private place of two or three individuals about getting bills printed—I don't know their names—I know few people in Glasgow by name, but a great many by</p>

               <p>sight—Mr. Gallagher is a foeman tailor or cutter—I have known him for some time—he took an active part, and was a member of the committee—I presume he buys and reads my paper—I said Barett's whiskers were four inches in length from the ear when I first saw him about four inches long from the ear to the chin—I noticed that they appeared slightly singed on the night of the demonstration—I never knew Winslow, Brown, or Burke—I know there is such a person as Rickard Burke, by the papers; I don't know him myself—at the committee meeting on 13th December I counted fifty eight persons present, in counting votes on the bishop's proposal—I don't know where Gallagher lives in Glasgow, or Barrett's address; I never heard it—I understood Barrett was a stevedore—I don't know for whom he worked—I have known M' Manus between two and three years—he came from time to time to my place of business—I know two persons named Mullen—I have not seen Mullen lately—I know a gentlemen in Belfast, a stonecutter, named Murphy—I never had 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left in my hands for Mr. Murphy, or for Hastings—I know a person by sight called Kyne; I don't know how he spells his name—I have seen him once or twice at my place of business—he never placed any money in my hands for Murphy's wife, or anyone else—I have only seen him purchasing newspapers at my place—I stated in my paper that I was glad that a requiem high mass had taken the place of the funeral demonstration—this article in my paper of the 14th about Thompson is not written by me—sometimes I insert things without seeing them—I must have seen it after it was printed—this is it: "If proof were wanted to confirm our assertion that the three Irishmen were hanged, not for murder, but from a vindictive feeling, and to strike terror into the ranks of the Fenians, that proof would be afforded by the proceedings against the young man who is now awaiting his trial at the hands of 'English justice'"—I must have seen that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GREENE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose in your capacity of a journalist you see a large number of persons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A very large number, without knowing their addresses—I do not sympathize with Fenianism; on the contrary, I ascribe it to my influence over the working population of Irishmen in Scotland that they have been kept from Fenianism—I strongly suspect that I have been the means of preserving the working men from that influence, by my desire to keep them to such demonstrations as were legal—I strongly desired to persuade them even against demonstrations, but when I found they would have gone on by themselves I endeavoured to lead them—my articles have never had any Fenian tendencies, though they are written in an Irish national spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by that? A. I mean the right of Irishmen to the same justice that exists in England and to legislative independence—I should say not with the view of the separation of Ireland from this country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But surely you would know? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, then, I say no—I have never been prosecuted by the government for any matter of a political kind con<lb></lb>tained in my paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have any circumstances particularly impressed on your mind the fact of having seen Barrett, especially on that Friday evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, one or two things—he took an active part in guiding and controlling the demon<lb></lb>stration, and in preserving order, and suffered by being burnt, and his clothes being injured—I notice him on that account—he wanted the</p>

               <p>posting of bills throughout Glasgow announcing that demonstration—he was an active person on the committee for the proposed demonstration which, did not take place, and on this particular occasion we had great difficulty in getting the committee meeting to accept the proposal of Dr. Grey; the greatest possible difficulty on that Friday evening, because the people were determined to hold the demonstration, provided it were legal—I used every exertion to prevent it, and I believe he assisted me in per<lb></lb>meating men's minds with my idea: hence my knowledge of him, and my desire to look upon him as an intelligent person—a few others in the same way assisted me in carrying out my project, but we had considerable diffi<lb></lb>culty in getting the meeting to accept the proposal of the bishop—six or seven persons were present at the tea—I knew them, all by eight—Barrett was one, Gallagher was another.</p>

On Saturday morning he called in the fore<lb></lb>noon, and I gave him a shilling, and took as much tea as made up the shilling.

I don't remember any man coming to my house about that time to get them buttoned"—that was in answer to a question I asked him, if he had any recollection of a man coming to his house to get a pair of boots "buttoned"—I asked him if he did not remember a man coming back, and that the work was undone, and he kicked up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—he said he had no remembrance of such a thing—I asked him if he remembered a man who had brought some work for him sending out for a newspaper and reading the Clerkenwell affair—he said ho did not, and that such a thing could not have taken place without his remembering it—I asked him if he knew anyone of the name of Hughes—he said "No: "</p>

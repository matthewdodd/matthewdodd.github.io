                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Wilson, who is in the employ of the St. Katherine Dock Company—I knew the deceased, Ann Jones. On the 9th of July I was walking with her between King John's Palace and the Mulberry Tree, Stepney-green—there was a child in our way—we were walk<lb></lb>ing in the kennel—there is no regular pavement there—Jones was on my right—it was very dusty—I thought I heard a distant sound of a wheel—I turned my head half way, when I just saw the side of the wheel—I was in the</p>

               <p>act of putting up my hand to draw Mrs. Jones on one side when she was dashed down with violence before my feet—I looked up to see what had done it, and quite close to her saw the wheel—it was the left hand wheel—I can<lb></lb>not say that I saw the prisoner—I saw the reins, but in whose hand I cannot say—the deceased lay motionless—I raised her up—a man ran up to my assistance, and placed her head on his knees—I untied her bonnet string, and heard a gurgling kind of sound in her throat—I saw a large white contusion on her left temple—the blood poured profusely from her nostrils, and her left ear—there was a kind of paving-stone near where she fell, which forms the curb—there was no other vehicle in the road—the cart was on the left side of the way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier, and live at Frome, in Somersetshire. On the 9th of July, between three and four o'clock, I was in the Stepney-road, near Stepney-green, with Allen—I was going towards King John's Palace, and saw the prisoner in a cart coming from it, driving at a very fast rate, I should say ten or twelve miles an hour—we passed two women—I cannot say whether Wilson was one of them—the prisoner passed me, and I had passed the women—after he had passed me I saw him in the middle of the road, as if thrown from the cart—I then turned, and saw the deceased lying with her head on the curb, about five or six yards from the prisoner—the cart was in the middle of the road—I went up to the deceased, took her up, and placed her head between my knees—blood was flowing from her nose—she did not move, but died almost directly—she was put into the cart, and I got into it—the prisoner was drunk—he drove part of the way to the hospital—he went at a good smart trot—I begged him not to drive so fast, for if there was life left in the woman, he would destroy it—another man got up, and I got out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the cart far? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I could not say whether the prisoner had been driving all the journey—I had been walking on the footpath—it is a wide one—there are gravel-stones on the footpath—perhaps the road is smoother—after I got out of the cart, I ran after it as fast as I could to the hospital—I was determined not to leave the woman—the road was rather dusty, but not so as to obscure the view of persons—there was a calf in the cart.</p>

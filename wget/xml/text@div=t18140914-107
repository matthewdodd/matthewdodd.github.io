I lost the money between Sunday week and last Sunday night; last Sunday week it was in my box the bank notes, gold, and silver; there were eight one-pound notes, two guineas, two three-shilling pieces, two shillings, and two sixpences, all my property. On Thursday morning I found my box was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse this man of taking it - A. On Saturday evening, I had occasion to go to my box for change, and saw all my money was gone. I suspected the prisoner; he lodged in the house, and he slept out of his lodgings. On Sunday morning, I went to the officer, we went in search of the prisoner, and found him in Leg-alley, in a one pair back-room; the officer, and me, went into the room, and saw the prisoner; I told the officer that was the man; as soon as the officer had got hold of him, he pointed to me, and said, that is the man have robbed; he said, spare my life, my mother will make up the money to you again that I have made away with. The officer went to search him; he would not willingly be searched, he was obliged to tie his hands; we found on his person three one-pound notes, one guinea, and five three-shilling peices. That was all that we found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you identify the notes - A. One of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other lodgers in the house - A. Yes; four or five besides the prisoner and me.</p>
               <p>CHARLES HUMPHREYS. I am an officer. On Sunday morning, the prosecutor came to me, and said, he had been robbed; I went to Leg-alley, and there I found the prisoner in a one pair back room, with a bundle in his hand, and a great stick in the other; he was just going away. The prosecutor pointed him out to me. I proceeded to search him he said, that is the man that I have robbed; he hoped the prosecutor would spare his life. He would not be searched; I was obliged to tie his hands; I then searched him, and found three one-pound notes, a guinea, and five three-shilling pieces. He wanted the prosecutor to forgive him; he said, his mother would give him the money again not to appear against him, it was a drunken job; he was very sorry for it. These are the one-pound notes that I found upon him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is one of the notes that I lost; I am sure of it; I marked it upon the corner; I wrote upon it before I lost it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went out to get a place of work; on my return, I met five of my shipmates; I stopped with them until Saturday. On Thursday they passed the board of Admiralty at Greenwich; on Saturday they made a subscription for me; I got five pounds and some silver.</p>

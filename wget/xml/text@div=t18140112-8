               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing any boys near his shop - A. Yes, on the 17th of December, about six o'clock, I saw two boys, they were in the act of drawing ribbon out through the screw holes of his shop window; I could not see which of them did it. I opened my door and run after them; I took one of them, that was the prisoner; he was never out of my sight. I found nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not got the ribbon - A. No, nor any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you, while you were in the shop, see them in the habit of drawing the ribbon out - A. Yes, one of the boys went up the street, and the other down the street; they run about an hundred yards together.</p>

            . I gave Mr. Grafton an alarm about six o'clock in the evening, I had occasion to call upon Mr. Wood; about twenty yards before I got to Mr. Wood's door, I saw the prisoner standing at Mr. Grafton's window; I stopped and looked; the two boys turned round and looked at me. I went into Mr. Wood's and communicated my suspicion to him; we shut the door, and looked through the glass window, we observed the boys drawing something through the bolt hole in the window; the boys ran away immediately before I opened Mr. Wood's door. Mr. Wood pursued them; I went over to Mr. Grafton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make observation enough of the boys to say the prisoner was one of them - A. No. I cannot swear to either of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out of work about a month, I went round that way to look for work.</p>

On the 5th of January, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking up and down the shop - the prisoner came in, and went about two thirds down the shop; she asked to see some Irish cloth- she had a white apron on; I saw her stoop down, and tuck it under the string - I shewed her some Irish cloth: she said she hoped it would be good, and bought seven yards of it, at 2s. 6d. per yard; she then requested me to shew her some inferior, and while I was shewing her that, a person was detected in stealing something - the prisoner said what a shocking thing it was that people did not know better; I saw a piece of calico at that time by the prisoner's side: she then requested me to shew her some muslin - I went for that, and when I returned the calico was gone; I saw something under her shawl, and told Mr. Graham - I continued to serve her, and took 2l. 4s. 7d. of her - I tied up the parcel, gave her change, and she went out; I followed, and told her she had something under her shawl, or in her apron, which she had no right to: I took her into the shop, opened her apron, and found these eleven yards of calico.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who is Mr. Graham's partner? A. He has none; this is one of our bills, but we have no such bills now - I believe we gave this to the prisoner; the parcel she had, occupied a considerable bulk - I tied it up; this calico was not in the bundle - I removed her from that part of the shop to another: I do not know that I made a mistake in making out this bill - my memory does not serve me for it: when she came back, she gave me the parcel of things she had bought, and desired me to send it home; I sent it immediately - she told me to send it to Trinity-lane, and to tell her husband what had taken place, as she had no one else to send.</p>

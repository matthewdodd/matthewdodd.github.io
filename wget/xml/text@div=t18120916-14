I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my book. I immediately looked round, and saw the prisoner turn down stairs with his hand in his coat. I accused him with having taken my pocket-book. He made no reply, but made all the haste he could down stairs, and ran across Mark-lane, up a gateway, nearly opposite. I cried, stop thief, and as he was returning back, down the same gateway, I met him, and took him by the collar. The pocket-book was handed to me immediately by Mr. Redman. I took the prisoner into the coffee-room, and delivered him into the custody of the officer.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SMITH. I am a corn-dealer. On the 24th of July I was at Mark-lane. About two o'clock I heard the cry of stop thief. I saw the prisoner run down Mark-lane. He turned up a gateway. I lost sight of him. He turned back again. He ran by me. He had his hand upon the pocket-book in his side pocket. I am sure he is the same man.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner coming down stairs. Mr. Dobson cried out, stop thief. I pursued him to the gateway. He took the pocket-book from his coat, and put it under some rubbish, which turned out to be Mr. Dobson's pocket-book. I gave it to Mr. Dobson. The prisoner retreated and endeavoured to illude the party that was pursuing him. He called out stop thief, and said he had ran that way. I told him he was the man. They took him.</p>

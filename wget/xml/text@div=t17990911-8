               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This is a transaction some time ago? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that she now surrenders to take her trial? - A. No, she was stopped at Bow-street; I was sent for, and at the desire of Mr. Flond I now prosecute her.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you prefer your bill of indictment? - A.She was stopped in July or August, I went immediately before the first Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did you not know there was a Sessions here in September? - A. Upon my oath I did not know it; she got bail, and came to my shop after that to attempt the same thing again.</p>
               <p>Q. One half-guinea is very much like another? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know the reason that she was not tried before was that she had been lying-in? - A. I have been attending here for three Sessions<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110022"></xptr>running, and it is impossible she should be lying-in each of them.</p>

             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Barron; the prisoner came into our shop in April, 1798, for a quire of gilt paper; I requested Mr. Barron to give her half-a-guinea; she refused the money I gave her several times; Mr. Barron desired I would give her her guinea back again, and she went away; when I took up the money, there was no half-guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it possibly have slipped off? - A. No, there is a glass case upon the counter, and Mr. Barron put it down upon the glass case, the rim of which rises about the 8th of an inch; I went after her, but she was gone; I could not find her; about the end of July she came to the shop again, she came for the same article, and with the same pretence; she gave me a guinea to pay for it; I gave her change from the till; she said it was all bad, the seven-shilling piece particularly; she said she used to pay but one shilling for it; Mr. Fentum, a gentleman who keeps a music shop next door to us, gave her another seven-shilling piece for it; I then sent for an officer to take her to Bow-street, and she attempted to force herself out between me and the door post, but I kept her in; she was taken to Bow-street, and I attended there.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it not have slipped down? - A. No, there is no possibility of it, because there is a rim all round it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Were you present when the prisoner was apprehended? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no bad half-guinea found, I believe? - A. No.</p>

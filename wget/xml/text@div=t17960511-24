In consequence of directions from my master, about seven o'clock in the morning of the 26th of April, I looked to see what was going on in the shop; I placed myself by the bannisters of the stairs, where I could see them without their<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110085"></xptr>seeing me; as soon as Colin Markinson came in, he took down one shutter, he was porter, a man came in, and he sold him some whiting and size, he gave change, and put the money into his pocket; when he had took down the shutters, M'Caul came in, and then Markinson took a new pot, and put three ladles and a half of white lead into it, and covered it up with a piece of new paper; he put it into a back place where the mill stands, and put it into a tub; when M'Caul came in, he told him what he had done; M'Caul said, you have; and he said, yes; M'Caul told him to make haste off with it; Markinson put on his hat, at the outside of the door he covered the pot over with his apron; when he got to the end of the window he uncovered the pot, and went away down the Strand; he came back in about ten minutes; but before he came back, my master asked M'Caul where Colin was gone; and he said, he was gone down the Strand to drink some gin with some old soldiers; my master said, no, he is not; you know very well where he is gone as well as I, you know that he has got some white lead; and M'Caul said, no, he had not, with that M'Caul stood at the door till Markinson came back, and then my master charged him with taking the white lead out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. M'Caul was by at this time? - A. Yes; he said, he had not taken any thing out of the shop; he said you have; and my master desired him to fetch his property back; with that, Colin went down the Strand to get it back again; and then he brought in some size and whiting, and said, that was what he had taken out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long have you lived with the prosecutor? - A. Six months.</p>
               <p>Q. M'Caul, I believe, has been in that shop between twenty and thirty years? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the other prisoner been in the shop? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you came into the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very large shop? - A. Not very large; it is narrow and long.</p>
               <p>Q. As long as this Court? - A. No; the bannisters of the stairs go up from the middle of the shop, about three yards from where I saw the prisoner take the white lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you serve in the shop yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you don't know where the white lead and the different sorts of paint are, do you? - A. Yes, I do; I can go to any of those places, and have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long the white lead had been placed there? - A. Many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, at three yards distance, and you watching over the bannisters of the stairs, will you swear it was white paint and not whiting? - A. I saw him sell the whiting and size first; and then he took a new pot, with three ladles and a half of white lead; I saw it as plain as that book is before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whiting is of the same colour with white paint? - A. One is dry and the other wet.</p>
               <p>Q. He said he would go for the property, and brought back this whiting and size? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been upon good terms with these old servants, who have been so many years in the house? - A. I always behaved civil to them, and they always behaved civil to me; and I discharged my duty to my master.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any quarrel? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any complaint made to your master at all? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself? - A. No; I never had with either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. One of them never told your master any thing about a soldier, did he? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor threatened to tell your master about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. About a soldier keeping you company, you know? - A. Yes, some time ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago was that? - A. That was the summer before last.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the impudent fellow say to your master about it? - A. I do not know that he said any thing; that does not concern the theft.</p>
               <p>Q. But I will have the whole truth; there was some quarrel about this threatening to tell your master about keeping company with a soldier? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell your master of it? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, or did he not, threaten to tell your master of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. One of them told your master about your keeping company with a soldier; which of them was it? - A. I do not know that either of them did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, which of the prisoners was it told your master? - A. They might both of them chuse to call my name in question.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did either of them, or both? - A. It might be both for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, you were not very much pleased, were you? - A. I knew they could not say any thing against me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you pleased with it? - A. I was neither afraid nor ashamed of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you did keep company with a soldier then? - A. And what of that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ward. Q. What was this soldier's name? - A. Morrison.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was a fellow-servant of your's? - A. Yes.</p>

I came down into the shop, and asked John where Colin was gone; he said he did not know, but he believed he was gone to get a glass of gin with some old soldiers; I said, John, how can you tell me that lie, when you know he is out with some white lead; he said, he did not know that he was, and while I was talking to John upon the business, Markinson returned; I asked him where he had been; he said, but a little way; I said, you have been out with some white lead, where have you carried it to; he said he had not; says I you have, and I insist upon your going and fetching it back; after talking about it some time, he went away, and in a quarter of an hour or thereabouts he came back with a pot of size and whiting; says I, this is not what you took out, for you took out white paint; he said it was, and that he only took it for his own use; I told him it was no such thing, I was certain he had been and bought that elsewhere; I sent my young man to Mr. Hughes's with that pot of size and whiting.</p>

             an opportunity of knowing where the white lead, and where the size and whiting is kept? - A. It is impossible for a person to be in the house without knowing where either of them are.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are they always kept in the same place? - A. Always; we have three or four places for the white lead in tubs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that any body could place themselves upon that stair-case, and look into the shop and see what is going forward, without being seen in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been any quarrel between this girl and either of these men, you must have known it? - A. There might, but I never heard of any quarrel between them.</p>
               <p>Q. No complaint from the prisoners of this girl being too familiar with any person? - A. Never that I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been the character of this young woman, a modest, well-behaved girl, or the contrary? - A. She has been so while the has been with me, and from the recommendation I had with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has M'Caul been in your service? - A. Upwards of twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose recommendation did Markinson come into your service? - A. M'Caul's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. It was after this conversation between you and him that he returned with this pot of whiting and size? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard any complaint of this girl from either of the prisoners? - A. No, never; I heard that a soldier did keep her company before she came into my service.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this white paint? - A. According to the description the girl has given of the quantity, I suppose 5s. 9d.</p>
               <p>Q. You never recovered your white lead? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I take that for granted that you could not have sworn to it if you had? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They were originally committed, I see, by Mr. Bond, charged with stealing to the value of 10d. and now you charge them with stealing to the value of 4s.? - A. I don't know how it came to be put down 10d. I told Mr. Bond 5s. 9d.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any pot being sent to your house that day? - A. Yes; Mr. Manby sent to our shop to know if his man had been for any whiting; the prisoner Markinson had been about half an hour before, if not less, and asked for a two-penny pot, which in the trade we call a double pot, and a quart of size and a penny worth of whiting, which I served him with, and he paid for it and went his way.(The prisoners left their defence to their Counsel, and M'Caul called three witnesses, who gave him a good character).</p>

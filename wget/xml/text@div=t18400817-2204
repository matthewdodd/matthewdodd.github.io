                  </hi>. I am shopman to William Higginbotham, of New Cut, Lambeth, a pawnbroker. On Saturday evening the 15th of August, the prisoner came with some pledges, and when she was gone I missed a gown and shift—I have not seen them since—I went that evening to the pri<lb></lb>soner's house—she asked what I wanted—I said I wanted her—she said, "What for?"—I said, "For taking the articles from our shop"—she said she had not been there—I said she had—she then said she had been to our shop in mistake for another pawnbroker's—we searched her room, and found this wrapper, which corresponds with the one the articles were in—</p>

I was at the prosecutor's shop, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner there, and there was another young man in the shop—the prisoner said to him, "If I take this parcel, will you tell?"—he said, "No, 1 won't"—it was a gown tied up in a wrapper like this—she then took up the parcel, put it under her shawl, and walked out—I told the shopman.</p>

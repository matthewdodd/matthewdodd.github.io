                  </hi>. I am waiter at a refreshment contractor's, 142, Bermondsey Street—on Friday morning, 22nd August, about a quarter or twenty minutes past 1 o'clock, I was at the door of the house, unloading things—the prisoner was at the door; I heard Mr. Philcox order him away—I went into the warehouse to stow away some goods, and hearing a dis<lb></lb>turbance, some trussels being knocked over, I came out to see what was the matter—I saw the prisoner still there, he was a total stranger—I said "Why don't you go away when you have been told?"two or three times<lb></lb>he said "I will put a b----<hi rend="italic">chis</hi> into one of you b----s directly"—as I was going back to the warehouse I received a blow; I did not know I was stabbed till I felt the blood—I saw the prisoner strike the blow, but little thought it was a knife—I put my arm up as the blow was coming—some<lb></lb>body said I was stabbed, and I saw him part with something; I could not see that it was a knife—he took to his heels and ran, and I after him, with three or four of my mates—he ran into a policeman's arms, and asked for protection—he was very drunk—I was laid up for three weeks, and am weak and stiff now, but I think I can go to my work—I don't want to press against the poor fellow, he was mad drunk.</p>

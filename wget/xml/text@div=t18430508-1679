I was on duty at Greenwich fair, on the 18th of April—I saw the prisoner in company with some other boys—I saw him follow a gentleman, and take out of his pocket a bag of gingerbread nuts—I took him directly—the gentleman came part of the way to the station, but he had a ticket to go by the steam-boat—it was just getting dusk, and when I got near the station, he was gone—I had not asked his name, as I was not aware he was going—this is the bag of nuts—I asked the gentleman if he had lost anything of value, and he turned round, and said this was his property.</p>

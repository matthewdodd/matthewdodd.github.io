               <p>Q. Who did you live with when this happened to you?</p>
               <p>Wilds. I was at home at my mother's, in Holborn; she is a char-woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Wilds. Never before last Sunday night; I was coming from Holborn to Holywell-lane, I met the two prisoners in <placeName id="t17721209-44-crimeloc236">Long-lane, Smithfield</placeName>

               <p>Q. What was the first thing they said to you?</p>
               <p>Wilds. They said I should go along with them; I said I would not go; they said I should; they dragged me to my own door in Hollywell-lane; I went to go in; they pulled me out, and said I should go along with them; they took me to Mr. Owen's the Swan in Shoreditch; they had some meat between them both; they hedged me in between them and they forced upon me a great deal of liquor. We staid there about an hour; when I came out into the air; the liquor overpowered me; they pretended to carry me to

               <p>Wilds. Yes I was brought to my senses by the fright; I cried out very much; they said no one had any business with me, I was their sister; that I had drank more then I should do, and I wanted to go to a bad house; but they would carry me home; they dragged me into Bethnal-green-field; at the back of the Blind Beggars, Harrison threw me down in the field; Mitchell held me while Harrison committed a rape on my body, and then Harrison held me by my two arms while Mitchell did the same; then Harrison

               <p>Q. Did you see what they did with your clothes?</p>
               <p>Wilds. No; they beat me and bruised me, I had not strength to go one way or another.</p>

               <p>Wilds. The fright overpowered my speech, I had not power to cry out.</p>
               <p>Q. But you could drink, and drank enough to get in liquor?</p>
               <p>Wilds. They forced it upon me.</p>

               <p>Q. People you had never seen before?</p>
               <p>Wilds. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards was it before you saw? them again? did you describe the persons to the watchman that had injured you - to Butter?</p>
               <p>Wilds I told it to one of the runners of the night in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Butter was the first you saw; what was it you said to him?</p>
               <p>Wilds. I told him I had been ill used and was very cold, and desired him to have some compassion on me; he pulled off his great coat and put it on me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he ask you who had ill used you?</p>
               <p>Wilds. No; I described them to the runner of the night in the watch-house, I described them by their dress.</p>
               <p>Q. How?</p>
               <p>Wilds. One was in a blue surtout coat, with his hair tied behind.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you describe the other?</p>
               <p>Wilds. The other had a surtout coat on, what they call a fryar's coat, a brownish colour; his hair was not tied.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe them to be tall or short men?</p>
               <p>Wilds. Tall.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was in the room when you first saw them?</p>

               <p>Wilds. Two of Justice Wilmot's runners, and the folks that belong to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else?</p>

               <p>Q. They were brought into the room to you?</p>
               <p>Wilds. No, they were in the room; I was carried in the room to them; I sat down; they bid me look about, and I said, they are the men; then I was carried into the coach again to Justice Wilmot's; there I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who besides them was in the room?</p>

               <p>Wilds. On Monday morning.</p>
               <p>- Butter. I found this woman in the fields, about a quarter before twelve on Sunday night, I was crying the hour upon the Green; when I came to the last beat, the last house, I heard a noise; I could not tell justly, where it was; I made up to it: it was against a gardener's gate facing the Globe-fields, as you go to Mile End, behind the Blind Beggars.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from any public street or public passage?</p>
               <p>Butter. She was within twenty yards of the gardener's house; there I found her standing; I asked her what was the matter; she said she was in great distress; I said who has been using you ill; she said two men. I found her naked all but her cap and stocking; I brought her up with our great coats till next morning; then her father and some acquaintance brought her things and took her home.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Whether you did not find some of these clothes?</p>
               <p>Butter. No; a farmer's man found some on Monday morning.</p>

            . Last Monday I found some clothes, about eight o'clock in the morning, in Stonyrock-field, behind Bethnal-green mad-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the gardener's gate?</p>
               <p>Harling. About 40 yards. I found an apron, an old silk gown, a pair of stays, a pair of shoes, two old handkerchiefs and a pair of buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the stays whole?</p>
               <p>Harling. They were an old pair; I do not know whether they were cut or not; there was a half pint pot and the finger of a glove in it, and two old handkerchiefs; I carried the clothes to the Salmon and Bull near the watchhouse, and left them there.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wilds. Where did you get the things from?</p>
               <p>Wilds. The watchman brought them when I was in bed, to dress myself to go before the Justice.</p>

            . The girl lay knocking at my gate some time; a dog of mine barked that waked the family; I opened my bed room, and asked who was there; she said there was one that wanted me; I bid her come round to the window; she said she could not; I went to another window; she said she was in distress, she must and would come in; I bid her go down to the watch-house; she said she could not go down.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Thorn. Just before the clock went twelve. I waited in the room till I saw the watchman come up; he spoke to her; I desired him to take her to the watch-house; he said he did not like to take her without an officer; while he was gone<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177212090023"></xptr> a bye watchman came and took her to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of day did you see him there?</p>
               <p>Owen. Between four and five.</p>
               <p>Q. Alone or in company.</p>
               <p>Owen. There were a man and woman with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay?</p>
               <p>Owen. I believe the best part of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what liquor they had?</p>
               <p>Owen. Five quarterns of liquor called gin and rasberry, and one pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the room full of company?</p>
               <p>Owen. The room they were in was partly full.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing particular in their behaviour?</p>
               <p>Owen. No; I was in the bar, they were in the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the woman, do you remember how she sat, whether on one side, or between them, or how?</p>
               <p>Owen. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you clear Harrison was one of the three?</p>
               <p>Owen. Yes; I am very confident.</p>
               <p>Harrison's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing at all of the person; indeed I remember being in company with some girl, but I do not imagine this to be the same; I parted with her as soon as I came out of the house; the girl was in liquor a good deal; she said she was going to drink tea with somebody that met her; we declined her company and came home.</p>
               <p>Mitchell's Defence.</p>
               <p>I do not remember ever seeing the girl in my life; I was along with Harrison, but I cannot remember being in any house, or with any girl whatsoever; I cannot remember rightly going out; I was greatly in liquor.

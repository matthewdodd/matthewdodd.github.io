                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Francis Bennock and Co. of 80, Wood-street, silk warehousemen—no one sleeps on the premises—on Tuesday, 8th November, about a quarter-past 6 in the evening, I fastened up the premises—the doors were all closed and secured—I took the keys with me—I went' to the premises next morning between ten minutes and a quarter-past 8, and found the door in Wood-street partly open—I pushed it, and found the lock on the mat—it appeared as if it had been taken off from the inside—I found some pieces of silk lying near the door, and found the stock in the place in disorder—some goods were on the ground—seventy-six pieces of silk were missed, about 7,600 yards, worth about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was safe in the warehouse the night before when I left it—it was a peculiar description of silk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, carrying on business at 104, St. John-street, Clerkenwell—on Thursday, 17th November, about 8 in the evening, the prisoner called at my shop, and showed me a sample of lace, of which lie said he had 2,000 pieces—he asked me to buy it—he then said he had a large lot of silks, and asked me if I would purchase—I pressed him as to where he got them from, and after some hesitation, lie said they were not right—I pressed him again, and he said they were from a warehouse in Wood-street—he said it was stolen from Wood-street, and that he and another man had got the lot—he then left, saying be would bring me a sample the next day—communicated with the police the same evening, and Inspector Potter called the next morning—I knew the prisoner's address—I had known him as a trimming and fringe maker for some time—I knew that he lived at 13, Slater-street, Bethnul green—I went there about half-past 6 the next evening, and asked him to show me the silk—he said it was too hot, he could not show it to me then—I did not see the silk then—I next saw the prisoner at his house on Wednesday, 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, about 12 o'clock—he then gave me a sample of silk—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be the piece—I gave it to Mr. Potter within an hour after—I went again to the prisoner's house the same evening about 6 o'clock—he then said he would take me over the water to see the silk, he did not keep it in his own house, because it was dangerous—Mr. Potter and two other officers were then outside—I accompanied the prisoner the same evening to the County Terrace public-house, New Kent-road—I rode there in the prisoner's cart with him—he left me there, and was away for about half an hour—he then returned, and said the man where the silk was was out—he then drove me to Sutton-street on the road home—I left him that evening under the arrangement that he was to come to me the next day—I was to purchase 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silk of him—I told him on the Wednesday morning that I could not purchase that amount, as I had not the money, but he was to call on me the next day—he came about 12 at noon—he wanted me to leave with him immediately—I told him I could not leave for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—during that time I communicated with Inspector Potter—I then went with the prisoner and another man to Horsemonger-lane, where I and the prisoner got out—the man drove the horse and cart away—I and the prisoner went to the County Terrace public-house, where we were joined by the man who accompanied us in the cart—we all three then walked as far as the Elephant and Castle, when the prisoner said, "We had better have our boots cleaned; that will throw the police off all scent"—he said it would throw the police off their guard, or scent—another man then joined us, and we went to a public-house at the corner of West-square, a very quiet house—we stayed thereabout half an hour, when a man came and said he had seen some one watching, and that the silk had been sent over the water, opposite to Rotherham and Co. 's, the large drapers in Shoreditch—I and the man who first accompanied us then got into a Hansom cab and drove to the place named, in Shoreditch—I there saw the same horse and cart I had seen before, with a strange man in charge of it—either the prisoner or the other man said to him, "Have you got the silk?"—he said, "No"—the prisoner then got into the cart with the strange man and drove away, leaving me with the other man—this was about half-past 2—it would take two or three minutes to drive to the prisoner's shop from where we were at that time—in about eight or ten minutes he came back, and said he had got the silk in the cart—he was sitting on the right-hand side of the cart, near the kerb, and he asked me to pass him the money, which I did—I gave him 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver and gold, in two separate bags—I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You had known the prisoner some time, had you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the first time I saw him was probably seven or eight years ago—when I knew him first, I bought trimming of him, at Cater and Co's, of Finsbury, for the firm where I lived—I left there about six years ago—I saw nothing of him after that till eighteen months ago—he then brought me some chenille nets, which I bought, and bought them very dear—I lost money by them—those are the only two transactions I had with him—he has a shop—I believe he. sells silk at that shop—the first policeman I told was Knowles—I went to his house—I went to the station as well—I saw two or three men on reserve there—Potter came the next morning, the 18th—the prisoner did not tell me that the person to whom he was going was a man named Dixon—he did not tell me the name—this man called himself Jones—I did not hear the prisoner mention the name of Dixon at all—I saw two more men besides the prisoner—I saw two men over the water—the man who drove the horse and cart to Shoreditch was the same man who met us at the Elephant and Castle—the man who drove the cart over to Shoreditch was the same man who drove it to the Elephant and Castle—he was the strange man I alluded to—when we got to West-square, he went away, then came back again, and said the silk had gone over to Shoreditch; and when we got to Shoreditch, that very same man was with the horse and cart—I saw no other man—the money I paid was my own money, some I had taken out of my cash-box at home, and I drew a cheque for 102. at the London and County Bank head office, as I went down on the same day, the 24th—the reason I drew that cheque was to detain the prisoner until the officers overtook us—I cashed it myself—the rest of the money was taken in my shop on the two or three previous days—the money I paid to the prisoner has not been found—I made a note of what I have stated—I have the notes with me—I made them as the matter was going on—I did not make a note of every word the prisoner said—I told Mr. Potter the same morning the conversation that took place—I did not make a note of the words that the prisoner used, that the goods were not quite right; that they were stolen from Wood-street; the prisoner gave me some cigars—I never had any quarrel with him at any time—about six months previous to this, he called, and asked me if I could buy some wide silk—I said No, I could not—I then communicated with Mr. Potter—the prisoner did not tell me that he had a commission to sell this silk—these notes were made at different times—on 17th, when I got home I wrote, and on 18th I wrote again—I am quite sure I did not write them all at the same time—I did not write every item; I thought it was not requisite.</p>

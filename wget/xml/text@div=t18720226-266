On Saturday night, 24th February, about 9 o'clock, I was in the Commercial Road—as I turned into Arbour Square I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I turned round and saw the prisoner running towards me rapidly—I attempted to take hold of him by the collar, but was unable to do so—he had his hands out and attempted to push me down—the force of the collision knocked his cap off—he did not wait to pick it up, but kept on running—I pursued and called out "Stop thief!"—he ran round three sides of the square, up Arbour Street East, into Charles Street, where I lost sight of him—I saw him soon afterwards in custody at the police-station—he had run by there—when I saw him I said "That is the man, and he very near knocked me down"—the prisoner replied "Yes, and you knocked my cap off"—I sent for the cap, it was brought in by a constable, and he claimed it and put it on in the dock—it was then partly covered with mud.</p>

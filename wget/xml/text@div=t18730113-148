                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, of 97, High Street, Deptford—on 2nd January, about 1 o'clock, I missed a waterproof cloak which was just inside my shop—it was safe fire minutes before—a com<lb></lb>munication was made to me, and I saw the prisoner on the opposite side—she appeared to be bulky, and I sent my young man over to her, and the cloak was pulled from under her arm—she said, "Don't look me up, another girl gave it to me"—I said, "I shall," and she ran away—I ran after her, and gave her in custody—this is the cloak; it is my property, and worth 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I really did not take it—a girl gave it to me, and asked me to hold it, as I was standing opposite the shop, and I was stupid enough to do so—I waited a quarter of an hour with it opposite this very shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I had seen it safe five minutes before—there was no other girl outside—you were walking along by yourself quite fast—it is false to say you were standing outside a quarter of an hour.</p>

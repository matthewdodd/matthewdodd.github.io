                  </hi>. I am proprietor of the Horseshoe, Tottenham Court Road—on the 3rd March, the prisoner and his daughter came to reside in the hotel—he was a stranger to me—he had two bedrooms and the partial use of a sitting room—I supplied him with all he wanted up to the 27th March—he asked me to lend him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., saying he had only Irish notes with him, and they were so difficult to pass in London, and he should have to return them to his bankers—I gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 27th he asked for his account, which was properly delivered to him, and he came to my office and asked me whether I would take a cheque on his bankers—he owed me 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for hotel matters and the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Yes"—he then asked me to give him a sheet of paper, which I did, and he drew up the cheque, and I asked him if he wanted a receipt stamp—he said no, he had one—I asked him the name on the top of the cheque, and he said "Bally<lb></lb>haunis"—he said that was his bank, and asked me for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. changel out of the cheque, which I gave him—I paid the cheque through my bank (the London and County, Oxford Street branch), the same afternoon—it came back in due course, marked "No account"—I firmly believed it was a straightforward cheque, and would be duly met—he told me he wanted to hold a drawing in respect of the "Short-horned Company," for the benefit of the poor of his district, and asked if it could take place at the hotel—I told him it was within the Lottery Act, and I could not have it drawn at my place—he sold the books of tickets to a number of my friends at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I have never seen anything of the cow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> You gave me some names as references respecting the cow—you asked me whether the tickets would sell best at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said for an Irish lottery such as are sent to me by post 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the usual thing—I know you have received cheques from other gentlemen in the country, and they went through my bank and were cashed—during your stay you were a teetotaller—you told me you had sold a couple of horses to a Mr. Hutton for 200 guineas, and you asked me if he gave you a cheque whether it would be good—you asked me first if he had been a bankrupt, and I told you I had reason to believe he had from what I saw in the papers—you told me Mr. Hutton had given you an order on his secretary for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that you were too late to get the money, and he had given you a letter—I said that had nothing to do with me—the London banks close at 3 on Saturdays—when you left you gave me your address in Ireland, and requested me to forward your letters—I retained them on receiving the telegram from Ireland for the order of the Court—I suppose many of them contained money from what you told me—there were not more than three letters in the establishment at the time I received the informa<lb></lb>tion from Ireland that the cheque was a false one—from what you told me I believed they contained 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheques from various gentlemen from the sale of these books—I suppose now there are 30 or 40—you only wrote to me once, and that was the afternoon of Bank Holiday, when you wrote to say that you wished me to forward your letters still, but to hold the cheque over for a day or two, and I telegraphed that the cheque had been returned to me from Ireland unpaid on Tuesday morning—I do not remember re<lb></lb>ceiving a letter or telegram from Stockton-on-Tees saying you were sorry to</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Durban Bank at Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, Ireland—on the 27th March no one of the name of Charles Ellison had an account at our bank—the prisoner has never had an account there that I know of—I received this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and sent it back as marked now—the prisoner had no authority to draw.</p>

From instructions I received I went, on the 3rd April, to South Stockton, north of Yorkshire, and on the 4th I went to the police-station, where I found the prisoner detained—I told him I was a police officer from London, and had a warrant for his arrest for obtaining 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him if he would like me to read the warrant to him—he said "Yes," and I did so—he said he was very sorry, but at the time he gave the cheque he thought some friend of his would have paid the money into the bank to meet it—I saw his brother-in-law at Bow Street, and had some conversation with him in the prisoner's presence—he had previously been bail for the prisoner, and he told me the prisoner had no means whatever now, that he had already spent a good deal on him, and could do no more—the prisoner did not contradict it—I found these documents on him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I brought him up from Stockton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant, of Leicester and Notting<lb></lb>ham, and live at 64, Portsdown Road, Paddington—I have known the prisoner about twelve years, and was aware from him that he was plaintiff in a Chancery suit—I advanced him money for fees, and my friend Mr. Smith and others did the same—the suit has been going on about twelve years—it is about twelve months since I advanced him money—I cannot say the exact date he asked me to do so afterwards; but I was very little in town, and did not do so—after I declined, some of my friends received these postal cards—these cards addressed to Messrs. Geddes, Mr. Slater, and Messrs. Keosh are the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To Messrs.

The bribe was taken in wines, &amp;c., as a sham, to force Mr. Eldred L. B. Pearce into a deed now held by him to rob him of millions collusively in his Chancery suit of thirty-seven years a suitor. On an indictment Smith and Donaldson would be transported for life. The case in Chancery has been decreed on by three Lord Chancellors in plaintiff's favour up to 29th July, 1868.—41, Manchester Square, London, 23rd November, 1870.")

                  <hi rend="italic">here cautioned the prisoner that he was giving meaning to the cards by his questions</hi>)—I never received any money or goods collusively—I jumped from a baker to a wine-merchant all of a sudden, because I chose to do so—the money came from my own industry—I never heard of Colonel Dawkins—I never took a single farthing, directly or indirectly—Smith and I are not partners, he is out of the business now—my partner is Robert McCargo.</p>

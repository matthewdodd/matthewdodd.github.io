There was a very large box which he took care to send from my country house to a house in Piccadilly. I got a warrant to search that box but it was gone then; upon which we open'd another little box of his (he was by at the time) there were 2 handkerchiefs, a towel, napkin, and other things (produced in court.) This napkin is part of a set. The towel has my mark on it U 12. There are 2 pocket handkerchiefs, which I put out of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280008"></xptr> pocket a day or a before. The leather garters are what I used to do up my boots with. The 3 brass sockets are mine. As to the candles, I do not swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say at the opening of his box?</p>
               <p>Underhill. At first he said there was nothing but what was his own.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether I did not offer master the garters 3 or 4 days before, and he desired me to put them by?</p>
               <p>Underhill. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you leave Warwickshire ?</p>
               <p>Underhill. I left it at Christmas last.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not customary for your servants to have napkins to clean their plate?</p>
               <p>Underhill. Yes, proper plate cloths, but not such as these.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner trusted with your plate?</p>
               <p>Underhill. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your ever find any of that missing ?</p>
               <p>Underhill. No, he dealt in smaller things.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he things deliver'd to him as your butler, to have in his custody?</p>
               <p>Underhill. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he an opportunity to have made his escape, the day he was taken, if he had been so minded?</p>
               <p>Underhill. He had. I believe; but I suppose he did not care to go without his wages.</p>

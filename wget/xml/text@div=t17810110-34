She offered me all she had about her and all she had in the world if I would not proceed against her. She further said, if I would go into the back shop with her she would relate something to me that would induce me not to proceed against her; she entreated Cope in the same manner and said she had something to say to him that would induce me not to proceed against her. The other when we detained Gilson was exceedingly troublesome; she said there was nothing found upon her, and if we would not let her go she would force her way. We locked them both in till the constable came, and then we took them in a coach to the justice's.</p>

               <p>About four o'clock last monday afternoon the prisoners came to our shop and enquired for some white persian; I shewed them two quantities; I told them they should have a yard of the best for two shillings. When I cut that off, they enquired if I had got any pale pink persian? I told them we had; I shewed them two pink persians, one paler than the other, the palest of which they fixed on; and enquired of me the quantity that would take to line the hood of a cloak.

At the time I was looking over the counter I saw the piece of persian standing up under the stays of Gibson; it seemed to me to stand nearly perpendicular to the peak of the stays.</p>
               <p>It did not stand on the ground? - No.</p>
               <p>She had a long cloak on, you could not see whether she kept it up with her hands or her legs? - Probably both; I cut her off the persian.</p>
               <p>You did not see her take it off the counter? - I did not see it till after it was in her possession. I cut her off a piece of persian and missed the largest piece of the white persian off the counter; I was then sure it was a piece of persian she had got in her possession. She then enquired for some quilted coats, which I shewed her; she bought a quilted coat, and gave seventeen shillings and sixpence for it. I put it in a piece of paper and came on the other side of the counter, the side next the door. The coat was put up in paper and tied; and as they were going out of the shop they said they should call the next day and buy a cloak. I went out of the shop; I passed by Mr. Arnett, and told him the women had robbed us. I overtook them very soon after they got off the step of the door; they were never out of my sight. I stopped them and told them they had robbed us of a piece of persian; they said, what! we rob you? Yes said I, you have; you must come back and I will search you; they came back into the shop; I catched hold of

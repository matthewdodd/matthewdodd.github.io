On the 29th of September last, I heard a noise at the public-house, called the Ship and Blade Bone; I went into the house to get half a pint of beer. I saw Mrs. King, the landlady, about two minutes before I went in; directly I went in I saw Hannaway; he was very active in swinging a stick round, and then he came up to me, and hit we on the head, as if he had a done on purpose.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260030"></xptr>Q. Before that, had you interfered as watchman - A. No. I was having half a pint of beer, and said nothing. I catched hold of him by the collar, and asked him what he did what he had struck me for; etc gave me no answer. He threw me down, and hit me in the mouth, in the house. I got up again, and I crawled out of the house on my hands and knees, and as soon as I got out, I was knocked down again. My lips were out to pieces, and my teeth knocked in, and one of my fingers bruised. I cannot say who knocked me down; there were three or four of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of the men who were there at that time - A. No</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Harden - A. Yes. I saw him before I came out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first came into the house, did you see these four prisoners there - A. No; only the one that I swear to; that is Hannaway; I did not see any of the other three prisoners there. After I was knocked down out of the house, I sprang my rattle, and several watchmen and a patrol came to my assistance. We went behind the house, and found Hannaway. I gave Hannaway into custody; King, the watchman, had Hannaway in custody, and when I went into the house there were fifteen or sixteen men; four or five followed me out.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether the prisoners were of the party, do you - A. Only Hannaway; he followed me out of the house; he gave me a blow. I gave charge of him for that blow. The rest of the party that followed, I do not know who they were.</p>

               <p>Q. When King was taking Hannaway to the watch-house, were you attacked by any body - A. Yes, by Connolly; he ran at me to do me some mischief, he had no weapon in his hand; he was trying to get hold of me; I guarded myself with my stick, as well as I could, until he got my stick from me. I went to Old Gravel-lane, and called for assistance.</p>

            's; when I come up he was bringing Hannaway towards the watch-house. I was knocked down as soon as I came up. I cannot say who knocked me down; there were about ten or twenty with sticks. I said to my partner, deliver the man to the watchman, and draw your cutlass. Hannaway was sent on with King and another; the attack began in Silver-street; there were about sixty or seventy of them, they had got bludgeons. I put myself in a posture of defence, to prevent them from rescuing Hannaway. They began upon me first with bludgeons. I put up my left arm to save my head, it-fell down after, it was broken. I fought with my cutlass a got bit; my arm was broken with sheir bludgeons. I was knocked down; they jumped upon me at the time I fell down, my cutlass was in my hand. The prisoner Connolly took it out of my hand. I put up my hand to save myself, and Conolly struck at me with the cutlass; he cut my fore-finger of my right-hand as I laid down almost off. I crawled under a cart, and got away. I heard Shields call out for assistance, I went to him; I could not see any body. He was smothered in mud; I knew his voice well. I can only speak to Conolly.</p>

            . I was called in about twelve o'clock at night, the night he received the injury. He had received six blows on his head, three of which were very considerable. They were inflicted with a blunt instrument, one wound on the right temple, and one on the left. One on the right side the crown, and the other on the left. He lived until Monday twelve o'clock, that is four days. I opened the head with my brother surgeons; we removed the upper part of the skull, and, after removing, the first covering of the brain in the membrane of the brain, we found a quantity of serum.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that an indication of an injury of the brain? - A. No doubt, Sir; this was underneath where one of the blows were; the blows on the right side of the head, that was sufficient to account for his death, with the other appearances we saw. I have no doubt he died in consequence of the injuries he received.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. My Lord with respect to the prisoner Hannaway, he cannot in law be responsible for the sudden act of others in which he took no part; this case cannot be murder, at the most only manslaughter.</p>
               <p>COURT, Gentlemen of the jury, upon this evidence you cannot convict Hannaway; you will acquit Hannaway, and then you will consider that of the other prisoners.</p>

             the watchman came into my house, a quarter past eleven at night. He seemed to be rather intoxicated. When he came into the house he and another man had a quartern of gin; he had no beer at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a person of the name of Hannaway there? - A. Yes, he was standing close to the bar. I was coming out of the bar with a pot of beer in my hand; he put his head to my shoulder, and shoved me away in jest; he did me no injury. I never had an angry word with him in my life; he lodged with me. I took no notice of his shoving me away. I went into the parlour with the beer, and returned into my bar again. I then saw Jaarvis the watchman and Hannaway have hold of each other. I cannot say who laid hold of the other first. I saw Hannaway trip the watchman up; immediately the watchman went out, and sprang his rattle, and three men came in, and took Hannaway; that is all I saw.</p>

I said, let me look at him again; I looked at him, and said he was like the man that came for the wine, but only he was not so drunk as he was: I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Did not Sheldon say, do you know the man, and you said no? - He asked if I knew the man; the answer I made was, this looks like the man that robbed me of the wet linen; I did not say no at first.</p>
               <p>Had not Sheldon at the time told you this was the man that came for the wine? - No; he said, is this the man that robbed you?</p>
               <p>What did Sheldon say more? - He said nothing, but went and sat down; there was nothing of the wine mentioned: I am clear he is the man that took my linen.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was turnkey at Clerkenwell-bridewell: one night about nine o'clock, the latter end of February or beginning of March, the prisoner called at the gaol and insisted upon my drinking with him, because I used him well when he was in my custody; he fetched two pots of beer; he and I and another young man drank it.</p>
               <p>Was he drunk then? - No; he would insist upon my having something better, and asked me what I would have; I told him I would have a pint of red port mulled, and he went and brought it.</p>
               <p>How was he after he drank that, was he sober? - Yes; after that pint was out he said he would fetch a second pint, and then he would wish me good night; he went away, and did not return; the maid brought the second pint.</p>
               <p>What time did he go for the second pint of wine? - I think it must be full ten o'clock; the maid came again in about ten minutes after she brought the wine, and said they had been robbed; I met the prisoner this day fortnight in St. James's Park, and took him; I was determined to take him whenever I met with him.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Did not Mrs. Bursell say she did not know me? - Yes, I believe she did at first.</p>
               <p>COURT. Repeat the conversation that passed between Mrs. Bursell and you. - I brought the prisoner to Mrs. Bursell's, and met her in the passage; I said, Mrs. Bursell, do you know this gentleman? she looked at him very stedfastly, and said, No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Was there a light in the passage? - It was about twelve at noon.</p>
               <p>What did you say upon that? - I said, don't you remember being robbed? this is the man that came for the wine; she then said, O law! I think I recollect his face.</p>
               <p>This was in the passage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did she say when you took him into the kitchen? - I took him into the tap-room; nothing else was said; I did not take him into the kitchen at all.</p>
               <p>To BURSELL. Was the man that came for the second pint of wine the same as came for the first pint and the two pots of beer? - I am clear he is the man.</p>

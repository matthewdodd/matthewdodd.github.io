That she went to them, and saw Frances Coats holding Dorothy Fennel by the Hair of the Head, or Head-Clothes, with one Hand, and beating her upon the Stomach with the other; and Dorothy Fennel cry'd out, O Lord, my Stomach. That the Prisoners Elizabeth Richardson held the Hands of the Deceased, and said, Get up, get up. And she, this Witness, believes, that Richardson thought she had hold of the Prisoner Frances Coat's Hands, for she is blind. That she coming in, Dorothy Fennel said to her, Country-Woman, they tear me Limb from Limb. That having gotten her up, she sat down at the Door, and groaned very much, and the next Day she was found dead in her Bed.

That thereupon she went and pull'd Dorothy Fennel away from the Prisoner, upon which she caught up her Crutch, and struck Dorothy Fennel a violent Blow on the Head with it; and that after this Fennel complain'd grievously of her Stomach. That afterwards she met her in Leather-lane, going to make her Complaint to the Overseers for the Poor, and to desire them to get a new Lodging, for she said she would lie there no more, for they had beat her almost to Death.

Other Evidences depos'd, That after she had been at the Overseers, in Order to get a new Lodging, and being advis'd to go Home to her old Lodging that Night, she did so, and went to Bed, and about 5 the next Morning complain'd mightily of her Stomach, and desir'd to have some Water to drink, instead of which they got her some Small Beer, and about half an Hour after she was found dead in her Bed.

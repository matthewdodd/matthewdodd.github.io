                  </hi>. On Saturday evening, 14th February, at 12 o'clock at night, I saw Mrs. Perry and her child in the passage of 4, Oak-lane—I did not see the prisoner, he was in his room; but I came down for a light for Hammond and Phillips from up stairs—the prisoner's door was open, and a pair of scissors hit me on the hand, and went from my hand unto Mrs. Perry's child—she called out, "Oh, my God, my child is murdered"—I saw the scissors pulled out.</p>

                  </hi>. M. R. C. S. I live at Limehouse—about the middle of November the child was brought to my surgery—I examined its head, and found a punctured wound penetrating to the left side of the skull, above the ear, through the membranes of the brain, and wounding the brain itself—the child survived longer than I expected it could have done, and I had it examined by a surgeon at one of the London hospitals—it died in March, and I made a post-mortem examination—after removing the top of the skull, I saw the wound in the brain, and pressing down upon it the brain collapsed, and nearly three-quarters of a pint of matter escaped—these scissors would be likely to produce the wound, and it could scarcely end otherwise than fatally—the child died from suppuration of the brain, caused by the wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you sure of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Almost as sure as I can be of anything—matter formed in the brain—that might have been produced by other causes, but here was cause sufficient for it—a scald would do it if the scald was sufficient—if the scissors produced it, I should not have ex<lb></lb>pected it to have occurred before, there is such wonderful tenacity of life in children—it was about a year and a half old—I examined the traces of scalding when I made the post-mortem examination—I saw a redness, but that had nothing to do with the suppuration—the whole hemisphere of the brain was one mass of matter—the wound was about an inch and a half in depth—I could see the wound in the brain by means of a candle—the depth they penetrated to would depend upon the force with which they were thrown, and the resistance of the bone of the skull; but they wounded another person first slightly, and glanced off—the skull is not quite bone.</p>

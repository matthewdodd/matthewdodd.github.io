                  </hi>. I keep a lodging-house in Craven-street—the prisoner was my servant. On the 3rd of December I missed some tea, sugar, bread, and meat—the prisoner was brought to me by a policeman, with a jug containing meat and bread—the policeman asked me if it was my jug—I said, "Yes"—he asked if the bread and meat were mine—I said, "Yes, no doubt it is"—I had long suspected the prisoner, and had accused him of taking tea, sugar, and bread—I had missed articles of this description—the prisoner was then taken to Bow-street, and a key found on him—he was not present when a box was opened with that key—the officer returned to the house and opened the prisoner's box with that key—a bag of tea and sugar was found in it—it corresponded with what I had, and what I had missed—the jug is mine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant F</hi> 10.) I thought it necessary to watch the prisoner on the 3rd of December—I saw him at half-past ten o'clock at night—he had this jug, and this bread and meat in it—I saw a woman whom I have seen him meet before—he did not meet her that night—he returned, and took him with these things—I asked who the woman was who was generally waiting for him—he said, "My aunt, she washes for me"—I took him, and saw his mistress—I took him to Bow-street, and found eight lumps of sugar, and this key on him, which he said was the key of his box—I opened the box and found this tea and sugar in the box, and the sugar found on him exactly corresponds with the sugar found in his box.</p>

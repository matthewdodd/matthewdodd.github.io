Manley, the watchman, brought three live fowls to the house, before six o'clock in the morning of the 4th of August. The prisoner was in custody. They were kept in a hen-house - I had seen them safe the evening before, about dusk, as they were going to roost. There were six of them; they used<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230009"></xptr>to go out into the street - they were all safe then. William-street is parallel with the timber-yard.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Sunday morning, about five minutes before five o'clock, I heard watch called; I went up, and saw the prisoner running with this bag in his hand - I pursued, and overtook him. and asked what he had in it; he said fowls, and I found three live fowls in it. He said a boy gave them to him; he did not know who he was, or where he lived. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a bed-post carver, and live in John-street, Curtain-road, nearly opposite Gough's. I was looking out of the window a little before five o'clock in the morning and saw the prisoner and another man driving the fowls from William-street, into Le Blanc-buildings, which is no thoroughfare. The prisoner went down the buildings to lay hold of them, and the other stood at the entrance to prevent them from getting out; the prisoner had a bag; when he went out of the buildings I saw he had got them in the bag. They came by my house, and I charged them with stealing the fowls; they denied it. I called watch, and they ran off. The watchman took the prisoner; the other escaped. I was undressed, and could not follow.</p>

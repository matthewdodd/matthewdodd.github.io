            ; I am the son of Mr. Harris. The prisoner was porter to Messrs. Broom and Harris; the carpetting was not missed from the warehouse until after it was found on the prisoner. I saw the carpetting at Bow-street office; I know the carpetting to be the prosecutors property. I had occasion to cut off six yards from the pi and the three yards that was left.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRIFFITHS. I am foreman in the Strand. On Saturday, the 18th of December, the prisoner stopped at the door, which attracted my attention; asked I would purchase a calf skin, which the habit of doing; he took it out of a piece of brown holland, and then I saw it was a piece of carpetting by his hesitation I was induced to think it was purloined. I taxed him with it; he said, he had purloined it; he told me freely. I said, I am sure you never came by this honestly, where did you get this; he said, that was nothing to me. I then said to him, I conjecture you are an upholsters porter, that he had been laying it down at some house and this was a remnant; he said, it was. I said, who is your master; he said, that was nothing to me. I insisted upon knowing, or he should not have the property. He said, he was an upholsterer in the City. He had a small bit of paper in his hand which led me to the knowledge of Messrs. Broom and Harris. On Sunday morning I went to Mr. Schofield; I asked him where he purchased the rug; he told me of Messrs. Broom and Harris; I went to Messrs. Broom and Harris; I saw their foreman; I asked him if they had such a man; he said, they had. I asked him if they had missed any thing; he said, I could not tell. This is the capetting the prisoner offered me for sale, and the carpet he admitted he had stolen.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Reed-place, East Greenwich which is a mile and a quarter from Mr. Owen. I was at Lewisham that Sunday waiting for the Maidstone coach, and there I saw the prisoner not further from the prosecutor's than from here to Ludgate-hill—he had another man with him—I saw something drop, and called after them—I told them they were leaving their dinner behind—they turned off the footpath to come to me, and the prisoner said, "Will you swear that I dropped that meat?"—I said I could as safely swear I saw him drop that bit as I did the last (I saw two pieces drop from the prisoner)—the constable came and asked me if I would walk back to the. shop, and he took the two bits of meat—he had the roan in his charge at the time, and he took them back to the shop—I wont with them—Mr. Owen began to say something about some one—he said he thought this man had got it, and he would search him—the prisoner said, no, he should not—the constable searched him, and found about half a pound of suet in his pocket—Mr. Owen said that suet belonged to him—the prisoner said he had bought some suet of him—l believe there was an argument about some small quantity being bought.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the London Docks. On Wednesday the 12th of June, I was at work at the back of Nos. 4 and 5 Warehouses—the prisoner, who is a custom-house officer, was there—there were some hogsheads of tobacco being rolled out of the back shed—one that came out was rather open in the head-part round the rim—I am confident there was no tobacco hanging out of it—as soon as it was stopped, and the men that had turned it out went back for another hogshead, the prisoner made a start at the hogshead, and took a handful of tobacco out of the end of it, turned himself round quickly, and put it under the tail of his coat—he kept both his hands behind him—I directly told Smith of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the London Docks. On the 12th of June, Thomas made a communication to me—I saw the prisoner take a hand of tobacco from the head of the hogshead, retreat about ten yards from the hogshead, and put it underneath his coat tails—I went and asked him what he had about him—he made no reply—I asked him for the tobacco he had, and he handed it to me from underneath his coat tails—I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself, a man like him, he ought to have known better—he made no reply—I told him to go about his business—I took the tobacco and threw it up into our own warehouse, where Thomas was.</p>

I am a locker in the service of the Customs—I am in charge of the tobacco warehouse at the docks—the prisoner is a locker in the tea department—that has nothing to do with the tobacco warehouse—they are convenient to each other—he had charge of the tea warehouse—these casks of tobacco were being rolled from the shed I had charge of, to another warehouse—I cannot say whether the prisoner had any right where they were rolled—he had no business there that I know of—there were no teas there—about one o'clock that day Thomas spoke to me, and pointed out a hand of tobacco like this—I could not swear this was it—I went to the prisoner, and said, "Mr. Watling, did you take this tobacco out of the cask?"—he said he did not, he picked it up to give to me—I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself for doing such a thing, and whatever he said after that I did not hear, because I walked out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable in the London Docks. I have known the prisoner as being employed in the docks by the Customs many years—on the 12th of June, I went to the Surveyors of Customs'-office—the prisoner was sent for, and was questioned by the surveyor as to what business he had there—he said he was going to the privy—there are several privies, the most convenient and nearest would be at the back of No. 5 warehouse—to get there he would have to pass before the tobacco warehouse, but not where this trans<lb></lb>action took place—he said he had picked up the tobacco for the benefit of the revenue—he did not say he took it out of a crack in the cask.</p>

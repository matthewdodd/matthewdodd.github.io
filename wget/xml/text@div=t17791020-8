On Michaelmas-day, the 29th of last month, I missed five shillings out of my till; it was marked the preceding evening, on a suspicion I had of the prisoner, from the information of my apprentice. I sent for a constable, and when the constable came I called him out of the cellar, where he was about his usual business, and desired he would show me what money he had got in his pocket; he laid down the money he had in his pocket upon the counter. I looked over it, and selected 5 s. from it, which I had marked the preceding evening in the presence of my apprentice; those that had impressions I marked with a knife in the edge over the head; those that had no head on them I marked on each side directly opposite. I found 5 s. with these marks, which marks I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Did you charge him with having taken them? - I did; he said he had not taken any, but he seemed very much confused. I charged the constable with him, and sent him to the Compter; he was taken before the alderman and committed; he has relations of some credit, therefore I should be glad if the court would permit him to go for a soldier.</p>

I was present, on the 28th of September, when my master marked the money that was in two tills; he put one mark on the edge of those that had heads, and the plain ones he marked with two marks on the edge opposite each other. In the morning I missed 5 s. and told Mr. Winstanley of it. A constable was sent for, and the prisoner was called out of the cellar, and desired to produce the money he had in his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177910200023"></xptr> pocket; he pulled out of his pocket half a guinea, and about eleven shillings in silver, out of this Mr. Winstanley selected five shillings which we had marked in the evening. Mr. Winstanley asked me if I knew them; I told him I did; that they were the five shillings we put in the till the preceding evening.</p>
               <p>Are you now certain they were the five shillings that were in the till the preceding evening? - Yes; they are them (producing them.)</p>
               <p>When they were found what did he say? - He faintly denied it; he was so confused he hardly knew what to say.</p>

               <p>I was frequently sent out with silver for halfpence.</p>
               <p>To Chambers. Was there any silver marked any time before the 28th? - No. On the Saturday I counted the money in the two tills, and set it down on a piece of paper, and on Monday I missed three shillings; on Monday night I counted it again, and on Tuesday I missed six shillings more; then I told my master of it, but there was none marked before.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a very good character.)</p>

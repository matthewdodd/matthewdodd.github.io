Codd's in the year 1843, she was introduced by a Mr. Augustus Minniken, as a widow—she was present at the time of the introduction—in Nov., 1855, she called at our office—she came in consequence of our having refused to let her have any more money—I have paid cheques for her, I mean cheques drawn on our house—she applied in Nov. last for the usual sums which we paid her on account of her accruing pensions—our house received money for her on account of two pensions, the Lord Olive Fund, and the Madras Military Fund—they were received by our firm at the house of the East India Company—we continued to receive the Olive Fund from 1843, up to 31st Dec. last—when the prisoner came to us in Nov. we had received a letter, which was shown to her, and she read it—Mr. Codd was present as well as myself—this is the letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "To Messrs.

The person who intro<lb></lb>duced me to you was this Dr. or Mr. Minniken, and lately requiring a sum of money to carry on some mining operations in Germany, he did everything he could to induce me to raise a sum of money for that purpose, even if I could on the policy of my life insurance. But not meeting Mr. Minniken's views on this point, he turns round and threatens to injure me, in every possible manner with you, to the extent that I am married; but this I peremptorily deny, he has not and cannot have any proof of such marriage taking place. The threat he holds out to you regarding me is done merely to give me annoyance. I am not in his debt; on the contrary, he owes me upwards of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. He is now in the Queen's Bench, having been removed lately from Horsemonger-lane Prison; his debts are numerous, and in every respect he has acted disreputable, and truly disgraceful, which is well known in the City. He has assumed the name of Dr. Augustus Ligonier Minniken, his name being James Minniken; he is quite an adventurer, and I know he does not and never did possess a shilling property. Messrs. Watson, solicitors, near Finsbury-square; Mrs. Robinson, No. 34, George-street, Minories; or Mr. Laurie, Fleet-street, will bear me out in what I state; and several others. This Captain Marriott I do not know, but I am given to understand he was formerly a Cornet in some regiment, went to Bombay, and sent home for bad conduct. He is also in the Bench, a companion of Mr. Minniken's. I deny his having any certificate of my marriage, indeed, he cannot; and I hope you will take no notice of his letters. He is a most base, worthless fellow, devoid of all feeling and character. I have not done anything to injure him, more than what I now state, but his threats I dis<lb></lb>regard, and have told him so; he has done now all he possibly can do in writing to you. M. E. M'Nair.")—We were satisfied with the receipt of that letter, and the person writing the letter signed Warren not having come as he said he would, to bring the documents he spoke of, we continued to act as her agents—in March last she again came to our office; that was on the subject of a second letter that we had received—we showed her that second letter, and she read it—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "To Messrs.

Sir,—I am directed to inform you it is now decided to send Mrs. M'Nair's certificate of the marriage which took place at Bow Church on the 28th May, 1846, to Grindlays and Co.; but, previous to taking this course, a respect for you sincerely entertained by a gentleman whom you do not know, induces the parties concerned to give you this notice, in order that you may retain any sum due to you from policy of insurance, or other<lb></lb>wise. In fact, I am requested to advise you that, from circumstances which you may conceive to be grave, the placing of the certificate in the hands of the proper authorities cannot be deferred; this being unfortunately forced upon those by whom I am commissioned to address you.

Grindlay—the draft of the answer is endorsed upon this letter, and I should add that the address, "No. 19, Tottenham Court-road," was added by me—there was no address to it when it came; we told the person who brought it that a reply would be sent, and we put down the address—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "No. 19, Tottenham-court, New-road.

               <p>—I do not know the exact amount, but it was half a crown a day, which made it a little more than 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a quarter—it is necessary, before it can be obtained, to hand in to the department a declaration like the one produced—I received this declaration on 6th April last—the prisoner called at the military department, I remember her—she handed me this declaration—seeing the word "agent" written at the foot, I asked her if she was the agent to Mrs. Mary Eliza M'Nair, the person named in the declaration, or whether she was Mrs. M'Nair herself—she said that she was Mrs. M'Nair—I thereupon filled up the usual printed form to the cashier—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) is it—I gave it to her, and she left—she left the declaration with me—I filled it, up, and put it on one side—if I had known that she had married again, I should not have directed the warrant to be given to her—(<hi rend="italic">The order directed the cashier to issue a warrant to Mrs. M.

One day, early in April, the prisoner came to the office with this order directed to the cashier—I turned to the warrant book, and found that up to that time the warrant had been received by an agent, Messrs. Codd—I then asked her if she was the party mentioned on this paper—she said, "Yes"—I asked her if she was aware that by receiving it herself she would cancel the power of attorney—she said she was aware of that fact—she produced another paper at the same time, referring to the Madras Military Fund—I told her that she would have to get that exchanged at Messrs. Grindlay's, the agents for the Madras Fund, and therefore she had better do so, and receive the two warrants at once—she took the paper back, and left, and I did not then issue the warrant.</p>

Codd had hitherto drawn the pension, I could not pay her until I had written to them—the particular pension was not the one now in question—I told her to come on Monday, the 7th—she came, and I then showed her a letter we had received from Messrs. Codd; she applied for a copy of it, and I told her to write for it, which she did—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>: "Messrs. Grindley, 5th April,</p>

Codd for the proof that they alluded to, and that the case would have to go before the Committee of the Fund—I told her that there were rumours that she had been married, and I asked her if she would make an affidavit that she had not, and as far as I now recollect she declined to make it—she said she was not married, that there was no truth in the report—I then had some conversation with her about her children—this is the letter she wrote, about a copy of Mr. Codd's letter—I (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "To H.

I then rose as well as I could, gave the alarm of stop thief and watch as loud as I could; finding nobody about me, or any probability of my retrieving what I had lost or finding the persons, I had it in contemplation to go home, as I was very bloody, but before I got to the corner of Chancery-lane to turn round, I heard a cry that they had got one; I stopped then till the watchman came up with him; the watchman shewed me the hat, which he said he had detected him with, the prisoner was then by, between the watchman and another man; the watchman then shewed me a hat which he had taken him with, and asked me if it was mine; I immediately claimed it, and said it was my hat, he was then taken to the watch-house; I there charged him with this and left him with the watchman, and the next day I appointed to go to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. When the prisoner was brought back you did not know him to be one of the persons? - A. It was impossible for me to say in the situation I was in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. This was half past eleven at night. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The person left behind did not strike you after the rest were gone? - A. I think I did receive several blows as I turned to get my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some time spent then in struggling for your hat? - A. I don't apprehend a minute altogether, the situation I was reduced to from the first blow was such that I can't say whether the after blows were given with sticks or what.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner searched when he was taken? - A. Yes; but there was not any thing found upon him belonging to me but my hat.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a cook: I was standing at the gate of the Queen's-head tavern, Gray's-inn-gate, at half past eleven at night; I saw a number of men assembled together on the opposite side of the way, they had sticks in their hands; after that a great number ran all off except one; I heard a person's voice, but I can't say whether it was Mr.Card's voice or any person's else; it was a cry of stop thief, or something of that sort; I could not exactly discern what it was; I ran across the road, and saw Mr. Card reaching for his hat; Mr. Card was neither down nor up, but upon a kind of a rise; I ran towards Middle-row, because I saw the man run off that took the hat up; I ran till I came nearer Middle-row, I made as if to go across the road, and instead of that I went strait through Middle-row; I lost sight of him in Middle-row; and in about a minute and a half afterwards I had gone just below the bars, when I met the watchman and another, with the person now at the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you observe whether that person had any thing with him? - A. He had only a hat on; he had nothing in his hand at that time; but the person that picked the hat up had a stick, and a hat on: when I came up, the watchman said he had a hat on his head, which is powdered.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner's hair powdered? - A. It was not; I said there was a gentleman that had been robbed between Southampton-buildings and Chancery-lane; upon that I returned, and left the watchman, and found Mr. Card just by Chancery-lane; I called to Mr.Card, and told him there was a man in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were pursuing this man, whoever he was, did you observe any other person running near him? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, looking at the prisoner, tell us whether you have any knowledge of him? - A. I have no knowledge at all of him; he was about the same size person; but I cannot take upon myself to say that it was the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when any hat was found? - A. Yes; the hat that the prisoner had on was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other hat found than that which the prisoner was taken with upon his head? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>DAVIS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman; on the 2d of May, between eleven and twelve, I was standing before my box, just by Holborn Bars; I was walking up and down, with my bludgeon under my arm; I heard a cry of "stop thief!" I saw a vast number of people coming through Middle-row; I ran forwards across the street; I was on the opposite side to Middle-row; I ran over the way, and saw a man run very hard; and I called out "stop thief!" after him; he was running towards Fleet-market; I ran after him, and pursued him; I was rather afraid of going by myself; a man went after him, just outside of the crowd; I laid hold of his collar, and said, my friend, I have got you, you are the thief; I am not a thief, he says, I run after the thief; I told him I was very sure he was the thief; I turned him round by the shoulders, and told him not to use his hands to any thing whatever; I then called for assistance, to one Howard, who is inspector of the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from Middle-row was it you stopped him? - A. I don't think it is much less<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110122"></xptr>than 100 yards; I took him back again towards Middle-row, and a young man (I believe it was the last witness) told me a gentleman had been robbed; we went on a few doors on this side Chancery-lane; the prisoner said, there is my hat lies there; there was a hat laid there, underneath a window; I said to him, you have got a hat upon your head, who does that belong to? he said he did not know whose hat it was; I looked at the hat, and saw it powdered; he said he was hurt, and had been knocked down, and he had picked it up in the street; he said, let me pick up my own hat; I told Howard to keep his hand fast, and I stopped and picked it up myself; the prisoner said that was his hat; and then I saw this gentleman here (Mr. Card) the blood was running down him very much; I asked him if he knew any thing of that hat? I took it off the prisoner's head, and the gentleman said it was his hat; and from there I took him to the watch-house, and kept the hat ever since, (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Card. I am certain this is my hat.</p>
               <p>Davis. I searched him in the watch-house, and found a false tail in his pocket, and a small keg.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a stick any where? - A. Yes; after I had been at the watch house and came back again, I found this stick, just by the place where I took him, (produces it.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. As to the stick you did not see it in his hand? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there a great many people running? - A. Yes; a great many cried out, "stop thief!"</p>
               <p>Q. The hat that he said was his, you would not have seen if he had not pointed it out? - A. No, I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. And he said, the hat he had on he did not know whose it was; that he had lost his own and took up that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOWARD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am inspector of the watch; between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was coming down Castle-street, I lolborn, and I heard the rattles going about Middle-row; I tucked my great coat round me, and ran, somebody was coming down the street, but upon my coming, they turned back and went towards Holborn-hill; somebody said, that was one of them, I followed him, it was not the prisoner, and then Davis immediately took the prisoner, and called me to his assistance, upon which I let the other go, and the cook, Mr.Cowen, came up, and said, the gentleman that had been robbed was on the other side of Middle-row, and we took the man to Mr. Card, he was all in a gore of blood; but before we got to Mr. Card, the prisoner made a bit of a stop, and said, let me take my hat up, your hat, says I, you have got a hat on; yes, says he, but that is my hat; then the watchman took the hat off his head, and I perceived a good deal of powder hanging about it, and he walked some little way without any hat, and then the watchman gave me a hat, that, he said, was his, and took him to the watch-house; the prisoner said, the next day, the man that I was after, was the man that had got the watch; I asked him who he was, he said, he did not know him, only that day he had been playing at skittles with him at the Bull-in-the-pound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr.Const. Q. Were you at Bow-street when he was examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state any of this that you have now stated? - A. I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to omit so particular a circumstance? - A. I mentioned it before the Grand-Jury.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say it before the Magistrates? - A. I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. But will you swear you did? - A. No; I don't think I did say that before Mr.Bond; you seem to harp very much upon that point, but he said it to the next witness that will be called as well as me.</p>
               <p>Q. But I find you did not state that before the Magistrate? - A. Then you find I was not over severe before the Magistrate.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watch-house keeper, of St. Andrew's, Holborn: On the 2d of May, about half past eleven o'clock, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house, charged by Mr.Card; I searched him, I found nothing upon him but a false-tail and a key, and a hat of Mr. Card's; we have two prison-rooms; I put him first in the front-room, he asked for a piece of paper, wrote a note, and threw it into the street, and then I put him in the backroom, because he should have no communication with the street, he then desired another piece of paper, and a pen and ink, and he wrote a note which I have got here, and asked whether I could send it, I understood it was to his father; I did not send it, I then went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to you or in your hearing, while he was in your custody? - A. He asked me if I knew the watchman that stopped him, I told him I did, that his name was Davis; he asked whether he could see him, I asked him what he wanted with him, he said, he was a poor felon, but he wanted to send that note, in order to procure a few pounds to give to Davis, to prevent his evidence, or some words to that effect; I told him, he could see him when he came, he would be at the watch-house to go to Bow-street; during the time that he was in the watch-house, he damaged the watch-house, by pulling down the wainscoting in different places; he likewise pulled part of the seat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110123"></xptr>ing up where the prisoner sat down, and there was a hole made in the ceiling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing about Howard? - A. No; only about Davis.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was coming down Holborn-hill, I cannot say rightly the time, some little distance before I came to Middle-row, I heard a cry of stop-thief, accordingly, I sat out and ran, thinking to overtake the thieves; as I was going down Middle-row, crying out stop thief, somebody came behind me, and hit me a violent blow on my back, which very nigh knocked me down; however, I recovered myself, and in the blow I lost my hat; I saw a hat lying before me, and I put it upon my head; when I got a little below Middle-row, Davis took hold of me, and said, I was his prisoner; I said, I was not, the thief was gone forward, and he laid hold of me, and as we came back towards that gentleman, I saw my hat, and when Davis took me, and brought me to the watch-house, he says, he went back and looked for the stick, now, when he took me, he had the stick in his hand, the ceiling I never touched, and the wainscotting I only just touched.(The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a very good character).</p>

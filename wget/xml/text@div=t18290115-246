            . I am an officer of the Customs. I was on Cox's-quay, and saw the prisoner about one o'clock in the morning - he was a stranger there; he had nothing in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150105"></xptr>his possession then; I saw him again in four or five minutes, with the coat on his arm: I asked him about it; he said it was his master's, and that he lived at No.8, Rosemary-lane; I laid hold of him, and said he must give me a better explanation, and in half a minute Furneaux came - he then ran away up a gateway, which was no thoroughfare, and I took him; Furneaux claimed the coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I did not run away from him? A. He did; I am certain he told me it was his master's; he afterwards said he had picked it up.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HARLEY. I am a watchman - I belong to the quay; I saw the prisoner on the quay, with the coat on his arm - Gibbs was speaking to him; he said the coat was his master's who lived at No.8, Rosemary-lane - I directly collared him: he ran from me, and was secured- he said he was a stranger, and had only come to town that night; and said, if I was a stranger, and picked up a prize in the street, would I not take it.</p>

               <p>Now is it here sealed up? - It was here sealed up; it is just broke open.</p>
               <p>Did you see Godfrey put his seal upon it; - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the seal? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Have not you examined exactly what the letters were? - I see Godfrey put his seal upon it; he borrowed some wax of the clerk on purpose to do it.</p>
               <p>Did you see him put his seal upon it? - No; they called me out at the time into another room.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the seal, what was it? - I can't recollect what the seal was.</p>
               <p>Has it remained sealed ever since? - Just in the same manner as it was.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to the prisoner, when you looked in at the door, do you recollect the prisoner's face? - I can't.</p>
               <p>When you first saw the three men, was the prisoner one of them? - I did not see any of them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. He has spoke to the prisoner looking in at the door, all he has spoke to is the man coming out.</p>
               <p>(The bundle produced in court.)</p>

               <p>To Jackson. Can you swear that the same seal is on it now as when it was delivered into the shop? - I can swear that.</p>
               <p>How can you say that, when you say you don't know what the seal was; the seal may be broke open, and another put upon it? - I saw two dim letters, I could not observe what they were.</p>
               <p>Were they the same letters as when brought here? - I could not tell exactly what they were.</p>

               <p>I live at the Green Dragon; I am bookkeeper there; I heard Jackson call out thief, and I ran over the way; Jackson had the prisoner in his hand.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the house? - I went over the way directly; Jackson had got the prisoner by the collar, and I saw him drag him into the house; I saw a bag of linen at the door; it laid on the stone step at the door; I went to Godfrey to fetch him to give charge; I went to the Mansion House with him; I searched this man.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing upon him? - No; I saw a bag of linen sealed up before the justice; I can't tell what the seal was; I saw Mr. Godfrey seal it; was carried to the Mansion House, and then put into the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>It is pretty heavy, I believe, do you think it possible for the prisoner to carry such a bundle as that? - They might carry it between them, I suppose; he is big enough.</p>
               <p>You saw him, and that his arm is withered, and that he was in the hospital? - He said so.</p>
               <p>You searched him and found nothing upon him? - The constable searched him; he did not find any thing upon him.</p>

               <p>I am a nurse at St. Bartholomew's hospital.</p>
               <p>Do you know this young man? - No farther than being a patient in the hospital; I never saw him before in my life; he staid there till Sunday was fortnight, and then he went out to get a clean shirt about half past three.</p>
               <p>How long had he been a patient? - Seven weeks; he was not discharged till Wednesday.</p>
               <p>What is the matter with him? - He has got a bad arm, very bad indeed.</p>
               <p>Had he any other complaint besides his arm? - He could not lift his arm up to his head. It was a swelling in his arm; he could not lift it properly to his head when he wanted; he could not lift a quart pot up with his hand.</p>
               <p>You are still a nurse? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How long? - Upwards of nine months.</p>
               <p>Do you know the young man? - No other than by his being a patient there; I never saw him before; he came to be a patient almost nine weeks ago; he was in a very bad state of health; they were rubbing in mercurial ointment, for he had a swelling in his left arm.</p>
               <p>How is his health besides? - Very bad; I never saw him to the contrary while he remained there.</p>

               <p>It is in Bishopsgate-street; it is not a great way.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the prisoner coming to see you last Sunday fortnight? - I do; it was pretty near five when he came; he asked me if I had heard from my son at Coventry; I told him I had; he said he could not stay, for that he must go back to the hospital.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - About five o'clock when he left me; I can't say positively as to the time; he is a weaver; he has worked for our family, and he has worked for my son; he is a hard working young man, and at the same time he went to the hospital he was working for my son.</p>
               <p>What is his character? - That of a very industrious hard working young man; I am certain to it.</p>

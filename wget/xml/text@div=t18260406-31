               <p>BENJAMIN CLAY. I live with Mr. Curling, a salmon salesman. This salmon was in my care, to be weighed and delivered to master's customers; on the 14th of March - about ten minutes past five o'clock in the morning I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060017"></xptr>missed it from a basket at <placeName id="t18260406-31-crimeloc164">Billingsgate</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there none in the market but what you had? A. None; I did not go round the market to see, but I can tell without that - if any had been left the day before it would not be of this quality; they come from Ireland to master; I had sold a box and a half of salmon that morning to different people- there might be twelve in each box.</p>

            . I am a fellowship porter at Billingsgate. I saw both the prisoners that morning, a few yards from each other. I saw Painter stoop to Curling's basket: he appeared to have a fish in his hand; he went towards the bridge; whether he took the fish away I cannot tell - Benjamin followed him immediately. I heard in two or three minutes that a fish had been stolen and sold. Clay went in pursuit, and in half an hour I saw them standing close together opposite the market; Benjamin then had a tub with a salmon in it; I told Clay they were the men who I supposed had it; Benjamin was stopped first - I saw the kit and salmon at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Benjamin works about the market? A. Yes; he carries fish about sometimes.</p>

            . I am a salmon weigher. I saw the prisoners in the market - they were sometimes together; I saw Stephenson and Clay together, and in consequence of what they said I went round the market - in half an hour I saw the prisoners together - Benjamin had a salmon kit under his arm; I told Clay; Stephenson was close to me; Benjamin held his finger up to me - I saw him pass the salmon kit over to Painter, and, in five minutes, I saw Painter brought into the watch-house, with the kit and salmon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was half an hour after the fish was missed that you saw them? A. Yes; it is not common to see fresh salmon in a kit, I did not take them, as Stephenson did not mention their names; he only described their dress; the prosecutor had all the salmon which came that morning. I have known Benjamin twenty years - he was often in the market buying fish. The prosecutor had sold about twenty-two that morning, but had not delivered them.</p>

In consequence of missing something, I had her searched - I offered to search her myself, but she would not let me; I sent for my brother up, and then she allowed me to look at the duplicates, which she produced - they referred to a gold ring, a shirt, and two sheets - I gave them to my brother, who gave them to the officer - I had lost a gold ring, worth 1l.; the sheets belonged to my brother William, and the shirt belonged to Benjamin Ebbs, who lodged in the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I asked for a little money for some tea and sugar, and beer - you said that servants did not want such things. Witness. I let her have 7s. one day, but it was soon gone; she had very few things to put on when she came, and I gave her three dresses, which were very good - she had been paid three months' wages, at the rate of 10l. a year.</p>

               <p>FREDERICK GILL. I am in the service of Mr. Gill, a pawnbroker, in Wilmot-street, Brunswick-square. I have a ring, which was pawned by the prisoner, I believe - I have a shirt, which I took in, but I have not sufficient recollection to enable me to swear to the prisoenr - I have the counterparts of the duplicates; these two correspond with them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You asked me if it was mine when I pawned it; I said No, I should not leave it long. Witness. She said she had brought it from Sarah Cole; 1 lent 3s. on it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ANDREWS. I am in the service of Mr. Boyce<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110082"></xptr>I have a sheet and a shirt, pawned by the prisoner - I recollect her perfectly.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

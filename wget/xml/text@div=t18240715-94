I went up to the office on Saturday week; Mr. Hoggins persuaded me not to go before, but I had a summons to go on that day.</p>

On finding the bill by Mr. Stafford, the officer asked for 3 s. 6 d., and my father paid it; he had told me in the morning that I should have to pay 3 s. 6 d., and 8 d. - the officer sent me home for it; I got it, and paid it to him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner on the 27th of June, at the corner of the Park gate, Pall Mall; he was picking pockets when I saw him; I saw him make two or three attempts to do so; another was with him, who backed him up, and said,</p>

               <p>"Take it." I then saw them follow Mr. Lawrence into Pall Mall - the prisoner took the handkerchief, and gave it to the other, whose name is Bowdler. I gave Leather to Cook, an officer, and took Bowdler myself, but he escaped; I then took the prisoner to the Thames Police - when I was in Covent-garden he said it was his first offence, and he hoped the prosecutor would look over it; the prosecutor said he would speak to his father.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You took both the boys, and gave Leather in charge to Cook - A. Yes; Cook is not here: I took hold of Bowdler; he escaped from me.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did Lawrence pay you when the bill was found - A. None, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not send the boy home to get any money - A. No. I paid 6 d. myself. I never sent him to get 3 s. 6 d. nor 8 d., nor any money.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen his mother this afternoon - A. Yes, and have seen her before to-day, but I never drank with her since this period.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never induce the woman to go drink with you, or rather to treat you while you were drinking; and frightning her son - A. No.</p>

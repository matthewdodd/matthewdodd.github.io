               <p>Court to Matthison. I understand you had seven or eight people about you. How came you to mention only these three? - I did not know their names, and there was none took any money but these two prisoners at the bar; I don't know how many there was in the room; there was none took hold of me, or did any thing to me, but these three in the bar and one man that got away; there was other people in the tap room, but they did not meddle with me; Barlow first laid hold of my arms and then another man came and laid hold, and Barlow and the woman picked up my money; I cried out the moment that Barlow laid hold of my hands; there was none<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200010"></xptr>see him that I know of; they would not tell me their names or nothing, the people that were in the room would not.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor came to me on Sunday morning about nine o'clock, and I went with him to Salt petre-bank, and I desired him to keep behind me, and follow me into the house, and I went into the wrong house; afterwards we went into the Black Lion, and I saw Fitzsummons there, and he pointed to this Fitzsummons and said, that he put the candle out; the landlord interfered and said, that Fitzsummons was not concerned, it was

             and Poll Loney, because he ran out from the bar and saw the prosecutor on his hands and knees, and he pulled them off from him when he was on the ground; and I believe he gave evidence to that effect before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court. Your memory Mr. Dawson does not seem to be quite accurate; the examination reads the same as Mr. Young has now said. - When Hugh Young was before the magistrate and they had taken down his evidence he contradicted a part of his evidence. I took Fitzsummons away about ten o'clock at night; I went into the Nag's Head by the side of Tower-hill, were Loney and Barlow were sitting, and I apprehended them.</p>
               <p>Court. I am not fond of officers so forward in court of justice; where they give their evidence right and proper it is a pleasure; but when they come to swear to fact, and refer to writings, and are not confirmed in it, it does not look so well.</p>
               <p>Court to Young. Did you say as Mr. Dawson states before the magistrate? - If I said so I must have said a great falsity, he did apprehend me so at first, but I corrected it and said as I said now, that I saw him near me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Barlow. I was only sitting in the tap room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Loney. I had been at Mr. Young's, and I went out and I was going towards home, and I met this man, he asked me where I was going; I said, home; he went home with me and made me a compliment of 6 d. when he came out he said, he had but two six-pences or he would stay with me all night; however, he said, he would treat me with a pint of beer; we went into Mr. Young's and had a pint of beer, and he gave the other woman that was along with me the 6 d. to get change and pay for it, and she would not return the change, so Mr. Young threw down four-pence farthing; says she, rather than you shall be the looser I will give the change; and as he was coming out he bawled out, says he, I am robbed; that is all I know of it.</p>

            . I am waiter at the Horse and Groom. On Tuesday evening, the 18th of March; I saw the prosecutor and the two prisoners come in; they sat down, one on each side of him; I saw his fob turned inside out - I thought they were his friends: I saw him go to sleep; I think it was Simmington who I saw putting his fob in again - the other prisoner was on the other side of him, and could see what was done; I cannot say that Simmington was sober.</p>

            . I belong to the Coldstream Guards. On the 18th of March I saw Lynn in Chandos-street; he said he was going to get something for supper, and went into a shop to get some bacon; the prosecutor and Lynn then came along; Simmington said, "This is the man for me;" we then went to a house to have half a pint of gin; I said it was time to go home - the prosecutor pulled out his watch, and the chain broke; Simmington then put the watch into the prosecutor's pocket; I then went on with them to the Horse and Groom, and left them there.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>SIMMINGTON's Defence. The prosecutor said he was a townsman of mine, and I gave him my direction to call - I had no idea that he was going to charge me with such a thing.</p>
               <p>The prisoners received a good character.</p>

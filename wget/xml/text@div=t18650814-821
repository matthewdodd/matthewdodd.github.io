                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Flanaghan, of 7, Mason's-buildings, Night-street, Southwark—the prisoner lodges in the same house, she is the landlady's daughter—on Sunday, 16th July, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I was coming down stairs into the yard and saw the prisoner in the kitchen—I said, "Margaret, where were you all the night?"—she said, "What is that to do with you"—I said, "It is not out of <hi rend="italic">no</hi> harm that I am asking you, I want a candle"—she said, "D—you and the candle too," and then she caught me and threw me against the stairs—I went up stairs to my own room—she followed me and called me "Flanagan's w—, I said, "I am not, I am a lawful married wife"—she then said, "I'll swing for you, you b——old w—, I'll swing for you," and struck me with the candlestick on the top of the head, and I fell—she then took the fender from the fire-place and struck me with it three times and broke my ribs—I do not know what occurred then—I was taken to the station on a stretcher, and afterwards found myself in the hospital—she kicked me—I had marks on my arms—I was black and blue—I remained in the hospital three weeks.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am dresser at Guy's Hospital—on Sunday morning, 16th July, Mrs. Flanaghan was brought there on a stretcher—she appeared to be insensible; her head was bleeding profusely—I found an incised wound on the back of it, laying the bone quite bare, about an inch and a half long—this candlestick might inflict such a wound if used with great violence—a branch of the occipital artery had been divided, which caused the extreme effusion of blood—I applied pres<lb></lb>sure to it, which stopped the hæmorrhage entirely—I examined her again after she was put to bed—her face was bruised all over, all down the left side of her body, down to her hip, was bruised, and she had two fractured ribs, the seventh and eighth—she was exactly three weeks in the hospital—that fender might possibly have produced the injuries which I saw on her side and her ribs.</p>

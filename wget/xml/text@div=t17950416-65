I see him on Good Friday evening standing on the barge; I see him take the deal out of the barge, and afterwards take it on his shoulder, and walk on the green banks, which is near two hundred yards distant. I followed him, and never had him out of my sight; and as soon as he stopped, I laid hold of him. He asked me what he had done? when I took hold of him by the collar, I said, you know what you have done. He said, I only took it for a step ladder or else a toe board, that is a plank to walk on to the barges. It belonged to one Mr. Fletcher, of Coulchester; I put them on this barge, I am positive to the deal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going up Green-bank, and going home. I meant not to make my property of it. Why did not he apprehend me on the barge if he see me?</p>

               <p>I am a waterman. I see him take the deal out of the barge, and followed him till he pitched it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not you apprehend me at the time I was going home? there was a carman in great distress, it is a nasty bad street, full of holes, and a man had his horses down, and I gave him all the assistance I could. The man begged me to go and beg a pulley, what they use at the brewers drays; I went, and could not get any; and I went on dock, and thought of one of our ladders; there was never a ladder there; there was a deal plank, and I took it; and when I got back to the green, the cart and the man were all gone; they lighted me up with the deal, the street was so bad. I did not think to steal it, or make any property of it. That is the truth and nothing else. I have no witnesses but God Almighty, and you the gentlemen of the jury. He never apprehended me till I was about three hundred yards from the place. He knows me well; he has known me these ten or twelve years.</p>

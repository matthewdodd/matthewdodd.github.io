                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 104, Britannia-street, City-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch—I rent the whole house at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—William Goodruff is the landlord—the prisoner and her hus<lb></lb>band occupied one room at the top of the house, which is the second-floor—William Holmes occupied the first-floor—I have a room, called a store-room, on the same floor as the prisoner's room, where I kept all my boxes and things, all that I was possessed of, except my shop goods—I had all my linen and wearing apparel put into four boxes, all of which were locked, and the room was also locked—I went to that room the last time the second day that the prisoner entered the house—I then got a bedstead and bed out for her—that was, as near as I can tell, eight weeks before the fire happened—at that time all my things were safe—there were three band-boxes in the room—I looked into one in particular, and there was my straw bonnet, and best shawl, and silk handkerchief, and two or three more things—I cannot say exactly whether the prisoner was in the room at that time—when I delivered the bedstead to her I was called down stairs, and did not go up again—I left her and an old man there, and in half-an-hour or twenty minutes she brought the key of the room down to me, and said she had locked it all safe—the old man's name is George—he lodges in a house I have in the same court—on Saturday morn<lb></lb>ing the 3rd of Dec., Mrs. Holmes came down stairs near upon nine o'clock, just as I had got up, and said, "Mrs. Cooper, the house is on fire"—slept in the parlour, on the ground-floor, and Mrs. Holmes lodges in the first-floor—I immediately went up stairs—there was nobody there but Holmes and me that I know of—I said to Mr. Holmes, "Where is it?"—he said, "Here it is on the landing"—there was no flame, but the landing, close to the prisoner's room, was all smouldering, and my store-room-door was burnt a little—we found rags all burnt out like tinder lying along the landing—I found nobody up there but Mr. Holmes—we threw water over the tinder, and put it out—I thought it was all safe—I went into the prisoner's room, and looked about, but saw no fire there—she was not in her room, nor was anybody there—her door was on the latch—I went down stairs immediately, and in about two or three minutes Mrs. Holmes came down again, and gave another alarm of fire—I went up stairs directly, and found Mr. Holmes up there again—I pulled out my key, and put it into my door, but could not unlock it—Holmes tried, he could not unlock it, and burst it open—I could not see any thing for smoke, it was so violent, but I threw the window up, and felt my way round the room, and at last saw a very small glimmering light, not larger than a halfpenny candle—I went, and caught hold of it, and found it was a bonnet-box—I ran into the prisoner's room, and put it in the fire-place—a great quantity of people came up stairs—I went into the room</p>

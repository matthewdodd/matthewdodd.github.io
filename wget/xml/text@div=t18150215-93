The prisoner slept in the room exactly over me, I heard him get out of bed, I was then dressing myself; I heard him unlock the door, and shut it, I followed him down stairs immediately, the servant maid was cleaning below, I heard her unlock the door, and let him out. I came down stairs and opened the house in the course of two or three minutes the chamber maid came down, and said he had stolen the things specified in the indictment. I pursued him, but in vain,; about five o'clock in the afternoon, a witness who is present and the prisoner, came into my house in a state of intoxication. I had him directly then taken into custody, I am certain he is the man, he set in my tap-room the whole of the afternoon.</p>

            . I am a taylor. On Thursday the 19th the prisoner came into a public house where I was having a mutton shop in the evening, he had some dinner, and a woman with him, they dined at the same table; he dined there on the Friday. On Friday evening, as I was going home he asked me if I could reccommend him to any place where he could get a good lodging, it was in my road to pass the prosecutor's house; I told the prisoner they had very good beds there, It was a respectable house, as I thought. We then went into the parlour of the Angel Inn, he called for a pint of ale, the officer came in, and took him in custody.</p>

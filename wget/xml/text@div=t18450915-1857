                  </hi>. I reside at No. 59, Welbeck-street. I was returning home on the 5th of Sept., about fi ve o'clock, and whilst I was knocking at the door, a person pulled a purse which I had in my hand—it was twisted round my finger, and the person did not succeed in getting it from me, but he drew me about two yards from the door—the purse contained about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I heard some one call out while the person was pulling the purse from me—in consequence of that call the person let go the purse and ran away—I did not see his face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am coachman to Mr. Highford, who lives in Welbeck-street. The prosecutrix lives in the house—about five o'clock that day I was coming up the area steps, and saw a lady being dragged by something in her hand—I could not see who it was, but when she turned I saw it was Miss Buhot—I went to the man, and he ran away—I followed him, and he was taken at the end of Hollis-street—the prisoner is the man—I have no doubt about it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 48.) I was on duty in Oxford-street on that afternoon—I saw Coling—he pointed out the prisoner—I went to take him, and he ran off—I pursued him, and came up with him in about three minutes—when I took him he said he knew nothing at all about it—he said he was not the man that tried to snatch the purse from the lady—I had told him I took him for attempting to snatch a purse from a lady—I had lost sight of him once in a street that runs into Cavendish-square—he was not out of my sight for a minute, and when I saw him again he was still running—I have no doubt at all that he is the man that Coling pointed out.</p>

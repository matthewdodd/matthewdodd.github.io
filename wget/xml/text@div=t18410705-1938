                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Cook, a dairyman, in Cranmer-road, Brixton. On the 8th' of June, the prisoner came to our shop for some eggs which came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a sixpence—I gave her 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and she left the shop—I laid the sixpence on the table, sepa<lb></lb>rate from any other money—I looked at it soon after she had left, and found it was bad—I laid it on the mantel-piece, and there it remained—on Saturday, the 12th, she 'came again, and asked for a pennyworth of milk—I knew her again—she talked of her mistress being ill, and appeared in a great hurry—I thought she was a servant—she had her sleeves tucked up, as if she had just come from her work—in consequence of that I permitted her to go away—I gave her change for that sixpence also, and put it in the same place—about a minute or two after she had gone I looked at it and found it was a bad one—I put that with the other, and they remained apart from all other money till I gave them to the policeman—on Friday, the 18th, the prisoner came again for two eggs—she gave me a shilling—I examined it, and called my husband—he immediately went for a policeman—I remembered her as the woman who had been with me twice before, perfectly well—my husband returned with an officer—I then went to the place where I had put the sixpences—I gave, one to the officer, and in my fright I left the other—I carried the other to the Magistrate when I was examined, and now produce it—I gave the shilling to the officer.</p>

            . I lost two coats from my house on the 17th of April, from my box in my bed-room - I heard some persons were in my house about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, and saw two men in the street, one of them had my coat on - I believe the prisoner to be the very man who had the coat on, but he was at too great distance for me to swear to him - I believe him to be the man - the coat was afterwards taken from a coach, and two others which he is now indicted for we took off his back; it was three quarters of an hour after the robbery.</p>

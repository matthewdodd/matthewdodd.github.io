                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Wood, who is in the Excise. We live in Lucas-street—on Monday, the 8th of April, I was in Stepney fair—I had a geld eye-glass round my neck suspended by a ribbon—I felt a tug at my ribbon, and a crash of the ribbon cutting—I turned and said to Jones, "You have got my glass"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "You have given it to somebody"—he said, "No"—I told the policeman—he took hold of them—Kelly said, "Here is the glass; I was just going to give it to the lady."</p>

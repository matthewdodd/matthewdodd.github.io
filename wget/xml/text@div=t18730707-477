                  </hi>. I am minister of the Presbyterian Church at Armagh, Ireland—I know the prisoner as Berson Reuben Allender—in 1870 he came to Armagh as assistant-master at the Royal School there—he gave lessons in German, and, I believe, had classes—there was a gentleman living there named Kidd, who had a daughter, Emily Gambia Kidd—the prisoner was married to her on 8th March, 1871, by me, in my church—he signed himself "Berson Reuben Allender" in the Marriage Register—when he came to Armagh he called on me, and sent in his card—I received him in my study—he told me his name was Allender; in fact, Allender was on the card; that he was a converted Jew, and had been in college in Edin<lb></lb>burgh, and was to be a clergyman in connection with the Free Church of</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, High Street, Bow—on Tuesday afternoon, 18th June, I went with my brother Stephen and a young man named Jackson down to the River Lea to bathe, near the Hackney Marshes—when we got there was a crowd of people, about on the bank and bathing—they tried to put their hands in my brother's trousers pocket, as they were lying on the ground, and we came away—as we were walking along the prisoners and the others threw stones at us, and they kept on for about a quarter of a mile, until we came under a railway arch—we waited there for them to pass us, instead of passing us some went in front and some behind us, and before I was aware of it I was throttled and thrown on the ground—I could not say who did it—there were seventeen or eighteen of them—I was on the ground from five to seven minutes, and while I was on the ground I was kicked on the head and about the body—Wood kicked me on the head—Standley kicked me in the back, and one, not apprehended, hit me in the eye with a stone—they tried to put their hands in my pockets, but I kept my hands in—I had two half-crowns—they threatened to dash my brains out if I did not take my hand out, and I would not—I had hold of the towel with one hand and the other was in my pocket—Wood jumped upon me and kicked me in the head, because I would not take my hand out—I said I would give them all I got if they let me get up and did not murder me—they let me get up, and then those on the outskirts of the mob began to run away when they saw some men coming over the railway bridge—one of the crowd, not any of the prisoners, snatched my pin out of my scarf and said "I will have this," and my hat was lying on the ground, and they took that—one of the men put an old hat on my head which did not belong to me—after that they ran away—my brother and Jackson were standing about three yards from me, not being touched—when they ran away I went on the opposite side of the bridge, and we went over the bridge and followed them—the prisoners were amongst those we were following—they weat</p>

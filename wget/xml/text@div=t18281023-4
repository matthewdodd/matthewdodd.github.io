On Saturday, the 20th of September, I had been to the Swan public-house - I had a pint of beer, and was going home about half-past eleven o'clock at night; I was going along the road and overtook the prisoner's wife, she was alone; I asked her for a half-quartern loaf which I had lent her the Saturday night before, (I had lent her one) she said she had not got one with her, but if I would go home with her she would pay me; I agreed to go with her - I had not then seen any other person; I walked with her about two hundred yards towards her home - I walked at her side - she did not lay hold of me, nor I of her - we walked on decently, and about two hundred yards on, somebody hallooed out "Nance," in a rough voice; she went back and said "George, is that you?" he said something to her, but what, I could not hear; I could not see who was talking to her at that time - I saw him knock her down and kick her about; (it was the prisoner) she then called Murder! I went back and asked him if he was going to murder the woman - he said "If you do not go away, I will serve you worse than I do her;" I then went to pick the woman up, as she was still on the ground; he went to push me away as I thought, but I felt something prick me, it run into my side - I dropped the woman and ran away - he ran after me; the prick was in the lower part of my body - he followed me, I dare say a hundred yards, and said, "You b - r, I will stab you;" I did not then know he had run a knife into me, but I knew something was run into me, and as he came by the gas-light I saw his hand raised up, and the blade of a knife about three inches out of his hand - that was when he said he would stab me; I said,"You have stabbed me!" he said, "You b - r, I will murder you;" I ran forward - he ran on, and I called Watch! some persons came to my assistance; he was secured in a very short time - I gave charge of him, and his wife came up to me, and gave charge of me; she told the watchman to take charge of me as well as him, charge for charge; the watchman let go of him, and took me - he sprang his rattle, and another watchman came; he was secared, and taken to Islington watch-house - I was taken to Mr. Jeaffreson's, the doctor's-shop; that was twenty minutes after it was done: I have the shirt here which I had on - it is stabbed through; the stab was below my waistcoat - I was stooping at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing passed between you and the woman, except your asking for a loaf, and her saying she would pay you if you went home? A. No - I had made no proposition to her, or offered to kiss her, or any thing; there was nothing improper whatever.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said he would go home with my wife in my room - that he had been with her before, and he was a stouter man than me.</p>
               <p>COURT to THOMAS SUMMERFIELD. Q. Had you, in any manner, intimated to her that you wanted her to go with you for any improper purpose? A. No, nothing of the sort - she left me when he called Nance.</p>
               <p>Q. While he was beating her, did she suggest that you had endeavoured to take any liberties with her? A. No; I swear solemnly nothing of the sort took place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He knocked her down, and said he would do as he pleased with her.</p>

            . I am a surgeon of Islington. I was called up between twelve and one o'clock, to see the prosecutor - I found a wound in his belly, which they said had been done maliciously; it was a puncture from some sharp instrument - the knife produced is very likely to have been the instrument: he might have lost about an ounce of blood - if the wound had been a little deeper, it would have produced instant death.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home intoxicated; having been wounded in the head, and had a glass of liquor - this man was drinking in the same place with me, and attempted to strike me before I touched him; he fought me about two hours before, and nearly killed me; he came into the Bull public-house and took my beer away - he bit me and we fought; I have been in the army fourteen years - I work for Mr. Laycock.</p>
               <p>The prisoner then handed in a paper, which was as follows; On the day in question, on my way home from employment, I met the prosecutor, in company with my wife; after remonstrating with him, as to the apparent intimacy between them, the prosecutor replied that he had a greater claim on my wife than myself; he immediately struck her down, prostrated her at my feet, and from the feelings most men possess towards their partners in life, I committed the assault complained of; I have been under Lord Wellington at Waterloo and in several engagements - I have a pension for life, in consequence of a wound in my head; I therefore might, as a military man, have been more irritated than another - the prosecutor was able to go to his work next day; my wife is in attendance, and will prove the truth of this statement. I am a poor man and beg to submit my case to the humane consideration of your Lordship.</p>

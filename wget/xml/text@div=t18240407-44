I was awoke about two o'clock in the morning by their noise. I had fastened them up about eight o'clock that night. I got up and found them gone; and between ten and eleven o'clock that morning I got a search warrant, and went to Lawrence's house with two officers; he lives at the tile-kilns at Harefield, about two miles and a half off. We found some fried and raw liver upon a rack in his cottage, and a pail of bloody water upon the floor. Churn lodged there; we found both the prisoners and another man sitting round the fire. Churn's breeches were spotted with blood; he attempted to run away; one of the officers fetched him back. I put him into a cart; he said,</p>
               <p>"What is the value of your pigs" - I said between 4 l. and 5 l., he said,</p>

               <p>"If you have 5 l. paid you, and the officers have their expenses, do you want to hang anybody." I said,</p>
               <p>"No, I do not know that I do, but I am sure you are the men who drove my pigs away this morning." he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I was not the man, but I was with the man," and said that it was

            . After we had been before the magistrate, he said,</p>
               <p>"I can tell you where one of your pigs are; it is in a meadow about a hundred yards from where you found it had been stuck, covered up by the hedge." I went there, and found the pig stuck and covered with rubbish. Lawrence came to me on Monday the 15th; he said he came about poor Will. I said,</p>
               <p>"What is it" - he said,</p>

               <p>"I will give a 1 l. note with his father sooner than he shall be sent away." I said,</p>
               <p>"You are a very civil fellow, but if you had nothing to do with it, what makes you want to give a pound-note." I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Beale Road, Old Ford Road, and am a cabman. About 12.20 on a Tuesday morning, I don't remember the day of the month, I was on my cab stand at Cambridge Heath, while stand<lb></lb>ing there I saw two young men and a female going along the road on the right hand side of Hackney Road coming from Shoreditch church. I also saw three men following them on the same side of the road, I should say from 4 to 6 yards behind—I heard some loud talking, I looked towards them—the three men parted from the others and walked across to the top of the cab rank—the prisoner who was one of them turned round and used some vulgar expression towards the female—he was then in the middle of the road, at the top of the cab rank—he held up a knife and said, "You b----if you come and fight with me, you b----<hi rend="italic">sod</hi>, I will rip this up your b----guts"—I had not heard either of the other men say anything to him before that—the two young men who were with the female then walked across towards these three and left the female at the other corner, and all of them walked right to the other side of the road and then we heard a scuffle—I could not say who began the scuffle—I went up to them, I got close to them—I was not more than 4 yards away from the prisoner and Freeman—the prisoner stepped back a few steps, unbuttoned his coat and pulled out something, and made a stab at Freeman—he made a plunge at his left hand side—he bent a little and stabbed up, like that—Freeman called out "I am stabbed, you have stabbed me"—the prisoner was then walking quietly over the way and buttoning up his coat—Free-man put his hand like that and kept on reeling about—he did not fall down—I followed the prisoner who walked towards his two companions who were on the other side of the road, and made some sign or signal to the companions who were following, and they all three turned and walked towards Cambridge Heath Bridge—I followed them, and saw a constable and spoke to him, and we went up to the prisoner and the other men, and I picked the prisoner out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was very dark—there were from a dozen to sixteen persons round altogether, not more—I did not see the beginning of the scuffle—I stated before the Magistrate that the prisoner used the expres<lb></lb>sion "If you come and fight me I will rip this up your b----guts," I am sure of that—I told the Magistrate as nearly as possible the same I have told to-day—I believe I said that before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. The fourteen or sixteen persons were round at the com<lb></lb>mencement of the scuffle, but at the time the prisoner made the stab at Freeman there was nobody near Freeman and the prisoner but themselves—I don't know which commenced the scuffle—when I went across the road Freeman and the prisoner were by themselves, separated from the others; they were standing up to one another, they were not close—there is a stone with three lamps on an obelisk, I should not think there was another lamp near the spot—I did nut lose sight of the man at all till I told the police<lb></lb>man,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187404070012"></xptr>
               <p>I followed him close up behind—I was not more than 3 or 4 yards behind him at the very extreme, and he turned round and said something to me going along which I could not hear—I wish to say something which I think is of very great importance; when the constable brought the prisoner back to the corner of the Hackney Road, Freeman was gone and there was no one there who saw the affair, only me—the constable took the prisoner's name and address and let him go, and he said I should be more careful in what I: said in giving a man in charge for stabbing, and the prisoner said, "I shall know you, you b----<hi rend="italic">sod</hi>, if for three months to come, I will do for you, I will know you by your talk," and that he would sling a half crown in my eye.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brush maker, and live at 41, Canrobert Street—I was with Freeman and Lamb that night, in the Hackney Road—I and Freeman were singing as we went along—we went into an eel-pie shop—we came out, and walked along—I saw the prisoner and two other men before we went into the eel-pie shop, and we saw them when we came out—before we went into the eel-pie shop we were singing "Do come in on Sunday, <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>," and the prisoner with the other men turned round and said, "We can come in any b----Sunday you like"—there was no quarrel before I went into the shop—when we came out Lamb said something to Freeman—we walked on up the road without saying anything to the men—they went in front of us, and they crossed by the cab-rank—they then turned round, and I believe the prisoner said "I have <hi rend="italic">up'd</hi> your old woman many a time, and I will up her again"—Freeman and I crossed the road to ask for an explanation—I did not know any of those three men—when wo crossed the road he wont in front of them, and <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> Hall (which is a nickname for Hall) said to Freeman "Why don't you turn it up, <hi rend="italic">Sal</hi>?"—that is a nickname of Freeman's—Freeman did not say anything in reply—the prisoner struck him in the chest—the prisoner and Freeman then backed out into the road by themselves, and <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> Hall and Brown came on to me, and said "Boot the b----<hi rend="italic">sod</hi>" and they began to kick me—I did not see what the prisoner and Freeman did—I afterwards took him to the doctor's, and afterwards to the London Hospital—I heard Freeman halloo out "I am stabbed!"—I did not see the prisoner stab him; that was whilst tho other men were kicking me—I had just jumped up, when ho hallooed out "I am stabbed!"—the other men were at me then—I then went and looked, and found Freeman—I think there were more than a dozen people on the spot while this was going on—none of them interfered—I am quite certain that none of those strangers administered the stab—I knew Freeman well; I was his companion—I have seen him since he died; I was there every day—his name was James Richard Freeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not at any time hear the deceased say it was <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> Hall who had stabbed him—the prisoner and Freeman were out in the road alone together when Freeman was stabbed—I did not see anyone else near them—I was on the pavement and they were out in the road—I could not tell whether there was anyone else standing anywhere near them;</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He said that on the 25th, two days before he died—he was examined before the, Magistrate on the, 26th—I told the Magistrate what he bad said to me, and that was why he was examined on that point—he appeared sensible at the time-the doctor was present—he appeared to understand the drift of what I was saying—I did not take down what he said; he was not then considered in a dangerous state—he was in bed—I heard him tell the Magistrate he had not said it—I can't account for that; I know he did say it—I put it down in my pocket-book—this is it; "Jack Hall, called <hi rend="italic">Punch Hall</hi>, 25/2"—that was the note I made at the time—I am sure he said that he was stabbed, by <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> Hall, and that he saw the knife in his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—I saw Freeman there on the Tuesday, and examined him—he had a punctured wound in his left illiac region, just above the groin, about an inch and three-quarters long—he died on Friday morning—it was a stab wound, and went straight into the cavity of the abdomen, causing acute peritonitis and death—I was present when the Inspector asked him who did it, and he said that <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> Hall did it; I don't remember exactly the words he used—he was perfectly sensible at the time, and also when he made his deposition.</p>

I am a leather cutter—I used to go by the name of <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> Hall years ago—I was with the prisoner and Brown on this night when the scuffling was going on—I saw the two men and the young woman—we had just come out of the eel shop, having some eels—they were singing a song, "Won't you come on Sunday, <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>?"—the prisoner said "1 don't want to come on Sunday; I can come any day of the week"—the</p>

"Oh, he has bled me I" and he ran away towards the Hackney Road—the prisoner came on to the pavement, and I said "<hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, have you stabbed him?"—he said "No, I have not"—we went up towards Cambridge Heath Bridge—the cabman followed us—he would not lose sight of the prisoner till we got right over the bridge, and then he went and fetched the policeman—the policeman came up, and the cabman picked the prisoner from us three, and me and Brown went away and left the prisoner in company with the policeman—I did not stab Freeman; I was 14 feet away from him, and I was friendly to him up to the same day—Brown could not have done it.</p>

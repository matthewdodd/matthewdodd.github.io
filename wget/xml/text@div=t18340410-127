               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. She made no attempt to conceal this shilling? A. No. I had not had any words with her that morning - I had quarrelled with her on the Saturday evening - when I charged her with taking this shilling she was exceedingly indignant, and said she would complain to a Justice - my mistress saw me mark the money.</p>

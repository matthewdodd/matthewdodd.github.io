                  </hi>. I am a merchant—I reside at Ampton-place, Gray's Inn-road—at the end of October, 1856, I had a house at Notting-hill—in 1857, that house was robbed and I lost plate to the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., amongst which were six or seven spoons that I set some value by—after that some of the property was found in possession of the prisoner's brother, and he was taken before a magistrate—I was present—it was through me that he was convicted—the prisoner came to me about three months since—he asked to see me, and said he had come on a very important mission, that he was working with the police and he knew about the robbery com<lb></lb>mitted at my house at Notting-hill, and if I would only stick by him he would succeed in recovering the whole of the property—I asked, him if he was sincere, and said, I hoped he was not deceiving me—he said, no; it was the truth; and he wanted to make an appointment for me to meet him that night, but I could not do so—an appointment was made for an<lb></lb>other night, and I made a communication to the police—we went to the Porcupine public-house in Newport-market—I was in disguise—we found the prisoner was not there, and they directed us to a house in St. Martin's-lane where we found him—I did not get anything on that occasion, and I lost sight of the prisoner—I saw him again on 14th March, we met him in</p>

               <p>the Hop Gardens in St. Martin's-lane—I asked him if he could get me my property—he said he could, and he took us round by Charing Cross up to St. Martin-street, and he said before going into the house, "If you will give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I will get your diamond ring." I said, "I would rather get the plate than have my diamond ring;"—he said, "Very well, I can do that;" and he took us round to a public-house in St. Martin-street—he took us in the parlour and said, "If you will give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I will get five of your spoons."—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he was to go and get the spoons—I was to wait outside—I did wait—he returned and said, "There is one or two of the parties here, the others will not be here till late; but if you would rather go home, you shall have them by 10 o'clock to morrow morn<lb></lb>ing."—I went home—I did not see him the next morning—I never saw my 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. again—the next time I saw the prisoner he was given in charge of the police.</p>

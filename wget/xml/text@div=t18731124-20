                  </hi>. The prisoner is my husband—on 18th October, about the middle of the day, he came home drank—fee laid down en the bed and slept for about two honre—while he was asleep I removed some money from his pocket—when he awoke he seemed in a very confused state—he de manded the money from me, And I refused to give it him several times he took a knife out of his pocket and opened it—I don't remember his saying "I will stab you"—I said "I won't give it, I would rather be killed than give you the money"—he then stabbed me, after some words between us—we were both in a temper—I ran down stairs, and met a fellow lodger coming up—I don't think I fainted entirely away—my mother was present at this time; she stood by the side of me, and he struck her with the knife.</p>

               <p>—I have only been confined a fortnight—he has always been a good hus band to me, and always brought me his money, except when he has been in liquor—he was always kind and affectionate—he never lifted his hand to me before this—his father has been for thirty years senior carpenter at the Italian Opera House, Covent Garden, and he has been working for him—I told the Magistrate that he seemed to wake up mad—he lost a good deal of money in a business, which greatly preyed on his mind—at times his mind has been disturbed—on this occasion he had been out and pawned some articles and got drunk—he was annoyed at my finding the ticket.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 33, Devonshire Street, Queen Square—on 18th Ootober, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I heard screams proceeding from up stairs—I went up and saw the last witness on the third step, trying to come down stairs—she seemed to be in a swoon—I caught her in my arms—she had a child in her arms—I saw blood on her clothes—I carried her down stairs, and placed her on a sofa, and went for a doctor and a constable—I and the constable went up stairs and saw the prisoner—I said "What have you done?"—he turned round in rather a confused state and said "I don't know what I have done; what have I done?"—I said "You have stabbed your wife, where is the knife?"—he said "I have not any knife"—we took him down the yard—another constable came, and I said "You had better let us know where the knife is; we shall search your place right through—he said "It is up there, under the window"—I and the con stable went up, and behind a box we found this knife, wiped, and put away behind some boxes—I opened it; it was smeared with blood, and had got a lot of fluff on it—there was blood on the landing between the rooms, but it had been wiped up, and there was blood all down the stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. On 18th October I was in my daughter's room—the prisoner came home drunk and laid on the bed a little after 1 o'clock—he got up about 4.30—I think he and his wife had some dispute about money—I could not hear, but I fancied so—(<hi rend="italic">this witness was very deaf</hi>)—he took a knife out of his pocket and stabbed his wife, and just as I was going out of the bedroom door he stabbed me in my back, my arm, and my side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 3, Queen Square, Bloomsbury—on Saturday afternoon, 18th October, about 5 o'clock, I was called in to 33, Devonshire Street, and found the two women wounded, the younger seeming in the more dangerous state I examined her first—she had a severe wound on the upper part of the left arm, near the shoulder, three wounds on the back, and one at the back of the head, considerably smaller—three of these were very deep, the other two were comparatively superficial—the elder woman had seven wounds; they were more extensive than those on the younger, but not altogether quite so deep—there was a long incised wound on the arm, a rectangular kind of wound at the elbow, two wounds under the chest, and three on the back—this knife would inflict such wounds—considerable violence must have been used.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think they could all have been inflicted in one minute by a violently excited person—I think I may say they have both recovered.</p>

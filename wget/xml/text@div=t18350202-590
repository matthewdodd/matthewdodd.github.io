                  </hi>. I am a hatter, and live in High-street, Shad<lb></lb>well. On the 4th of February, I saw the prisoner, Bolton, go to Mr. Jug<lb></lb>gins's house, loose a pair of trowsers, and take them—the prisoner, Jarman, stood before him while he unloosed a pair of trowsers which hung outside, on the door-post of Mr. Jeggins' premises—he lives opposite to me—the prisoner was endeavouring to prevent any body from seeing what Bolton was doing—he could not see what the other did, because he was looking about to see if any body observed him—he had his back to him the whole time—they went away, and returned to the spot, three different times, and were evidently in company—there was a few words passed between then—they evidently appeared connected together—they walked together, and returned together in company—as soon as Bolton had got the trowsers he ran away with them—I followed him, and cannot say what Jarman did—I stopped Bolton, and he dropped the trowsers at my feet—I brought him back to Mr. Jeggins, and found Jannan in custody when I came back—they both had aprons on—the prisoner stood before Bolton, with his hands before him perfectly quiet; and at the time the trowsers were re<lb></lb>moved, he appeared particularly agitated—they were there for a quarter of an hour together, before the trowsers were taken.</p>

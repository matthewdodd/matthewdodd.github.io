               <p>Q. Was the horse saddled and bridled, when you took him? - No, I had him in an halter to the field; I pulled the balter off his head there, and shut the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the horse next? - Not at all; till it was brought up to the Red-Lion. It was the same horse I put into the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the fence of the field good? - Not very good, it was pretty badish.</p>
               <p>Q. What fastening had the gate? - It had a chain and staple; I don't know, whether I found the staple in the passage of the field, or not.</p>

I de<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040049"></xptr>sired them to go back, and stop the men, and to know what they were going to do with that horse.

               <p>Q. How far was this from the field, where Mr. Knight's horse is kept? - It was about forty yards from the gate, where the horse was. Then we took him to Southwold. They were leading the horse. It had a bridle and saddle on. At the Red Lion we sent for

Accordingly I went behind the cart, and Alexander was leading the horse with the bridle in his hand, and Watts was walking along the side; I said to Alexander, where are you going with that horse? he said, what horse? he let go the bridle directly; I said, the horse you have got; he said, I have not seen any horse; says I, what do you call this, that you have got by your side? says I, this story will not do for me; I took him, and I perceived Watts had made his escape, and I called to my brother to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040050"></xptr>after him, and my brother took him getting over the hedge, I directed my conversation only to Alexander, I took him to the Red Lion where the horse was owned, and a bag was taken out of Watt's pocket which held the saddle and bridle.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that the other man that you took was the same man that was along with Alexander? - Yes. He was not at all out of my sight; I was not present at their search.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This night was dark, was not it? - It was not a very dark night; enough for any body to perceive any thing at the distance of five or six yards.</p>

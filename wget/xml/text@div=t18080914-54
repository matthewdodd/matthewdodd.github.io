               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, he came to my house on the 18th of July, about six o'clock in the evening, with another man, he called for three pints of porter, he paid for the two last pints of beer; the other man had set off from him; he went to the tap room back again, and he stood and watched me for a long time. One of the customers desired me to draw him a pint of beer; I carried the pint of beer into the parlour, and when I went back from the parlour I saw him walk out of the bar. I pursued him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. You suspected him - A. Yes; then I found him sat down in the first box in my tap room, he had his hands between his thighs, and that handkerchief with blue spots covered it over. When I came to him, I said my friend what have you been doing in my bar, he said he was not in my bar; I told him he had. I lifted up his right hand, I found my tumbler, I took it from his fist.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any money in the tumbler - A. Yes, seven seven shilling pieces, two half guineas, and a guinea, was in the tumbler.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you loose that money out of the bar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the money the last time before it was stolen - A. Just about ten minutes before, after I had given change to my customer.</p>

On the 18th of July, about a quarter after eight o'clock in the evening, I went and apprehended the prisoner; the prosecutor told me that he found the property upon him, in the presence of the prisoner; the prisoner said he did not take it from the bar, he took it up from the tap room floor.</p>

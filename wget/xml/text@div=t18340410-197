               <p>GEORGE ARNOLD. This prisoner lived in Tabernacle-walk - I followed the last prisoner to his house; and after we took Bartlett, we went to this prisoner's house, and found four pair of gloves on the table and in the drawer, which are mine - the prisoner is a glove-manufacturer - he said he bought those gloves of Bartlett.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Arnold to the prisoner's house - I said to the prisoner, "I believe you had Bartlett here yesterday?" - he said, "No"- I said, "You have to-day?" - he said "No" - I said,"I am witness that he came here to-day" - Mr. Arnold then found four pair of gloves, and said, "These four pair I had in my hand yesterday - I can swear to them" - the prisoner then said, "I had them of Peter Bartlett."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. He keeps a glove shop? A. Yes; some of these were in his window - I do not know whether he was at home when Bartlett went to his house. <rs id="t18340410-197-verdict1124" type="verdictDescription">

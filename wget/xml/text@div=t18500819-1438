I received information, and went to some premises in Earl's-court, Kensington, belonging to Robert Gunter—on 14th July, I missed a quantity of lead from the roof of the house—I found some lead behind a large paving-stone against the wall, near the place</p>

               <p>where the lead was missing—it was then about seven o'clock in the evening—I left it there, and went again about nine, and watched—I saw the prisoner come and listen—he looked round the corner where I was secreted—he then went to the stone, took the lead, and unbuttoned his jacket, and put it inside—he was going out of the garden, and dropped this lead, I took it up and took him—I have compared this lead with the roof; it corresponds exactly—I asked the prisoner where the lead was that he put inside his coat, he said he had none—he had a rag in his hand—I found this knife next morning on the spot where I took him.</p>

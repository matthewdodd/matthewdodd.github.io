On the 10th of April, about six o'clock in the evening, I missed six half-crowns from my till - I could not imagine which way they went, as I could find no vacancy; the prisoner and two or three lads came in repeatedly, and that afternoon I marked some shillings; the prisoner took two of them from the till - my son told me he saw his hand go into the till, and gave me a hint about the prisoner, who ran out - I pursued; he ran, and threw the two shillings over his hand at me - I ran, and stopped him; a young man took up the two shillings, and gave them to me - they were two of my marked shillings; I do not know who took them up - he had not run above forty or fifty yards when he threw down the two shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. You say the young man picked up the money? A. Yes - I did not see him pick it up; the prisoner's father states that he is between nine and ten years old - there was a little boy he brought with him; I did not see him take them - no one was near the till but him - on the Saturday night he came for a halfpenny pencil; he brought a lad to ask for the pencil, while he put his hand under the counter into the till - I believe the prisoner had 3d. to buy a pound of flour at the next door; he had no flour-bag with him, but little bag with 3d. in it.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. What side of the counter is your till? A. It is next the window near the door - there is an opening at the end of the counter under it; there was a vacancy into which a lad could put his hand - he got into the dark corner; my counter is about ten feet long - this crevice is under the end of the counter; it was a long time before I couldfind it out - I lighted a candle three times, and was obliged to put it out again; I could not find it.</p>

            . I heard a noise, went out, and took the prisoner and the money - the prosecutor said that he threw it away, and a young man picked it up and gave it him; the prisoner cried very much, but did not say any thing - he had no bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been an officer? A. Eight years; I have only sworn to what he told me - I was beadle of the parish, but I left it with a good character.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I was in the shop about ten o'clock in the morning of the 10th of April; I saw the prisoner go up towards the till, press against the counter, and feel as if feeling for the till - I suspected he had put his hand into the till, and told my father to take him; he ran off - my father ran and took him; I had discovered the crevice on the Saturday evening, which was so small that no man's hand could go into it - we did not miss money till that Saturday.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is the till at the top or the bottom of the counter? A. At the top - there has been a piece of board pulled away from the end of the counter, that confined the till.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you try whether you could get any thing into the till? A. Not without stooping - it is under the counter; it is possible for a boy to get his hand in - the till is very long and comes up to the back of the counter; I saw the money was gone from the till - my father marked it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the depth of your till? A. Eight inches, and the opening about two inches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And do you mean to say the boy could put his hand to the bottom of that till? A. I could nearly get my own hand in.</p>

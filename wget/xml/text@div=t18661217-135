I am a watchmaker, at No. 1, Commer<lb></lb>cial Terrace, Park Road, Forest Hill—about half-past five o'clock on Friday morning, the 16th November, I was called up by two labouring men—I found a circular hole cut in the shutters, two of which had been removed, and the window broken—there were some blood stains on the window—the shutters had been fastened up securely when I, retired to rest—I lost from the window two silver caddy spoons, a silver pickle fork, a dessert spoon, about a dozen plated spoons, nine silver chains, two brace<lb></lb>lets, two trays, and two pairs of earrings, and I think other articles, worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—these produced are them—they are doubled up, broken, and scratched, evidently to sell as old silver—they were shown to me by the officer on the following Tuesday.</p>

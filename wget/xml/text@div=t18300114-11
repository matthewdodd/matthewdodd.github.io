On the 10th of October, at one o'clock in the day, I and my husband went out to work, leaving the house safely fastened, and took the key with us; the articles stated in the indictment were in the house; on our return, between five and six o'clock, I saw a pane of glass was broken, and the front window open - any body could get in - I missed all our clothes; I have since seen a pair of breeches, a waistcoat, and a smock-frock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you went out was the window fast? A. Yes - the pane of glass being broken they could put a hand in and unfasten it; there was a little place broken in the glass in the morning, but not large enough for a hand to be put through - the window was hasped; it is on the ground floor - I found my bed-room window open, which was shut before; they had got out there, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140017"></xptr>suppose - the property was in the bed-room; all my rooms are on the ground floor.</p>
               <p>ISAAC PYE. I am constable of Cheshunt. On the evening of the 10th of October, in consequence of information, I went in pursuit of some persons, and apprehended the prisoner about two o'clock on Sunday morning, the 11th; I did not take any thing from him - he had a smock-frock on, which I directed to be taken off; I afterwards saw it in the possession of Hanken - he was examined before the Magistrate with

            , and made a statement - I searched the prisoner's premises, which he showed me himself: it was a shed - he said he and his brother had been sleeping there; I there found a pair of braces, a hat, a stick, and a coloured handkerchief, which Hanken has got - I took him to Hertford gaol.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On what occasion did he tell you he had slept in the shed? A. When I took him into custody I said, "Where have you been sleeping?" as his house was empty, and he took me to the shed - it was near twenty miles from Law's; it was in a lane in the parish of Seacome, near Hertford - he informed me that he and his brother lived together; I took him at the back of the house where it was said they lived, at two o'clock in the morning - I desired him to show me where they slept, and he took me to the shed; this was before the brother was taken.</p>

            . I am assistant to Pye, and went with him in pursuit of the prisoner. I was present at a conversation between him and his brother Thomas - Thomas said to him that if he had taken his advice and stopped at home, he would not have fallen into this dilemma; he made no answer, but merely told his brother to hold his tongue - I had him in custody in the public-house for two hours and more: I did not threaten or promise him any thing - he said he would tell me where to find all the things; I was talking about the prosecutor's things at that time - while we were talking Pye and Hanken found the things in the shed.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HANKEN. I was with Pye when the prisoner was apprehended, and two or three days after I took from him in Hertford gaol, a smock-frock, a pair of breeches, and a waistcoat; I was with Pye when he found the braces and handkerchief in the shed - I produce them all.</p>
               <p>JOHN LAW. These things are mine; I know them all by having worn them, and by marks on them, and swear to them - I know the smock-frock and handkerchief by some stains.</p>

               <p>ANN NEWMAN. I saw the prisoner at Enfield on the 10th of October, about two o'clock in the afternoon, in Flask-lane, next door to the prosecutor's - he was coming down the lane with his brother Joseph; I did not know him before - he had a few clothes wrapped up in a white smock-frock, as it appeared.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My brother asked me to go with him to Enfield, to a house he lodged at, as he had some things there when he worked at Theobald-park; when I got there the woman was not at home - I went to a public-house, had a pint of beer, and then came down the lane again; my brother was there with a bundle of things, and when we got home he gave me the frock, trousers, and breeches to put on, and the constable took me with them.</p>

            : our house was broke open between the 27th and 28th of June. Mr. Ireson rented a parlour, a dining room, and a back chamber: they got in at the fore parlour window; there were two outside shutters to the window secured by bolts; I fastened that window at nine at night, when I went to bed. The bolt was found in the yard wrenched off.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what Mr. Ireson lost I supoose?</p>
               <p>Evans. No. Between one and two in the morning I heard a noise in the house; I lie on the second floor; I got up, and saw a man upon my landing place with a mould candle in his hand: my bed chamber door was open; I went to the window and called the watch; I saw three men; one went out first upon my crying out; then three went out, and the last man that went out fired a pistol at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak with certainty as to the man you saw standing with the candle in his hand?</p>
               <p>Evans. I think that is the man (pointing to Cherry.)</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from you when you saw him?</p>
               <p>Evans. About ten stairs. My husband is at Jamaica: he has been gone fourteen weeks last Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Who fired the pistol at you?</p>
               <p>Evans. The same I saw upon the stairs - Cherry.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you think it was between one and two o'clock?</p>
               <p>Evans. When I got up I saw it was star light; they all went out and left the door open, and the last man fired at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the persons of either of the other three?</p>
               <p>Evans. No; as soon as I cried, watch! they immediately got out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Ireson was not at home?</p>
               <p>Evans. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from Cherry. Did you swear to me before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Evans. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. from Cherry. She said she had never seen me to her knowledge.</p>
               <p>Evans. No; I was not asked any thing about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you asked before the Justice whether you knew any of the men?</p>
               <p>Evans. Yes; I said then I thought Hudson was the man that stood upon the stair case and fired the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to think now Cherry was the man?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070025"></xptr>Evans. By their dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other reason to alter your opinion?</p>
               <p>Evans. No other reason; I believe I was mistaken then; I won't positively swear to Cherry.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. It was on the outside.</p>
               <p>Gains. I ran to the house; I saw three men come out, and heard a pistol fired; I at first thought it was fired out of the window at the people, but when I came up I found it was a mistake; the first man I met was Fowler.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from the house?</p>
               <p>Gains. Five doors; that was before the pistol was fired.</p>

               <p>Gains. Yes; when I met him he struck at me with something in his hand, which I took to be a cutlass; I struck at him; he hit me on the shoulder; I had no mark on my coat or shoulder; I ran after the second, wh o came across the road and went over the bank. I drew out my pistol and snapped at him as he went across the road, but it missed fire.</p>

            . I live next door to Mrs. Evans: about two o'clock I heard the cry of murder and thieves; I threw open my sash and cried fire immediately; I saw three men come out of Mrs. Evans's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it break of day?</p>
               <p>Barber. It was twilight; it was more than break of day: the first that came out was Barret.</p>

               <p>Barber. Yes, I took particular notice; he came out with his hat flapped in his hand; he turned round and looked up to see who was crying; and Cherry was the man to the best of my knowledge that fired the pistol at me; the shot entered the window two panes above my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man?</p>

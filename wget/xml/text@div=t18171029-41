They all ran away. I saw the watchman immediately after, and he asked me if I had been robbed? - he was about three yards from me. I told him he had seen it, and ought to have gone after them; he said he had not seen it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know any of the prisoners - A. I had seen Daltry before; it was he that came down the lane, and took my watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to speak with certainty to him - A. It was seven o'clock. There was a strong gas-lamp at the corner, I saw him plainly; I saw him at the office three days after the robbery, and pointed him out-the prisoner, Martin, was another of them; he came up the lane after I had been robbed, and asked me if I had been robbed? I told him he knew it. I had seen them standing together before I came up to them, he was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not take hold of him - A. I was afraid of being ill used, as I had a great deal more property about me; the watchman had gone away before this. I had seen four of them standing together under the lamp before I was robbed. I believe the four other prisoners to be the men who robbed me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. The watchman was discharged. I never said it was ten o'clock at night, or any other time than seven. It did not last more than two minutes. The watchman went on his beat; he was nearly under the lamp; the robbery was in the middle of the pavement, about four feet from the lamp. The men immediately ran up Whitechapel-the man who took the watch ran up the lane. I saw them again the same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them afterwards you did not like to go near them - A. No, I walked away. There might only have been five of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see either of them after that night - A. On the 20th, at twelve o'clock. I was sent for-there were seven of them; I picked the five prisoners out from the seven. I am sure they are the men; I knew their faces. I know nothing of a reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know there is 200l. to be paid if the men are convicted - A. I do not. I should be sorry to receive it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who laid hold of your right or left arm - A. The prisoner, Hurley, laid hold of my arms. I met the prisoners at the time of the robbery. I described them at the Office that night.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How soon after the robbery did you see them that night - A. When they were going away, they came back to the spot; I was a little higher up; they were moving about, and appeared to be the same party - I was ten yards from them. The robbery was on the north side of Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GRIFFITHS. I am a police officer. The day after the robbery I received information, and went the next morning, which was Wednesday, to Black Lion-yard, which is lower down the road than Petticoat-lane, nearer to Mile End. I went there between nine and ten o'clock, and found the prisoner, Daltry, up one pair of stairs; Hurley was also in a room there, both with girls, I took them into custody. I received information, and went in pursuit of Martin, and took him in Trumpet-court, just by Black Lion-yard, about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was you present when the prosecutor saw the prisoner - A. There were seven of them at the bar together; the prosecutor was brought in. The magistrate asked him if there was any person there who had robbed him? he immediately pointed out Daltry and the four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290019"></xptr>other prisoners. He said he knew nothing of the other two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He pointed out Daltry immediately. He said that he held him and pushed him about. He could not distinguish which was on one side of him, and which was on the other. I had taken them up on another charge. I never saw them before.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Although he could not distinguish which was on one side, and which was on the other, did he separate them from the others - A. He separated the prisoners, and said he knew nothing of the others. I apprehended them from the description I received at the office.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. I am an officer. I apprehended Rule and Newton, on the 16th of October, at the Black Horse, in George-street, Spitalfields, about eleven o'clock in the morning, by the description which I received at the office.</p>

               <p>DALTRY'S Defence. I am innocent. I was at a public-house at the time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SMITHERS was called to prove this fact, but his evidence referred to the day before the prisoner was taken up, and not to the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>MARTIN'S Defence. I can prove I was at home from six till nine o'clock that night.</p>
               <p>HANNAH ROBINSON and JUDAH BENJAMIN were called to prove the alibi. Their evidence also referred to the night before the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

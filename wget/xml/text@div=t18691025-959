I am a fishmonger, and live at King's Cross—about 6 a.m., on the 12th October, I was at Billingsgate Market—I had a pony and barrow, which I left on Fish Street Hill—I bought three pads of mackerel at Billingsgate, one of which I put on the barrow—the other two were to follow—my brother spoke to me, and I went to the barrow about 8.10, and found the pad gone—it contained about ninety fish.</p>

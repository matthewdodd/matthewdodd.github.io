                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Green, and reside at 5, St. George's-terrace, Kensington—on Friday, 7th December, I was in Sussex<lb></lb>place, Kensington, about 12 o'clock in the day—I was wearing a gold locket fastened to a piece of elastic—it was merely attached to my brooch, not round my neck—I had nearly crossed the road when the prisoner, I believe, came across;—I think he was the first person I met—I did not look at him at the moment—he shook me, and dragged the locket—he saw it by my pulling my cloak as I was arranging myself for my walk—I imagine he took it for a watch—he shook me, and ran off with it directly—I could not speak for a minute or two, but when I did I saw a policeman, and I hallooed out to him "Thief," and pointed to the man—the policeman followed him, another gentleman saw him, but he is not here—when I pointed out the person he was running away—I am sure I pointed out the personwho had snatched the locket; there was no other—he had a red handkerchief on, but I could see a great deal more of it than I can see now.</p>

On Friday, 7th December, I Was on duty, in Sussex-place about a quarter past 12 in the day—I heard a cry—I went into Sussex-place—I had previously to my hearing the alarm met the prisoner—he was not running then—it was not a minute before this happened—I went a short distance, and returned in consequence of suspecting the prisoner—I then heard the alarm of "Stop him"—immediately after I saw the prosecutrix, who told me something—she pointed out a man running and said she had lost her gold watch—I went after the person she pointed out—he was about thirty yards from the prosecutrix when Le spoke to me—he went down a lane leading out of Sussex-place, and afterwards across I seven or eight fields—I pursued him for about an hour, and at last overtook him at North-end, Futham, in the private ground of a gentleman named Downes—I told him he was charged with stealing a lady's gold watch in Sussex-place, Kensington—he made no reply—I searched him but found nothing on him—on the way to the station, about a quarter of a mile from where I captured him, he made a most determined resistance, and tried to get away—he struck me on the side of the head, and knocked me down—I still kept my hold, and recovered my feet, and then he kicked me in the pri<lb></lb>vates, and also on my knee, and my hand—a man named Moore rendered me assistance, and I eventually took the prisoner to the station—I had not lost sight of him during the chase except temporarily in passing a building, but I got sufficiently close to him at the commencement to know he was the man I had met only a minute before—on one occasion I got as near to him as I am to his lordship—he was dressed as he is now, except his handkerchief—he had a drab handkerchief with red about it—it might be the same he has on now, only folded differently.</p>

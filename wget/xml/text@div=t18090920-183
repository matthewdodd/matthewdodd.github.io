            . The prisoner came to my house under a false pretence, and said the premises belonged to her, that the house had been set on fire, and that I had been the instigation of it; she said she came from Fulham. I took her up stairs and shewed her the damage I had received from the fire in Bear-yard; she said she was perfectly satisfied I was innocent of it. I came down stairs and left her with my wife in the passage; she went up with my wife after that.</p>

            . Q. Did you see this woman when she came to your house on the 21st of September - A. Yes. After she had the conversation with my husband she asked me to go up stairs with her to shew her my bed room, which I did; she begged me to leave the room a minute; I left her alone for a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any silver table spoons in the room where you left her alone - A. Yes; silver table spoons and silver salt spoons; she took all the property from that room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she remain in that room - A. Not more than a minute. I went into the room to her, I found her shutting the drawer, which made me suspect her; I came down stairs with her; I did not tell her what I suspected; I desired her to walk into the parlour where my niece was. I went up stairs as quick as I could to look for my spoons; I perceived the spoons were gone from that room; I came down and informed my husband; she was searched by the constable; my niece will tell you of that. I never saw her before.</p>

            . Q. Now tell me whether you had left the handkerchief and the umbrella up in that room - A. Yes; and the silver spoons were up stairs in that room. I was in the parlour when my aunt shewed the prisoner up stairs; when she came down stairs I heard the spoons rattle, she laid them down by the side of her, or in the chair; I called my aunt she did not come into the room immediately. I saw the salt spoons in her hand, she was trying to pull her glove over them; my aunt came in, and then I charged her with taking these things, then I went for a constable, after the constable came I found the umbrella under her clothes.</p>

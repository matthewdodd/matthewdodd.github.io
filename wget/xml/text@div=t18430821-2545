                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, and live in Museum-street. On a Monday, about three weeks ago, the prisoner came to my shop—I knew him before—he had lived with Alexander M'Kenzie, Esq., who dealt with me—he said he came from Alexander M'Kenzie for some books—he mentioned some books, and looked out others—he had before had books, as coming from Mr. M'Kenzie; in general, Mr. M'Kenzie used to send a note, but, knowing the party, I did not hesitate at that time—I delivered them to the prisoner—there were seven of them, and they were worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I let him have them, supposing he came from Mr. M'Kenzie—two or three days after<lb></lb>wards I saw him in the street—he said he might as well give himself up—he then ran away, and I did not see an officer near me.</p>

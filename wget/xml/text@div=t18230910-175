            . I was at the fair, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and I saw the prisoner sounding several people's pockets. I saw Wiggins, and desired him to watch. I saw him go up to Mr. Clark, stand three or four minutes, and then take the book out, and immediately bolt. I went up to Clark, and when I came back Wiggins had taken him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose there were a good many people there - A. It was very thin. There was plenty of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100080"></xptr>room to walk about. There were several persons behind him looking at the shews. He did not go off above a yard.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he attempt to run away - A. He turned round sharpish, and went between me and Jordan.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Scott, a labourer, and reside at 4, Clarence-cottages, Hackney—that is the same house in which the prisoner lived—she occupied the two rooms adjoining ours, one up stairs and one down—they are both front rooms—I occupied two rooms in the same house—I have been there about five weeks, I think—she was there all the time I was there—when I first went, a man of the Dame of James White was living there—they lived together as man and wife—I recollect James White going away, three weeks before the child died—he left her there and three children with her, a little boy and two little girls—Fanny was the eldest, Sarah the next, and the little boy was the youngest—he was about three-and half years old—the children were left under her care—I saw the little boy dead—the last time I saw him alive was on Tuesday, 27th September—I saw him twice during that day—the first time, was about 11 o'clock in the day—he was crying for drink—I saw him again about 2 o'clock; he was crying then—I did not observe anything peculiar about him—he was a sickly child, and he looked sickly then—he was then walking on the floor—he had an abscess on one side of his face, and it was tied with a handkerchief, so that without I had uncovered the face I should not have seen the bruises; it was tied too closely over—on that day I went from home about half-past 5; the prisoner was not at home during that part of the day—I came back about 10 minutes to 6, the prisoner was not at home then—she came home about 8 o'clock that night and went up stairs—at that time the eldest girl was down stairs, and the other two were up stairs in her room—I did not speak to the prisoner at that time, but I heard slaps; that was about 3, 4, or 5, minutes' after she went up stairs—the slaps sounded as if they were hit on some fleshy part; they sounded loudly—I did not hear any screams or any cry—I saw her come down again; I think about half-past 8—she then went out and took the eldest child with her—she came home about 9 o'clock—she spoke to me against my room door some few minutes, then wished me good night, and went up stairs—I heard her say, "You naughty boy," when the slaps were given the first time that she went up stairs—I did not hear anything</p>

               <p>more that night after she went up stairs the second time—on Wednesday morning, about 7 o'clock, I saw the eldest girl come down stairs, and about half-past 7 I heard slaps; heavy, loud, sounding slaps, of the same kind I had heard before—I did not hear any screams; the prisoner was upstairs at that time, and the other little girl—I saw her about half-past 8 o'clock come down stairs, she seemed to be in a very great hurry, with her bonnet on and her shawl on her arm; she rushed past our window—I saw her come back again about a quarter to 9—she then ran up stall's about as far as her room door; there is a small passage at the top of the stairs—the stairs are fronting the door—she screamed as soon as she got to the top, by her room door, and then ran down the stairs again—I directly went to my room door, and said, "Mrs. White, what is the matter?"—she said, "Oh! my little Jemmy is gone"—the little boy was called Jemmy—I said, "Why, he is not dead?"—she said, "Yes he is; go and see"—I ran up the the stairs and went as far as her room door, but did not go inside—I could see the child lying on the bed; it appeared to be dead—I did not go near enough to touch it; it had a covering over it—I said to the prisoner, "Yes, so he is;" and I said, "Where have you been?" she said, "I have been to the doctors"—I said, "Is he coming?" and she said, "Yes; but I don't know when"—I then said, "Oh, pray run and fetch somebody;" and we both ran down stairs—Mrs. Offen, who lived nearly opposite to our house, was called, and then the doctor came—I went up stairs with the doctor; I was so frightened that I did not notice what the doctor said, or what the prisoner said—she told me on the Monday, as the child died on the Wednesday, that it had been very loose in its bowels, and made a great deal of dirt—on the Wednesday morning she told me the child had not made her any dirt—she said she had punished it, and she did not think it would make tier any more dirt—I said, "What have you done to it?" and she said, "Last night, when the other children went to bed, I took it up stairs, and heard it its prayers and undressed it, and instead of putting it to bed, I tied it to the bedstead"—I said, "La, sure, sure you never kept it there all night"—and she said, "Yes I did, till 7 o'clock the next morning"—and I said, "Poor little thing, I wonder it had not untied itself and got into bed"—she said, "No, I tied its hands down"—I said, "Why it must be dropping down with sleep, where is he now?"—she said, "He is down stairs with the other children"—that was all that was said then—I heard some slaps on Saturday night—that was the Saturday night before the child died—I had heard them on previous occasions, but I cannot tell the distinct times.</p>

On the morning of 28th September last; I went to 4, Clarence-cottages, Hackney, from information I received about half-past 9—I went up stairs into the bedroom, and I saw a child, between 3 and 4 years old, lying dead on the bed; the prisoner was not in the room then—the child was dressed—there were marks of violence upon, the head—I observed some bruises on the right cheek; two scratches, also a bruise or wound on the left side of the head—while I was examining the child, she came in—I asked her whether she was the mother of the child; she made no reply; I then asked her whether that was her child; she said, "No"—I asked her whether she could account for those bruises on the child's head; she said, "I do not know; I was out all day yesterday, and they were not there when I left home"—I then asked her who had care, of the child during her absence; she said, "The girl;" pointing to Fanny—after that I left the house, and went to the surgeon, Dr. Haycock, and asked him whether he could certify the cause of the child's death; he said he could not until he had made an examination—I went a second time that day to the house, I should say about 11 o'clock—I went with the coroner's officer to make inquiries; I questioned the little girl as to whether the child had received any hurt the day before—I went again the next evening at 6 o'clock, and searched the house; and in a cupboard in the down stairs room, I found these pieces of cord—I produce the foot-rail of the bed—it is the top rail at the foot of the bed—I did not make the little model—the foot-rail crosses the top of the post—that is the position in which it was when I found it—there are some dents on it, and a little <hi rend="italic">fluff,</hi> which I have put</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Hackney—I remember the prisoner bringing the little boy to my surgery in September—I cannot fix the precise day, but it was about a week prior to the child's death; it was at that time suffering from an abscess at the side of the face—the prisoner said it was caused by an injury the child had received when falling on the stairs—I opened the abscess—there were no bruises about the face, except just round the abscess, which would be very likely to be the result of the injury she mentioned—two days afterwards, the prisoner came again with the child; the wound was then healing—the abscess was on the left side just below the cheek-bone—I asked her the first time, whether she was able to procure proper nourishment for the child—she said she was not, as the father of the child was away, and I then relieved her with some trifle to get some nourishment for the child, and it was much better the second time she came—the first time it came, it appeared out of health and generally weak—on Wednesday morning, the 28th, the prisoner came to my surgery about half-past 8 o'clock, and asked me to go immediately, as her child was dying or dead; she did not seem to know which—she was exceedingly excited with grief, fran<lb></lb>tic, and exceedingly distressed in manner—she went back to her house, and I followed her down the street—when I got to the house, I think 1 found her in the room—J went up into the bedroom, and found the child I had seen the week before, on the bed, with its head on the pillow, partially dressed—it had nothing on but its clothes—it was not covered with any sheet, or anything except its own clothes—it was quite dead—the body was quite warm; it could have been dead but a very short time—its face was clean, and the skin had a whitish appearance, as if it had been recently washed—there was a show of blood at each nostril—on the right side of the face there were numerous brusies, a very large one especially under the eye—the prisoner was behind me, and I turned to her and inquired how those brusies came—she said she did not know, as the child was in bed when she came home the night before, and she had not been disturbed by it all night, and when she awoke in the morning the child was dying, or very ill—she said she had been out all the previous day—the little girl Fanny was in the room at the time—I asked her whether she knew anything about these bruises, and I could get no distinct answer from her—I gave information to the police, and on the following day, the 29th, by direction of the coroner I made an examination of the body—I have here my notes made at the time—the examination was made thirty hours after the supposed time of death, at three o'clock in the afternoon—the body was clean and well nourished—the age of the child</p>

               <p>was apparently about three years—the scalp was covered with very thin hair at the back part, the scalp was nearly bald, the hair was of unequal lengths at different parts of the head—on the lower portion of the left parietal bone there was a wound, just above the ear, half an inch in length, gaping in the middle, to the extent of quarter of an inch in length; there was a slight ecchymosis around it, and the surface of the wound was glazed as if it had been done some short time, the blood was dry and glazed over it—on the lower portion of the right bone on the corresponding side there was an ecchymosis as large as a sixpence—there was a small cicatrized wound, a wound of old date that had been, healed, in the same position—on the back part of the right ear towards the lower portion there was an abrasion of the cuticle and a slight ecchymosis—there was no corresponding appearance on the left ear—on the back part of the head there were many marks of old bruises of a yellowish tinge—on the face there were many small ecchymosis about the forehead, and nearly the whole surface of the right side of the face was covered with ecchymosis, the largest of which was under the eye—those ecchymosis on the lower portion of the face were in the direction of two curves passing from the chin towards the ear, narrow lines of bruises about half an inch in width—I made a sketch of the face—I particularly examined the state of the wound that was unhealed from the abscess, and the edges of it were still open, and there was a little blood inclined to ooze from it; it was not quite healed, otherwise it was in a healthy state—a bloody fluid, to the amount of about a drachm, exuded from the nostrils on turning the head to one side—under the chin there were extensive ecchymosis and a narrow abrasion, which I afterwards tried the cord with—there was also a large ecchymosis on the front of the throat—there was no distortion of features, the conjunctiva, or whites of both eyes were pale; the jaws very firmly closed so as only to be separated by great violence—the back of the left wrist, and the front of the right were marked by a line of ecchymosis of nearly half an inch in width; that line was continuous when the front of the left wrist was placed over the back of the right—there was no mark on the front of the left wrist or the back of the right, so that the hands must have been tied together; the same cord did not go round each separately—if that mark was made with a cord, the cord must have gone continuously round both hands—on the forearms there were marks of ecchymosis of different colours, and therefore of different date—there was a line of ecchymosis to be traced continuously across the chest, round the outside of both arms, and behind across the spine and shoulders, but most apparent on the right arm and on the chest; this line was not to be traced under either of the arms; if that was made by a cord, it must have gone over both arms and round the chest; the line was not be traced so distinctly behind as in front, only faintly—there were two lines of ecchymosis of older standing, across the loins, and numerous small ecchymosis over both legs and outside both hips—those were the whole of the external appearances—I have seen some portions of rope—I tried different portions of the rope to the different marks on the child, and each portion that fitted was marked accordingly—one rope fitted distinctly the marks round the chin, and another the marks round the hands—I subsequently removed the scalp and opened the head—on raising the scalp there were clots of blood on both the parietal bones, corresponding with the external bruises, and of very recent date—in many portions there were only stains, as if the ecchymosis had taken place some time previously, and the blood been absorbed—on the back part of the head there were several spots of extra<lb></lb>vasated</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185911280050"></xptr>
               <p>blood more recent than any of the others—on opening the head an enormous coagulum was found, covering the upper surface of the left hemisphere of the brain, on the right side of the head, a coagulum was also found in the lower portion of that hemisphere of the brain—the effusion of blood on the brain would explain the cause of death—the veins at the base of the brain were very much gorged with blood—the quantity of blood effused amounted to at least half an ounce; the brain and mem<lb></lb>branes themselves were perfectly healthy—there were slight traces of old disease in the chest, but from which the child had recovered some time previously—there were marks of old adhesion on both sides of the pleura, more particularly the left, but that was old disease—the ecchymosis over the windpipe was found to be of a very superficial character, and there was no constriction or narrowing of the larynx internally—I gathered from that that death was not caused by strangulation, the pressure on the larynx had been but slight, the bruise was only external—the stomach was quite empty, and the small intestines nearly so, the large intestines contained a small quantity of feculent matter, which indicated that the child had had but little food for some time previous to death—the child died from apoplexy; from the effusion of blood on the brain, resulting from the rupture of some small vessels—if a child were to be tied to a bed with its head hanging down, and was left in that position for several hours, the result would probably be apoplexy—there was no external mark that would account for death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> On what day did you make the post-mortem exami<lb></lb>nation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Thursday the 29th—I had not heard at that time that the child had been tied up—I did not find any remains of old inflammation in the membranes of the brain; I found some extravasated blood partially absorbed, under the scalp, but not in the brain; that was from an old bruise of a very trifling character—I did not find within the cavity of the skull corresponding marks to the two wounds on the left and right parietal bones; I did underneath the skin outside the skull—they were both recent injuries—there were old ones and new ones as well—when I saw the child it was quite recently dead; it was quite warm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Considering the state in which you found the child, do you think it possible that it could have remained with its head hanging down from 9 o'clock at night till 7 the next morning and then be alive? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I think it is possible—from the evidence detailed as to the way in which the child was tied, it would have power for some hours to keep its head up, when the muscles became so tired that the head fell forward, of course, the fatal symptoms would be apt to ensue—a child tied horizontally would not have the power of keeping its head up for any great length of time—I think if its head was hanging down it would cause death within a few hours, but I cannot speak as to the precise number of hours, perhaps from six to twelve, but I cannot speak positively one way or the other—I think the fact of this being a weakly child would not make any difference—the inference I drew from the marks under the chin and round the head, was that its mouth was tied up by something—I examined the bandage that went round the head, and it would not correspond in the least with the marks round the cheek—the marks round the cheek, under the chin, and over the head were caused by a cord, and not by a bandage; it was a broad bandage—there, was no trace of the bandage having become hard or being rucked up; I examined it and it was perfectly flat—apoplexy from ordinary causes is hardly ever found in children of that age—I never met with such cases, and as a simple</p>

               <p>disease I know of none—form whatever cause the blood vessels had given way the appearances would be the same—I have no experience of any child suffer<lb></lb>ing from apoplexy, and I never knew any one that ever saw it—if it had been from an old injury the state of the blood would have been totally different—the blood would have been altered in colour and partially absorbed, but it was of a dark colour and very recent—I do not know that concussion sometimes weakens the blood vessels of the brain—as soon as effusion takes place to any considerable extent it produces insensibility, and loss of power and motion—the child was brought to me about a week before its death by the prisoner for me to attend to it—she also brought it herself a second time—it was then decidedly better, that was two days after the first visit—when she came to me on the Wednesday morning she was frantic with grief—she hurried home, and I followed her within a few yards—she was very anxious for me to come—I found the child on the bed partially dressed, it had on ft night<lb></lb>gown and a small frock.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked if a child could live long if its head were hanging down; would that depend upon the amount of support the head might have had during the time the child was tied up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Entirely; and a little also upon the muscular strength of the child as to how long it would be able to hold its head up, and upon accidental causes which I cannot particularize—there seemed to have been a ligature passing from above the head round under the chin; if that had been supported by the bar it would have enabled the child to live for some time in that position—I did not find any injuries about the head that would make it more disposed to an attack of apoplexy—there were two portions of extravasated blood on the scalp, one within the brain; the latter was the cause of death—I should mention, that on examining the bed, the ping of the bed, to which the rail was attached, were found very much bent—I examined the bed myself after hearing this detailed account at the Police-court, and found the two pins very much bent, as if a heavy weight had been attached to the cross-bar—I have also tried, for the sake of the experiment, what a child of that age would be likely to weigh, and I found it was between thirty and forty pounds—experiments have been tried with the bar, which will bear a great deal more than the weight of the child—I think the child must have had some support to the head during the night to have been alive all those hours—I found a large mark under the chin; if a cord had been passed under the chin, and been attached to the rail above, that would have supported the child—I traced the mark all round the head, the line was not very distinct across the top—my belief is, that the band underneath the chin was put to keep the child quiet—from my examination of the wrists, I formed the opinion that the hands were tied in front of the body, because, when the hands were put in that position, they seemed to have fallen so naturally; the relative position of the hands would have been the same if crossed behind, but the elbows were slightly inflexed; it would depend mainly upon the position in which the arms were put just at the time of dying.</p>

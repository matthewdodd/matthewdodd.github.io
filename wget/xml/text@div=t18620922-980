                  </hi>. The prisoner married my sister—she was living at Colchester-house, Bromley-street, Poplar, at the time this happened, and I was staying there at her request—the prisoner was not living with her at that time—on Wednesday, 10th September, I had gone to bed on the first-floor, and my sister was sleeping in the room below me—there was nobody else in the house, and I did not know until I was awoke, that the prisoner was in the house—he was living at West Ham—I heard a noise towards morning as if it came from my sister's room—I then heard a scuffle, and almost immediately afterwards a loud noise at my bedroom door as if from a kick—the next kick smashed in the panel, and the prisoner rushed into the room with a cutlass in his hand—I believe that cutlass was kept in the house—I had seen it there two or three years before—I had just awoke out of sleep—I had been asleep since 11 o'clock, and I believe I got to the edge of the bed—he began to cut at me with the cutlass—I rushed on him to close with him, and in the struggle I forced him out of the room on to the landing, but before we got out of the room he cut me on the forehead—I do not know whether that was the first blow—he got the better of me outside the room, and I was thrown on my back—I rather think it was down the next landing, down five steps, that I was thrown—I believe I got on my legs as quick as I could, and I got on some steps—there was a further struggle as soon as I regained the landing—I ultimately secured him, and forced him into the room again, during which time I got some slight bruises—there was a cut on the stairs about half an inch deep; a piece was cut out—I do not know how it was done; it was not so before—it appears to have been cut with</p>

               <p>some cutting instrument—I fancy that he was flourishing this cutlass about on the staircase, but I was not sufficiently conscious to say—I held him till the police came, and in that last struggle the sword dropped from him.</p>

ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he came into the room and made a blow at you, did he say, "You shall get out of this house?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say particularly what he said; he rushed in with great violence—I will not say whether he said, "You shall go out of the room and out of the house"—he made some coarse observation, you d—d thief, or some<lb></lb>thing of that kind—he made a direct cut at me when I was on the edge of the bed—I mean to represent most decidedly that I was cut when I was on the bed, and the blood was on the sheet and blanket—I slept in the same bed that night—after I had received the cut I went down five stairs—there are fire stairs from the top landing—I then rushed up again, and over powered the prisoner—I did not strike him or grasp him by the throat—I heard him call out "Murder," but not till I had him down and disarmed him—he had no chance of breaking a window and calling "Police"—I had him down when the police came—it was his house, and his wife was living in it—I have several relatives in the neighbourhood—I know nothing of his declining to live in the house while his wife's relatives, myself and others, lived there—two and three-quarter years ago he came into the room where I was; my sister had been telling me about his ill-usage, and he said, "Henry Howard, let our acquaintance cease," if that is forbidding me the house, he did so—that is all that took place—I never had an angry word with him up to that period—he has not forbidden me the house since—I have never seen him, except twice the Commercial-road—I charged him with an assault before a Magistrate a short time since; that was dismissed—his wife told me that she was in the habit of going to West Ham on Sundays—she told me that she was so afraid of his violence that she dare not go out—I have no doubt that she let him in on this occasion—I have seen the cutlass many times in the room where they slept—it was generally down by the bedside.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 56). On 10th September, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was on duty in Bromley-street, Poplar, and heard screams of "Murder" and "Police" proceeding from Colchester House—I went there as quickly as possible, and saw a female at the door, who begged me to hasten up to the second-floor front room—I did so, and found the prosecutor and prisoner struggling—the prisoner was undermost, being held down by the prosecutor—I separated them, and asked them the cause of the dis<lb></lb>turbance—the prosecutor said that he should give the prisoner in custody for cutting him on the head with this cutlass (<hi rend="italic">produced),</hi> which I found under the bed—I told the prisoner he would have to accompany me to the station; he made no reply—on the way to the station he said that he had done no more than he should do again on finding a thief and a vagabond in his house—he was fully dressed, with his coat on, similar to what he is now—the prosecutor had nothing on but his shirt, and was bleeding profusely from a wound over the left eye—there was blood on the sheets, as if it had commenced there—after the prisoner was locked up, I went and examined the top stair, and found this piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) had been cut out of it by some sharp instrument—the panel of the bedroom door was smashed in—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 3, Eastcott-place, East India-road—I was called to the police-station to see the prosecutor—he had an incised wound on the left temple, about two inches long, down to the bone—it is not very deep there; the bone is very close to the surface—it had not penetrated the bone, which it would if it had been done with great violence—it bled very profusely, on account of an artery being divided.</p>

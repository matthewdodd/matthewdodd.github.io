                  </hi>. I live at 12, Brewer-green, Westminster, and am a master plumber—on Monday evening, 14th September, about 8 o'clock, I was going down Drury-lane, and a man pushed against me, and tried to catch hold of the chain of my watch—he did not get my watch—I shoved him on one side, and he put his hand to his breast, and walked on one side—I took no more notice, and walked down to the corner of Long-acre, and along Long-acre till I passed Charles-street, when I turned round, and saw the two prisoners, and a short young fellow between them, walking after me—I had a suspicion they were going to rob me, and I looked at them—I walked a little farther on, and in about two minutes Cramp came up and caught hold of the chain of my watch with his right hand—he got the watch out of my pocket, got his left hand behind mine, and got hold of the watch—we had a scramble for it—I caught hold of his sleeve, he gave a pull, broke my hold, pulled the swivel off the chain of the watch, and ran away—I was hallooing out "Police"—I turned to run after him, and was thrown in the street and kicked—I did not take notice of who did that, I was so excited—I ran after Cramp—I did not catch him—a man caught hold of the skirt of his coat at the corner of Charles street, and he broke his hold and stumbled, and lost his cap there, but he escaped—Cramp was in front of me when I was tripped up—it was not Cramp who tripped me up—I went straight into Drury-lane after the man—three or four police came up, and told me I had better go to the station—I went there and explained it—I gave a description of the man—about a week after Hayes was brought to the police-station, and placed with ten men there, and I picked him out—I have no doubt he is the man—I next saw Cramp at the police-station; I have no doubt about him—he was placed with eight men, and I picked him out.</p>

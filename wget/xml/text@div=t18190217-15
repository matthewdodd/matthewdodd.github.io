            ; it is his house, and in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea. I am a nurse; I always lodge there when I am out of place. I keep my box there, under the bedstead in the front parlour, where George sleeps. The articles stated in the indictment were in the box, and three 1 l. bank notes - the prisoner lodged in the back-parlour - she had lodged there three weeks. She left the house on the 11th of February, and said she was going to the Brentford stage at the top of Sloane-street, to get a parcel - I did not understand that she was going away for good. She returned the same day, went out again about a quarter before one o'clock, and never returned. I missed my box about a quarter of an hour after she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you opened it - A. A little before she went away, every thing was then safe. The three notes were put by themselves, in a little dice-box in the large box. I opened the dice-box, and saw the notes safe a quarter of an hour before she left - I did not see her go out. The box was small. Mr. George came home about six o'clock in the evening, and went to Brentford after her.</p>

            . I am son-in-law of the last witness. I keep the house, which is in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea. The prisoner lodged with me for three weeks before she left. I was absent when she went away. When I came home about six o'clock, I heard what had happened - I had left the house about six o'clock in the morning. I went to Brentford, as I heard the prisoner had a sister there - I did not find her there. On the Saturday evening I found her on the top of the Chelsea stage, in Piccadilly, coming to town. She saw me, and turned her head away. I went to the side of the coach, and said,</p>
               <p>"You are the person I want - come down, will you?" she then came down, and I took her. She asked me what I wanted with her? I told her she was my prisoner. She went quietly with me at first, and then struggled. I told her she should go, and told a person who stood by what was the matter. She denied doing any such thing. I took her to St. James's watch-house, and gave her to an officer, who searched and found a pair of stockings on her, which I claimed as my mother-in-law's - she did not deny it. I took her to Marlborough-street - she said the trunk was at her house, No. 10, Cross-street, Chelsea, where she had lodged since she left me. She went there with me and the officer. The officer called me into the house to see if the trunk was mine - it was in a room on the first floor; the prisoner said it was the box she took. The officer gave them to me at the office on the Monday - we opened it at her lodgings, and searched it particularly. Some of the things were gone, the notes were gone. I am certain it is my mother's box, I have mended it myself. She had a handkerchief in her hand when I took her, which is the prosecutrix's.</p>
               <p>MARY GEORGE. I remember the prisoner going out - I did not see her go. My husband is a carpenter. I had, I believe, two 1 l. notes, and about 1 l. in silver, rolled up in my mother's box, in a pocket handkerchief. I did not look into the box after I put it there.</p>

             re-examined. I saw my daughter's money safe in the handkerchief on the Saturday night before the robbery - there was a 1 l. note and some silver. I took 1 l. in silver out, and put in a note for it - there were 10 s. or 15 s. besides. I left two 1 l. notes and the silver in it. I saw the handkerchief safe on the Thursday when I went to the box, but did not open it. The box and all the things are mine.</p>

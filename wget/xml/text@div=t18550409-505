                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Deptford. I let lodgings—the prisoner occupied rooms in my house, and a man with her—the man left her there, and she was there for a fortnight after he left—she locked up the premises took the key with her, and never came back—she had given me no notice, and I had not the slightest idea that she was going—I un<lb></lb>locked the room with a key belonging to one of my neighbours, and missed a sheet, a quilt, the top of the bedstead, the drawer of the dressing table, and a shelf out of the cupboard—I had not looked in the room much after</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090130"></xptr>
               <p>she came, but am certain that they were there when I let her the room—I also missed three halfpence out of my own room, and my daughter's petti<lb></lb>coat, which I had seen safe the day before—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), the pri<lb></lb>soner had it on when she was taken.</p>

This petticoat is mine—on the day before I missed it, I saw it safe on a side table in the sitting-room—I next saw it on the prisoner when she was taken—I charged her, and she said that I gave it to her; that was not true, nor had I lent it to her.</p>

               <p>I am a broker, and live in Church-street, in the Little Minories: On Friday evening, September the 2d. about six o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and offered a new mahogany chair, with two rows of brass nails, to sell; I had a suspicion it was stole, and asked him where he lived; he said, Whitechapel; he told me, if I would not buy it somebody else would; I told him I could not part with it; then he said, it was his sister's, and he would go and fetch his sister; he said, she lived in Red-lion-street, Whitechapel; he attempted to go and fetch her, and I stopped him, and sent for our beadle, and gave charge of him. I believe somebody told him he had better confess where he had it, and the man might forgive him; they took him away, and in about twenty minutes after, I was sent for to the office with the chair, and was bound over; I took the chair back, and have had it in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present? - A. No; they said there were but five; I went out of doors, and was astonished to find there were but five; I had bought them about three the same afternoon, and set them at the door, they had never been in the shop; I was backwards and forwards, in and out of the shop, according as people came to the door; they told me there was a man at a shop in the Little Minories with a chair to sell; I went immediately, and before I got there, I met an officer who had got charge of the prisoner; he was brought down to Mr.

            's shop, and when he saw me, he begged me ten thousand pardons, and begged I would forgive him; we went down to the Rotation office, in Lambeth-street, and I saw the chair there; I knew it to be one of the half-dozen. (The chair was produced in Court).</p>
               <p>Mansfield. That is the chair the prisoner offered me for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Melvill.) Can you speak to that chair positively? - A. I can; I generally have a mark in the bottom to know what they are stuffed with, before I buy them. I marked this, the mark is here now, the pattern and mark agree with the others; I know it also by the corner being broke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Last Friday week, as I was coming through Goodman's-fields, I met an old Jew that had got this chair up in a corner; I turned back, and said, my friend, that is a nice chair; he said, yes, master, I have got it to dispose of; I told him I had but very little money about me, I could not purchase it; he told me his sabbath drew very near, and I should have it very cheap; I asked him what I should have it for; he told me I should have it for five shillings; I told him I had but three in the world, and I would give him that if he thought proper to take it; he said, if I had got no more money, and as I had to make my money of it again, I should have it for that money; I gave him the money, and had the chair of him; I took the chair to the first brokers I came to, to offer it for sale, which was in the Little Minories; he said, he did not think I came honestly by it, and he should stop me and the chair too, which he did; he sent for a constable, who took me to Mr. Robson's house, and to the Justice's, where I was committed here.</p>

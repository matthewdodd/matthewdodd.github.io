             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Cullen. I am not perfect that the prisoner is the man, only he had red hair, a red waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember buying any oranges in <placeName id="t17980214-72-crimeloc401">Fenchurch-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17980214-72-crimeloc401" type="placeName" value="Fenchurch-street"></interp>

Yes; this day fortnight I was pasing through Fenchurch-street, there were three men with oranges, but I dealt with only two; one of the men (one with the dark hair) asked if I would buy any; I told him, no, I did not want any; they still kept reazing meen in the street; and I asked him, in a joke, what he would have for them all; he said 4s. I told him that was too much, I did not want any; then he asked me if I wanted a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. How many followed you? - A. Two men, they had both baskets; I asked him what he asked for a dozen; he told me one shilling; I said that was too dear; he asked me what I would give for a dozen and I told him sixpence; he said to me, my master, you shall have them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. I looked at him before the Lord-Mayor, and I said then if he was not the man he was very much like him.</p>
               <p>Court. We happen to know what you said before the Lord-Mayor, you told a very different story there to what you have told now; take care what you say.</p>
               <p>Witness. I pulled out four half crowns three shillings, and a seven shilling piece; I gave the young man with the red hair one shilling,</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner again? - A. It is very much like him; but it is a very dangerous piece of business.</p>
               <p>Q.What are you afraid of if you speak the truth? - A. I wish to speak the truth; I gave him one shilling, and he said it was a plain one, he did not like plain ones, and he gave me back one shilling, and I then gave him half-a-crown; he said it was a French one, he returned it to me, and then the oranges were paid for; he saw a seven shilling piece in my hand, he asked me if I would let him have it, and he would give me seven shillings for it; I asked him what made him so desirous of my seven shilling piece, I told him I had plenty of silver, I did not want any more; he still kept wanting my seven shilling piece, he held an argument with me about it, he said he would be obliged to me, for he hoarded them; I then gave him the seven shilling piece, and he gave me seven shillings back; I went on to whitechapel, to Mr. Garth's, a grocer's-shop; I told him I thought I had been desrauded; and he said he could not tell weather they were good ones or bad ones, they were very queer ones; I said, I would go back and see for the man; I went back to Fenchurch-street; I delivered all that money to Mr. Perrin, the constable, he put it up in a piece of paper, and sealed it up.</p>
               <p>Q. The shilling, the half-crowns, and the seven shilling piece, was that good money? - A. Yes; I am sure that was all good, I brought it from my own house.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had got to whitechapel, how much bad money did you find then? - A. None shillings and a half-crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had not any bad money before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140100"></xptr>you saw these Jews? - A. No; I am sure I had all good money when I came from home, I had no French half-crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you received any money after you left home before you met with these Jews? - A. No, I had received no silver; I had received a seven shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take up one of the Jews when you returned to Fenchurch-street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the constable take up one of them? - A. No, they were taken up afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. At the first examination there were two young men examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar one of those men? - A. The prisoner was one that was examined before the Lord-Mayor the first time of examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Be correct, and recollect yourself, there were two examinations on account of this charge against the Jews for having given you bad money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the first examination, was the prisoner at the bar one of the persons charged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were then examined? - A. A man with black hair and a man with red hair. (The prisoner's hair was red).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you swear, upon that examination at the Magistrate's, that the prisoner was the man? - A. I said, to the Lord-Mayor, that if that was not the man, it was a man very much like him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure those were the words? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you mean to swear now, after the answer you gave to my Lord-Mayor, at the Mansion-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not, upon that occasion, swear that the prisoner was the man whom you charged with having given you the bad money? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your information taken in writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sign it? - A. Yes, with my cross; the Lord-Mayor's clerk read it over to me before I signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen either of the other two Jews since that time? - A. No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any body been with you since that examination, to talk to you about this charge that you have made? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell my Lord, and the Jury, what passed between you and these persons? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I object to that question.</p>
               <p>Court. You must connect them, certainly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand that you believe this to be the man, but whether it was or not, you do not mean to swear to him? - A. No other way than I have sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you safely swear that the prisoner was the man? - A. It is a heavy thing to swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself to swear that the prisoner is the man? - A. To the best of my knowledge, I am not acquainted with this business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this dark man taken up before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was discharged? - A. The Lord-Mayor asked me if I knew any thing about him; I said, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. That man was the man that you had all the conversation with in the street? - A. Yes, dealing for oranges.</p>
               <p>Q. That must have taken up some time? - A. Yes, I suppose five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet that man you would not swear to? - A. I did not look that man in the face.</p>
               <p>Q. The money that you brought from home, when did you receive it? - A. From my wife that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How much silver had you in the house? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had the ill luck to get a bad shilling into your possession before? - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. At Loughton, near Woodford, in Essex.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you attend Woodford-market? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The money that you received from the man with the red hair, you shewed to the grocer, and he could not tell whether they were good or not? - A. He said they were very queer, they certainly must be bad, but he could not see any brass.</p>

I know the prisoner: This day fortnight I saw him with two men in Fenchurch-street; I saw Bartrup with them, the countryman, and I said to him in a joke, you have been dealing with the Jews; there were the prisoner and two other Jews, I know all of them by sight perfectly well; I saw the countryman come under the gate with one or two of the Jews, I cannot say which, I did not see any thing that passed between them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar one of them? - A. Yes, that I am clear of, he was one of the three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the complexion of the other persons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they black or red hair? - A. One was very black; this man is not so red as they represented to me, before I saw him; I saw the Jews standing together a good while after the countryman was gone, it might be a quarter of an hour; I saw the countryman when he returned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. - Q. You heard no conversation, and saw nothing particular pass between the countryman and the Jews? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They were selling fruit about the streets? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you sell fruit about the streets? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you sell oranges? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. Do you carry fruit about the streets, or do you stand in one place? - A. I stand in one place.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far do you stand from this gateway? A. About 20 yards, the gateway is No. 28, and I stand between No. 32 and 33; when the Jews passed me, I told them they had been in a good thing, and one of them pulled out a handful of silver, and a halfpenny amongst it, he asked me for a halfpenny-worth of apples, which I gave him, and he went away.</p>

            , in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone. The prisoner lodged in the same room, and slept in the same bed with me for nearly nine weeks. On Thursday, the 17th of June, I got up and went out about five o'clock in the morning, leaving him in bed - I left my things in the room. My coat was worth 20 s.; two yards of cloth, worth 30 s.; a pair of breeches, worth 5 s.; a pair of trowsers, worth 5 s.; five waistcoats, worth 20 s.; four handkerchiefs, worth 4 s., a watch, and other things, worth above 5 l. altogether, were all locked up in my chest - I laid the key on a shelf over the door, under my hat-box, whether he knew that I do not know. I returned again between eight and nine o'clock at night, and missed my things next morning; he did not sleep at home that night; he had tied up his old dirty things, and old hat, and put them in the place where he used to keep his best clothes, so that we did not think he was gone. I did not examine my trunk till the Friday morning. I found the key where I had left it, and the trunk locked, but all the property gone. I had seen them all safe between eight and nine o'clock on Wednesday morning. He never returned - I have found none of my property. I found him in custody on the Saturday week following, and asked what he had done with my piece of cloth; he said voluntarily that he had sold it. I asked what he had done with the tobacco box, which was in my waistcoat pocket; he said,</p>
               <p>"Was there one, if there was I have sold it altogether." I asked what he had done with an old half-crown, which was in the till of my box; he said he had sold it altogether to a Jew.</p>

The prisoner is a coach-smith, and had lodged there about nine weeks - he paid regularly till Whitsuntide; his week ended on Saturday, and on Thursday, the 17th he left in the morning, without notice. I was in Hyde Park on the 26th, and found him there. I took him to the watch-house, and said</p>
               <p>"Joe, can you get the things back again;" he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I cannot, for I sold them all to a Jew." I said,</p>
               <p>"How came you to rob the man;" he said he did it from want; I said he was not in want, for my wife had got a good breakfast and dinner for him if he had come home, and he had better have come and had it than rob the man.

I asked what he had to say; he acknowledged committing the robbery, and that he had done it for fear he should be in want, and through the persuasion of a woman called Mary, who walked Covent Garden, and had sold all the property to a Jew.</p>

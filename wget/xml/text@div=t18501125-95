                  </hi>. I am an engraver, at 32, St. Martin's-le-Grand. Some time ago I received from my shop-boy, Baker, a letter, containing an order, signed, "R. Murray Campbell, and Co.," dated 30th July, in consequence of which I made up a parcel containing half a ream of letter-paper, 500 envelopes, and a card-case, and sent Baker with them, and a bill receipted, to 34, Coleman-street, desiring him to bring back the money or the goods—he returned in due course, and brought back nothing but the receipted bill—upon that I went to 34, Coleman-street, and saw a stout man, a clerk, who I have not seen since—I asked for Mr. Campbell, and he said, "There he is"—he was within sight and hearing, and I said to the prisoner, "Are you Mr. Campbell?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I am not known to you, but my name is Death, and I have come about some goods my lad recently left here, and</p>

               <p>I want payment for them"—he <hi rend="italic">hummed</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ahed</hi>, and I said, "Let me have my goods back"—I looked round the place, and would have taken them if I had seen them; and I said, "Where are they?"—he said, "They are not on the premises, I have sent them away"—I said, "It is impossible, a quarter of an hour cannot have elapsed"—he had very little to say, and I said, "You injure a poor lad in my employ, for I gave him strict orders not to deliver the goods without the money, and I shall discharge him from my employ"—he said, "Mr. Death, pray where does your lad reside?"—I said, "Why do you want to know?"—he said, "Because if you discharge him, I will take him into my employ;" and he also said, "I might have kept the receipted bill if I had chosen"—I said, "That would have been a case of robbery, I should have come back instantly with a policeman"—he said, "You give credit?"—I said I did not to strangers—I was obliged to part with him—he said he was going to shut up the office, and I found I could not get my money—on my leaving, the stout man said, "What is this all about?" and I showed him the letter, which he tried to get away from me—Campbell was near him at the time, and the stout man said, "Oh, I will call on you, and settle that"—I said I wanted it settled then, and he said, "Oh, he is a b—st—d ass," pointing to Campbell—Campbell said nothing—I never got my money or the goods back—I saw I was <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, robbed, and cheated—this is the receipted bill ( <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>—"34, Coleman-street, July 30th, 1850.

                  </hi>. I am shopwoman to Mr. Death. On 24th July the prisoner called at the shop, and asked if we printed letter-press cards—I told him, "Yes," and he said he wished to have 500 printed, "R. Murray Campbell and Co., 34, Coleman-street"—he gave me this card(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and a written order—when Mr. Death came home I told him of it—that was the only time I saw Campbell—I am quite positive he is the person—he said nothing about credit—we are not in the habit of giving credit to strangers—we generally ask for a deposit, or the address—if they give an address we do not ask for a deposit.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy in Mr. Death's service. I remember at some time at the end of July taking a parcel from Mr. Death's to 34, Coleman-street—I believe it was cards—there was "Campbell" on the door; I cannot recollect the rest—I went day after day—I saw a person I supposed to be a clerk there, not the prisoner—I think I left the parcel; I said, "I have brought the goods from Mr. Death's;" and he said, "You can leave them, if you please"—I did not leave them; I brought them home again—I did not ask for the money the first time I went—I took a bill with me—I brought them away again, because master told me not to leave them without the money—a few days after that I went again with another parcel—I went day after day, three or four days—I did not leave the parcel, because master told me not, till I saw him—at last I saw him, and said, "Please, sir, I have brought the goods from Mr. Death's"—he took them, opened them, and said, "Tell Mr. Death my clerk will call this evening, and give another order, and pay for them"—I opened the bill, and showed it him, and then he said that—I left the goods because he <hi rend="italic">gammoned</hi> me to do it, and said that his clerk would call and pay—Mr. Campbell said, "You had better take the bill," and I took it back, but neither the goods nor the money—I saw Mr. Campbell write the letter produced—I delivered it to my master.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The last time I was there, when I left the parcel—I cannot exactly say how many parcels I have left there; it was two or one, not three—I took this order for the goods, which I took this bill for afterwards—I saw Campbell twice—when I said I had not seen Mr. Campbell when I took the parcel, it was not true; it was not the first time that he <hi rend="italic">gammoned</hi> me—he got the goods then, by-saying, "I will give you a little note to take back"—I had not got a receipted bill then—I have been about seven months in Mr. Death's employ—he has not disharged me.</p>

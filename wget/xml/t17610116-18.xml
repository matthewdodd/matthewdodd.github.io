               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of her taking it away?</p>
               <p>Lee. No; she was detected at the king's-head, in the Old Change, the ostler brought her. She had a box in which were caps; in searching that, we found two other pint pots; there were four found in all upon her. [Produced in court.] She was taken before the alderman; there she confessed she stole them; she used to come about selling caps to people.</p>

            . I lost a pewter pint pot, I believe on monday night the twelfth of this instant. The ostler at the king's-head in the Old Change, and another man, came with the prisoner to me and brought my pot; they said they took it out of her box, from under her caps, and at that time they showed me the other pot belonging to Mr. Lee, he lives in Little-Britain. I heard the prisoner say before the alderman, it was the first offence, and begged very heartily to be forgiven. I am certain my pot had not been taken above an hour, before she brought it again.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>As I was coming home, in the street I met a woman that sold old cloaths; she has travelled the streets a good while. I said you are very much loaded. Said she, so I. I wish you would carry this bundle into Bishopsgate street for me; they are old pots that I have bought. I said I should be at the White-hand. So I took them to carry for her. I put them into my box, because I thought they would not be so troublesome to carry, as if put them into my apron When I went into the house, the young man looked into my box; I thought it was as the woman had told me, or I should hardly have gone into the house with them. I have not seen her since, because I was taken up and confined. Here is one Mr. Smith, I see here, that knew me years ago. Please to call him to my character.</p>
               <p>Q. To Constable. Did she give any account of a woman that buys old pewter, when she was in your custody?</p>
               <p>Constable. No; she did not.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. I am a pawnbroker, I have known the prisoner between twenty and thirty years; her father was a very great carpenter in Houndsditch. I never knew any harm of her; but I have not seen her for six or seven years. So know nothing of her character for that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Ealing. On Sunday, the 5th of Feb., I went to London with my wife and one of my daughters—Mary Ann Lemon was in my service—I left her in my house, with my daughter Elizabeth and my sons William and Joseph—my instructions to the prisoner and to my son were, that my daughter should go to the Sunday-school, and William should go to chapel, but Joseph, the youngest, should not go out—I had received information before I went out, and had given some directions to the officer—this bottle is not mine; I have examined the beer which is in it, but not tasted it—I do not know whether it is mine or not.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant T</hi> 19.) About ten o'clock at night on Sunday, the 5th of Feb., I went to take Mary Ann Lemon into custody—I said she was charged with being concerned with Jane Lemon in stealing some things from Mr. Bruce—she said, "If Mr. Bruce had behaved to me in the manner he ought, I would have confessed; but now, if you take me before twenty magistrates, I will not say one word"—she also stated, that she had bought three half-pints of beer, and had given it to Jane Lemon to assist her—I asked her where she bought it; she said that was best known to herself—I measured the beer; there is a quart of it—my wife found this muslin hand<lb></lb>kerchief, which Mrs. Brace identified, on Jane Lemon.</p>

I am the wife of John Pascoe—about half-past twelve o'clock on Sunday, the 5th of Feb., I searched Jane Lemon—I found this muslin handkerchief in her pocket—Mary Ann Lemon, who was present, said, "That is mine; I gave it to Jane to hem for me; I have another at home that I am wearing every day."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. This piece of muslin is mine—it is now in the state ia which it was when I lost it—it had been originally a dress for one of my daughters, and was afterwards cut up for the purpose of making a neckerchief, which it now is—I had kept it, to the best of my belief, in the top drawer of my double chest in my own bed-room—that drawer had never been kept locked; but when I got home on that Sunday, I found some of the locks in another chest of drawers had been opened, and some of the mahogany had been broken away with a knife—I had not seen this muslin for some time, as it was put up with articles that were not immediately in use—it was in the state it now when it was put away.</p>

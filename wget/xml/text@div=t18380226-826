                  </hi>. I keep the John Bull, at Old Ford. Emma Smith was my servant for about two months and five days—in consequence of something, I marked some shillings and copper money on Saturday, the 10th of February—I looked into the tills the following day, and missed some of the money so marked about five minutes before eight o'clock, on the morning of the 11th—the prisoner Dorey was in the tap-room at the time I came down and missed the money—he came to the bar between eight and nine o'clock, and had half a pint of beer—he offered two halfpence, both marked, in consequence of which I sent for a policeman—he was not at home, but he came between nine and ten o'clock—I stated the case, and he took Dorey into custody—he took him to the station-house, and then came back, and asked to have some conversation with Smith, which he had—Dorey was out of employ—I could not exactly turn him out—he was constantly about my house.</p>

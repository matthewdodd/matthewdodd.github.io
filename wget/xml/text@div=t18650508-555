                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker, of Dudley, in Warwick—on 7th March my shop was broken open and robbed—I identify some of these watch-cases and movements (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this watch number 136,841 was originally 13,684, the figure "I" has been added since—I have no doubt of its being mine, and one of those I lost; here is another, 452,571, the original number of this was 15,257; the first "I" has been altered to a "4" and "" has been added—here are others which I identify in the same way; this one, 490861I was originally 49, 086, the two "1's" have been added since—here are six or seven altogether which I identify, and in which the names of supposed makers have been inserted, but in this one here is the name of an original maker in Coventry, under the dial, who manufactures for me—they have also been re-gilt—I never knew a watch<lb></lb>maker to alter the number—this paper (produced) was found with the watches—I do not identify it, but I identify the numbers, it is not in my writing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, G</hi> 22). On 22d March, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner running very fast in Spencer-street, coming from Northampton-square—I followed him to a pawnbroker's shop in Goswell-road—I went in and asked him what he had got; he said, "Nothing"—I said to the pawnbroker, "What is this man pawning here"—he handed me this silver watch, which is one of those which the prosecutor identified—I took him in custody, and found two cases on him—he said he lived at 15, Gibraltar-row, St. George's-road, Southwark—I said, "Well, I am going to search your address, have you anything that does not belong to you"—he said, "No, all that is there belongs to me"—I went there and found seven watch movements and three watch-cases, which the prosecutor identifies—I also found three or four watch movements, and one metal watch, which are not identified—I went back and asked the prisoner if he could account for them; he picked out four watch movements, not four of these, and said, "I had them from a man in the New Cut, and also one metal watch"—I said, "Here are a quantity of movements and cases, who did you get them of"—he said, "Of a man named Bacon"—I asked him where he lived—he said he did not know—he did not tell me the name of the man in the New Cut—I said, "Cannot you give me any particulars"—he said, "No, all I know is I met him in a public-house in the London-road"—I said "There is a quantity more movements than there are cases, can you account for that;" he made no answer—I afterwards went to 5, Little Northampton-street, Clerkenwell, where Hicks lives, who gave me four watch-oases—I also searched the prisoner's room, and found this piece of paper with six out of seven of the original numbers of the watches on it—I then went to a gilder in Queen-street, who gave me the plates of seven watches with names and numbers of them, which had been fresh gilded; they were the names of different makers in London.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE JOSEPH HICKS</hi> on oath says, "I live at No. 5, Little Northampton-street, Clerkenwell—I am an engraver of watches, I know the seven watch cases and seven watch movements produced, the prisoner brought them to me towards the latter end of March last, and he asked me to put names on them and alter the numbers—I put names on all and added the figure "1" to each number, and in one case I altered "" into "4"—the numbers are generally stamped on the cases and plates—I did not think it was suspicious in the prisoner asking me to add names and alter numbers."</p>

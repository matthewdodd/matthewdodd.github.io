               <p>—I attended on the deceased Caroline Potter, in October last—she died on the 22nd of October—she was in a state of pregnancy at that time—I was not present at her death—I attended the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was injuries, and sloughing of the womb—the <hi rend="italic">uterus</hi> was not inflamed—it was in a state of ecchymosis, with a large slough in the middle of that ecchymosis—I attribute that to external violence—the only marks on the body which could at all be attributed to violence, were some very slight remains of bruises about the right groin, but they were so slight that I did not take any notice of them—while alive she com<lb></lb>plained of pain about the womb—I have not the least doubt of the cause of her death—kicks or blows about the womb would certainly produce the effect I saw—from the appearance after death, I should say the injury was inflicted a fortnight before, or it might have been six or seven weeks before.</p>

                  </hi>. I knew the deceased Caroline Potter—she was the widow of William Potter, a sawyer—she was thirty<lb></lb>nine years old—she lived with the prisoner from the beginning of February—I saw her the day before her death, in the workhouse—she was not able to walk at that time—she complained of the lower part of her stomach—I was in the same house where the prisoner lived with her, in August—on the 18th of July, I saw the prisoner kneel on her chest, with his hand to her throat, attempting to strangle her—I saw him ill-treat her many times after that—I saw him strike her on Wednesday, the 22nd of September—he kicked her on the right side of the lower part of her stomach—it was a very violent blow indeed—she seemed to suffer much pain from it, and com<lb></lb>plained—this was on the Wednesday—she was laid up on the Friday—she was compelled to apply to a doctor—two other doctors attended her before Mr. Warder—she applied to them—she walked about a little, but very tri<lb></lb>fling—she complained then of violent pain at the bottom of her stomach—she first complained of that violent pain on the Friday after the 22nd of Sep<lb></lb>tember—I lived in the same house with her—I never knew of her falling down stairs—she was never better, from the 22nd of September till she died—she was never able to go about as usual during that time—I never observed him strike or ill-use her after the 22nd of September.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a nurse in the Chelsea workhouse. The deceased came there on the 22nd of October—she was in very great agony all over, particularly the lower part of her body, and that continued till she died—I had her in my hands when she died—the child was prematurely born at that time.</p>

               <p>nine o'clock at night; she was intoxicated and lying at the bottom of the stairs. I helped her up as well as I could, and got her up stairs. There is a door at the bottom of the stairs, which was propped open as she was lying down, so she must have gone up stairs before she fell down, because the door shut by its own weight, without any body shutting it. She sat in a chair. I could not get her to bed that night. In the morning she com<lb></lb>plained of a pain in her side.</p>

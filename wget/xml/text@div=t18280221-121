On the 12th of February, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I heard a footstep, opened my door, and saw the prisoner, who had got halfway up the stairs; I asked what she wanted, she said a man named Davis; I said no such person lived there, and she went away. On the day following I was talking to a man at my door and saw her again; she passed me and went up stairs; I asked what she wanted, she said Davis; and the day following, my son missed two aprons and an umbrella, which had been on the landing of the first flight of stairs - these are the aprons: the umbrella was a green silk one.</p>

I am an officer; the prosecutor gave me information; I went with him and found the prisoner in bed; she appeared to be out of her mind, and said she knew nothing about the things, but her son said, "You know you stole them, and my trousers too" - I took her to the watch-house; and she said there was a shop where she sold things sometimes, and perhaps they might be there - I went there and got these aprons.</p>

            . I keep a clothes shop in York-street; I bought these two aprons and a dirty green silk umbrella of the prisoner on the 12th of February - I bought the umbrella for 8d., and sold it for 10d.; she brought that about eleven o'clock in the morning, and the aprons about four o'clock in the afternoon - I put them at my door directly.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took them out of the prosecutor's passage, and was under the necessity of taking them. Mrs. Jamieson gave me but 6d. for the umbrella, and 4d. for the aprons. The officer said if I would tell him where they were I should not be hurt; I took him to the shop, and he said "Who is to pay me for my time;" I said, "If you will wait till my husband comes home he will pay you:" he found I had no money and took me back to the watch-house.</p>

On the 25th of March I sent Joseph Davis, my errand-boy, to carry home some watches- he had a list of the places he was to deliver them at - he returned in about two hours and a half, and said he had missed one parcel, which contained the watch in question; he said he could not tell how he had lost it.</p>

            . I went out with a number of watches to different places; I met the prisoner, who went with me from my master's house nearly - when I got to my master's son's (who is an apprentice to a gold-beater), where I was to leave his clothes, the prisoner held out his hand to take the bag which had the watches in it, in a tin case; I let him have it, because I had known him before, and did not think he would have done such a thing; I told him to stand opposite the shop - when I came out we walked on to the end of Fetter-lane, where I asked him for the bag, which he gave me; I went on to several places, and when I got to the last place but two, I missed the watch; I asked him about it - he cried, and denied all knowledge of it. I said I would inquire if I had left it in mistake at any other place, which I did, but could not find it - I then told him he must know something about it - he cried, and said, if I said so again he would go home - I then went home and told my master; I afterwards saw the watch found on him; he said nothing then.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

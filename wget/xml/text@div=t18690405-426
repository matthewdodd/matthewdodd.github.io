I am a foreign tailor, and live at the Sailor's Home, Whitechapel—on 11th March, about 8 in the evening, I was walking in the neighbourhood of the Sailor's Home—I met the prisoner—he asked if I wanted a ship—I said I did—he then asked me where I kept my money—I said "At the Sailor's Home, in my chest"—he said it was very wrong of me to have it there, because I might lose it, I had better take it out of my chest, and keep it on myself—I went to my room, and got my money—I put some in a purse in my breast pocket, and some in my trowsers pocket—I had about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—I also had a watch in my waist<lb></lb>coat pocket—I came down and joined the prisoner, and an Englishman who was with him—we went to a public-house, and had a glass of ale—I was quite sober—we left there and went to another public-house—after we came out the prisoner said "You can come home to my place"—he asked me how much money I had got on me, and I said "2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,"—he said "Then you must give us half of that," and then he struck me on the eye—it knocked me down, and I lost my senses—when I came to myself, my coat, money, and watch, were gone, and I was lying down on the ground where I had been knocked down—I got up and went away—I was with the prisoner about two hours—he spoke to me in Danish—next day I went to the house where he lived, but could not find him—I saw him the following Monday, in a public-house opposite the Sailor's Home—when he saw me he ran through another door, round Wellclose Square, to his house—I followed and gave him into custody—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man—I lost 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver.</p>

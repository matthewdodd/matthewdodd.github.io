             sworn. - I am constable of St. John's, Westminster, and attend occasionally at Bow-street: On the 15th of this month, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was sent for to a pawnbroker's in Strutton-ground, Mr. Brown's; I went, he had stopped a woman, not the prisoner, with a pair of stockings; in consequence of what passed then, I apprehended Champness in Duck-lane, at a public-house; I then took him to Tothill-fields, and went to enquire where he slept the night before; I searched a room in Duck-lane that I under stood belonged to Macdonald, and behind the bed's-head I found these articles concealed, they are very mean things, which led me to suppose they might belong to Champness; I enquired in the neighbourhood, and found that Mrs. Dearding had been robbed; I went, and she claimed them; I know nothing more against Champness but his own confession before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was not that taken down in writing? - A. I cannot say, I believe not; they very seldom do take down confessions.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear it was not? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp objected that the witness ought not to be permitted to give evidence of that confession, but it was over-ruled by the Court.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Before the Justice what did the prisoner say - in the first place, was he advised or threatened? - A. No; the prisoner Macdonald was offered, if she would say, honestly, where the rest of the things were gone, she might be admitted an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200037"></xptr>evidence, and she refused; but I heard nothing of the kind to Champness. Just as he was going from the bar, having told the Magistrate he had found those things in the street, he desired that the Magistrate would not accuse Macdonald, for she was innocent of every thing; he admitted that he had brought the property to her, and that he had found them in the street.</p>
               <p>Champness's defence. I did not say that Macdonald was innocent; I alluded to the woman that went to pledge the stockings, I said I had given her them to pawn. Both <rs id="t17990220-38-verdict205" type="verdictDescription">

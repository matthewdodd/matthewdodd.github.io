I live at Edgware—on the evening of 2nd September I was helping the prisoners to drive some sheep and cattle—I went through Stanmore with them—I saw the last witness and her husband standing in the road—Norris told them to get out of the way to let the sheep pass; they would not—they swore at the prisoner—the man asked what the sheep fetched at Watford—Gibbs asked him again to get out of the way, and he would not, so he pushed him out of the way with his open hand and he fell backwards—both the prisoners had sticks—they did not strike him with a stick—I and Norris went on to drive the sheep on one side to let a furniture-van come by—Gibbs followed us—we all walked—both the man and woman were drunk—Gibbs was not drunk nor yet sober—I did not see Norris touch the man at all.</p>

            </rs>. The Prosecutor depos'd, That the Shutter of a back Parlor was bored, and cut, and a Bar taken out, and the Goods stolen. That the Prisoner had borrowed a Gimblet about a Week before, which he did believe to be the same which he found near the Wall, where, whoever did the Robbery, came over. When the Fact was done it was wet Weather, and there were Footsteps in the Dirt. That a Stick was found that Morning in the Yard, which he affirm'd he had several Times seen in Patrick Clifford's Hands. Mrs.Harrold depos'd, his Wife came in while he was drinking at her House, and said, That she had maintained him several Years, and if she left him but one Week he would come to be hang'd. Joseph Watson was his Companion. Another Evidence depos'd, his reputed Wife goes out at Night, and he does nothing but drink all Day, and keeps a disorderly House, and the next Morning Watson asked him for something, and he said he had spent eight Pence Half Penny; upon that Watson reply'd, What, must I have nothing of the Booty you have got? Another Evidence depos'd, as they were carrying them to Prison, in the Coach, Clifford said, I wish we had committed the Robbery Yesterday, then I had been far enough out of Town, and then they might catch me if they could. Another Evidence depos'd, That between twelve and one a Clock in the Morning the Robbery was commited, he saw Clifford and another come from the back Yard, which was the Way the House was  when the Robbery was committed. Mr. Robinson the Beadle gave Clifford the Character of keeping the worst House in ten Parishes, in harbouring all manner of ill People. That he had taken out many Children that he us'd to no entertain and encourage in ill Practices. Clifford call'd some to his Reputation, who depos'd he had been a Soldier, but was discharged for being an Irish Man, but they could say nothing as to his way at living since.

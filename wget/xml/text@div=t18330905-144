On the 30th of August, the prisoner came with another man; I had seen the prisoner two or three times before - he asked for some toy-dishes and plates; I had some suspicion of the prisoner, and asked what he had in his pocket; he said nothing - I put my hand into his pocket, and took out one of these images, - and he put his hand in his pocket, and took out the other; they are my husband's property - the other person who was with him then put his hand under his coat and took out these six plates; he gave them to the prisoner, who put them on the counter; they then ran off - I gave the alarm and the prisoner was taken.</p>

            (police-constable G 102). I took the prisoner - in going to the station-house, he said he did it to make up the money he had lost in playing at skittles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have dealt with the prosecutor for a long time, and never wronged him - I went to her house, and took those images which I had ordered, with intention of paying for them, and as they are very delicate, I put one in each pocket; I had no intention of stealing - I had not done paying for the dishes and teapots I had bought.</p>
               <p>HANNAH HART. He did not ask the price of these images - he bought some things which came to 1s. 71/2d.; he gave me 2s. and I gave him the change.</p>

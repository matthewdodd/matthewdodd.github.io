                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of 11 King's Bench-walk, Temple—about four weeks before 11th April, I met the prisoner—he came up to me in St. Martin's-lane, and said, "I hope you are quite well, Mr. Parsons"—I replied, "You have the advantage of me, I have not the pleasure of knowing</p>

               <p>you"—he said, "I have met you several times some years back,"and he named several parties whose names I knew—he said, "I can get you plenty of business, where are your offices?"—I gave him my card, saying that I had recently taken offices, and I could not see him in them for a day or two, as they were unfurnished—he said, "I can get you plenty of furni<lb></lb>ture, I am an agent for Messrs. Atkinson, and get furniture for parties from their warehouse"—I told him what furniture I required, and on Monday, 10th April, I saw it at my office—it consisted of a table, an easy chair, three mahogany chairs, a what-not, a wash-stand, a rug and a carpet—I missed those things on Saturday the 15th.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it that he went away from your lodging? - A. I think it was some time in September, a twelvemonth ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of his intention of going away? - A. No; he owed me a trifle; he told me he would pay me the next day; it was a little more than a week's lodging; he took the key of the room and the key of the door with him; I expected him home at night; I did not see any thing of him till I saw him at the watch-house last month.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after he went away that you broke the room-door open? - A. In about a fortnight after when I went into the room I missed three blankets, a pair of sheets, a tea-kettle, a pair of bellows, and a tinder-box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see my part of this property afterwards? - A. I never saw any of my property again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body lodge with him in the same room? - A. There was a woman, who she was I do not know, he called her his wife; he went away in the morning first, and she went away a little after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he could not take the key if she staid last in the room, she must have locked the door? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - About the 7th of last September I was informed that the prisoner was in St. James's workhouse; the prosecutrix and her son went into the workhouse, and they pointed out the prisoner to me; I told him I had got a warrant against him for a felony, for robbing his ready-furnished lodgings; I asked him where the duplicates were of the property; he said he had no duplicates, nor he did not know where they were; but he had a friend there who would be answerable to pay her for the property that was gone. I told him my warrant was for a felony, and he must go with me before a Magistrate; I would not let it be settled there. I took him before the Magistrate; the prisoner was a pauper in the workhouse, and the friend that he got to come forward to settle the business, was a pauper there likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say at that time about the woman that lived with him? - A. He said there was a woman that lived with him; she was not his wife; she was in the workhouse at the same time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mrs. Hall has told your Lordship that I took the keys, and that I took the lodgings. It was the woman that took the lodgings, and as soon as the woman and I agreed to take the lodgings, the prosecutrix gave the woman the keys of the room and door directly; I never had the keys in my possession a quarter of an hour in my life; I was a porter; I used to go out between five and six o'clock in the morning; I used to meet the Exeter mail to get a job of carrying parcels from that mail, and I was out carrying parcels at that time; I never went home in day-time; the last time I slept in the lodgings, the sheets, the blankets, and the rug, I left on the bed when I got up, and the woman I left in the bed. I went to my work as usual expecting to come home at night, but hearing of a place that would be rather more to my advantage, in the country, I went that afternoon and got it. I did not return again for about four months, and when I had been in London a little time, I was employed to carry a box of stone-masons tools to Wandsworth; I fell down and hurt my loins, which made me apply to St. James's workhouse for relief, and there I was when these people found me; as for the property I never moved a single article, nor had I the knowledge of their being moved.</p>

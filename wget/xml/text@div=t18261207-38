On the 16th of November, about half-past three o'clock, Tobin came into the shop alone, and bought a quarter of a yard of calico for 1d.; I stopped him as he was going out, in consequence of information, and asked what he wanted it for; he said he came from Chelsea and wanted to mend his shirt with it - he was taken to the watch-house about half an hour afterwards - Webster had been pointed out to me, and I went after him - I saw two or three different quarters of yards of calico found on Tobin at the watch-house; that I sold to him, was among them - a lady's silk handkerchief and one or two quarters of yards of calico were found on Webster- when I stopped Tobin, as he was leaving our shop, I saw Webster sitting nearly opposite the shop, with his apron full of something - I followed him, and picked up two pieces of sarsnet, one shawl, and one cloak - they laid in the way he had run, but I had not seen him drop them.</p>

I saw Webster running round the corner very fast, and stopped him; he had an apron on, but nothing in it then - his hat fell off with two pieces of calico in it - he asked me to let him go, saying he had only knocked a man down; but I gave him in charge.</p>

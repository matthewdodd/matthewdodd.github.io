            . I live in New Union-street, Moorfields - the prisoner lodged in the same house at one time; I had frequent opportunities of seeing him write, and am acquainted with his hand-writing. (The witness examined three papers, and a bill on Exchange, which she identified as the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>One of the papers was here read - it was a letter, addressed to "Mr. Thompson, coal-merchant and brewer, Northampton," and signed William Oglivie, stating, that understanding Mr. Thompson was in want of the loan of 500 l. the writer would discount his promissory notes, of 250 l. each, at six and twelve months date, payable to order, at 5 per cent. discount, and 2 s. 6 d. commission; and desiring to direct to him at the Ram Inn, Smithfield.</p>

            . I am landlord of the Ram-inn, Smithfield. The prisoner was at my house once or twice in April last - I saw him there in a room with Mr. Thompson - it was on a Friday in April; the prisoner had left his card at our house, in the name of Oglivie, and said he had a letter coming from a person, and would I take it in for him. One came, addressed to Mr. Oglivie, at the Ram-Inn, Smithfield, and he took it; this was about a fortnight before I saw him with Thompson; several other letters came in the same name, from Ireland and Scotland, as appeared by the post-marks; he had them all: I did not see him open them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he say more than this to you, "If any letters come in the name of Oglivie, please to take them in?" A. It was to that purpose - he left a card, which I supposed was his own. I did not find that his name was not Oglivie till after I came here, and heard him plead to the name of Wilson.</p>
               <p>Q. You only thought his name was Oglivie from his leaving that card? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. State what he did about that card? - A. He brought a card, and said, "I have taken the liberty of having a letter addressed, for me, or to me, to your house - will you take it in?" I said certainly, and next day one came - he called the same morning, and took it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Mr. Isaacs is an attorney? A. Yes; a gentleman calling himself Moss was there, disputing with Mr. Thompson about possession of the bill; Mr. Isaacs, and a person named Creed, were also there; Mr. Isaacs said Mr. Thompson came there under pretence of taking the bill up, and then put it into his pocket; Mr. Thompson had possession of it when I got there; Mr. Isaacs wished me to take Mr. Thompson in charge, but I did not attempt to do so; he consented to leave the bill in my hands till it was decided; one of Mr. Isaacs's clerks came for me.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did not Thompson consent immediately that it should be in your custody till this trial? A. Yes; he said it was not his hand-writing; that he was not the acceptor of the bill.</p>

            . (looking at one of the letters produced). I received this from the watch-house-keeper of Bunhill-row. I then went to No. 7, Lloyd's-row, and found a bundle of papers in the first room, on the right. This paper (looking at it) was among them: -</p>
               <p>(Letter read.)</p>
               <p>MY DEAR ANN. - I am in custody at Bunhill-row watch-house; let him know by seven o'clock in the morning, or to night, to send Mr. Harmer to me, as I go to Worship-street by ten o'clock - hide my papers. I am in good spirits. Bring me a shirt and stockings by nine o'clock; say to the landlady I am arrested for putting my name to a bill, to oblige a friend - shew this to him., and he will send some one to me with some money.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Williams, No. 7, Lloyd's-row, Sadler's Wells.</p>
               <p>The paper found at Lloyd's-row, was directed on the back,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Shannon," dated</p>
               <p>"9th June, 1825," contained a list of various bills, amounting in all to 1100 l.; the one in question being among them, and under the list was written as follows. "I have received the above bills from F. Wilson, for which I have given him 50 l. on account, and it is expressly understood between us, that he is to receive a quarter of whatever I recover on them."</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to MR. CREED. Q. What had you to do in this business? A. Mr. Coles being in town, and having had a bill got from him, I went as his friend. I was not employed by any one. I went to search the lodging, and found this paper - no officer was with us. Mr. Coles, my father, and one Cleaveland went with me; he is clerk to Messrs, Cox and Co. army agents.</p>
               <p>Q. Do all these gentlemen happen to form members of a society? A. We do; we belong to the society of Guardians, for the protection of trade - it was established before I was born. Messrs. Foss and Sons are the attornies.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Foss has nothing to do with the society who set this prosecution on foot? A. No; Mr. Matthews is their attorney. That society has nothing to do with the one Mr. Foss belongs to. I did not know Coles till about a fortnight before I went there. I am a member of another society like Mr. Foss's, and so is my father.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. In consequence of Coles complaining to you, did you go there in search of a bill? A. I did; we found his bill there - his name is at the head of this list.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you go to Messrs. Esdaile's, to stop payment of this bill? A. No; Thompson made some application to my father about the bill, and I believe my my father went to Messrs. Esdaile's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell your father to stop payment of the bill, because he had been swindled out of it? A. I never heard him tell him so. I know that he said it was a forgery. I think he said the amount was 150 l.; but he understood there were others - he explained to me that the bills were drawn, I think at the Ram Inn, and Mr. Cooper wished him to accept them, but he declined. I do not know how he gained information of the forgery, or how he knew they were made payable at Messrs. Esdaile's.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. What did he state about the bills? A. He said he met Cooper by appointment - that Cooper drew them, and wished him to accept them, which he declined, for, as Cooper was to send the bills into Scotland to be discounted, and as he was a stranger there, they might be sent there without his acceptance, on his (Cooper's) responsibility, and if Cooper would bring the money down to him, at Northampton, he would pay his expenses.</p>
               <p>Q. You mention the name of Cooper; was that the name Thompson knew him by? A. No, he knew him as Oglivie. I call him Cooper, because he was apprehended by that name. We did not discover till afterwards, that Cooper and Oglivie were the same persons. Thompson said he knew him as Oglivie, and he drew the bills as Wilson - it excited his suspicion, and I believe was one reason why he refused to accept.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Thompson explain how Wilson could get the bills discounted in Scotland without being accepted? A. If the money was got he was to accept them.</p>

            . I keep the Fox and Anchor public-house, Charter-house-lane. Mr. Thompson, of Nottingham, generally comes to my house when he is in town. I first knew him about March or April last. I saw him there, in company with the prisoner, about the beginning of April. I think they came in to my front room, which I call the tap-room; they had some conversation; they came again together in two or three days, had some conversation, and went into my back parlour; they desired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150060"></xptr>some ham for lunch, which I fetched them, from Charterhouse-street, and after some conversation they desired that some bill stamps should be sent for; I cannot say what the amount was - it was two or three; my little boy fetched them; I took them into the back room myself, and put them on the table; Thompson asked for a pen and ink, which I took into the room; the prisoner wrote on the stamps, and I had occasion to withdraw from the room, to go to the table in the yard, close to the parlour window, which was open, to wash my hands, and saw the prisoner writing on the stamps; after washing my hands I had occasion to go into the room; I believe they then asked for more ale; I took it in, and while I was in the room I saw Thompson writing across one of the stamps; what he wrote I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did you write a letter to Mr. Thompson on the 4th of June? A. I have written a letter or two to him, and received this letter (one before produced) in answer to mine of the 4th of June; I answered it by post; (looking at another) this was also written to me; I saw him afterwards, and conversed with him about the contents; I have seen him write myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at this bill - do you believe what is written across it to be his hand-writing? A. I really do - I have not the least doubt of it. I saw him at my house last Saturday week - I think he said to me that it was a hard case to loose so much money - that he did not wish to hang the prisoner if he could get his acceptances back - that there was one coming due in October - he wished me to endeavour to get them if I could - I said I did not know how to proceed in it - I had nothing more to do with it.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Now, take care, did he say "acceptances or bills?" A. I cannot take upon myself to say which.</p>
               <p>Q. To the private room of your house there is a window, which was open, and you could see what passed? A. I saw a great part of it - I did not pretend to wish to know about it - I am quite certain the prisoner wrote on the stamps - I do not know his hand-writing - I never saw him till about a month previous to his coming with Mr. Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sworn they were there on two occasions, one of which was two or three days after the other? A. As near as I can recollect - it might be more - I did not make a minute of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you recollect the bread and cheese one day, and the ham the other? A. Because I have frequently seen Thompson - he has dined with me when I have had roast beef - I was once one of the Fancy - I was called St. Davis when I was on the list - I did not put my head through the window - I did not wish to see what was going on, or I could have looked more minutely - I always knew the prisoner by the name of Wilson.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went yourself to fetch the ham? A. Yes, that makes me remember it - I have left off fighting about a year and a half - I went to shew Thompson the way to Worship-street - he stated that he had to charge the prisoner with getting either bills or acceptances from him in a manner that was not proper - I cannot say what were his words.</p>

            . I am the holder of this bill - I received it from Shannon - I presented it for payment at Sir James Esdaile's, and then put it into Mr. Isaacs's hands - a gentleman calling himself Wright, but who I found afterwards was Creed, called at my house with Mr. Thompson, and proposed an arrangement to pay the bill, saying that Thompson was defrauded out of the acceptance - I told him it laid in my solicitor's hands, and we three went to Mr. Isaacs - Thompson said he was defrauded out of the bill, and Creed asked Mr. Isaacs if he had any objection to shew the bill - it was shewn to Mr. Creed, who handed it over to Thompson, who walked up to Mr. Creed and said, "Have you your barnacles?" or something of that sort - Creed said he knew nothing about that, and then Thompson put the bill into his pocket - Mr. Isaacs protested against it, and said he should certainly give him in charge unless he gave it up - Forrester was sent for - Creed proposed that Forrester should take charge of it, and they then said it was a forgery - Thompson said it was hard that he should have to pay them - I said</p>
               <p>"What need you be afraid of if it is a forgery" - he never answered, but walked up and down the room.</p>

            . I am an attorney, and was instructed by Mr. Moss to apply for payment of this bill - there have been no proceedings taken yet. While I was in possession of it Mr. Thompson called on me, in company with Mr. Moss, and a person calling himself Wright; Mr. Moss said they had called to propose some arrangement; one of them asked if less than the whole amount would be taken; the answer was, that it could not be done without the consent of Shannon, an indorser; something was said about time; Mr. Creed requested a sight of the bill; I called to the outer office for the bill, and put it into Creed's hands; he looked at it for a short period, and handed it to Mr. Thompson, who pretended to be looking for something, and asked Creed if he had his barnacles about him (I should have mentioned that he said he had been tricked out of this and other bills); he then folded up the bill, grasped it very tight, and said, "This is a forgery; I shall keep this bill;" I said I could not allow that, but, if he wished it for the purposes of justice, I should produce it at any time; he insisted upon holding it, and I sent for Forrester.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and know Thompson well. I have seen him write five or six times. To the best of my belief the acceptance on this bill is his writing. I have very little doubt of it. I should not have objected to take it as his acceptance.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. When did you first give information that you knew any thing of his hand-writing? A. I am assistant to a Sheriff's officer; an attorney at Northampton knew I had had business with Thompson; that is the way they found me out; the last time I saw him write was about two months ago, at his own house.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What attorney at Northampton applied to you about this? A. Mr. Jay's clerk; he sent to me on Tuesday to know what I knew, and subpoenaed me directly; they applied to my master first, and sent to me as the person who knew the hand-writing; I have seen him sign his name two or three times; I only saw him scribbling two months ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the reason of his scribbling? A. He was making a bill, which he had referred to his son to finish; we had arrested him, and there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150061"></xptr>a bill between the plaintiff and him; I asked for it; he began to scribble.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that scribbling at all like this acceptance? A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS. I am the wife of Cyrus Davis. Thompson came twice to our house with Wilson. I remember the second time; bill stamps were sent for - I think it was two - they were in a little back parlour adjoining the bar - Thompson called for pen and ink - a window looks from that room into the yard - I have seen Thompson write several times, and swear that the acceptance on this bill is his writing.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How often have you seen him write? A. Five or six times - in March, April, and May last - he made no difficulty at writing - my little boy fetched the stamps.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is there by the window looking into the yard a place to wash hands? A. There is a table at the window - my husband washes his hands there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you in the parlour while these persons were there? A. Part of the time - the window was open all day - I have received letters from Thompson, and he has afterwards asked me if I had received them - he wrote to us, stating that there was ale at the wharf for us - we bought ale of him.</p>

             (aged nine years, upon being questioned, appeared to understand the obligation of an oath). I saw the prisoner at my father's house with a stout fat gentleman named Thompson - my father or mother sent me for some stamps, which I fetched from the second house opposite - I fetched two - they were small pieces of paper - I laid them on the table in the little parlour at the back of the bar.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Was the prisoner very much at your house? A. I do not know; I often saw him there, and knew him by the name of Wilson. I do not know when I went for the stamps - it is not very lately.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you recollect what sort of stamps you asked for? A. No: I do not know how much money I had.</p>
               <p>COURT to JONES. Q. How long have you known Thompson? A. For six or seven years - he carries on a large business in bricks, malt, &amp;c.; his sons, I believe, manage the business for him.</p>

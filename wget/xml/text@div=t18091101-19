On the 20th of October, between four and five in the afternoon, the prisoner came in the shop with a young woman to buy a bit of jean; she was to chuse the colour; I put them down several pieces, but none of them would please them; the prisoner said to the woman, you had better have velvet for your shoes; it was but for one pair. I turned round to look for the velvet and when I came back I missed a piece of jean; I looked and saw it under his coat; I should have charged him with it directly, but being alone I was afraid; I rang the bell; my servant came down directly; I followed him to the door, I said you have a piece of jean; then he ran off as fast as he could, the young woman went after him; he ran up Sun-court and down Dunnings-alley. He was brought back in about ten minutes. I am sure he is the same person.</p>

            . On the 25th of October I was in Sun-street, I heard the cry of stop thief, I ran after the mob; I picked up a piece of jean; I went on further, I saw they were bringing the prisoner back; I went with the prisoner and Mr. Taylor to Mrs. Caldicott with the jean; she said it was her's, and what the prisoner had taken out of the shop.</p>
               <p>MR. TAYLOR. I live in Sun-street. On the 25th of October, near my house I heard the cry of stop thief, I observed the prisoner running away from the young woman; observing that he crossed the way to come at the back of the houses in Sun-street I run to my own house, and went through and got out of my back door; the moment I opened the back door I saw the prisoner pass, as hard as he could run; I immediately followed him and knocked him down; the servant came up and said he had robbed her mistress of the jean; I took him back to Mrs. Caldicott; she said he was the man that took her jean.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Defence. I was going to my dinner about one o'clock, I met my fellow apprentice, we had a pint of beer together; this woman was with him, she said she wanted a pair of shoes; I took her to Mrs. Caldicott to buy the stuff. I know nothing of that stuff, I came out of the shop before the woman.</p>

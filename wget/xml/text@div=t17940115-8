            . On the 19th of December, Thursday, we lost the sugar, I was landing away some sugar about six o'clock in the evening, from Fresh wharf, I was very near done, I had rolled two hogsheads in the gateway to make room for the carts to go down; I was called by my brother to look, he said he had found a hogshead that was plundered with the head out. My brother's name is James Yates; I had not stayed on the whars above the space of five minutes before this man, Brightwell, brought the prisoner down with his apron full of sugar, from Cox's key; I looked at the hogshead and there was half the head out, and a deal of sugar out, and lay about, I took the sugar and compared it with that in the hogshead, and it appears from what I know of sugar, to be of the same quality; there was none other on the key that had their heads open, I looked them all over, there were different forts of sugar on the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say with certainty that any was missing from the hogshead? - Yes, I can say there was a good deal missing at that time, I know that the hogshead was full, I had seen it a tight head on half an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that you saw the prisoner after you had seen the hogshead open? - About five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make the discovery that the sugar was gone before the prisoner was brought to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it that you made the discovery that the sugar was gone before it was brought to you? - Not five minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. In what manner had he the sugar? - He had it in his apron before him.</p>

               <p>Court to Yates. Was all the sugar that was missing belonging to Mr. Bolt? - All the sugar was in Mr. Bolt's care, as wharsinger.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I went down to this water side; I intended to go down to Gravesend that same low water, I could not get a fishing smack; I went up one of these gateways, there were a parcel of people there; I had been at work on these keys all the day; there were four of the hogsheads burst out of ten, I was all over sugar, the sugar flew over me as I was going up the gateway, a parcel of people were standing in the middle, and this man thought I had stole some sugar, because I was all over sugar, and he took me to Mr. Yates, and he said, see he is all over sugar now; I have got no friends, I am a seaman, I served my time at sea.</p>
               <p>Court to Brightwell. How far was the prisoner from the hogshead that had the head taken off? - About forty or fifty yards, not more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The hogsheads were in one gateway, and I was going up another, therefore it must be more than fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Court to Yates. What might be the value of the sugar found on him? - About six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that the quantity found there was all that was missing? - I think it was with the rest that lay on the ground, which I did not pick up, because it being dirty it would spoil the rest.</p>

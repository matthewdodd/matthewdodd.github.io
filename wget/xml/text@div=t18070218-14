               <p>MRS. BENJAMIN. Q. You are the wife of the prosecutor. - A. Yes; I was behind the counter in the shop when the pelisses were taken, they were hanging at the post of the door outside of the shop. I heard the cry of stop thief, I immediately went to the door and missed the two pelisses. I went about two doors off and took the pelisses from the prisoner, she gave them to me and said nothing.</p>

            . I was at the prisoner's mothers house the day this piece of work happened concerning the pelisse; I asked Mrs. Benjamin what was the matter; she said she had torn the pelisses, and she must be paid for it. I answered she was in liquor, and I dare say if she come to morrow she would be paid for it; she came three times in all.</p>

               <p>- NEWTON. I heard the cry of stop thief, I went into the street, I saw the prisoner running away towards her own home, I followed her and overtook the prisoner at her own door, I desired her to stop, she said, no; I overtook her on the stairs, I told her I understood that she had stole two pelisses from Mr. Benjamin's shop; she said she had not got the pelisses. They were taken away from her before I saw her.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoners Defence. Mrs. Benjamin said if I would pay half a guinea I should not be prosecuted at Marlborough street; her husband said I tore these two pelisses; Mr. Newton swore that I took them away, she swore that she followed me into a wine vaults, and took the two pelisses from me. I went on a Sunday morning to exchange some of my cloaths, I left some of my cloaths with them, I have never got my property from their house.</p>

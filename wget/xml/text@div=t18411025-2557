I was on duty in Bread-street, on the morning of the 30th of September—I had noticed some things, which induced me to watch—I saw Price, about eight o'clock that morning, come out of Luck and Co.'s with a brown parcel—I set a lad to watch—I saw him again, about eleven, come out with some parcels—he went to Punchard's, who is a marine-store dealer, in Bread-street-hill—I looked through a pane of glass in the window—I saw Price give this parcel to Punchard—it was tied up tight with this rope, so that I could not see what was in it—Punchard took it into his possession, and handed Price some halfpence—he did not untie the parcel, or weigh it—I went in, and asked both of them whose property it was, and what they bad got there—neither of them made any answer, but Punchard shot some paper out of a bag, threw the bag at Price's feet, and said, "Here is your bag"—the bag was lying in the shop—the wrappers were lying on the counter, close against Punchard—Price did not take that bag into the shop—he had two brown paper parcels—I searched Price, and found on</p>

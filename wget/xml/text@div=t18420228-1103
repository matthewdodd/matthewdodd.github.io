                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, Wild's-buildings, Borough, in the parish of St. Saviour, Southwark, and work at a hop warehouse. On the night of the 27th of February, I was returning home along Holland-street; a female addressed me and asked where I was going, I said I was going home; she said would I go home with her—I said not, and went on—I turned down the street, and she came down on the same side of the way, as far as a house near which I was attacked; she wanted me to go in there, I refused—she used some words—I said I did not care for her as tong as I behaved myself well—I went about five yards from the place, and three men attacked me, a few yards from the house; one of them came up the street, and struck me a blow in the face—I cannot say where they came from—they said nothing to me—one of them struck me in the face, and the other two attacked me severely—they struggled with me a few moments, till a woman and her husband was passing, and the husband interfered—I knocked the prisoner down, and kept him till the policeman came up—the men were stranger to me—I was sober—the first thing they did was to strike me; and the other two struck me about the body—they said nothing—no attempt was made to take anything from me—they could not overhear any conversation between me and the female.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Cranfield, of Isabella<lb></lb>row, Lambeth—my husband is a smith. On the night of the 27th of February, about twelve o'clock, I was leaving a house in Ewer-street; I stood at the door and saw a female talking to the prosecutor in a very improper manner, because he would not go up the street with her—the prosecutor walked on towards the house, and the female stopped him against the door and began talking to him again—I heard her say some<lb></lb>thing very improper—he said no, he would be d—d if he would—he was going from her—she said something about she would make somebody—I saw three young men standing at the corner of a court or gateway, and heard one of them say "She cannot get him in;" and when the prose<lb></lb>cutor was leaving her, the three ran up the street—I saw one of them strike him—I called to my husband, "Come, here is a man will be killed"—we went up the street; the prosecutor and the prisoner were fighting as it were, and the other two struck him a blow—my husband tried to get the prisoner away—I hallooed "Police;" and one of them came up to me and said, "If you do not hold your tongue calling Police, I will kill you"—I ran to the top of the street, and called "Police" again; the police came down—I said several times that the prosecutor's hat was taken into the house, she was endeavouring to get him in too, calling watch; and it was at last thrown out of the door or window—he kept hallooing out, "My watch, my watch, mind my watch"—the female and the other two men ran away when the policeman ran down the street.</p>

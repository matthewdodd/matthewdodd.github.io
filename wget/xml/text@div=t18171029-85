               <p>JOHN EVANS. I am a grocer, and live at Aldgate. The prisoner came into my shop on the <rs id="t18171029-85-cd454" type="crimeDate">10th of October</rs>

I said I did not make less than an ounce, which came to 6d.; she paid me 6d. for it, which I immediately found was bad. She asked for half a pound of sugar and gave me another bad 6d. I detained her, and charged her with passing had money. I asked her for the money she had in her hand, which she gave me. I sent for an officer. She pulled her apron off, and threw it from her - I gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>JOHN FORRESTER, JUN. I am an officer. On the 10th of October I was fetched to Mr. Evans's, and took the prisoner into custody. My father examined her apron.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q.What age are you? - A.Sixty-eight - my sight is not very good - I only saw the person when he asked me for No. 2, and when he came back and took my bundle - I know he had a fustian dress on, as he crossed two or three yards from me; and it was pretty light there - I had never seen him before.</p>

            . I was standing at a coal-shed in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020020"></xptr>Sugar-loaf-court - I heard the old lady cry, "Stop thief" - I looked down the court, and saw a man come up the court with a bundle - I would not swear to the prisoner; but as he passed me the colour of his dress seemed the same as what the prisoner has on now - when I heard the cry of"Stop thief," I cried, "Stop thief," and the man dropped the bundle, which I took up - he turned down Swan-street - the prisoner was brought back in a few minutes - he seemed to me to be the same man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Was there any light near you? - Yes, from the coal-shed, and from the gas-lamp - I had but a moment to observe the prisoner in, and would not swear he is the man - the court I was in is the next to Mr. Bailey's.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL TAYLOR (police-constable H 83). I was on duty at the end of Swan-street, and saw the prisoner running from that court, and some persons after him - I stopped him - he said, "Let me go, he has run up the street;" I took him back to Sugar-loaf-court, and asked what was the matter - they said a woman had been robbed of a bundle - and Godfrey said the prisoner was the man - he said, "You cannot swear to me;" she said, "I can, by your dress;" he had a fustian coatee on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were there not a great many people running? A. There might be a dozen, but chiefly women and lads: there might be one or two men - the prisoner was the first who was running - I had been about a minute at the corner, no person could have run past for the space of two minutes without my seeing them; the prisoner said he was not the man; the prosecutrix said she would not give charge of him if I would give her her property; I did not press her to give charge, nor did I threaten to take her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to Well-street - there was a cry of "Stop thief," and the officer took me - the woman said, "As I have got my bundle, let him go;" but the officer said, "If you don't give charge of him, I will take you."</p>

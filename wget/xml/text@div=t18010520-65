               <p>Q. Could they get out of your yard? - A. I never knew them go one hundred yards in my life; I had them ringed the day before.</p>

             sworn. - On Tuesday, the 21st of April, about half past twelve o'clock, I was coming from Muswell-hill to Highgate; I had been at work at the foot of the hill with a team of horses; I saw the prisoner coming towards Highgate with the sow and pigs; I halted, and he came up to me, and we had some conversation together; I said to him, you have got some very pretty pigs there; he said, yes; I said, a couple of the best of them would not be dear at a guinea; he said, no; I asked him if they were for sale; he said they were; I asked him how far he had drove them; he said, from the hill above, but he did not know the name of it; I came with him a considerable way; he did not go so fast as I did, and I passed by him; he said, you say you want a couple of pigs, you shall have a couple for a guinea, take one of the worst and one of the best; I said, no, my friend, you are too hard, I do not particularly want them; I left him upon Highgate-common; I halted again at the beginning of Highgate, and waited till the man came up again; I then seized him by the collar; says I, my friend, you are not going any further with these hogs, I shall stop you on suspicion of having stolen these hogs; he said, no, they are my own property, I have bought them and paid for them; I asked him where he bought them; he said, at a public-house at the hill, pointin to Muswell-hill; he said he bought them of a publican, but did not know his name; I told him that did not satisfy me, I should take him into custody on suspicion; he said he was afraid he should lose the hogs; I took him to the Castle inn, and left him in custody there while I went back again to Muswell-hill; I put the hogs into my own stye, at Highgate, till Mrs. Webb claimed them; she and I went to the Magistrate together.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from Mrs. Webb's that you first saw the prisoner? - A. Not quite a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was looking after some work; I overtook a man with a sow and pigs; he asked me to take them for him towards Islington, and he would satisfy me. <rs id="t18010520-65-verdict357" type="verdictDescription">

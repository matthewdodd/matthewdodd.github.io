               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. At what time had you left your friends? A. About half-past two o'clock I had not looked at my watch; I came direct from Whitechapel - I did not mean to cross the bridge, and came across Bishopsgate-street, down Sun-street, Finsbury, and across Smithfield; that was not out of the way to go over Blackfriars-bridge - I do not think Cornhill would have been the straightest way; I called at no public-house on the road - I was not at the Red Lion, in Poppin's-court; I did not say I lived in Kennington-lane, at the station-house- I wrote my address there; I was rather elevated - I noticed as the man ran away that he had a brown coat on; he knocked me down with his fist - he either came out of a house or a street.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I saw the prosecutor, about half-past three o'clock, in West-street, at the corner of Field-lane - he complained of having been robbed by two women; I had just met the prisoner and another woman going through Black Boy-alley, which leads into West-street - I let them go on, and when I came to the bottom I met Steer, who told me he had been robbed of a gold watch; I then went after them - they had got nearly two hundred yards, as far as Turnmill-street; I laid hold of them both by each hand, and the prisoner dropped the watch which I now produce - I am quite sure I saw her drop it; I picked it up, and held her till another constable came - we took them to the station, and they were both committed; the bill against the other has been thrown out - I sent another constable to look for Steer; he came to the station, and claimed the watch directly he saw it - he was rather in liquor, but not insensible; he spoke rationally - he identified it again at the Mansion-house; I gave it to the inspector to lock up, but I put my mark on it first, and am certain this is the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure of it? A. I have my mark on it, and I took the No. 2154 - the prosecutor did not describe it before he saw it - he had said it was a gold watch; he could walk as steady as I could - he stated he had been robbed in Farringdon-street, and I found the prisoner about four hundred yard from there.</p>
               <p>H. G. STEER. This is my watch - I bought it about nine months ago of my brother; it is worth 4l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I think you said you did not meet any women in you walk? A. Not to speak to them - none of them touched me; I am quite sure none of them surrounded me - they may have said "Good night" or so, but I said nothing to them; I am a married man.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was coming through Black-boy-alley, about half-past three o'clock, and met the prisoner and another woman - the tall one said to the short one "I thought he would have knocked you down;" the short one replied, "I thought he would" - we went on the corner of Field-lane, and met Steer, who said he had lost a gold watch; we returned, and took both the women in Turnmill-street; I saw Sarsfield stoop and pick up a watch when I took them - he took it to the station-house, where Steer identified it - he was sober enough to describe what had passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How were the women standing when he picked something up? A. He had seized them both, and they stood rather against the wall; the prisoner appeared to have dropped something; her right hand was to the wall - I did not see her drop it.</p>

The prisoner lodged with me; I pay the rent of the room - she was to pay me rent, but never did; she had been with me about three weeks, and left me on the night of the robbery, the 16th of August; I did not find this out till the morning of the 17th, when I was dressing myself; I then found my box not in the place I had left it - I found a dent in the lid, and it was open; I looked into it, and missed nearly 40l., which was placed in a small box inside the larger one; the money was taken out, and the little box was left - nothing was taken but the money; it was fifteen sovereigns, and the rest in shillings and half-crowns - 3l. was left; the silver was loose in a little purse - the purse was taken, and a bag which had the money in it was taken; I immediately cried out - my neighbours came and asked what was the matter, and they told me to go to the watch-house; I have since seen the bag the money was in, in clements' possession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had you any other lodgers in the house besides me? A. Not the day you took the money; two women lodge with me, but they were both out on the 16th.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When did you see your money last? A. I was at my box on the Monday, and saw my money, that was the 15th; on the 16th one of the lodgers went to her mother's, and the other to her work - they slept in my house at night; I did not see the money after they left.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I left one lodger in the room, named Ann West, very much intoxicated, on the bed; Mrs. Grace, I, and West's husband, came out together, went to a public-house, and there had some drink; I said to Grace, "Now, remember where I am going - I have paid you all I owe you;" she said, "Mrs. Jones, you have paid me every thing satisfactorily;" I paid her 11s. for rent; she knew I was going out, and should not return till four o'clock in the morning, and I left her 5s. to get breakfast. Did you not know I was in possession of a few pounds? Witness. No.</p>

I received charge of the prisoner for being drunk, and searched her on the morning of the 17th - I found on her a canvas bag and 9l. 19s.; after searching her, I asked where the remainder of the money was - she said she knew nothing about it; I brought her up from the lock-up place, and she said that nobody but her knew that old Betty had got so much money - I asked where the rest was; she said she knew nothing about it - I sent one of my men to her lodgings; he brought some more money - she was remanded for a week, and at the end of the week she sent for me, and said if I went to her brother he could tell me where the rest of the money was; in consequence of information from him, I went to a public-house, and the landlord produced some money to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you found the money on me, you took me up, and said, "Well, my girl, you are in a fine predicament, are not you? you had better tell me the truth." Witness. I did not tell her to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner.

            . I am a publican. The prisoner came into my house about ten o'clock in the evening, on the 16th of August, with a man, whom she called her brother - they had something to drink; she told me she had sold a little property out of the Bank, that it was the last she had, she was fearful her brother would get it from her, and would I let her leave it with me for a few days; I said I had no objection if she would count it before her brother, and she counted eleven sovereigns and four half-crowns, which I produce.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 16th of August, I came home about two o'clock, and Mrs. Grace was washing next door - I went to her, and told her, as I could not get what I wanted for dinner, I would let it rest till the evening, and when I came home I would pay her a little money, and perhaps all that I owed, as we had had a few words the evening before; she wanted to turn me out of doors, but the landlord would not let her - she had two more women lodging with her; we all slept in one bed, and there was a dispute about so many being in the bed, and I slept on the boxes at the foot of the bed - when I came home I fetched her from next door, and paid her 11s. which I owed her; we both went out together, and the key was hung up - we went round the corner to a public-house, and had a quartern of gin, which I paid for; I saw no more of her till I came home at nine o'clock at night - I had been to redeem some articles; nobody was at home - I went next door, spoke to Grace, and then came away, finding I should be too late to go where I intended - I went in a coach to my husband's brother, in Covent-garden; I told him I had met a friend who was now going to set me up in life again, and I intended to leave London altogether - I had paid my landlady<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080019"></xptr>all I owed, had sufficient to relieve myself from all difficulties, and should have a few pounds left - the last time I left Grace's room

            . I am a fruiterer, and live in Bull's Head-passage, Leadenhall-market. On the 24th of October the prisoner came to my shop, and asked for 3d. worth of apples - she tendered me a crown-piece, and I gave her change without noticing it, but afterwards found a bad one among my money. On the 29th she came again, about three o'clock in the afternoon, for 3d. or 4d. worth of apples, and gave me a half-crown; I went into the counting-house, took out the had crown, and said, "Good woman, you must know this crown-piece;" she said No - I said,"Well, you must know this had half-crown - where did you get it?" she said she took it at a shop up the market"- I said then she could show me the shop; she walked along the market, and let something fall from her person, which I took up, and gave to the officer - it was seven half-crowns in a cotton handkerchief; I said she was a bad woman, and asked how she came to pass such bad money- she said she was extremely sorry; I gave the eight half-crowns to the officer - I put the whole together.</p>

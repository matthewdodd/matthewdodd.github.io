I am the wife of William Brett, and reside at 11, Gray-street, Richmond-road, Islington—last Monday morning, between 10 and 11, I was walking up Gracechurch-street—I had a purse in my pocket, which contained a half-sovereign, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—a gentleman of the name of Smith, who had hold of the prisoner, came up and spoke to me; and at the same time a boy named Bates gave me my pursr—I had not missed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a broker at 138, Leadenhall-street—I was going from Gracechurch-street into Leadenhall-street at about half-past 10 last Monday morning, when I saw the prisoner, who was with another man, go close up to the side of the last witness and pass his hand into her pocket, right in front of her dress, and take out a purse and show it to his com<lb></lb>panion—I ran up to the lady, who was walking fast in the opposite direction, touched her on the shoulder, and told her she had been robbed; then I ran up to the prisoner, seized him by the collar, and said, "Give me back that purse you have robbed the lady of"—his hands were behind him, loose: he said he had no purse—I had him by the neck: he struggled very violently, and attempted to strike me—I saw a shop door open, I threw him into the shop and shut the door on him—the lady then came into the shop; I sent for an officer, and gave him into custody—I am sure he is the man who took the purse—the road was quite clear at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> That is the reason the lady was waiting to cross? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, at the time the thing happened she was stepping off the pavement—I did not see any body else waiting with her to cross—I am a sworn ship-broker, and carry on my business at 138, Leadenhall-street—I have been there two years—perhaps I have been in half-a-dozen cases of this description in London, and perhaps a dozen in Liverpool—my name is not up in Leadenhall-street—I am connected with the house of Powell and Co., from whom I have a certain fixed salary and a commission, and I do business for other houses—I have my own room at their house—I do not consider myself a clerk.</p>

               <p>and the money in it flew about, and was picked up—I picked up two shillings and the purse, took it into tho shop where the last witness had taken the prisoner, and gave it to the lady.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

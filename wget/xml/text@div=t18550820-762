                  </hi>. My husband is a confectioner, at Isleworth. On 3rd July Smith came about 7 o'clock, and asked for a pennyworth of gingerbread; I served him—he paid me a half crown—I took it indoors to my father-in-law; I found it was bad, I marked it, and laid it on the shelf.</p>

I gave the policeman the half crown that my daughter-in-law put on the shelf; that was soon after they took it—I came home between 12 and 1 o'clock, and she showed me what she had taken—I saw the police in the evening of the day that this was given to me—I stayed at home all the rest of the day—I had not been at home many minutes when it was shown to me—I took it off the shelf to show to a friend, that he should not be taken in.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer shop, at Isleworth. On Tuesday, 3rd July, I saw all the three prisoners—I had seen Townsend and Hodgson in the house on Monday; they had some ale and biscuits, and paid in good money—I saw Smith first on the Tuesday—I saw him in the skittle ground in the afternoon—Hodgson and Townsend came about 5 o'clock, and three or four more—they had something to drink in the tap room, there were five or six of them—the three prisoners afterwards came altogether, and Smith called for a pint of ale; I took it them, and Townsend gave me a shilling; it was bad—I noticed it directly, and marked it—I called the policeman, and gave her into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Smith. Q.</hi> How much beer do you suppose we drank together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You did not drink half the ale—I gave you in charge at once—part of it was drank—you came about 2 o'clock on the Tuesday—I did not challenge you to play at skittles—we did play—you afterwards played with a customer of mine—I think you left off play about 6 o'clock, and you left my house about 7 o'clock.</p>

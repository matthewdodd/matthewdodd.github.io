I consulted my brother; we went and gave information at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180090"></xptr>Office in Worship-street; we marked the metal and left it all in the hole till one o'clock; he went out to dinner as usual; I immediately followed him, and let him go as far as Hoxton, in hopes of taking the receiver as well as the thief; he got near home, and I thought there was no iron shop in the way, I immediately secured him; I brought him back, and the officer took a piece of metal from out of his breeches.</p>

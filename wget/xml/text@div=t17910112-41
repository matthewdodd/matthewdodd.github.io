On the 17th of December, in the morning, my boy was taking down the shutters, and cracked one of the squares of the window; about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was up at dinner, and had left the shopman in the shop; I believe, he in the mean time went into the back shop; and I came down to send him to dinner; and I saw from the the middle of the stairs, these two women standing in the street, with their heads quite close to the window; I stood for half a minute on the stairs, and they were still looking, when Vallens, who had a large red cloak on, put her arm into the window as far as she could reach, and took out a card of lace which was laying in the window; there is a shew-board, and it was at the extremity of that board: Burn stood so, that no person coming up the street could see her; there was very few people passing, as it rained hard; I ran down the stairs, and after her; she was about five yards from the place; she put it under her cloak, and put her left hand upon it; I ran after her, and took hold of her; Vallens ran off; and I took her as quick as I could; the other crossed the road, and came down the other side of the way; when she had got opposite me, I took the other over to her, but could not keep both; a coachman then drew up; the big one was then put in, and then the other; I let go the little one, and ran after the big one; the coachman held one. (The lace produced and sworn to.) The window was broke about eight o'clock, only cracked, not broke out; I am sure these are the women.</p>

I have some witnesses.</p>

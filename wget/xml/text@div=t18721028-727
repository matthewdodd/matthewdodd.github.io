                  </hi>. I live in Red Lion Yard, Gray's Inn Road—on 1st October, about 12.20, I was in Chiswell Street with a friend—the prisoner Redding went up to my friend and struck him—he turned round and Reeves struck him likewise—I turned to pull my friend away, and Reeves struck me on my mouth—three or four persons came round and I lost my watch, chain—a policeman came up and I gave the prisoners in custody—Redding tried to pull Reeves away from the policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My friend was Mr. Bow, I was just behind him—there were about four of us altogether; there were not eight—I had been to pay my quarter's money to the society, and the others were clubmen who had been to the same place—I did not hear Bow use a bad expression—Redding was a little the worse for liquor—it was Reeves who snatched my watch—I said so just now—they pulled my coat open and pulled a button off—I put my hand like this to save my face; I had so many hitting me, first on one side and then the other—some of them tried to snatch at my chain; they were all associates, I believe, and Reeves tried to snatch it a second time—my intention was to tell the Magistrate so—Bow did not appear the next morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have no doubt that Reeves snatched at my chain—I saw Redding in the crowd, but I do not know that she touched me.</p>

               <p>strike Mr. Bow, and then Reeves struck him—Pearman got hold of Bow's arm, and then Reeves attacked him, and several of the prisoners' friends came up and tried to knock his hat over his eyes, and knocked him against the shutters—a constable came, and Redding got hold of him by the back of his neck and tried to pull him down.</p>

I am a farrier, of 20, Richmond Street, St. Luke's—I was with Watts and Pearman—Redding came up and struck me on my face; I took no notice, and she struck me again—I turned round, and Reeves struck me—Pearman then came up and they struck him—two men after<lb></lb>wards struck me, but I do not know who they were.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I say ten or twelve of the prisoners' associates, because they were men of the same class, and they all took their part—I was not told that some one had said something filthy to the woman and that she struck him—the men did not say a word to me, they only shoved me about and tried to get Reeves from me.</p>

             was by the side of him. I saw Waters; but he ran to the gentleman that was with me. I saw him plainly, at the same time when Mouldy Cloak stopped me. He said, Blast your bloody eyes, you bloody thief! your watch, your money! your money, your watch! I said, I should not be robbed, and I laid hold of him: I wanted to push him down, but could not. I wanted to get one of his buttons off, but could not. White said, D - n your eyes and limbs, let his guts out; for I know him. He had a rusty cutlass, with a brass guard.

             all my fingers so, that I dropped my stick. They thought it was a tuck stick, and bid me drop it; but it was only a fishing-rod. Then they took my money out of my pocket, and were about my watch. My friend called to me; and then this man left me, and ran to my friend. He was engaged with Waters. I went back to my friend. Cloak told me not to look back; if I did, he would blow my brains out. I kept looking at him, and he drawed his hat over his eyes; but I kept stedfastly looking at him. I am sorry to say that I went to school with White. I begged them not to murder my friend, but consider his family. They were blasting and swearing, What do you hesitate for? Blast him, cut his throat; blast him, cut his head off.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120015"></xptr>How long is it ago since you went to school with White? - About twenty four years ago; but I have seen him since; and he knows me well. I begged of them to let me have my fishing rod; for they saw it lie upon the ground with my friend's hat. Waters picked it up, and brought it to me. I looked at him again, that I might be sure of the man. He said, Blast your bloody eyes, if you look back, I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>You said they had a cutlass? - I think they had one, and a pistol too. The cutlass I am clear in. They then ran away, blasting their eyes and limbs, and said, Why did they not rip my guts out?</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - Nine o'clock, I suppose; not three minutes under or over.</p>
               <p>Was there light enough to distinguish them? - Plenty of light to distinguish them very well; I was very particular in making my remarks on them.</p>
               <p>White. My Lord, it was a very dark night.</p>
               <p>How long might they stay with you? - I believe near three minutes.</p>
               <p>The others you never knew before? - No; but I was very particular in observing them. We went to the Thatched-House, got pistols and cutlasses, and went back to take them; but could not find them. Then we carried back the arms, and went to Bridewell, and gave information of them. We searched till three in the morning, but could not find them: I went home at three. I got up at six, and went to the bottom of Chick-Lane: the constable and I waited there till ten o'clock, but saw nothing of them. They told me there was to be a sight at Mile-End, and I should be sure to find them there. I repaired there, and sat in the lobby of the Turnpike for some hours, till I saw them all come by. I saw them coming a good way before the turnpike, which was in the afternoon of the next day, at White-Chapel Turnpike. Cloak and White were in a little chaise-cart, and I saw Phillips and Waters. Waters was in a chaise along with two women. I know them to be the people, except Phillips: I could not swear to him; but he was very like the person that accosted us at the Turnpike; therefore we took him up upon suspicion. When I saw them there, I was sure they were the people who met with me, that they were the men. I took a coach, and told the coachman to follow that chaise-cart till we ordered him to stop. They went through White Chapel, down Houndsditch, into Long-Lane: there was a little stoppage there. We got out of the coach, and took them out of the chaise and the cart.</p>
               <p>Are you now positive to the other prisoners? - I am, and do think Phillips was the other; but cannot swear to him. When they were taken into the public-house, before I went to the justice, Phillips said, If he was hanged for that robbery, somebody else should suffer. He was the only man that I could not swear to.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You are a glazier? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A master or journeyman? - I have been in business eleven years, and have served all Ward and Parish Offices.</p>
               <p>When was this man taken up? - The next day.</p>
               <p>Committed for further examination? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They were examined and sent afterwards to Bow-Street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And then, the day they were fully committed, you swore to them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had not positively sworn to them before? - No; I told the justice I would swear to them, but I wished rather that they should be prosecuted by somebody else.</p>
               <p>You never told any body that either of them was your school-fellow before that? - Yes, from the first minute; that made me tender. I told the Justice at first I knew them, and would swear to them; but that one having been my school-fellow, I wished to have them examined again; and in the mean time advert sed, that some other persons might appear against them rather than I should.</p>

             we came through the Turnpike, therestood a very tall, strait, decent young fellow: he said, Gentlemen, I wish you may not be robbed, or you will be robbed, I am not confident which. I immediately smiled to my companion, and said, I have nothing to lose; are you afraid? He said, No. The man said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120016"></xptr> But we will give them the double. I had not the presence of mind to ask him which way he was going, or to ask him for his company; but he went towards Kingstand. I saw no more; but when we had got about an hundred yards, a man caught me by the collar and wrist, and swore, D - n your bloody eyes, I have you now. I said, Have what? He said, Your money directly, or I will blow your brains out. I told him, That he might easily have, for I had none, or very little, besides some change from what I had paid my reckoning with.</p>
               <p>Had he any weapon? - I cannot tell what he had in his hand; I was too much terrified. He said, Give it me directly. I did not give it him immediately. He said, D - n your eyes, if you hesitate another minute, I will cut your head off. I called out Whiskin two or three times; he strived to stop my mouth.</p>
               <p>Who was it that laid hold of you? - I am not positive. I turned my head round to resist as well as I could; and the little chap, which I verily believe to be that Waters, came and stooped under me, and said, D - n you, what do you hesitate about? cut his guts out; and immediately pulled his hat so, that I could see no more of his face. I believe that to be Waters from his stature; it was a little black fellow, but I cannot be positive to him. He immediately turned my breeches pocket inside out; there was nothing but half-pence in it. He pulled my watch out likewise. I held my watch with my left hand, and tried to get it into my pocket; but they got it away from me. Then they said, Go along. When they had got my watch, and had joined company, one of the three villains, I do not know which, said, They had done him. Said one, You should have cut his guts out; for I know him well. I had known White well for years.</p>
               <p>You don't speak positive to either of them? - No.</p>
               <p>But rather believe it was Waters that came to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it a light night? - I observed it was a very pleasant fine evening as we walked from Enfield together.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to distinguish people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>How came it they were not fully committed the first time they went before the justice? - I believe it was a good deal owing to my timorousness: I said, if I should hear them speak some words, I should know them; but their voices differed a little.</p>
               <p>Was it owing to the timorousness of the last witness? - No; he was positive at the first time. He swore positively to them at Justice Blackborow's. He said, the first time to the Justice, that he was positive they were the party.</p>
               <p>When was the first time you heard Vezey say he knew one of them? - On the Monday they were all taken: he said, on Sunday night, before we came into Islington town, that he knew one perfectly well, but could not recollect his name, and that he could pick him out of two hundred persons.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On the 26th of last month, at about half past ten in the evening, the prisoner and Mr. Rimmington came to me, and gave information that they had been robbed, and desired to know whether we could get somebody else to assist to go in search of the parties. I went to Kipping and Redgrave, and we went in search after them that night, according to the descriptions that he gave of them. We could not find any thing of them. We went the next morning to the sign of the Castle in Field-Lane: there we staid watching and looking to see somebody come from Chick-Lane, from the habitation where some of them lodge; but not seeing them there, we heard there was to be a sight at Mile-End: we proceeded from thence in the afternoon to this sight: we went to Mile-End. Mr. Kipping, Mr. Redgrave, and I, went into the Gun, and the prisoner went to the Turnpike-gate, and he said he should be certain he should know the men in case he saw them We never were with him from the time he went to the gate till he came and told us, that those men that were in that chaise and in that cart were the people who had robbed him. We immediately took a coach, and pursued them from thence to Long-Lane: there we took them. He said, from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120017"></xptr> the first, that they were the men that robbed him.</p>
               <p>Did he describe the men to you? - Yes, as near as possible.</p>
               <p>And when you took these people, did they answer that description? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he describe their dress? - He said they were dressed in brown cloaths, as he thought. W hite had a brown coat on; Mouldy Cloak has now the same coat on he had then; and Waters likewise, the shortest, he said, particularly, had a mark upon his buttons.</p>
               <p>Had he that mark on his buttons? - I believe the mark is now upon his buttons; that is Waters; it is something like a stag, or a bird, I will not be positive which. He told me this before they were taken.</p>

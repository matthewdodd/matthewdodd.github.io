                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Jones, an attorney. In May, 1856, I took a house at the corner of Finsbury-square—I entered into an agreement with Dr. Winn; it was in writing—I was to live in the house, and he was to have two rooms on the ground floor, one back bed room on the second floor, and a small room in the basement—he was to carry on his profession there as a physician, but his family was not to reside there—the bed room that he occupied was on the same floor as my bed room—previous to 29th Sept. there had been a great many disputes between us—Tinley is his servant, and lives in the house—on 29th Dec., at near a quarter to 12 o'clock at night, I was going up to my bed room—I had reached the landing of my bed room, and was about a foot or eighteen inches in my room; the door was open, and I was just in the act of entering—I had a wrapper hanging on my left arm, and my hat and a chamber candlestick, with a lighted candle, in my right hand—when I was about twelve or eighteen inches in my room, Dr. Winn ran after me, and struck me twice or thrice on the back of the neck—that was whilst my back was towards him—they were violent blows, struck with the fist—he then caught hold of me by the stock and shirt, and pulled me round, and kept beating me about the shoulders and head—at the time he struck me,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020035"></xptr>
               <p>I dropped all that I had on my arms; there was a gas light over my bed room door—at this time my wife was on the next flight of stairs—my daughters were also on the stairs, going up with my wife to see the younger children—when he dragged me round, he caught hold of me by the back of the hair; I struck up, and tried to get away from him; he held me by the back of the hair, and held my head down, and called out, "Tinley, Tinley!"—Tinley replied, "I am coming, I will give him a <hi rend="italic">pill</hi>, I will give him a <hi rend="italic">pill</hi>"—he said it twice—Tinley came and struck me with something on the head three or four times, such as I never felt in my life before—I said, "My God, Sarah, they are murdering me; they have either got a life preserver or some deadly weapon, for it is not the hand of a man that I have been struck with"—the blows stunned me, and an immense quantity of blood began to flow; I was saturated with blood in a few minutes—I lost my senses for some time, not very long; I found myself in the middle of the bed room a minute or two after—I was taken in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Mr. Jenkins, my medical man; he lives in Great Prescott—street, and has attended my family ten or twelve years—I had my wounds dressed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>.) <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> My friend Serjeant Ballantine said that you had been convicted some years ago? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, fourteen years ago; it was for conspiracy to defraud—the sentence was eighteen calendar months, from which I subsequently received a free pardon—I did not serve more than a year—after that I received Her Majesty's free pardon; I have not got it; it was shown to me when I was discharged, but not given to me—I swear that—if I am not mistaken, it had the signature of Her Majesty to it, but I am not sure of it, it is so many years ago—it was shown to me by the Governor, Captain Groves—I never saw Her Majesty write, but it was a signature I believe to be hers—I occupy as tenant under Dr. Winn; I believe Dr. Winn has a lease of the house for thirteen years—there has been some discussion about it—there has been no anxiety on my part, not the least—I wanted to purchase his lease when I first entered the house, but when he said he did not want to dispose of it I gave up all idea of it—I never ordered my family to do anything in order to drive Dr. Winn out of the house; I have expended too much money upon the house to make things uncomfortable; I have never given any directions to my family or my servants to do everything to drive Dr. Winn out of the house; I did not do so up to Christmas Day last, or three or four days before this matter occurred; I have been very unhappy in the house, in consequence of his not paying his rent, and my goods being liable to be distrained—I paid 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; the whole rent is about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid my rent—my father's name was Mark Benjamin, my name is Mark Benjamin Benham; I will swear that; I was married in that name nineteen years ago, by the late Dr. Herschell—I am thirty-nine years of age—up to the age of about fifteen I went by the name of Mark Benjamin; I then adopted the name of Benham—I have never been bankrupt—I was insolvent years ago; I took the benefit of the Act for 5, 084<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I have got a release in my pocket for 5, 050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I have paid my creditors; there is 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now outstanding, and allow me to explain why I cannot pay that, because I cannot find the persons, and it is my intention to pay the money into court, and obtain a re-vesting order—it has cost me about 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get released—I was remanded for six months, under the 76th section, what is called a discretionary clause; it was not for any fraud; the Commissioner said I had been living at too expensive a rate, but my detaining creditor sent my discharge two or three days after I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020036"></xptr>
               <p>remanded; it may have been fourteen days, it was a short period after, I will swear it was within a month—I was but twenty-two years of age then—I owed 5, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I carried on the business of an army and navy tailor at Greenwich.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever used any abusive language to Dr. Winn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None, to my knowledge—on the night in question Dr. Winn was in his bed room as I passed the door—I do not recollect ever having called him a swindler—I will not swear I did not, but I have no recollection of having used any such words—I may have said that he was a swindler as I was passing his door, but I have no recollection of having said it—I will not swear that I did not say it, for I had been that day to the Comptroller's office, and found that a distress was about to come in for three quarters rent—I may, as I passed the door, have called him a swindler—there was nobody in the house but my family, and Dr. Winn and Tinley—I had never called him a swindler before to my knowledge—I do not know that I have—I think I may safely swear it—I do not think I have, I will not swear it; but I do not believe that I have—I have not repeatedly called him a swindler—I do not recollect having called him a swindler at all, but I was much annoyed when I found that my things were likely to go away for rent which I had paid—I will swear that I have not repeatedly called him so—I do not remember ever having called him so; I may have said so, but not often certainly, for I had not spoken to him for a month before this happened—I have not repeatedly said to other persons that he was a swindler—I may have said that he got up two bubble companies, or was a party to them; he told me so himself of one, the Caxton—he did not use the word "bubble," but he talked of it to me—I have not told his patients when they came to the door that he was a swindler—Dr. Conquest lives next door; I do not know him particularly; I knew him by sight before this matter, as I might know any gentleman of the bar, but never to speak to him—I have never been to his house except ten years ago, when I went to consult him; never since I have been at Dr. Winn's;—my family are not on visiting terms with him—Dr. Conquest has called upon me once or twice at Mr. Jones's office since this affair; he is practising next door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether Dr. Winn purchased the practice from Dr. Conquest? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not present, but I have heard very different—I will swear that Dr. Winn has told me himself, that he did not purchase it of him; he bought his furniture of him and fixtures—Dr. Conquest formerly lived in that house—I swear solemnly that I had not had several interviews with Dr. Conquest before this matter occurred; I am not on intimate terms with Dr. Conquest—I never prevented Dr. Winn from coming home, or barred the outer door; he had a key in his pocket—I did not when he came home late one night in Nov., call out to him from the top of the stairs that he had been out to pawn his trowsers, or his coat, or anything—I might have said he had been to a pawnbroker's—I do not think I called out anything else—I was in bed when he rang at the bell—I got out of bed—I believe I called out to him from the top of the stairs, that he had been to a pawnbroker's—I do not believe I said he was a swindler—I will not swear it, but I do not believe I did—I have not directed my children to make noises over Dr. Winn's head, I will swear that—Dr. Winn has not complained of their making noises, and disturbing him; that was what I complained of to him—he lives down stairs—I have not told my children to make noises above his head to annoy him—to my knowledge they have not repeatedly done so—I am managing clerk to Mr. William Jones, a solicitor—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020037"></xptr>
               <p>am also a discounter, and have been so seven or eight years—on the night in question, Dr. Winn came out of his bed room in his shirt, trowsers, and boots—I mean to represent that I have told the truth in all that I have stated about his holding me, and that he overpowered me—he had not any weapon in his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, as Dr. Winn came out of his room, turn round and deli<lb></lb>berately strike him a blow on the eye? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I could not have done so—I did not—he ran down stairs when he heard my family cry "Murder!" and he heard the police breaking in, and I am told that he said to the police<lb></lb>man that he would charge me—what he said was, "I will charge him"—they both ran away after they had assaulted me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he cried out to his servant, "Tilney! Tilney!" were you not holding him on the ground and strangling him, or attempting to do so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my solemn oath he was standing as upright as I am now, and he was hold<lb></lb>ing me down by the back of my hair—I represent that solemnly—Dr. Winn had a black eye, but he has always discolored eyes, you must understand; I do not mean it offensively—(Dr. <hi rend="italic">Winn, who wore coloured spectacles, was here requested to remove them</hi>)—I do not mean that his eyes were only like that; his left eye was black—I saw that next morning at the police court, I can explain how it happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We may as well know? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No doubt I struck up in order to get away from him, and I must have struck him in the eye—I have no doubt at all of it—the conviction for conspiracy took place more than fourteen years ago—it was a prosecution by my stepfather, mother, and sister; I have never spoken to them since—I brought the facts to the attention of the Crown, and received a free pardon—I had an uncle named Benham; he carried on business in Jermyn-street, St. James's—I did not carry on that business after him; he died before I went to Greenwich—after the remand in the Insolvent Court, the peti<lb></lb>tioning creditor withdrew his opposition, and discharged me, and since that time I have paid l, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and obtained a release from all my creditors—when I went up stairs on the night in question, Dr. Winn was in his room—I did not see him as I passed—his bed room is on the same flight as mine—I believe his door was shut—my last quarter's rent was due on Christmas day; this occurred on the 29th Dec.; I had paid my rent on the morning of the 26th—Dr. Winn holds a lease from the City of London—I have a good deal of furniture and seizable property in the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is this about the pawnbroker and the breeches? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have repeatedly applied to Dr. Winn after 12 o'clock to allow' the street door to be fastened by the bolts, for I do not deem it safe to go to bed leaving it on the mere latch; he has refused time after time to allow it—one night, I did not know that he was out, we went to bed soon after 12 o'clock, and by the merest accident we bolted the door; when he came home he rang the bell violently; I was in bed at the time, it caused me to jump out of bed, my servants, and my little babes; I desired my son to run down stairs, and he opened the door; but Dr. Winn had broken the bell before he could arrive—I was angry, because I thought it was a fire—it was on that occasion that I said something about the pawnbroker's—we were all dreadfully excited; we thought the house was on fire, in consequence of the violent ringing—it was a very large night bell, and he rang it incessantly for several minutes until it broke.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has there ever been a distress for rent in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but I believe there have been other things in—I will not</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. On the night this assault occurred upon my husband, I was going upstairs to bed with him—I was behind him—my two daughters and my son were also going up with us—we were all behind my husband—we were going up the nursery stairs—we passed Dr. Winn's bed room door—it was closed—I was at that time behind my husband—my son sleeps up stairs—he is sixteen years old—my daughters sleep in the next room to mine, on the same floor—my husband was going into his room as we were going up the nursery stairs to see the younger children—I was close behind my husband at the time he passed Dr. Winn's door—he did not use the word "swindler," or anything of that sort; I never heard him utter a word—as I was going up the nursery stairs, I heard the doctor open his door, and he rushed out, and fairly jumped upon my husband's back—he struck him several blows on the back of his neck; and with that, my husband let the articles fall that he had in his hands—Dr. Winn then pulled him round, and struck him in front, and in dragging him round, he tore the wristband of his shirt off, and threw it on the ground—by some means he caught hold of the back of his neck, and my husband hit him up in this manner to beat him off—the doctor then called out, "Tinley, Tinley, come and help me fight this man!"—Tinley immediately answered, "I am coming, I will give him a <hi rend="italic">pill</hi>;" and I saw him come up the stairs—I saw something shine, I thought he had a gun in his hand—when he came up to my husband, the doctor had my husband's head down in this position, by the back of his head, holding his head back—Tinley came up, and struck him immediately two or three times on the back of his head, and I then perceived that it was a poker—my husband called out to me to come immediately—I did not call out, I ran away to cry for assistance—I did not see my husband again until he came down into the hall—during the whole of this proceeding, neither my husband nor Dr. Winn were on the ground—when I saw him in the hall the police had come in—he was then bleeding dreadfully; his face and neck were covered with blood—he was taken off in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the police station, and afterwards to Mr. Jenkins—he was in a dreadful state when he came back—I could scarcely keep life in him, he was swooning continually—I wanted to per<lb></lb>suade him to lie down, but he would not; I was obliged to bathe his hands and face with vinegar—that lasted till we went to the police court—two or three days before this, Dr. Winn put his fist in my face, and called me a very improper word, and said, "I know something of your husband, and I will do for him"—he called me a common prostitute.</p>

On the night of 29th Dec, I was going up to bed at the same time as my father and mother—when we got on the floor of the bedrooms, my father was behind me—I sleep on the third floor; as I was going up, Dr. Winn rushed upon my father without any provocation whatever; he took hold of him sideways, in the front, took hold of him by the back of the head, and drew him down in that manner, and held him down for a time, and called Tinley; he drew him out of his room, he was about two or three feet in his room—Tinley came; as he wag coming up, he said, "I am coming, I will give him a <hi rend="italic">pill</hi>"—he repeated those words twice; he came up with some weapon and struck my father on the head, and blood flowed; I could not tell exactly what he had in his hand—I directly ran to mamma's bedroom, smashed a couple <hi rend="italic">of</hi> windows, and made an alarm; I called out, "Police!"—the police came; but before that I asked mamma for the rattle, and went into my sister's room and sprang it—on the afternoon of that day, I was in the library with young Somellera, and my two sisters; I was getting up a few sentences of poetry with master Somellera, and rose from my seat to recite them, when Dr. Winn, and his servant, Tinley, suddenly rushed up and opened the door—Dr. Winn told Tinley to come in, and made use of a bad expression, and said, "Take hold of the young vagabond by the throat; they are making a noise, and I will not allow a parcel of strangers in my house"—Tinley came and took hold of me by the throat—my sisters went down and told papa that Dr. Winn and Tinley were fighting me, and papa came up; Dr. Winn asked him to fight, and papa replied, "I am not a fighting man"—as they were going down stairs I heard Tinley say, "You shall suffer before the night is out," that meant my <hi rend="italic">pa</hi>, because it was said to him—Dr. Winn replied, "Yes, he shall."</p>

               <p>Winn did not strike him, he went and put his fist in his face, in a menacing way; this was about 9 o'clock in the evening—Joseph Somellera and my sisters were present—I mentioned this at Worship-street police court—Dr. Winn was complaining of our making a noise over his head—young Somel<lb></lb>lera is a Mexican boy, a companion of mine, living with Mrs. Bedal, in the next house—Dr. Winn complained of a noise going on, he did not say who made it; we were not stamping on the floor, and kicking up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I have not often done so, never—I do not say we were quite quiet, because a ruler happened to fall off the table, and it made a noise on the floor; it did not fall more than once, I am quite sure of that; my sisters and Somellera were sitting down, and I was standing up, reciting the few sentences that I had written—I was not kicking my feet on the floor, and knocking on the floor with the ruler, for the purpose of annoying Dr. Winn; I have never been told to do so—Dr. Winn has not repeatedly complained to me of making a noise, not over head, nor on the same floor, never—he has complained two or three times of my making a noise and annoying him—I have not done so, never on purpose—I do not know a Dr. Godfrey, a friend of Dr. Winn's—I never said to any friend of Dr. Winn's that he was a swindler, never in my life, or to any one—I am sixteen years old—I live at home—I go to school—I know a coachman of the name of Philip, I do not know that his name is Wall—I have never heard Dr. Winn complain of my putting dirty things in the passage at the time his patients were coming; he has never complained to me—I have not done it, I never put a slop pail there, or a pail out of the yard, or littered the old chairs about the passage—he has complained of it to my <hi rend="italic">pa</hi>, only once—I was sitting on a chair, but making no noise; <hi rend="italic">pa</hi> was in the room, in the parlour opposite—I never said to Philip, the coachman, that my <hi rend="italic">pa</hi> was determined to get Dr. Winn out of the house—I never said that we meant to turn him out, and ruin his practice—I never said to Tinley, in my elder brother's presence, that my <hi rend="italic">pa</hi> was deter<lb></lb>mined to get the lease of the house, and that he had better leave Dr. Winn's employment—I never said to Tinley, "Papa, when he is tipsy, is very vio<lb></lb>lent, and he is twice as strong as Dr. Winn"—I will swear that, never any<lb></lb>thing of the sort—I deny saying so at any time—I never told Tinley it would be better for him to leave Dr. Winn's service, and that my father was a richer man than Dr. Winn; I will swear that I never said such a thing—I have never called Dr. Winn a swindler—I have never said so to the little Mexican boy, nor have my sisters—I never said to Dr. Godfrey, or any gentle<lb></lb>man, when I opened the door to him, "I suppose you are one of his <hi rend="italic">pals</hi>, and want your supper."</p>

On 29th Dec. I was in the library with Albert Benham and his sister, when the two prisoners came up; I was not making a noise—as they went down stairs I heard Tinley say, "You shall suffer before the night is out," and Dr. Winn replied, "Yes, you shall."</p>

I thought I saw the prisoner's face looking at the window; a lady coming in at the interim, I shewed her into the parlour, and staid with the lady about two minutes and a half; I heard something in the shop, I observed the prisoner standing in the shop; I came instantly in the shop. I asked him very rough what he wanted there; he making no reply I asked him a second time; he said some shoe strings; I shewed him some shoe strings; he gave me a shilling in my hand; I supposed the shilling to be bad, I held it in my hand and looked at the prisoner and he at me; he appeared confused at the time; he suddenly took up the shilling and ran out; I came round the counter, I missed two handkerchiefs that lay in the window; I went to the shop door, I did not see any thing of him; a lad told me he saw him put the handkerchief in his pocket. I am certain he is the person, he has been in my shop several times.</p>

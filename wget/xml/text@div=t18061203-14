               <p>Q. Do you remember the hue and cry of stop thief on the 20th of November last. - A. No. I had just come out of the bakehouse with a tin of biscuits. I saw the prisoner at the bar run by the window; him and Mr. England seemed to be in a tussle with each other, he had an apron on, I observed the candlesticks under his apron. Judging what might be the case I ran out to Mr. England's assistance, I collared him at the next door and took the candlesticks out of his hand; he made no resistance, I took him by the collar and delivered both him and the candlesticks to Mr. Robey.</p>
               <p>- ROBEY. You are a constable, I believe, at the Colonade. - A. Yes, I heard some people running by, halloaing out stop thief, I ran out and I met Mr. Randell with these candlesticks in one hand, and the prisoner in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. You of course took the prisoner in charge and you have had these candlesticks ever since. - A. I have; I produce them.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Foley look at these candlesticks, do they belong to your husband. - A. Yes, I am quite sure they do, they have his coat of arms upon them.</p>

               <p>Q. They are not silver candlesticks. - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you in truth say they are not worth more. A. What is the lowest I may put them at.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they cost your husband. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. They are large silver candlesticks, they may be worth ten pounds. - A. I will say five pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. However one may be disposed to favour him, it is impossible to say they are worth less than forty shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leather-case maker, and live in King-street, Covent-garden. The prisoner was my journeyman, and worked in my shop—on Thursday, the 4th of February, I gave directions to the prisoner to put some plates into some cases, two of which contained these brushes—I went out immediately after on business—when I came home, I sent for the cases to my counting-house—when brought to me I found no brushes in any I called Leech, and said, "Where are they?"—he opened a drawer, and gave me one set I said, "There were others in the other case"—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183602010205"></xptr>
               <p>said, "There was not"—I sent him in the warehouse to see if the other cases were right—he came back and said they were—I sent for a policeman, and found four brushes, which are my property, in his great-coat pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you open the cases to see if there were any brushes to both cases or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I knew by the weight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I cannot say how they got into my pocket—my coat hung on 1 peg, and I am out several times in the day, and there is nothing going on but larking among them. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I had missed property some time, and had tole my clerk to take particular notice to find it out—the prisoner worked for me nearly twenty years ago, for a year or two—I have lost sight of him for a number of years—he said he did not put the brushes into his coat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the prosecutor. On the early part of Thursday the brushes were taken out of the case by somebody—I immediately looked into the drawers adjoining to where the prisoner works, and found these four brushes, with four others, placed at the back of the drawer—no one else sits there—it was between three and four o'clock—about five o'clock, when he went to tea, I went to see if the brushes were in the name place, and found that four of them were removed into a drawer, to be put into the case, were put into a third drawer, under some carpet—the prisoner went out after that, about seven o'clock—I then went to the drawer, and found one set of brushes was gone—I communicated it to my employer—other persons had an opportunity of going to the drawers besides the prisoner, but we were never in the habit of putting brushes into them—he never went out of the shop, to go out of the house, without his great coat on—they must have been put in between five and seven o'clock—at the time I suppose the brushes were put there, I looked under his board, and found these three pieces of leather, and having a red-ink pen in my hand. I marked them—these three pieces were found on the prisoner, when he was taken to the station-house.</p>

            . I am collector at the turnpike at Highgate. On the 28th of August last one Mr. Brown a quaker, from Luton, in Bedfordshire, rode up to me, and said, I beg you'll shut the gate, for this man coming with horses, I suspect has stolen them, for there was another man along with him, and he is run away, his name is Clemonts, and there were 5 guineas offered for the apprehending him from the town of Luton, the prisoner came up soon with the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Pickford. It was before five o'clock in the morning; the prisoner had got a grey mare, a black and brown gelding.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the geldings?</p>
               <p>Pickford. The black one has no white about him, he is a little hollow in the back, with slouch ears; the brown one has a star in his face; the man was upon the mare, and they were tyed together with pieces of cart-rope. The prisoner wanted to go through; we stopped him, and told him he must not go any farther. for we suspected the horses to be stolen; he said, he knew nothing of the man that we told him ran away, but said he was coming down Barnet-hill, and that man was coming with the horses; he asked the man to let him ride as far as Hygate; we said, it was very particular for the man to let him ride on the saddle, and the owner to ride on the bare back.</p>

Mr. Brown gave me a shilling for people to drink for keeping them till the people got up at the Gatehouse. After which I sent for the constable and secured the prisoner.

            . I am constable. On the 28th of August, a little after 5 in the morning, a man came and knocked at my door, and said, there was a man and some horses stopp'd at the Gatehouse supposed to be stolen : I got up and went there; the last evidence charged me with a mare and two horses; I ordered the Ostler to take care of the stable; then I was shewn the prisoner, and charg'd with him, whom I took down to my house, and sent word to Justice Cross that I had got a man for horse stealing; he sent word for me to bring the man to him, I did, and he examined him, and he was committed to New prison. The prisoner said before the Justice, as he was coming from Barnet, he overtook a man with these 3 horses, and desired the man to let him ride, and he let him ride upon his hackney; I said he was a good-natur'd man to let you ride upon the saddle, and he on the bare back; he said he could not ride on the bare back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was at work in Old-street ever since the Sunday before Whitsontide, my mate was taken ill, and could not work, and I went into the country to see for a mate to come to work with me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175409110030"></xptr> coming along down Barnet hill I met a man with these horses, I asked him to give me a cast to London; he said, Yes, I should ride if I would give him some beer. I called for a pint of beer at the Mermaid and changed 6 d. He went down the hill before me; there I overtook him. He asked me which I would ride, and was going to help me up on one. The horse tossed up his leg, so that I dared not get upon him. Then he said, if you please you shall get upon my little nag, and I'll ride him. I got upon his nag, and he on the other horse, and before we got to Highgate he said he wanted to ease himself, and gave me the lead horse in my hand. There were three gentlemen coming down the hill; he said he did not chuse to turn himself up in the road till they were gone by. Then he was going to let his breeches down, but started and made a move to go away. The gentlemen followed him, and he went in at a little hunting gate upon the right hand coming from Barnet. I stood to see what was the matter, a man said to me, Young man I'd have you take these horses up to the turn-pike and deliver them there, for I suspect they are stolen. I took them to the turnpike and stopped; but before I came there a man went to the turnpike, and ordered the man to take care of these horses, and he had as good also stop me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pickford. Tell particularly what the prisoner said when he came up to the gate?</p>
               <p>Pickford. He said he knew nothing of the man or the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he want to go through?</p>
               <p>Pickford. He did, and when I was for stopping him, he said, What is the meaning of it, we paid at the other gate? He said but very little for himself.</p>

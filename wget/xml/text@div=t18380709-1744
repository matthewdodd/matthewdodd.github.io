                  <hi rend="italic">prisoner's Defence</hi>. I am a foreigner, and have no counsel—I hope you will do the same to me, my Lord, as if you were my counsel—I am only imperfectly acquainted with the English language, and hope I shall have your indulgence—as far as regards the forgery, I have to say, about five months ago I left England with a friend, a member of Pembroke College, Cambridge, named Colonel Bartlett—I could not return to my native coun<lb></lb>try because I was privately implicated in the Polish revolution—on this account my friend told me to take the name of Dr. Stern, a friend of his—I came to Aix-la-Chapelle, where Bartlett informed me he should re<lb></lb>main a few days to see a friend—I went on towards Cologne, but Bartlett told me, if I got to Cologne, I might inquire at Schaaffhausen's whether my thing was sent for a person called Dr. Stern—I told him I would do so, and I wrote to know the particulars, as I travelled in the name of Dr. Stern—I received the note in answer, that nothing had been sent for Dr. Stern, and I sent the letter to my friend—I left Cologne, and came to a town in Hanover, named Osnaburg—I there met Bartlett again by ap<lb></lb>pointment—he asked me whether I could lend him some money—I said yes, and lent him some, requesting him to give me security—he told me he had a letter of introduction from Schaaffhausen, of Cologne, to Messrs Rothschild, which belonged to his friend Dr. Stern, and I might take that for secu<lb></lb>rity; that the sum of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was mentioned in it, and I might deliver it in his friend's name, and receive the amount—I went with him to Hamburgh, and came over to London—after being about ten days in London I went to Rothschild's, and delivered the letter of introduction—in a few minutes Mr. Kirchner came and informed me that Mr. Rothschild could not see ne then, but would be glad to see me next morning—he addressed me in the German language, and asked if I would have a little money now—I said no, I would call again—I called about three or our days after deli<lb></lb>vering the letter, and wished 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was paid me—Mr. Kirchner asked if I would have all—I said not at present, but I would call again—I gave a receipt, which had been given to me by Bartlett—about eight days after Irecdved the first 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I again went, and received the other 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave the second receipt which had been given to me by him—I then told Mr. Kirchner I expected a letter from Germany, and in case It should arrive, he would be kind enough to let me know—about eight days after receiv<lb></lb>ing the money, the letter was sent—I went to Rothschild's, but the letter did not state what sum I was bound to receive, but it said, by producing the letter I should be paid—on coming into Rothschild's office, Mr. Kirch<lb></lb>ner asked if I had brought the letter which had been sent to me—I took it out of my pocket—he took it out of my hands, and left me alone in his office, and a few minutes after, Forrester came and took me into custody—About six months ago, when I came to London, the witness Bell visited me, and took tea with me, and after tea he asked me if I felt inclined to go to the theatre—I said I had no objection—he told me he had money with him, and if I would be kind enough to take care of it till the morn<lb></lb>ing—I said yes, and he gave 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into my care—he and I went to a tavern—Bell did not return next morning for his 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in the after<lb></lb>noon I was obliged to go out, and being in want of money I took 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it—I afterwards met my friend, and he asked me for some money—I told him I had money of Mr. Bell's—he persuaded me to let him have some; as he would write to Cambridge, and in a few days he should be able to re<lb></lb>turn it—on the 3rd of June I went to Greenwich, and met Mr. Bell, who</p>

               <p>said he was obliged to give me into custody—we went bock to London, and on the road he said if I could make a settlement with him he would not give me into custody, but in case I did not, he would put me into custody—Bell said I had told him I had to receive money from Germany, but I think he must be mistaken in that—I said I had to receive some money but did not mention any amount to him.</p>

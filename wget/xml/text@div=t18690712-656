On 16th June, about 12 o'clock, I saw the prisoners in Fore Street, Cripplegate, and saw them go in and out of several warehouses—detective Fawke was with me—we followed them to Friday Street—Holmes went into No. 8—Harris waited outside—Holmes came out, spoke to Harris, went in again, and brought out this piece of cloth, without paper—I caught hold of him, but he got away—I went next morning to 2, Batter's Court, Bunhill Row, and found Harris in bed with a young woman—I told him I was a constable, and should take him for stealing a piece of luster in Friday Street, on the 15th—he said, "All right, sir"—I took him to the station—I am sure he is the man who was with Holmes.</p>

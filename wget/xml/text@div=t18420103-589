                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the police force in Wiltshire. I know the prisoner Spragg—he lives at Trowbridge. On Monday, the 6th of December I went to the George Inn, Trowbridge, and on Tuesday the landlord brought me a bag addressed to "Robert Spragg, slater, Trow<lb></lb>bridge"—Spragg is a slater—on the 12th I went to Spragg's house, and found the bag with the articles which have been produced in it—I went to the post-office, and saw a letter directed to "J. Spillman, at Mr. Wade's, draper, Deptford, Kent"—when I went to Spragg's, on the 12th, I asked him</p>

               <p>if he had any lodgers—he said, "No"—I asked if he had any goods in his possession more than he had come by in an honest way—he said, "No"—I asked if he had not received a parcel that morning—he said he had—I asked where from or who from—he said from his sister, in Lon<lb></lb>don—I asked where she lived—he said, "In Fore-street, London," that she was living independent, and she often sent him a parcel—I asked what—he said, "Clothes, generally"—he referred to the coat he had on, and said, "She sent me this"—I asked him where the bag was—he hesitated, and then said it was in the pantry—I looked into the pantry, and there I found this bag, which was the same I had seen before—I opened it, and pulled out these things—he said, "That can't be for me, I know nothing of it"—the bag was not sealed—Spillman is related to a man named Adams.</p>

My dear Fellow,—You should have written to me as I wished, the moment you sent it off. I have been waiting ever since to hear from you, and am afraid to write in case all was not well. I have received nothing, and you must inquire about it. You sent anything. I have made every inquiry to no use.

Send me a <hi rend="italic">Dispatch</hi> on Sunday if you can. I want you to let me direct to you somewhere else. Now, you mind, I tell you, and write to me as soon as you have sent, &amp;c.

I have no doubt you will trace the things, and write to me directly as I am doing nothing, and if you can, something more on Sun<lb></lb>day. It will be all better, as things are very middling just now with me I can assure you. Write without fail by return of post. Yours, &amp;c. God bless you.</p>

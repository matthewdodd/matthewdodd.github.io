                  </hi>. I am one of the proprietors of the "Medical Times." The prisoner was our clerk from Oct. 1842—he was dis<lb></lb>charged on Saturday, the 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of March this year—he had authority to re<lb></lb>ceive money on our account—it was his duty to enter the sums immediately in this book, and to account for them to Mr. Healey or myself—on the 25th of October, 1842, there is no entry in the book of 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from John Steghall, nor on any other day—he has not accounted to me for any such sum—there is no entry on the 17th of February, 1843, of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., received from James Cook, nor on any other day—he has not accounted to me for that.</p>

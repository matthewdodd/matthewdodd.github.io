A. Backhouse"), and he said "It is mine; I came from London yesterday, and I was too late to get it cashed on Saturday evening"—I said "It is rather peculiar, but if you like to go to my place of business I will go to my bankers and hear what they 8ay relative to it"—I had a call to make, and I said "You go in, I will over<lb></lb>take you at my place of business"—at Creighton Street I got into Andrews's omnibus, when who should I see sitting opposite me in the omnibus but the two prisoners—I then arrived at the London Provincial Bank, and got out, leaving the prisoners to go on—nothing passed between us in the omnibus—I then got to my shop and found the prisoners standing opposite awaiting my arrival—I went in and they followed, and I said "My bankers are not satisfied to let me draw against this, and advised me not to advance any money until I heard from them when they forwarded it on for collection"—Renouf said "Will you advance us 15?" or something like that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187910200018"></xptr>
               <p>I then gave them the cheque back, and said I should do nothing of the kind—Chaplin said "I am really very short of money; give me a couple of pounds," to which I would not assent, and I handed him the cheque in this way, which he took out of my hands, when Renouf said "Oh, you can leave it with Mr. Jacobs; it is perfectly secure," and it was left with me—I arranged for Chaplin to call on Wednesday or Thursday, when I would have a reply—I paid the warrant into my bank for collection—in conse<lb></lb>quence of what I afterwards heard I communicated with Inspector Price the next morning—the prisoners produced nothing more than that one warrant.</p>

Backhouse"—he replied "very well," and then I volunteered to write a telegram—he may have requested me to—he said "Will you advance me some money on the security of the cheques to enable me to go to London, where I shall have no difficulty in tracing the owners"—I said "No, I cannot advance money on them"—I made out the form of telegram and Renouf left—he paid me nothing—he returned to my office some hours afterwards and showed me this telegram, which he said he had received from Messrs.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector, Cardiff</hi>). On the 10th September I took Chaplin, and on the 11th Renouf was brought to the station—he gave his name as George Renouf, shipwright, 40, Maria Street—I said to him, "Chaplin is in custody upon a charge of stealing a letter containing a number of cheques from the General Post-office in London, and you will be charged with receiving the same, knowing it to be stolen"—he said, "I knew they were stolen"—he remained silent for a minute, and then said, "But he told me he had stolen them from his father. I met the young man on board a Bristol boat coming to Cardiff on Saturday afternoon. He lent me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay my fare. When we landed he came to my house on purpose for my wife to pay him the money. He had some food with us that night and Sunday, but I could not lodge him because I had not room. He went to lodge at an eating-house close by. He showed me a number of cheques, which he gave me to keep for him; sometimes he had them, and sometimes I had them. I saw him again on Monday, and we went to Mr. Jacobs to change one of the cheques. He told us he did not do business in the street, but if we wanted to do business with him we must come to his business place. We went to hid shop at the Docks and gave him one of the cheques. He said, 'I cannot advance you any money till I go and see my banker'. He went away, and we remained till he returned. He said, 'The warrant is good enough, but I cannot advance you money for two or three days; it will have to be sent away by the bankers.' We offered it for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. He had some food with me up to Tuesday, and on Tuesday morning I went to see Mr. Blosse, the solicitor; Mr. Blosse told me what to do, and I sent telegram away to Darlington. I heard from Messrs. Backhouse and Co., and I went up on Tuesday evening to Darlington. I received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my expenses and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward"—later in the afternoon I charged Chaplin, in Renoufs presence, with stealing a letter containing a number of cheques and dividend warrants from the General Post-office, London—he said, "Yes, I did take them"—I then told Renouf that he would be charged with receiving the cheques, well knowing the same to be stolen—Renouf turned round to Chaplin and said, "You know you told me you stole them from your father"—Chaplin replied, "You know well where I got them from; you thought you were going to make a good thing of it"—he said one had been changed in the Isle of Wight, but the whole of the others had been restored to their rightful owners—I afterwards, with Police-officer Shee, brought the prisoners to London—I received this dividend warrant for 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Thomas, of the London and Provincial Bank, Cardiff, on the 11th—from the time Chaplin was taken till Renouf was taken and confronted with him, they had no opportunity of speaking together.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Jennett: On Thursday the 31st of May, about six o'clock, the prisoner came up to me at the door, and asked for a bit of blue ointment spread upon some lint; he said, Mr. Jennett don't know me, I am a medical man; I reached the pot down, and he spread the plaister; he then asked to go into the parlour to dress an ulcer; I shewed him into the parlour; I did not go into the parlour; I called over a little boy; he then came out, and looked among the bottles; he wanted to make some pills of tincture of bark and calomel; he asked if I had any made, and I said, no; he said, I will call again about nine o'clock, and if Mr. Jennett is not at home, we will knock up a few pills between us, and then you will have something in your own pocket. About nine o'clock he came again, as I was going to shut up shop; he said, he was come for some pills, and he wanted a small blister spread; he cut a piece of leather, and I was going to spread it with my thumb; he told me, if I would go round the corner into Church-street, and heat the patler, he would give me a shilling; I went, and when I came back, I saw him go out with my master's great coat on; I ran across the way, and caught hold of him, and said, you have got a coat that does not belong to you; he gave me the coat, and wanted to go away; he said, you have got the coat, what do you want more? I said, he must come back with me; he got away from me, and I caught him again; he then said, he would give me half a guinea if I would let him go; I got assistance, and he was secured.(John Alcock, a constable, produced the great coat, which was identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

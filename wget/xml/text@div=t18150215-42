I counted the muskets, there was but fifty-six, that is all I know; the prisoner worked for me until the tenth, and after the 10th he worked for some other man for Mr. Johnson on the same premises.</p>

            . I am inspector to the Honorable East India Company, in the military store room, Devonshire Square.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any muskets being deliver-there. A. I remember the prisoner taking one out on the 13th of January, about a quarter before one o'clock; it was taken out of Sir James Cunningham's office, he being head of that department. I was coming out of Sir James's office, I saw the prisoner with a musket in his hand; I know him perfectly well, he had a musket in his hand; being before the usual time to have the guns inspected, suspicion arose in my mind of something being uncommon. I knew he worked for Mr. Thompson, therefore I had no suspicion, only of his being too soon. The guns had not been inspected; we do not take them in as the property of the Company until they are inspected. I and my assistants inspect them for the company; until they have undergone inspection, they are the property of the makers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what he did with the musket. A. No, he took it out of the room where it was deposited; but wherever he went with it I do not know. On Saturday the 14th of January, Davis came down with some muskets on his shoulder; I do not know how many he brought, he put them down with the rest. On Tuesday or Wednesday I saw Davis, I said did you send Bird for a gun. I saw Bird when the constable had him in custody. Mr. Thompson told him he would forgive him if he would tell who he sold it to; the gun has been found, it is worth thirty shillings.</p>

            . I am almost thirteen years old, on the 13th of January, I saw the prisoner go into the military room about a quarter before one; we call it the view room, the inspection room; I had some swords on my shoulder; I went in after the prisoner; I saw him looking at Mr. Davis's guns that had been sent in for inspection. I came down, and saw him go out of the yard with a gun into Devonshire Square, where he went with it I do not know.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q, to Davis. Were all these muskets in the view room of your manufactory. - A. His and mine together, he is a journeyman under me; I am answerable for all that are missing, if any are missing I am to make it good.</p>

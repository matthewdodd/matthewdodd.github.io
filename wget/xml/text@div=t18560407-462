I was in the court on Good Friday night—I saw the prisoner come out—I did not see the chopper when first I saw him, but I saw him with it an he passed me—I saw him wield the chopper round his head, and he asked for Welch—I went after him, but before I got to him they were both on the ground together—after I got up to them, the prisoner made two attempts to strike him with the chopper—I do not know whether he did strike him—Weleh's head bled—I took away the prisoner from him—the prisoner was drunk—Welch was a little intoxicated, but not drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. George's Hospital. Welch was brought there on the Saturday—I examined his head—I found two cuts, each of them a little less than an inch, meeting in the middle—that was at the top part of the side of the head—there were two cuts in one wound, as if they were caused by one blow—the wound was not dangerous, it healed very well—I dressed his head—he came regularly every morning, from the 22nd March till 2nd April—I think this hatchet would have inflicted the wound—the back or corner of it might have done it—the front of it would have made a more dangerous wound.</p>

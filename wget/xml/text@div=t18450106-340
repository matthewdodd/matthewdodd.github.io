I got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, at Islington, which Tomlinson drove, and Harris was the waterman—when I got in I gave Harris a penny, as I supposed—I said Here is a penny for you"—my daughter-in-law, who sat in the cab, said io me, "How it glistens"—I put my hand into my pocket, where I knew I had had a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece was gone—I stopped the cab instantly, and said I had given the waterman a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—Harris denied it, and said he had only a few halfpence in his possession—he was taken to the station—I know 1 had the 5*. pjece a quarter of an hour before I took the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am daughter-in-law of Mary Wilford, and wife of Samuel Wilford. I engaged the cab, and got in it with Mrs. Wilford—Harris was at the door, as waterman—I saw Mrs. Wilford give him a crown-piece—I did not know it was a crown-piece but by the glistening of it by the gaslight—we stopped the cab, and went back to the stand—my husband was on the cab-box—Harris was found, and brought up—he was, asked by my husband whether he had received such a thing as a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and he denied that he had ever received such a coin—Tomlinson was within hearing—we all went to the station.</p>

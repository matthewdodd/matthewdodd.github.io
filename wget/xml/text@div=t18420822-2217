                  </hi>. I am a silversmith, living in Bream's-buildings, Chancery-lane. About half-past twelve o'clock at night, on the 9th of August, I was in Skinner-street—two women met me—I believe the pri<lb></lb>soner was one of them—they held up their arms, to obstruct my going on—the other took hold of my arm, and when we got to the bottom of Hol<lb></lb>born-hill she suddenly left—I felt, and missed my purse—I looked round, and saw the woman that left me had gone across the road—I went over, and charged her with it—she denied it—I thought I saw something pass to the prisoner—I said, "She has given the purse to this woman"—the prisoner walked away—I followed her to Field-lane, and called "Stop thief"—the policeman being at hand, he took her within twenty yards—on our way to the station, something dropped, which turned out to be my purse.</p>

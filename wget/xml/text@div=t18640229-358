                  </hi>. I am a clerk in a Russian broker's house, and live at Fulham—on 13th February, I was passing down High-street, Southwark, with two friends, and when near a court opposite the church I heard cries of murder, and saw a crowd of people rushing out of a public-house—they went up a court, and I followed to see what was going on—the people directly all turned round upon us, and the prisoner struck me, and swore at me very much for interfering—I had not spoken a word to her—she canght hold of my coat, and held me at arms length, took my umbrella, and passed it to two men, who ran away with it—I did not lose sight of her—a police<lb></lb>man came and took her.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you on this day that we have been speaking of, see the prisoner any where. - A. In Portland-street, St. James's, Westminster, about twelve o'clock in the day; I suspected her, and followed her into Poland-street, she stopped at the corner of Poland-street, in Oxford-street, and put something in her pocket and took something out.</p>
               <p>Court. She was putting her hands in her pocket. - A. Yes, for about half a minute, and then walked on again, she turned into the sign of the King's Arms, in Poland-street, at Mr. Brown's, I staid out till she came out, and then I went in and enquired what she had changed there. Mrs. Brown produced this sixpence, she said this sixpence was the sixpence that she had paid her. I produce the sixpence. I rubbed the sixpence on the stairs with my foot, to ascertain whether it was a bad one, and marked it, and desired her to keep it by itself; I then followed the prisoner, and took her in custody, in Marlborough-street, close by the office; she immediately put her hand and took out this brown paper, I suspected she was going to throw it away, I immediately seized both her hands, and took her into the office, where after some time struggling, we got the paper out of her hand, I found it contained two more sixpences, which I now produce, I have had them ever since; I searched her, and found a red pocket book, a new tooth brush, and about thirteen pennyworth of new halfpence, here is six pennyworth of them, and Jackson has got the rest, they were all good copper; we had some discourse who gave charge of her, she said if I liked she need not be prosecuted, I told her it did not rest with me, it was with the gentlemen who conducted the mint, I should take her before the magistrate; at the office I received that sixpence of Mrs. Brown, I have had it ever since; I was in court at Clerkenwell when sentence was passed upon her.</p>

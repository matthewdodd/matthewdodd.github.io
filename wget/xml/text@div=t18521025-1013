                  </hi>. I keep the Ball's Head public house, Bromley St. Leonards. On 16th Oct. the prisoner came about 9 o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing; he asked for half a pint of beer, which came to a penny, and he gave me a half sovereign—I gave him in change a half crown, three shillings, eight sixpences, one fourpenny piece, and two halfpence—I particularly noticed the half crown—after I had served another customer with a quartern of gin the prisoner put back a half crown, and he said, "I don't like this"—I said, "I don't like it neither, but that is not the one I gave you"—he said I must have given it him, for he had no other money about him—I had noticed that the half crown I gave him was George the Third's, and the one be gave back was a Victoria, with a mark on the head, rather scratched—I called a constable, and the prisoner was searched in my private parlour—he pulled off his boot himself, and put it under the chair—I took the boot and said, "If there is a half crown here, it is George the Third's half crown"—the policeman took it, and in it was a George the Third half crown—when I sent for the policeman, the prisoner tried to get away—I collared him back, and called on three persons to assist me.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody by the last witness—I have a bad half crown, which the prisoner gave me before I searched him—he said he had received it of the landlord and he had no more money—I took him into the apartment to search him, and while I was searching his jacket and waistcoat, the landlord took his boot up and there was a half crown in it—I found on the prisoner three shillings, eight sixpences, a fourpenny piece, and a penny, all good—the prosecutor said, when this half crown was produced that he had given him a George the Third's half crown, and this was it—I took the prisoner to the station, and as we were going he said, "I suppose I shall get six months for this; I have been at work for Mr. Mayer, and when I was paid I found I had a bad half crown; I went back, and they refused to change it, and being a poor man I thought I had better try and get rid of it."</p>

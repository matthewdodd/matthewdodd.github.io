                  </hi>. I live in Neptune-court, Lock's-fields. I travel the country with a horse and cart to sell things—James Edwards was my brother—on Saturday night, the 21st of June, about half-past nine o'clock, I went to the Jolly Butcher's public house, in Lock's-fields, and found my brother James there, and the prisoner Hardaway—I did not hear him say any thing at that time—I saw my brother go from there to the Cottage of content—I then went home to supper, and after supper went to Mrs. Dalton's—I went home from there, and we slept together—my brother got up at half-past three o'clock on Sunday morning, and left the house—I left the house about half-past four o'clock, and went to Norwood, with five others—when we got Norwood it was not six o'clock—I saw my brother lying on his back, and Hardaway was lying on his back—they were lifted up, and put on their seconds' knees—William Horton was my brother's second, and Frank Moody was Hardaway's—I said before the Magis<lb></lb>trate, that I did not know who Hardaway's second was; I have heard since that Moody was so but I do not know it—I went away to where I kept a horse and cart, and in consequence of what I heard I went again to the ground—my brother was on a man's arm—he could not speak—he was put into a cart and taken to the Rose and Crown, and then to Mr. Cook, a surgeon, at Denmark-hill—I left him at the doctor's shop, when I came away—he was dead then—he was taken to the station-house, and then to Newington workhouse—my brother and Hardaway had been acquainted a long while.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Hardaway's brother-in-law. On Saturday night, the 20th of June, I saw him in Lock's fields—I afterwards went home, and slept in the same bed with him—we went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock—Hardaway said he was going to fight with James</p>

               <p>Edwards, but it was against his will—next morning several people in the court called him up, and made a disturbance et the door—my mother said he should not come out, and the people said he must come out, for they had betted money on him, and insisted on his coming out to fight—they made such a noise that and assisted him out of a window, as my mother would not let him go out—I went with him as far as the Kent-road, and I then stopped at a coffee-shop there—I went down into Lock's-fields, and soon after they came there—Hardaway go into a donkey-cart—that must have been about half-past two o'clock—Moody was with him—I went to Norwood after they were all gone—I found James Edwards and Hardaway there; with Moody, William Morgan, and William Horton—I do not know Wilkinson—they had been fighting an hour before I came—I saw fighting between Hard away and James Edwards—Morgan was Hardaway's regular second—Moody did not have much to do in it—they continued fighting for about twenty minutes after I got there—there was no rope ring—the people made a ring themselves—there was nothing unfair in the fight that I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. On the Sunday morning, the 21st of June I went to Norwood—on the Sunday week before the fight, Hardaway and James Edward mentioned to me, at Mrs. Horton's door, that they were going to Norwood to fight—I saw the fight begin—they shook hands before they began—Wilkinson and William Horton were Edwards seconds, and Moody and Morgan were Hardaway's—they fought about an hour and twenty minutes—Moody was present the whole time—he helped to pick up the prisoner, along with Morgan acting as second—they both fell several times—Edwards was persuaded to fight by Horton and Wilk<lb></lb>inson—they said he would beat Hardaway in two more rounds—at the last round Edwards fell on his back—he could not fight any longer then—It was a fair fight—I saw nothing foul—Edwards was alive when he left Mr. Neal's public house, at Norwood—what part of the road he died on I cannot tell.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 54). On Wednesday morning, 1st December, a little after 7 o'clock, I went, with Sharpe, another constable, to Mr. Brom<lb></lb>ley's house on Stratford-green, and saw distinct footmarks in the garden in front of the house, which had been freshly dug—from there I went to the "Good Intent," in Stratford, kept by Ann Dugard, the prisoner's grandmother, about half or three-quarters of a mile from Mr. Bromley's house—I saw Mrs. Dugard in the bar—she said, looking at the prisoners, "Oh, here comes a policeman" (I was in uniform)—they would hear that, as the middle door was open, but I could not see them, as the position of the door-way is askew—she spoke in a sorrowful voice, but it was loud and distinct—I said, "Yes, you will hear all about it," rushed into the back par'our, and found the three prisoners there, and this clock (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was standing on the sideboard, with this handkerchief over it: it was at Rooter's elbow, and at Goddard's back—this was at half-past 7 or twenty-five minutes to eight—Watson was sitting further away from it, but he could see it—there were no other persons in the room—Goddard's shoes were off, and lying on the ground, very wet and dirty—he put them on, and I said. "Consider your-selves all in custody, for stealing this clock from Mr. Bromley's"—Goddard said, "You have no right to take me; I have only been up a quarter of an hour, and have only been in the back yard to see to my grandmother's water"—I called Sharpe in, and we took the prisoners to the station—I afterwards went back to Mr. Bromley's house, and took with me three shoes, belonging to the three prisoners—I examined them with the marks—the impression was very fresh and perfect—I found that Goddard's corresponded</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185812130076"></xptr>
               <p>with the marks; there is not the least doubt about that—the marks were in a direction from the back towards the front; the toes were towards the front—a person coming from the back to the front might have made those marks—I only saw one impression.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was that the impression of one foot or of two feet? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of the two feet of one man—they were wide apart—the faster the man ran, the wider they would be—they were more than the ordinary width, but I suppose he walked, because it was a <hi rend="italic">zig-zag</hi> in the midst of the shrubbery—Goddard's boots were wet, and he told me that there was some water in the yard—he did not say that he had been dabbling there—I cannot say whether he said that he had been turning the water off, or turning it on—I examined his boots, and I should say that he could not have got that dirt in his grandmother's back yard, but I did not go there; they were very wet for three-quarters of an inch up the sole—I took the boots of all the prisoners, and tried them—I tried Rooter's boot first, then Watson's, and then Goddard's: his was the largest boot—the impressions were so plain that I had no occasion to be long over it—it was not raining; it was about the same weather as it is now—I did not make an impression by the side, but put Rooter's boot into the mark first—it was so small that it did not interfere with the impression—I did not ram them down—I did not make the impression with Goddard's boots: it was already made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you let the boot out of your hand. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I put it lightly into the impression.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you rather a stiff clay at Stratford? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The garden is a very light soil, and it had been fresh dug—there were brads in Goddard's boots, but not nails to make any impression—he is wearing them now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Rooter. Q.</hi> Was I in conversation with these two prisoners when you came into the beer-shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see you.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Watson. Q.</hi> Where was I sitting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The furthest from the clock—Goddard was in one corner, and you were on Rooter's right—you were all three sitting in the corner—I told Mrs. Dugard that I must search the house—she assisted me, and said that Goddard, her grandson, had brought the clock in, and she said to him, "You devil, you have been with all those fellows again, and you will bring us all to destruction"—I asked her if she would attend the court at the next hearing, without being summoned—she said she would, and she did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where does Mrs. Goddard live? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She is a widow, I have been told, and lives with Mrs. Dugard—it is Mrs. Dugard'a house, I believe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Bromley's groom. On Wednesday morning, 1st December, I was going to his house, about 7 o'clock, and saw the three prisoners, two inside Mr. Boyle's gate, and one outside—Rooter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185812130077"></xptr>
               <p>was one of those who were inside, and as I passed, I heard him say, "He ought to he there by 7 o'clock; he said he would, and he is not there yet" I went on to Mr. Bromley's, and the prisoners followed me—I went in at the stable gates, and saw no more of them—I am certain they are the men—they followed me within thirty yards of my master's gate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know the "Good Intent"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not till the policeman told me—that may be a little more than half a mile from my master's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Rooter.</hi> You said at Ilford that they were three working men; that you had no suspicion of them, but walked on, and took no notice. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I took notice of you, and I said that you had got dark trousers on—your trousers are light and dark; they have light spots—I knew none of you before, but I looked hard at you as I passed—I did not hear the policeman say, "I know him: he has been transported"—he said, "Do you know them?"—I said, "Yes, those are the three lads that I saw this morning."</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the "Good Intent" beer-shop, Stratford New Town—Goddard is my grandson—he was there on Wednesday morning, 1st December—I cannot swear whether he left the house or no—I did not see him come in that morning—I was fetching some coals up—he sat in the bar, and his shoes were off—I was examined before the Magistrate—my daughter was in the house at the time—the other prisoners were not there, but they came in three, four, or five minutes afterwards—Watson came in first, and Rooter came in as near as possible at the same time—they walked in one after the other—I had seen Goddard with his shoes off before the other two came in—this is my mark to my deposition—I put my cross to something; I was too alarmed to know what—I had my hand guided—it is not a pleasant thing to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say before the Magistrate, "On Wednesday morning the prisoner Goddard, who is my graudson, came to my house about half-past 7, in company with the prisoner Watson; the prisoner Rooter followed them in a few minutes after"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not mean it, if I said it—what I said was taken down in writing and read over to me—I never saw the other two prisoners in my life—I saw Watson come in—he had something under his arm, and I thought it was something for breakfast—there was a handker<lb></lb>chief over it—I often cook things for him—I did not examine the handker<lb></lb>chief; it was something like this produced—it was a dirty looking one—they went into the parlour—that is the only room I have—they were all there together, and one of the two, I cannot say which, called for a pint of beer—I took it in, received 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, and going back, I saw the police—Goddard had passed the night at my house—he slept there—he has no father, and I have always kept him—Watson came in next after Goddard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

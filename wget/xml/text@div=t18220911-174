On the 24th of August, I went to bed at ten o'clock at night, before the house was fastened up.

I should think it took two hours to do it; a hole was bored in another door, but being lined with iron, they did not succeed; and the window shutters, which were lined with iron, had been attempted; Mr. Wheatley lodges with me.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Wheatley. I went to bed at half past twelve o'clock; the house was then safe. I sleep in the garret. I had been sitting in the front kitchen before I went to bed; I heard a noise in the back yard and awoke Strange, but we thought it was rats. I had left my shawl in the kitchen; and about three was alarmed by strange screaming - we found the house was broken open - my shawl was gone - every thing was turned out of the kitchen drawers into a carpet, ready to be packed up, and the clothes line was taken from the drawer, and unwound, ready to tie them up. My mistress's cupboard was broken open, and a piece of bacon taken. The spice box was broken open, and my master's pistols taken from the kitchen shelf. I lost some money from the kitchen drawers. There is a ditch by the side of the house, and a ladder was placed across it, which did not belong to us.</p>

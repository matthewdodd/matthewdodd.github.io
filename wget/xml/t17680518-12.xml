            . On the 15th of April, going to the post office between eight and nine at night, walking arm in arm with Mr. Bovill, I felt something at my pocket; I clapped my hand upon it and turned, and saw the prisoner close by me, there was an accomplice with him; in the prisoner's handing my pocket-book to him, it dropped between them; I did not see it drop, but I found it on the ground; in taking the prisoner to the Compter, in 'Change-alley he made a great deal of resistance.</p>

            . I was walking by the prosecutor; he felt something at his pocket, he turned about and cried, Halloo, who's there? I looked over my shoulder and saw the prisoner and another man, I suppose he was handing the book to him; it fell to the ground and opened, and several papers sell out of it; the other man made a pretence to help gather them up; I laid hold of the prisoner while the prosecutor gathered up the papers and book, the other man made off; the prisoner made a great deal of resistance when in 'Change-alley; the book dropped directly between the prisoner and the other man that made off.</p>

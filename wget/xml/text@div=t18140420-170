One room I let out furnished, the other rooms unfurnished. The prisoner had the lower rooms, the shop and the parlour unfurnished; he carried on no business; the prisoner's wife gave me five shillings a week for the shop and parlour. I called to see the person who had the ready furnished room; she was gone to Gravesend. On my going up into the two pair of stairs. I missed a set of shelves that had been there; I came down, and told the prisoner's daughter that I had put the shelves there because there was no closet, and that he must return them, or pay for them. There was no family in the house but themselves. On Sunday, the 27th, the woman called, and told me that Reach had been up, and taken the bed, and several articles. I went to the room, and found the door had been broken open. On the 7th of March, I saw the bed, pillow, and blanket, which I can swear to.</p>

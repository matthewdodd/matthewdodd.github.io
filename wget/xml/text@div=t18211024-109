I went to the prisoner's, I had been there twice before, and told the officers what had passed, On going in I told her I had come for some more shillings - she asked how many I wanted - I told her seven. She went to a place in the room, which she went to an a former occasion; she took them from there, sat down in a chair by the fire, took the poker out and placed the shillings on the hot poker, then put them in a mug of water, put something out of a paper into the mug, and washed them with it; then wiped them with a cloth and gave them to me. I gave her 2 s. 4 d. for seven. I gave her the same money Gleed gave me. I came down and went into the barber's shop. Hanley came in and took from me the same shillings which I had from her.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Luke's. I met Isaacson by appointment in Fetter-lane, on the 23d of October; Gleed and Kennedy were with me. Gleed marked some money at the White Hart, public-house, Fetter-lane, and gave it to him. We followed him to Charles-street, Drury-lane, and saw him go into the house. If he succeeded he was to go into the barber's shop - I saw him in the shop, and went in and found seven counterfeit shillings on him, which I produce. Gleed and Kennedy went up stairs - I took him up stairs with me; he pointed to the prisoner, and said "That is the woman who sold me the money." Gleed searched her and found the marked money on her. He asked her how she came by it? she said she took it of her lodgers. There was only a boy about fourteen years old in the room.</p>

            . I went with Hanley, and have heard his account - it is correct. I produce one shilling, two sixpences, and four-pence in halfpence, which I had marked and given to Isaacson. I went up stairs and found the prisoner and a boy in the room. I found the marked money in the prisoner's pocket - she said she had it from one of her lodgers. I saw two men at breakfast in the room an hour after.</p>

            . I am assistant to the solicitors of the Mint, and have been so nearly thirty years. The seven shillings are all counterfeits, have never been in circulation, and are all from the same dye. There is a flaw in the dye - They are base metal - merely washed. The half-crowns are also counterfeits, and merely washed, and all three from the same dye.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man came up and asked for Mrs. Kelly. I was getting the men's breakfast, and told him no such person was there; the other man said, "Come here and warm your hands, here is a nice fire." I went down for a pail of water, and left them in the room. When I came up I found this money on the cloth. I supposed my lodger had left it for me to get his dinner. I was blowing the fire - these gentlemen came up and said, "Is not your name Kelly?" I said No; and shewed them my certificate. I knew nothing of the half-crowns - it is done out of spite, because I gave information against one Callagan.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and gentlemen of the Jury the circumstance that I feel it my duty to declare to his honourable court that caused me to do the act: During the last two years of my confinement I felt as happy and comfortable as it was possible for a man in my situation, looking forward to the time that should restore me to my family I have a wife and children. Not hearing from my wife for the last two years, on my enquiring I heard that she had cohabited with another man, and had a child by him, she has since married another man, and is with child by him. A boy of mine was permitted to see me, who told me this about three months ago. Jealousy and rage got the better of me, and finding no rest day or night, I resolved I would make my escape. I did not desire to make the above escape until the above circumstances came to my mind The night the ship was cut I could then come away if I liked. If ever there was a poor fellow deserved pity, I do.</p>
               <p>LIMERICK. He hears a good character with the officer of the hulks, and here is an officer knows of the other man living with his wife.</p>

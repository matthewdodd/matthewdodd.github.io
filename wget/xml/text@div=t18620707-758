                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 2, Back-road, Kingsland—I have been stopping in the same lodgings with the prisoner, and slept in the same bed—she had a little boy, about a year and six months old—upon the 17th June, in the middle of the night, she took up a small white-handled cheese-knife, and said she would cut her throat—there was a candle burning in the room—I took it out of her hand—she was raving mad all that night—I had heard her say about a week previously that her husband had died—she had had a letter on the Thursday, announcing his death—he was in Canada—that appeared to affect her mind—on the next morning, Tuesday, I was out of the room for a few minutes—on my return she was putting this string (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) round the neck of the child—I took it out of her hand—she did not say anything—I told her I knew what she was going to do—I left the room soon after, as she asked me to go, and shut the door—when I came back she had this shawl (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) round the child's neck four or five times—I took that away from her—she was in the same state of excitement as on the night before—she said she was going to choke herself—she also told me she had taken some oxalic acid—that was the same week, just after she had drunk her tea, and it made her very sick.</p>

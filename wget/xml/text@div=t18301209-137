On the 9th of July last, he came to me to order a transfer to be put forward for the sale of some stock - the sum transferred was 115l. 3 per cent. consolidated annuities; he said it was to be transferred for Mrs. Creed - I had done a similar transaction before; I asked what time Mrs. Creed would be ready to make the transfer - I told him it would be ready very shortly; I had the transfer put forward in consequence of his directions - the stock was sold to

               <p>Q. Who introduced her to you? A. The first introduction I had to this lady, was somewhere about the beginning of August, 1827 - she was first introduced to me by Mr. Edward Jenkins, a stock-broker, who died on the 1st of March 1828; I was then his assistant -Mr.

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at any time tell you who she was? A. Yes; she was introduced to me by the prisoner as Mrs. Temperance Creed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. She had been introduced to you before the prisoner mentioned her as Mrs. Temperance Creed? A. He desired the stock to be sold for Mrs. Temperance Creed - he came afterwards with this lady, and, by his actions, I considered him as identifying her as Mrs. Creed, and as such I attended her to the books of the Bank; he did not say, every time he came, "This lady is Mrs. Creed," but it was natural to presume that she wanted no second introduction, having been introduced once - when Mr. Jenkins introduced her to me she was accompanied by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. BULLOCK. Q. Having directed you to have the transfer got ready, did the prisoner appear with this lady for the purpose of having the transfer perfected? A. He did on the 9th of July; I went with them from my station at the Bank to the transfer books of the 3 per cent. consols, under the letter C. in the transfer-office - the stock receipt was signed by the lady, and handed to the Bank clerk - the book, containing the transfer, was turned round, and she signed it in the place where transfers usually are signed - the clerk affixed his signature to it, as he had done to the stock receipt, and I signed my name as witness to the identity of the prisoner's signing; which is required by the Bank - I did it of my own accord, that is the usual course; here is the transfer (looking at it) - here is my signature and the signature of the lady I identified that day - she was the same lady who had been present on similar transactions; the prisoner accompanied her, to the best of my recollection, every time - he was present on the 9th of July during the performance of the transaction: I retired back to the rotunda, and to the best of my recollection the lady<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090068"></xptr>stopped at my desk to receive the money - I was present when the money was paid to her by my partner, Mr.

            ; I do not think the prisoner was present then; the lady appeared a middle aged woman, from forty to forty-five, but she might be fifty; her complexion was not florid at all; her whole carriage together was genteel - there were no signs of infirmity whatever in her walk - she had a dark full dress on, and to the best of my recollection, it was silk - she wore a very large bonnet, and a black veil, thickly laced; and her veil was on almost every occasion down - I remember no transaction in which that veil was raised.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I presume you have known the prisoner some time? A. Yes, seven years, if not eight; he has been a clerk in the Bank all that time - I believe he has been there twenty-two years; I always understood that the Bank clerks' salaries were progressively raised; he always bore a good character, to the best of my judgment.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person had stock to transfer, the regular course is to have a power of attorney, if they cannot attend themselves? A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known instances where a person unable to attend, has comissioned a friend to do the business without a power of attorney? A. I never heard of a transfer being effected at the Bank without a power of attorney, unless the parties themselves were present; I certainly once witnessed a woman sign for another person, but it was discovered immediately that it was wrong - that was a case of dividend; it was discovered before the signature was complete; the right woman was present, but not being able to write had requested this woman to sign her name for her. Consols close for the July dividend about the 2nd or 3rd of June - the person holding the stock at the time of shutting, receives the dividend due; Mrs. Creed would be entitled to receive the dividend which had accrued on the stock, at any time she chose to come for it - I did not know Mrs. Temperance Creed, and am certain Mr. Jenkins did not - I cannot answer for the late Mr. Jenkins; a party receiving a dividend goes to the desk signs the book and a paper, both of which state the sum received, and the amount, in respect of which it is received, it is specified in both, and the amount of dividend is specified in both - nothing is specified in the book but the capital, the name of the person, and the dividend, except the figures; the figures specifying the amount, would usually catch the eye - but it would require a practised eye to notice it; they are prominent enough to be seen.</p>
               <p>MR. BULLOCK. Q. Are you in the habit of attending parties to receive dividends? A. I am; this is the dividend-book - (looking at it); the name of the party, and the sum, is on one side of the book, and the amount of stock and dividends of on the other - there is always a sheet of blotting paper between the two leaves, which is down at the time the party signs; the blotting paper is between the name and the amount - it is removed at the end of about six months.</p>
               <p>Q. A party signing on the left side would not necessarily see the amount of stock and dividend on the right, when the blotting paper is down? A. No, but they are not permited to sign the book till they make their claim -I understood Mr. Adolphus' question to allude particularly to the warrant.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. By making their claim, you mean mentioning the sum? A. Yes; the clerk asks the persons name, and the amount of stock - and if they agree, he pays the dividend.</p>
               <p>MR. BULLOCK. Q. Is it necessary for the amount to be given by the persons themselves, or sometimes by the broker, or person who attends? A. Sometimes by the party, and sometimes by the person who attends.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the transfer-office of the 3 per cent. consols, and have been so for nine years - I have known the prisoner as a clerk in the Bank about twenty years; in July last, I remember his coming with a lady to make a transfer of consols - Mr. Lane accompanied them; Mr. Lane asked if the transfer was ready - the book was then turned round, and the party representing herself to be Temperance Creed, signed it, after having signed the receipt; I do not mean that on this occasion the lady said she was Temperance Creed - I took that for granted, she being with the broker, Mr. Lane, or somebody for her, had bespoke a transfer in the name of Temperance Creed that morning - this is the transfer-book; I saw the female sign it - here is my signature as witness to the transaction; Lane has signed it as witness to the identity - after signing this they went towards the 3 per cent. dividend office; the dividends were in the course of payment on the 9th of July - the parties might if they pleased receive their dividends on that occasion; the lady appeared about forty years of age - I had seen her six or seven times before, and to the best of my recollection, she was always accompanied by the prisoner, and always identified by Mr. Lane; she always came for the purpose of transferring stock, and always wore a bonnet with a black veil, which was generally down - I do not remember it ever being up; I have examined the Bank books to ascertain of there was more than one account in consols in July in the name of Temperance Creed - there is only one.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. On what day do you begin to pay your dividends? A. Bankers are paid on the 6th or 7th if a Sunday does not intervene - we generally begin to pay the public on the 8th; there is generally a great press of people the first few days, and they have a long time to wait.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Of course the prisoner was aware that you knew his person? A. Yes; I believe he attended his duty at the Bank till he was charged with this - but he was not in my office; it was not part of his duty to attend in the consol-office - the lady always transferred stock in the name of Temperance Creed.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give the dates of these transactions? A. On the 7th of August 1827, 500l. 3 per cent. consols; 15th of February 1828, 250l. - 16th May, 150l.; 9th October, 250l. - 25th November, 300l.; 22nd April 1829, 200l. - 25th August, 300l.; 15th January 1830, 150l. -9th July, 115l.; all these transfers were made by the same lady - the dividends are payable twice a year; and the attention of the stockholder would be called twice a year to the diminution of the capital.</p>

I, the prisoner, and Rebecca Goode, are left lier executors - I communicated with the prisoner respecting her property in the Bank; I asked him if the Bank books had been searched - he said they had; and that there was 1,650l. standing in the name of Temperance Creed - he did not mention the stock; I knew it was 3 per cents. - he gave me this information about the beginning of November; he was to apply to a broker for the purpose of having it sold out on the 19th of November -I was not present, and he did not himself tell me what he had done respecting it; his brother called on me - I went about the beginning of November. to Mr. Hawkins, a stock-broker, with the prisoner, merely to inquire the price of stocks; we came to no determination that morning whether we would sell or not - the prisoner never gave the broker any directions in my presence, nor did he himself communicate to me any directions he had given; I received the information from his brother - (looking at three letters) these are the prisoner's hand-writing; he called on me on the 18th, and said the broker had made some mistake, and the sale must be delayed till the following week on the 26th; and early in the morning of the 28th, I received this letter by a private hand (read).</p>

               <p>MR. COLES. In consequence of receiving this letter, I went to see him the same evening, and told him there had been so much delay in the business, that Mrs. Goode was resolutely determined to have the matter settled by fair means or foul, and if it was not settled, I apprehended unpleasant consequences would ensue; I then asked if he would give me a power of attorney for the next day, which was Saturday, delegating some person to act in his stead - after some hesitation, he said he would give one; he then paused a little while, and said, "I will supersede the necessity of a power of attorney, because I will be at the Bank on Monday morning" - nothing more was said; he was taken into custody on the Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You mention a will under which you derive some property; when does that will bear date? A. I do not exactly know - it might be made nine or ten years ago (the probate was here produced).</p>
               <p>Q. I see here is named a sum of 1,300l.; that I presume is in trust? A. Yes; it is 1300l. stock - it was all to sink in the residue of her property, for the purposes of her will; that 1300l. was left her before marriage, independent of her husband - it is now in possession of two gentlemen; it was her property, she could do what she liked with it - that sum is still existing; it stands in the names of her trustees - I knew she had a very good income; I supposed about 400l. or 500l. a year - she knew I had undergone losses, and she has given me sums of money out of her surplus income, for the last six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell where she got it from? A. Yes, I can - she was of an acute, clear, and intelligent mind; I believe she was not always careful about reading papers before she signed them - I presume she always exercised common prudence and discretion in the management of her affairs; the prisoner was in her confidence - (Mr. Fenn here produced the dividend book of 1827, and two dividend warrants) I believe these two devidend warrants to be in her hand-writing; they are dated June and July, 1830 - there is no doubt of the signature being her writing.</p>

            . I am a stock-broker, and carry on business in the rotunda. I have known the prisoner by sight some years; he came to me on the 8th of November, with his uncle Joseph, about the price of consols - I saw him again on the 11th, and he requested me to sell 1600l. 3 per cent. consols for Friday, the 19th of November; it was stated on the 8th, by Mr. Joseph or by him, that it was an executorship account - on the 11th I sold for the 19th, and on the 17th or 18th I saw the prisoner again; he stated that the stock could not be ready for transfer by the 19th; he did not say why - the stock having been sold by me, I re-purchased it, and communicated that to him; it was by his instructions I cancelled the sale - he at that time gave me directions for a sale, if they attained a certain price, for Friday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090070"></xptr>the 26th, but they did not attain the price, and I did not see him after the 19th; no transfer was prepared on the 26th, nor any steps taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you the broker usually employed by the uncle Joseph? A. Yes- I had not been engaged for the prisoner before; I recollect nothing being said about the property standing in the name of trustees, and think nothing was said.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the will-office at the Bank. The probates of wills are registered there, to be acted upon by executors; when a will is registered it is customary to make a claim for the amount - the prisoner came on the 26th of October to register this will: he made no claim when he gave me the probate - I observed to him that he had made no claim; he then said the amount was very trifling - I asked how much: he said 5l. odd shillings, 3 per cent. consols; which I entered on the probate, and find it entered there now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You understood him to be an executor? A. Yes, and that he was acting in that capacity; I know nothing of any claim of 1300l. on any executorship account.</p>

               <p>MY DEAR MADAM, - As it is probable my uncle has written to you to fix Friday next for your attendance at the Bank, I just write to say it is Friday week, the 25th, when I shall be glad to see you, about half-past eleven o'clock; I saw Mr. Farrard, and he requires an affidavit to state Mrs. Creed never had any children, but it will not do for either of the executors, so I suppose we must apply to Mrs. Kelly. Yours, &amp;c.

             AUNT, - I am sorry to say I have been so exceeding unwell I shall not be able to be in town to-morrow; I delayed sending this letter earlier. hoping I should be able to manage it - the doctor informs me I must not venture out, as the complaint is inflammatory, and requires rest; the affidavit Mr. Farrard wanted has been made by Mr. Wallis, who is the only person in London who knew my aunt, Creed, sufficiently long to have done so - there remains but little more to do before the money will be received; I hope, through the blessing of God, a few days will restore me to health, when you shall be informed on what day we require your attendance in the City; three of my children have had the measles lately, but are now recovering. Yours, &amp;c. B. COLES.</p>

            . I live at Camberwell. I lived with Mrs. Temperance Creed in her life-time, as her companion, for three years previous to her death; I was in the habit of going with her to the Bank, to receive her dividends - I generally left her at the prisoner's office in the Bank with him, and I waited in the rotunda till they returned; I went out of town in July - Miss Ivery came there when I went away; Mrs. Creed did not go to the Bank in July before I left - she could not have gone without my knowledge; she never wore a veil.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was she a sensible woman? A. Yes - she could read her receipts, and look to her own affairs, and did so generally; I know she was kind to some of her relations, and advanced them money - she appeared on confidential terms with the prisoner.</p>

            . I was acquainted with the late Mrs. Creed, and went to reside with her in July last; I do not know on what day, but it was the day Miss Reynolds left her - I remember going to the Bank with Mrs. Creed to receive her dividends; I think it was the next day; I took her to the prisoner, and left her with him; I went to Hackney from there, and returned to Mile-end in the evening.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the dividend-office at the Bank. I know Mrs. Creed's person - she was in the habit of receiving her dividends at my desk every half year, and always came with the prisoner; the book is handed to the party coming for dividends to sign on one side - the same course is pursued if a Bank clerk comes with them, we usually ask for the sum; but if I was going into another office and asked for a dividend for a friend, I might turn to the book, observe the sum and number, and ask the clerk to give me a warrant of that number.</p>

             re-examined. I have examined the Bank books to see what sum was standing in the name of Temperance Creed, in October last - it was 5l. 16s. 9d. 3 per cent consols.(The Transfer was here read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - it is my unfortunate situation to be placed as a criminal, charged with an offence which attacks my life, prosecuted by so near a relation as the brother of my own father, for whom, in any situation of life, I should have looked to for support and assistance; I am placed in this unhappy predicament in consequence of conduct which may have been imprudent, but was never intended criminal. My aunt, as you have heard, placed great confidence in me, and she informed me from time to time of her being obliged to sell stock to accommodate her poor relations, and she was desirous of having the transfer effected by a friend of hers, without the expence of a power of attorney, which would be an additional burden on the person she wished to oblige; she always expressed her confident hope that the sum she advanced would be paid, her intention being in such case to replace the stock - she had a mind fresh and vigorous; she always received her dividends with a clear knowledge of the sums - after the last transaction she assured me she had replaced the stock, and in consequence of that I made the declaration I did to my uncle, after her death; were she alive I should have no difficulty in establishing this fact, by her evidence - as it is, I must have it to your good sense and merciful consideration. Gentlemen, it has come to your knowledge that I was in the Bank more than thirty years, with an increasing salary and good private character; had I ever been conscious of any guilt, I must have known that after my aunt's death, the discovery was certain - yet I remained two months without absconding; I am here to meet justice, which I have no doubt I shall find at your hands, on a fair and merciful consideration of my case.</p>

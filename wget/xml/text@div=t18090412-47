On Sunday the 19th of February, about a quarter before seven o'clock, I was in company with Vickery and Gleed in Stepney fields; we met two men; Vickery was first, I was next, and Gleed was behind me; Vickery laid hold of the last man of the two, and said let us see who these men are. The prisoner passed me and Gleed; Gleed followed the prisoner and I followed Gleed; the prisoner walked five or six paces, turned to the left and ran away towards the Half Way House in the Commercial-road; I ran after him and passed Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you run after him for - A. To take him in custody, to see who and what he was; I ran fifteen or twenty paces after him; then he turned his face a little to the left; I had the sight of his face, I was within two or three yards of him, he put his right hand over his left shoulder and fired a pistol at me; then he ran five or six yards further and I after him; he turned half way round to the left and threw the pistol at me; it went over my head, struck the ground behind me, and went into a ditch of water just by; with his stopping to throw the pistol at me, I got near enough to reach him with this cane in my hand. I gave him two or three blows on his head and neck, he ran fifty or sixty yards further, towards the Commercial-road; I ran after him, crying stop thief; he jumped over a ditch and made his escape. I went to the Half-way house to Vickery, where he had the other man in custody; Vickery gave him in custody of another man; he and Gleed went to look for the pistol.</p>

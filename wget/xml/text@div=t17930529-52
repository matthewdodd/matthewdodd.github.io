The 23d of this month about one o'clock in the morning, to the best of my knowledge, it was Thursday, going along Coventry-street I met with the prisoner she stopped me and asked for something to drink; I told her I had no money; at the same time I had between four and five pounds in my breeches pocket, gold and silver, and some halfpence in my waistcoat pocket, I told the prisoner that I had no money, neither could I give her any thing to drink; so she said she would treat me rather than we should part without drinking together; so we went to a public house in Piccadilly, I don't know the sign of it, we had a glass of gin a piece, and she put her hand into her pocket for to pay for it, and she wanted a halfpenny, and she asked me for the halfpenny which I gave her out of my waistcoat pocket, to pay for the gin, after that we came out and came back again down Piccadilly, and stopped at the corner of <placeName id="t17930529-52-crimeloc290">Piccadilly</placeName>

I replied she was not; but I had been robbed by her, and told him I was waiting for somebody to take her into custody; he replied directly that he was an officer belonging to Bow-street and that he would take her; going along I told him I had been robbed of four guineas; when I came to the watch-house I searched my pocket, and I found only one guinea and one shilling left in my breeches pocket, which both the witnesses saw, and the halfpence were gone out of my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q What halfpence had you in your waistcoat pocket? - I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Q. Were these guineas marked? - They were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the money you saw on the girl, you cannot swear to any part being your money? - I cannot swear to any part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about it? - She said nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober? - I was sober enough to know all that passed.</p>

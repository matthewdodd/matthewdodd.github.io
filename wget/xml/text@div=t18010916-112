            , in Fenchurch-street: On the 20th of July, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner mending the bottom of a box; he stooped down under a stool, and began to rummage among some papers; I was looking at him, and by the motion of his body, I thought I saw him put something into the box; I suspected he had taken something, and I watched him; when he was going away, I said, Raven, will you have some beer; he said, yes, go into the Red Lion, call for a pot, and I will come to you in a minute or two; I said, I will wait, I can go along with you; he said I am only going to the Ship to leave this; I said I will go with you; then we went on till we came into Lime-street; going along, I said, Raven, have you got a hat there; he said yes, I am only going to leave it for a gentleman, and I will go along with you; I said you must excuse me, for I must see that hat, I must see what sort of a one it is; he then broke the string that was round the box, and instantly pulled out these two hats; I said, are you not a pretty fellow for doing such tricks as these, and I instantly took him back to the warehouse; but neither of the firm being in town, nor the foreman in the way, I took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were Mr. Borrodaile's hats? - A. By seeing him take them off the premises; they have no mark on them that I know them by.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - A. He said, you can take the hats back and let me go: I am a constable myself and I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he was finisher at Mr. Borrodaile's house, that some time ago there were some old hat-boxes put aside to be burnt, that he put one of them aside to take home for his children's playthings, and that on the night he was taken he put two books into a box, not knowing there was any thing else in it; that he had a wife and two children, and she was eight months gone in pregnancy.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Crow). Were there any books in the box? - A. No book at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You recollect you are on your oath as an honest man sworn to speak the truth? - A. Yes; there was no book at all in the box, nothing but the two hats.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him I would not take the books that night, and I left them behind me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who had known him for eight years, and gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a clerk to Messrs. Blagg &amp; Edwards, solicitors, for two or three years—a little before the 16th July I saw some<lb></lb>thing which I communicated to Inspector Russell—I got tickets from Jordan—they are all initialed with my initials on the back—Jordan was a ticket clipper at the Fenohurch Street Station of the Great Eastern Rail-way Company—Bodger relieved him—when I got the ticket from Jordan it was in the condition it now is—(<hi rend="italic">ticket produced</hi>)—he gave it me by the booking-office, down stairs—he was on duty there, clipping—I came to know Jordan through Parsonage, who told me he could show me how to travel for nothing—that was some days before I got the ticket from Jordan—he introduced me to Jordan in a public-house opposite the station—I then told Mr. Russell what I had seen—the date on the ticket is 16th July, No. 9015, third<lb></lb>class, half return—I met Mr. Russell by appointment, and he and I initialed the ticket—on 18th July I had a meeting with Parsonage at Fenchurch Street—Bodger was there, in uniform, at the clipping place, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I saw something take place between Parsonage and Bodger—Bodger gave Parsonage tickets, and Parsonage gave me one—it was a third<lb></lb>class single ticket to Black<lb></lb>wall, No. 7092 (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I always handed these tickets to Mr. Russell after I initialed them—Parsonage and I travelled together to Blackwall—at the time these tickets were given by Bodger to Parsonage and handed to me, they were clipped—I did not go all the way to Blackwall, I alighted at Shadwell or Stepney—Parsonage went on to where he lived—on 27th July I went to the Blackwall booking<lb></lb>office, in Fenchurch Street—I received this ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I cannot say from whom—it is No. 5278, half-return from Fenchurch Street to West India Docks, third-class—I went either to Shadwell or Stepney—on 28th July I received this ticket from one of the prisoners (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is not initialed—I did not use it, I travelled with a legitimate ticket—J. T. Avery went by the name of "Little Joe"—I remember on oth August going to Foster's public-house with J. T. Avery—I received these two tickets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from "Little Joe," one at the public-house and one elsewhere—No. 8029 is a third<lb></lb>class half return from Black-wall to West India Docks, August 5th—one or two days previous to this I saw Jordan, when I was going out, and he said "I shall not be here to-morrow, I will make it all right with Joe"—the other number is 5611, third<lb></lb>class, to Poplar, 5th August—Jordan introduced me to Joe—we went and had a glass together—Jordan said "Call in the afternoon, the tickets will be all right"—I called, and they were there for me—Avery told me to come in the office when I liked—he was a booking<lb></lb>clerk at Fenchurch Street—I</p>

               <p>think I saw Jordan and Avery on a Saturday, between 9 and 10 o'clock—A very said something about going to Gravesend, and would give me a couple of tickets if I came on Monday—I asked him for one on the Saturday morning, and he said "They are not up yet"—he said they would be up shortly—A very soon after that gave me one ticket, and Jordan gave me one—the one from Jordan was No. 604, first-class half return, Shad well, and the one from A very No. 3413, third-class to Black wall—I am not sure if they were clipped when given to me—I went on with a legitimate ticket—on 9th August I went to the Fenchurch Street Station—I saw J. T. A very—I got two tickets from him, third-class half returns, Nos. 1473 and 1541, to Blackwall—they were both clipped when I received them—I saw him give two tickets to two girls on this date—they passed through the window at the booking<lb></lb>office; but paid nothing—I believe they were clipped tickets—I cannot positively say—on 10th August I saw A very give a man a ticket whom I had seen on the line repeatedly—he did not pay for the ticket—on 12th August A very gave me two half tickets, second-class returns from Fenchurch Street to Blackwall, Nos. 9316 and 9317—on 13th August I took a man named Carter with me, and I found A very and Jordan at the side of the booking-office, in Fenchurch Street—A very said "How are you, old fellow; are you going down the-line to-day?"—I said "Yes, this is a friend of mine"—he said "Is it all right?"—I said "Yes"—he said "The proof of the pudding's in the eating"—after that J. T. Avery gave me two tickets—he gave me four on the 13th—the first ticket I got from Jordan on the 13th was put by him under the lining on the top of the stool, which is just inside the door where he nips the tickets—he said "There it is, under the stool"—I then went into the booking-office, and Avery gave me one; he pulled several out of his pocket, and gave me a first-class—all the tickets he pulled out of his pockets were nipped tickets, and different colours, and for different stations—the two tickets given to me by Avery and Jordan were for the East and West India Docks, Nos. 9152 and 9153, first-class, 13th August—I put them in my pocket, and travelled with legitimate tickets—I went again, later in the day, to the booking-office—Carter was with me—I saw J. T. Avery, who gave me two more tickets, first-class returns to West India Docks, 9159 and 9164—I did not go down with the train, and gave the tickets to Mr. Russell—I saw Avery again, later in the day; he gave me a ticket to Limehouse—I never paid anything for these tickets—they were all clipped when I received them—on 21st July I saw Parsonage at the Fenchurch Street Station—I made these notes in my pocket-book when I went home—I also saw him on 22nd July—on the 21st he got two tickets; on the 23rd he got three tickets—Parsonage got the tickets by the side of the booking-office—on the 23rd Parsonage got three tickets from Jordan, one was for me, and one for a person named Knight, whom Parsonage had introduced to me, and one for himself—I lighted at Shadwell, and let thein go on—they were followed—on the 30th I received some tickets from Jordan—two nipped ones—one is produced—one was given up in mistake—Jordan was on duty as usual—I have re-peatedly seen Jordan take tickets out of his pocket—on 2nd August I received two tickets from Jordan, first<lb></lb>class, Fenchurch Street to Blackwall, 6329—on 2nd August I received two tickets from Jordan, one nipped and the other not, Nos. 9389 and 9390, second, half returns, Fenchurch Street to West India Docks—on 4th August I went with Jordan to a public-house, and he gave me two halves of tickets, 2415 and 2454, first, half returns, to</p>

               <p>Blackwall; and later on the 4th, he gave me a third half return, Line, house, 2932—I knew Parsonage first of all, some months since; he is a cigar merchant, and is in the Customs—he lived at Stepney—he said he had paid seven threepenny fares in fifteen years, that he had travelled the line, and had used the line four and five times a day, he used, at night, to bring up spirits by it—I think it was 18th July when I first received any tickets from Parsonage—in that month of July I was on the platform at Stepney, and a ticket collector named Rutterford said to Parsonage "Look out, there's a b—detective on the platform"—on the same day, when Parsonage got to Fenchurch Street, he said to a ticket collector named Treadgold "Come down, old fellow, and have a glass of ale"—we all three went together, and while in the public-house Parsonage said to Treadgold "Look out, old fellow, there is a detective after us; you had better warn the people; it has already been done at Stepney," and Treadgold's reply was "Don't trouble, all the b—'s on earth can't catch us"—on that morning Parsonage did not take a ticket at Stepney—I have never seen Parsonage take a ticket, though I have travelled with him several times, nor go near the ticket clippers to have his ticket clipped—Jordan and Bodger were on duty at the Fenchurch Street Station on one occasion, and a man named Hollingshead was there—I saw him take out a lot of tickets from his pockets, and give away one or two—I never saw Parsonage go by the Tilbury line—I have seen Edward Avery repeatedly in the booking-office—when Parsonage introduced me to Bodger, he said I was a friend of his, it was all right—I have seen Bodger put his hands into his pockets and pull out tickets, on several occasions—I have seen J. T. Avery pull out hundreds at a time, and sort them out—I have seen Bodger hand tickets to Parsonage—I received this first-class ticket from Jordan on 10th August, No. 7061, first, single to Blackwall—that was given to me at Fenchurch Street, just at the nipping place.</p>

I am an Inspector of the Police of the Great Eastern Railway Company, and also of the Metropolitan Police, and have been so seven-teen years—I met Melhuish on one occasion in July, at the house of a mutual friend—he said something in my presence—I said nothing while the ladies were present, but afterwards I made inquiries, and asked for an interview with him—in consequence of what he said I gave him directions, and from that time until the prisoners were taken into custody he was acting under my directions, and met me from time to time—the 16th July was the first day upon which he showed me a ticket—he produced it to me on the day on which it is dated, about 4.30 in the afternoon, and I initialed it and saw him write on it; I met him just as he alighted from the train at the Stepney Station; I received from him from time to time all the tickets he has mentioned—I received each ticket on the day on which it bears date, about five or ten minutes after he arrived at the station where I appointed to meet him—I initialed every one of them, and saw him write on them—on Saturday, 16th July, I saw Parsonage leave his house, 26, York Street, Stepney—I followed him through the Stepney Station to Fenchurch Street—he passed the booking-office, and took no ticket and gave up none—Melhuish was walking with him—I next saw him on Monday, 18th, at Stepney—I followed him from his door—he passed as on Saturday, took no ticket, and gave none up—Melhuish came up with him; Melhuish took a ticket and he gave it up—when we got to the top of the staircase I saw one of the Company's servants, Rutterford, point to me and call Parsonage's attention to me—he made some observation, but I could not catch what it was—I followed on till we got to the Fenchurch Street Station—Parsonage alighted from the train, and he kept looking round as if looking to see if anyone was behind him—I got into the carriage again, and got out on the other side, so that I had an opportunity of seeing him when he was walking on—I passed through</p>

               <p>on the same platform as he, within a yard of him, as he passed the barrier he passed a man of the name of Treadgold, whose duty it was to take the tickets—he passed him without giving up any ticket, or even taking his hands from his pocket—he went outside, and into Austin's public-home with Melhuish, and was in conversation for some time—they were then joined by Treadgold—I then went some little distance from the station, where I was then joined by Melhuish, and made arrangements as regards the evening—I met him at 4.45, at the Stepney Station—he then handed me a third-class single ticket, No. 7092, from Fenchurch Street to Black-wall—this is the ticket—on 22nd, about 5 o'clock, I received a ticket from Melhuish for Shad well Station—I received all the tickets from Melhuish I have repeatedly seen Melhuish and Jordan in Foster's public-house; when I have been standing at the private bar—on 4th August, about 7 o'clock in the evening, I met Melhuish at Fenchurch Street; he went into the book-ing-office—shortly after he came and joined me at Foster's public-house, and brought me two first-class tickets, Nos. 2415 and 2445, from Fenchurch Street to Black wall—I gave him certain directions—he returned to the station—I saw him enter the station, and I took a cab, and went to Shad-well Station, where I met him again a few minutes after—he then handed me another ticket, which I now produce, No. 2932, third-class from Fen-church Street to Limehouse—on Saturday, 13th August, I saw Melhuish, A very, and Jordan, in at Foster's public-house, drinking brandy and soda-Carter was there also—after they left, Carter came back to me and handed me three first<lb></lb>class tickets, Nos. 9159, 9152, and 9164, from Fenchurch Street to the West India Docks—shortly after receiving those from Carter, I received this one from Melhuish, No. 9154, first-class—that was the fifth ticket I received that day from Melhuish—after giving him directions as before, I took a cab and joined him at the Shadwell Station—Carter, Mel<lb></lb>huish, A very, and Jordan, after leaving the public-house, returned in the direction of the booking-office, and went in there—shortly after I saw A very come out of the booking-office with a tall gentleman; I saw him give him a first-class ticket, the same description as this—I saw the gentleman hold it up, and I could see distinctly that it was a first<lb></lb>class ticket, and clipped—he went into the public-house with the gentleman, and had some brandy and water with him—I did not on any occasion see Parsonage with any tickets, or do anything with any, nor Jordan or Bodger—on Monday 15th August, Carter made a communication to me as I was in Foster's public-house, which induced me to enter the booking-office—he at the same time handed me a ticket—when I went into the booking-office, I saw Joseph Avery, who was the booking-clerk—he put his finger and thumb in to right-hand waistcoat pocket, and I saw that he had tickets between his finger and thumb; he being known by the name of "Little Joe," I said "No, Joe, let them be," and I seized his hand and took twenty-two tickets from it, which had all been clipped and used—I have all those tickets here, and produce them—thirteen of them had been issued on that day, and eight dated the 13th—the 15th was Monday—the Saturday return tickets would not be available—while I was searching him Edward Avery ran out of the office as fast as he could go, followed by Mr. Headington, the superintendent—he was brought back into the office—I saw hint throw two first-class tickets under the office table—they were also clipped, and dated that day—I believe they were first-class tickets from Fenchurch Street to Blackwill—I then went outside the booking-office door, and found ten other tickets</p>

               <p>on the partition that projects out from the boards, just outside the booking-office door—he had passed close to it—they were found within reach of where he was passing—every one of them were clipped, and all of them issued that day—I saw a coat hanging on a peg in the booking-office—I asked Joseph Avery whose coat it was—he said Jordan's.—I afterwards spoke to Jordan about it, and he said it was his coat—I felt it, and felt some tickets, and Mr. Headington took them out, six single tickets, all had been clipped—I took possession of the coat—I told the two Averys I should take them both into custody for stealing these tickets—I took them to the station—the charge was taken—Joseph Avery put out his hand as he was leaving the police-station, and said "I hope you won't be hard with me"—the other said nothing—after the Averys were locked up, I returned to the Fenchurch Street Station—I saw Parsonage enter the station—he passed the booking-office where the tickets were issued, through into another lobby, till he got to the bottom of the staircase where Bodger was collecting tickets, and where he would nip them—he said something to Parsonage, and pointed towards me—Par<lb></lb>sonage then returned to the window where the tickets were issued, and took a ticket, again joining Bodger at the bottom of the staircase—they had some conversation—both their backs being towards me, I walked up between them, and remarked to Parsonage, "Parsonage, you are obliged to take a ticket at last, are you"—he made no answer—I then turned to Bodger, and said "Bodger, you have allowed this man to pass prior to this some hundreds of times, without even asking him for a ticket"—he made no reply—I did nothing with them then—on the morning of the 17th, I met Parsonage at the Stepney Station—I told him that I was an inspector of police, and apprehended him for being concerned with others in stealing a quantity of tickets, the property of the Great Eastern Railway Company—he stood still, made no reply for some little time; when he recovered, he said "What do you charge me with?"—I repeated it—he made no answer—we got into the train and proceeded to London—on our way he said "It is a bad job, I suppose I shall lose my situation"—on the 18th I apprehended Bodger—I told him also he was charged with being concerned with others in stealing tickets—he made no answer—I took him to the police-station—the charge was read over to him by the inspector who took it; his reply was "I hear what you say"—Treadgold, Rutterford, and the others who have been mentioned, have been dismissed—inquiry was made—no proposal was made to take their evidence—that is the subject of another inquiry, I think, hereafter—I gave Carter directions, he was a clerk in the police-office—I also gave Richardson instructions—they communicated with me from time to time—I went with them to the station they departed from, and met them on their arrival—Carter gave me these tickets on the day they were dated—I saw their reports daily, as they were made—on Joseph Avery I found some money done up in small paper packages, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in one and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the other, in his trowsers pocket—I asked him what he was going to do with the paper done up in parcels in his pockets—he said he was going to pay it away—I found altogether 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, these two packages, and about 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in loose silver, upwards of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether.</p>

               <p>given me by Carter; the same description as the one I have got in my hand—the ticket was given just outside the public-house, behind a blind that was up inside—I think Joseph Avery has been in the employment of the Company about fourteen years—he received his salary every fortnight, I believe—he was taken into custody on Monday the 15th, and he had received it the Friday before—I know there was a day fixed for the collectors to receive their salary.</p>

On the 22d of March, I think Saturday night, I lost a silver watch, a looking glass, in a wooden frame, it was while I was asleep, in the dead of the night, between twelve and one o'clock. My lord, I inadvertently said I was asleep. I entertain lodgers; I am a gang master to the canal. It was of a Saturday night, and we pay the men once a fortnight; this Saturday night somebody came and knocked at the door, and my wife went to the window to know who it was, and they said it was the lodgers; she put on her petticoats, and went down and opened the door, and in rushed two men that had worked for me, besides the lodger, one was

             was one? - Because he first entered the room, and Leatherby followed him, and there was a large window by my right hand, and he came and drawed the curtain on me, and pretended that he came for money that was due to him; he had worked for me about a month before that, and he insisted on the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other? - William Leatherby; I see him; they both came up to the bed side by my right hand and told their names, and said they were come for their money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you owe them any thing? - Yes. Barber was a great masculine man; and he took me by the collar of my shirt; I told him not to use me ill, to come on Sunday morning, and it should be settled; Barber held me by the shirt and right arm; and Leatherby went to the foot of the bed, and drawed the bed from under me, and left me at last on the sacking, and I held the top of the clothes on with my left hand. Then my wife dressed herself, she says, I have lost my pockets; but I don't accuse them of that, because she got them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of the men got her pockets at any time? - No, Leatherby had not got her pockets, nor do I charge them with it. Barber pulled me about terribly, and dislocated my right arm, and I never shall have the right use of it any more; and Leatherby was searching about for the breeches and pockets, whilst Barber was laying on me; after this my wife says, Barber, says she, go down and get a light, and my husband shall settle with you, and told them they should be paid what their demand was; and he said, no, I shall not go down stairs, d-mn you, you old b-ch; and they said they would throw us down stairs to the mercy of the people that were under, and there was a vast number of seditious people got about at that time. Then they went on and took me by the shirt and by the right<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040008"></xptr>arm, and I struggled hard, and got me out of bed, as soon as I was out I was on my feet, and I saw a light come into the room, I see an arm slide it in at the doorway, about six or eight inches; but who brought it there I cannot tell, and then two of the foremen came into my assistance, and my wife took the light and looked at my bed side, and saw my watch was gone; says she, my dear, your watch is gone; Barber then went down stairs, and no person stopped him; this Leatherby was stopped, the foremen that he went towards put their hands into his pocket, and searched him, and there was nothing found, and he was let go; and I don't know that I have any more to say with regard to the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came into your house when your wife went down to open the door? - A gang master, he lodged there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with him? - No, not then.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the gang master? -  I don't know where he is now; he went up into his own apartment at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. He never offered to help you at all? - He was the man that brought that light, as he told us afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact he did not come into your room to help you at all? - He did not</p>
               <p>Q. Had Leatherby or Barber ever lodged there before? - They never had.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever got any part of your things again? - No part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the looking glass? - In the stair case window.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had your watch when you went to bed? - Yes; I and my wife can both assert that, because she saw me wind it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your looking glass on the stair case window the over night, when you went to bed? - I cannot swear that.</p>

               <p>I and my husband we were both in bed to ether, and there was some person rapped at the door, and I went to the window to know who it was, and they said it was the lodger, and I put on my petticoat, and went down, and opened the door, and the lodger came in, and two men, Barber and Leatherby, came in and rushed by me, and went into the room, and he began using my husband ill, and I told them to go and get a light; and Barber said, d-mn you, you old b-ch, I will throw you down stairs, and we will tear you in pieces; and they behaved in a very barbarous manner to my husband, and used him very ill indeed; and we cried murder! and some person brought a light, but I don't know who slided it on the stairs, and when the light came, I saw this man, Leatherby, he drawed the bed, and then I was afraid of my pockets, but afterwards I promiscuously found my pockets and had them; at last they drawed my husband out of bed, and then these foremen came into the room and asked them what they were about, and then they were told that they should have the money in the morning, and they said that they would not stop till the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said they should have it in the morning? - My husband said so, and I told them so. We expected nothing but murder every minute; when the foreman came in just at the door, then this Barber rushed out, and I went round to the bed side, and I missed the watch, and I said, my dear, you have lost your watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said that before or after Barber rushed out? - Before.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw Barber afterwards? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the glass? - That was gone; I saw the glass the night before I went to bed, at the window.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040009"></xptr>Q. Were they drunk? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I worked for this man on the Canal eight days and a quarter; we were paid once a fortnight on a Saturday night, at a public house, at Uxbridge; when we came to take our money, I called for some beer and victuals, and we sat there for about two hours, and he went out after his money, never paid us, and left us to pay our reckoning, and so we did not know what to do, and we went and called this Mr. Douglas, the foreman, to get some money to rescue us out of pawn, and we thought it was hard to go home without our money, and we went to Mr. Hallatt's house along with the lodger, and Mrs. Hallatt came down and opened the door, and we went up stairs, and went and asked him for the money, and he would not pay us; we said it was a sad case that we must not have our money to pay our way; he said we should not have it; Mrs. Hallatt says, you shall have it in the morning; he says, no, I will not pay it you; Mr. Douglas came into the room, and we were charged with the watch and glass, but I never knew any thing about the watch.</p>
               <p>Court to Hallatt. How much was there due from you to Leatherby and Barber? - I suppose about a guinea. The foreman rents a shop of me, and he told them as he rented a shop of me it should be settled the next morning. Six of the men that worked with me went home quiet, but these two would not; I was to receive the money of the foreman, and I was to pay them; there was a shop bill to be settled; it was at Uxbridge we were paid.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told them that the bill should be paid the next morning, did Leatherby or Barber make any objection? - Leatherby came up to my bed side and wrung his sift at me.</p>

            Did you see these men at all on the evening before? - Yes, and parted from them; there was a dispute between me and the foreman, that we could not get money enough to pay them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see this man yourself in the course of the evening before? - Yes, when I was with the foreman I took all the eight men to Uxbridge to pay them there, at the sign of the Bell, and when I got there there was no person came there for an hour, or an hour and a half after; there was a dispute between the foreman and me about the work, and I went away without saying any thing to the men why I did not pay them, I was afraid; the foreman told them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a pauper in St. Giles's workhouse; the prisoner was also a pauper—on the 10th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I was walking up and down the yard—the prisoner was sharp<lb></lb>ening her knife for her dinner—she had a bit of oakum sticking on her nose—I was laughing at her, and asked why she did not take it away, be<lb></lb>cause she looked foolish—sh" called me a stinking, rotten wh—, knocked me down, and tore my bonnet off my head—I caught hold of her bonnet, and then she cut my arm and hand with the knife—I do not say that she did it on purpose—she cut me twice on one arm, and once; on the other—she is subject to fits, and is rather weak in her understanding—she has been a good while in the workhouse—she was there before me.</p>

                  </hi>. I was walking up and down the yard with Repuke. The prisoner had a bit of oakum stuffed up her nostril—it hung down—she looked very odd—Repuke laughed and said, what a simple girl she made of herself, to make people laugh at her—she was cleaning her knife on one of the stones—I do not know whether she is light in her head—I have not been in the house long—she called Repuke a very bad name, caught hold of her bonnet and cap, and tore it off—Repuke caught hold of the front of the prisoner's bonnet, and tore it—I then saw the prisoner strike her with the knife twice on her left arm—I suppose she did it on purpose.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon, residing in St. Giles's workhouse. I have known the prisoner since last Jan. twelvemonths—she is very frequently subject to fits—she is a person of weak intellect at all times, but after the fits, on several occasions, she has been so bad as to be absolutely under restraint—Repuke came to me with a very extensive cut in her left arm above three inches in length, and nearly a quarter of an inch deep—it was not at all dangerous—there was a second cut on the same arm, and a third on the right arm—there must have been three blows—a knife is just the sort of instrument that might hare inflicted them.</p>

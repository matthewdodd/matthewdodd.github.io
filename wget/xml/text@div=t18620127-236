                  </hi>. I live at Prebend-street, Islington, and am a wholesale milliner—the prisoner is my brother—on Tuesday, 3rd December, I met him at Islington-green, quite accidentally—I went with him to a coffee-shop on Islington-green—I had seen him nearly two years before this meeting—I had been abroad in that two years—he requested me to meet him to see a friend of his in the Green-lanes, on the following Thursday—he did not say for what reason—I met him on the Thursday in the Lower-road—we walked a short way down the Lower-road—he said it was not convenient to see his friend that night; but I was to meet him on the Friday evening—nothing passed that night except when I have stated—I was to have met him at 7 o'clock on Friday—I did not get home till 8, so I could not go to meet him—he met me on Saturday morning, between 9 and 10, at King's Cross, at the corner of the Caledouian-road—he said a friend of his had informed him that I went that way every Saturday morning—he said, "You did not meet me last night; but it is of no conse<lb></lb>quence, to-night will do as well"—I agreed to meet him that night, at 7 o'clook, in the same place, Northampton-street—I met him at quarter-past 7 that Saturday evening—he had a parcel in his hand, and he said he wished to leave the parcel in the Ball's Pond-road, as he knew a coffee-shop there—we then went up Northampton-street, and turned to the right, and proceeded as far as the Islington and Ball's Pond-road station—we bore off to the right, and turned down a lane—I don't know the name of it; but it took us nearly facing the coffee-shop he mentioned—he left me waiting there while he took the parcel into the coffee-shop—when he returned to me, he said, "That is all right; I have left it"—we then proceeded up St. Paul's-terrace—he wanted to go up a narrow lane that leads up to a tavern—I said to him, "If you want to go to the Green-lanes, why not go round by way of the green, it is cleaner than this way"—he said he wanted to see his friend</p>

               <p>by 8 o'clock, an there was not time, that was the nearest way, or words to that effect—we then went that way—we went up the road by the side of the canal, or rather a pathway by the side of the river—not the tide that' is usually frequented by foot passengers; but the side where there had been a quantity of bricks standing for some time—I said to him then, "Why don't you cross over the bridge and walk on the other side, it is so very muddy on this side?"—he said. "Oh, never mind that, you can easily wash a little mud off your boots"—he asked me to walk by myself, as he was well known about that quarter—I said it made no difference to me—he walked on first, and left me—it was close by Paul's-terrace that he made that remark; but I cannot say exactly at what spot—we then proceeded a little farther, and he said, "Is that a man and a woman standing there"—I said, "No; it is only your fancy"—we walked about three parts of the way up the path, and he said, "Walk a little further in that direction"—that was pointing from the river I walked back a few steps, and he struck me a violent blow on the head—I turned half round—he repeated the blows several times, and I fell down—he then caught hold of my coat and waistcoat, and endeavoured to drag me towards the water—with a violent straggle I managed to get away from him, or he must have got me in—I saw afterwards that I had lost part of my waistcoat—it was in his hand—he then commernced striking me over the heads second time—he had a life-preserver in his hand the first time—it was after the second number of blows that he put the life-preserver on the ground—I dis<lb></lb>tinctly saw him lay it down, after palling me towards the water the first time—the second time he attacked me with the life-preserver he laid it down on the ground—the first blow on the bead was with a life-preserver—he tried to drag me to the river the first time with it in his hand—it was after that he laid it down—I distinctly saw him take it up again, and he repeated the blows over my head again the second time—he then caught hold of me by my scarf, and endeavoured again to drag me towards the water—it was a scarf that I wear with my collar—I resisted as well as I could, and the scarf broke away from my neck—he then looked about for the life-preserver, picked the up, and began striking me over the head the third time—I then pulled the life-preserver out of his hand, and threw it from me—he did not take it up again—that was the last time he struck me—he then caught hold of me by the collar of my coat, and endeavoured to drag me into the river the third time, and I then slid down the embankment, and ran and walked away as well as I could—he ran past me towards a pile of bricks, and I fell into a pit—he came to the edge of the pit, and said, "Come out of there, what do you want down there in the pit?"—I said, "You wicked villain, to get away from you; I know you wish to murder me"—he made no further reply—I then got out of the pit, and ran towards a brick wall—I came to the brick wall, and tried to get over it—I clambered over it, and fell on the other side—while I was doing so the prisoner caught hold of me by the tails of my coat to endeavour to pull me back—he did not do so; I fell over—over the next wall I saw a light—I had two walls to get over—I got over the second wall—the light was in the kitchen of a house—I went into the area, knocked violently at the window, and called out "Murder!"—a man came out and assisted me—I went with him to a surgeon's, and afterwards to St. Bartho<lb></lb>lomew's hospital—I have been suffering ever since from the effects.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Some time ago my brother lost his character in the City. I went to his house one Sunday, and found him in great destitution. I enabled him to the best of my ability to go abroad; he said he would repay me if he could do so. He went to New Zealand, and returned, not having accumulated any cash. He went again, and returned, and started in business; he had previously started in business, but failed. When he returned he said to my friends he did not mean to do anything for me; he ridiculed what I had done for him, and said it was only to answer my own purpose and for my own ends. I lent him to the amount of 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I have known the time when he has refused me bread. He provoked and aggravated me so that I did what I never thought of doing. He has taken things from me and from my sister, and sold them through his wife, and he has told my friends that I merely assisted him to gain my own ends. I hope you will take the matter into consideration before you pass sentence on me. I had no intention at the time to murder; I was so excited that I scarcely knew what I was about.</p>

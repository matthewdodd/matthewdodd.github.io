On Tuesday, the 4th of August, in the evening, nearly eight o'clock, or a little after, I believe, I was writing at the desk, the corner of the warehouse, and the prisoner came pretty near me before I perceived him; he asked some question about the Portsmouth waggon and the White Hart; I told him that the Portsmouth waggons came to the White Hart, in the Borough; he said, is there not a White Hart in this street? I said, no; I asked him if he had any thing? he said, yes; and turned round, and I see part of a box in his hand behind, under his coat; and I followed him, and he went rather hastily out, and I repeated it, let me see the direction, sir, several times.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a great coat he had on? - No, it was not a great coat. After he got from the warehouse door, perhaps eight or ten yards, he spoke very loud, he is coming, he is coming, two or three times to a man that was standing in the gateway; he ran off, and I after them, and he dropped the box just where he stood in the gateway, and I stopped and brought the box back to the warehouse; I followed him no further. Mr. Omerley said they must have the contents of the box, and I carried it to their house in Great Russel-street myself; I put my seal on it, and other marks; I am sure it is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you get at the prisoner again? - I carried it back into the warehouse, and immediately returned back to the gateway, and he was being brought in at the gateway before I reached the outer part of the gateway; it was not two minutes first.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the same man was brought back to you as you see drop the box? - I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of it? - I don't know, perhaps a shilling; at that time it had books and papers, which I don't know the contents.</p>


               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Pray, what time was this? - Not long after eight if any; I had had a candle some time; it was a dark place where I wrote, especially when waggons stand against the window.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have the misfortune not to see very well? - Thank God I see very well.</p>
               <p>Q. You wear spectacles? - People at my time of life generally do.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in this situation that you see the person who asked you about the Portsinouth waggon? - He came near, within about a yard; I had a candle burning that gave a good light.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lost sight of the person after the box was dropped, before the person who really is the prisoner, was brought back? - Not much more than a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the inn that the box was dropped? - It was in the Inn gateway, in Friday-street, two doors from Watling-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You never knew the man before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160094"></xptr>Q. You have described this to be the person that keeps the inn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not there at that time? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you stick up notice that you will not be answerable for any box that may be lost, in consequence of the great business that you have got? - No, we do not. At the time that the embargo was laid there was a bill stuck up, that we were sorry that we could not forward the goods, and hoped people would not be offended, and that we could not be answerable for the goods in case of fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, who are in partnership with Mr. Russell? - Nobody at all; there formerly were two others, but not at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in the yard when the box was taken? - I was. I don't know what conversation passed between Mr. Bancrost and the prisoner, but I see the man come out of the warehouse with the box in his hand (I really believe it to be the prisoner) he stepped on two or three steps, and then he put the box under his his left arm; Mr. Bancroft followed him, and said, I insist upon seeing the direction before you go any further; he kept walking on, did not answer, and he mended his pace, walking faster till he got on a run down the gateway. I was close after Mr. Bancroft when he dropped the box, and Mr. Bancroft stooped for the box, and I pursued after the prisoner at the bar; he set on a run as fast as he could possibly run; I kept up close to him; I had a catch once or twice till I got to Watling-street, and then I took him; I did not see the box again till I came back to the warehouse with the prisoner; I see him before with the box, and see him let it fall by the side of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same man that you see let the box fall, that you ran after and took? - I verily believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him from the time he dropped the box? - No. This is the box.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. I believe your's is a pretty large inn yard, is it not? - No, we call it a small yard.</p>
               <p>Q. An inn of considerable business? - Yes, some business.</p>
               <p>Q. Several persons coming in the course of the day for goods; besides which you have a coffee room and a tap room open for all comers and goers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Towards the hour of eight, when it becomes rather dusk, you have a good many frequent this place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you and Mr. Bancroft called stop thief? - The tap boy called out stop thief! and then I likewise, and, I suppose half a dozen more.</p>
               <p>Q. Several persons collected together? - There were not above three or four where I took hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you the man that first took hold of him, or a gentleman in the street? - A gentleman coming from St. Paul's, along Watling-street, said, I believe you are the thief; and he rather turned him into my hands; I was close after him; I said, yes, sir, this is the thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that you believed he was, but you was not sure, you would ask Mr. Bancroft? Have you never said so? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. When that person was laid hold of, did he make any resistance? - He said, you are wrong; I am not the person; you are greatly mistaken. I said, you must go along with me; says he, I will go along with you any where.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say he was an housekeeper, effered you his address immediately, and said he would go wherever you pleased? - He did.</p>

I had been to Pitt-street, Blackfriars; on my return home I called at one Mr. Thacker's, right opposite the Old-bailey; I was going from there to Whitechapel, I went by the back of St. Paul's, just as I entered Watling street, I heard the cry of stop thief! I did not run, I was on a sharp walk; a gentleman says to me, are you the person they are crying after? I made a reply, I am not; and the two men came up and said, where is he? is this the man. I told them I would go any where in the world with them. In every examination I shewed them I was an innocent man, and could have made my escape, but I would not.</p>

This must have been about eight o'clock, for I was at Cante bury-square at half past eight.</p>

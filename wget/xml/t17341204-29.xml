I said I don't care if I do; and so I went in, but knowing it to be an ill House, I thought it prudent to take care of my Money, and part the Gold from the Silver. I had a Guinea, and 7 s. 6 d.

I felt, and mist my 7 Shillings: I presently examined t'other Pocket, and the Guinea was gone too - I suppose the young one got that - What says I, Do you rob me? Ye Dog, says the old one, Do ye breed a Riot in my House? I got up, and threatned to make 'em suffer for it; and just as I was going out, the old Woman offer'd me the Silver, and said, Here, take your Seven Shillings; but I refused it, and went to Mr. Kelly, and told him how I had been rob'd: He said I was rightly serv'd, for he did not know what Business I had in a Bawdy-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Ramsbotham. About the 10th of September the prisoner called at my master's counting-house, (I did not know him before) and wished to purchase some low-priced sherries, saying he had been referred to us by Mr. Lindsay—I told him Mr. Rams<lb></lb>botham was not at home, but he had two or three parcels that were just landed in the London and St. Katherine Docks, and I appointed him to meet Mr. Ramsbotham at the Docks—Mr. Ramsbotham could not go, and</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business in Dunstan-court, Mincing-lane. On the 11th of September last, I went to St. Katharine's Docks in consequence of an appointment made by my clerk—I saw the prisoner there—he was a stranger to me—he said he had been told that I had some wines on the quay, which would suit his purpose, and he wished me to make a bargain with him for them—he wished to offer me a price for them—he had already seen them with my clerk in the morning—he looked at them again, and said they would suit him—he talked about other wines, saying he wanted to purchase very largely of other qualities—atlast it was decided that he would have these four butts, eight hogsheads, and four quarter-casks, which formed one parcel, and he would call on me next day about it—he told me he was a man of property, but was not much known in the market—that he had lately had cash left him, and he in<lb></lb>tended to pay cash for every thing he bought—he called on me next morn<lb></lb>ing, between ten and eleven o'clock—the price was then named, and fixed at 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per butt, which would be altogether 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him for a reference—he told me he always wished to satisfy parties he did business with—that he intended to name a party he had been travelling for, but he had had a dispute with the house, and consequently would not wish to refer me there, but he stated he had lately come into possession of property, which he had received as heir to his father—I told him he had said he in<lb></lb>tended it to be a cash transaction—he said he intended to pay cash, but that that day he was short, and he would give me the title-deeds of his property, of which he had lately come into possession, as security for the payment of the money in the course of a few days, and he produced to me this deed—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—he particularly pointed out to me this part, that it was to be held by Thomas Trevethen, his father, his heirs and assigns, as absolute property, and stated that the property was waste land at the time the document was written, but it had been built on, and was then worth 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in accounting for the indorsement on it, he said that a short time before it had been in the hands of some party for an advance of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but as this would only be for a few days, it was not worth while indorsing it again—he depo<lb></lb>sited the deed with me as security for the payment—he then asked me for the transfers, as he could not get the wines, or transfer them to any other party before I had transferred them to him—I ultimately gave him the wine warrants, in consequence of the representations he made with respect to this instrument—I had refused to do so before—I parted with them be<lb></lb>lieving what he said was true—I have never received any cash since—I had occasion to leave town on the Saturday after I had parted with the warrants, the 15th, and Mr. Ramsay, a friend of mine, undertook the management</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183811260189"></xptr>
               <p>of my business in my absence—I mentioned to him the transaction be<lb></lb>tween the prisoner and myself, under what circumstances I had agreed with him, and what had been deposited with me—I never authorised Mr. Ramsay to take bills of exchange in payment from the prisoner for the wine—it was arranged in the first instance that I was to be paid immedi<lb></lb>ately-subsequently, in the after part of the day, when the prisoner had got possession of the warrant, he said he thought he probably should not be able to pay cash so soon, but part of the property that would come to him on the 29th of September would be in cash—I remonstrated against this delay, but as I was obliged to leave town immediately, I had no alternative—some of the wine is gone from the Docks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you not had some of the warrants back again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not any, I believe the officer has three warrants for hogsheads, but they form a very small part of the whole, which was twenty hogsheads—some bills of exchange were sent under an envelope, during my absence, to my counting-house, but they have never been received as payment—some of them are on a Mr. Bragg of Bristol—Mr. Bragg has not given me up any warrants—Mr. Bragg waited on me some time ago, and made an offer to give up part of the wines he had, on my cancelling the bills against him, which he stated had been obtained by Mr. Trevethen under false pretences, but I have since discovered that Mr. Bragg has got an ad<lb></lb>vance on those wines, and they are no longer in his power to de<lb></lb>liver to me—I understand Mr. Bragg is a man of no responsibility at all—he told me he could not pay 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. towards the bills—he did not tell me his wife was a person of property—he said she had no property—the prisoner told me that Mr. Bragg's wife was a person, of property—that he had got a bond on her property—I believe he said so when we first talked about the parties to whom the wine was going—when I found that the money was not forthcoming, I called on the prisoner to know what he had done with the wines, and he gave a kind of history of what he had done or was going to do with them—he mentioned Mr. Bragg as a person to whom he had parted with some—he did not name him as a person whose bills he would give me—decidedly not—there was no talk about bills at all—he men<lb></lb>tioned Mr. Bragg as a highly respectable tradesman of Bristol-now I happened to know Bristol very well—I referred to the name of Bragg, and asked who he was—he said he had been for a long time with a house he named, which an intimate friend of mine had lately established—that he was going to be one of his greatest friends and correspondents, and that he had got security from Mr. Bragg to the extent of 4 or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a bond, I understood him to say, of some property of his wife's or family's—the bills on Mr. Bragg were one of 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the wine he had was worth 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner was apprehended on the 29th of October—I delivered him the warrant on the 11th of September.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there not a further shipment of wines agreed for between you and the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not agreed for—he wished me to make an agree<lb></lb>ment for them, and of course if he had paid me the cash for these I should with pleasure have gone on in further business with him—this deed was not given as a deposit for any further shipments-nothing of the kind was mentioned—one of the bills that were sent was on a Mr. Phillips for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Phillips has never called on me and offered me the money on my taking off the discount—I never heard any thing of the kind—I have seen Mr. Phillips—the bill is payable at Smith, Payne and</p>

               <p>Smith—the object of his calling on me was to tell me it was at Mr. Trevethen's request that he accepted the bill, and that he made it payable at Smith's, at Mr. Trevethen's request, because it would look better—his object in calling was not to pay the bill—he never offered to pay it, on my making a reduction.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, and live in George-street, Minories. About the 13th or 14th of September, I was requested by Mr. Ramsbotham to take charge of his business during his absence for a few weeks—I did so, and saw the prisoner at Mr. Ramsbotham's counting-house—I told him that in undertaking the management of Mr. Rams<lb></lb>botham's business during his absence, and he telling me he had transactions with him for four butts of wine then on the quay, I wished to know his account of it—he mentioned something about giving bills, and some were afterwards sent to the counting-house—I had received no authority from the prosecutor to take bills in payment—I never received them in pay<lb></lb>ment, only as a deposit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> A bill is always a deposit—I suppose you took them, and if they were paid it was all right, if not, yon held the man re<lb></lb>sponsible who had the goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The bills had four months to run—I could not have taken them in that sense—the prisoner was to pay the amount by the 9th of September, but in the mean time he deposited the bills as security—the prisoner told me that he had given Mr. Ramsbothan security for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner brought one bill to the Dock in the first instance—that was on Bragg and Co. of Bristol—I took that bill, but not in payment—I told him at the time I took it, that I wanted the money—I cannot tell on what day it was—it was between the 14th and 29th of September—he again repeated that on the 29th of September, he would bring the money—he had the warrants in his possession at the time—I saw him about the Docks everyday, and was every day urging him for the money-very likely eight days might elapse between his giving me the first bill and my receiving the others—he gave me another on Mr. Bragg, which I discovered was an altered bill—I recommended him to draw it afresh for his own safety—he said he had no change to purchase a stamp, and Mr. Ramsbotham's clerk gave him the money for it—he afterwards brought the bill properly drawn and left it with me—I have the bills here—they are drawn at four months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not a bill at four months in the wine trade reckoned cash? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—nor at three months-not even bankers' bills, if they have only one month to run—I gave the bills to Mr. Ramsbotham's clerk to lock up till his return, and I was urging in the mean time payment of the money from the prisoner.</p>

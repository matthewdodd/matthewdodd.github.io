            . I am a watch-house-keeper. The prosecutor was brought into the watch-house intoxicated, about one o'clock. He was put into the lock-up-room, and went to sleep. The prisoner was afterwards brought in, charged with some offence. I searched him - He had no watch about him then; I put him into the same room with the prosecutor - nobody else was in the room that night. About four o'clock, the prosecutor got sober, and complained of losing his watch and money - He said he had it safe when he was brought in. I found the watch in the prisoner's stocking, on his leg-Hall claimed it.</p>

On 13th May I was on duty at Rich<lb></lb>mond—I was in George-street, between 2 and 3 in the morning—King-street runs into George-street—I heard somebody hallooing, shouting, and making a great noise at the other end of the street—I went there, and saw several</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186207070075"></xptr>
               <p>persons going down Brewer's-lane—I walked down, and saw the prisoner—he stepped on a door step—I turned my light on to him, and he said, "What do you want to turn your light on me for?"—I said, "To see who you are"—he said, "You go away from me, or I will report you, and get your coat off your back"—I walked away, and he followed me, hallooing after me "Come here," he said, "I will fight you for what you like"—he then said, "I will go to the station and report you"—he turned off towards the station, and I turned in a different direction—I walked round my beat, and saw no more of him for half an hour, and when I was near the baths, about two minutes walk from the police-station, I saw him coming towards me—he came close up to me, put his foot against mine, and tripped my feet from under me on to the ground—I was not near enough to strike him before that—he struck me with his left hand on the right eye, and closed it up immediately—when on the ground he kicked me on the nose, and laid my nose right open—as soon as he saw me getting up, he struck me with both fists right and left on each side of the jaw; and as I lay on the ground he kicked me on my mouth, loosened ell my front teeth, and turned one tooth light round—I became not quite insensible, and felt two dreadful blows on my left side, either from a kick or a hit; I cannot say which—I was covered with blood from the blow on the nose—I then heard him run away, and became insensible—I afterwards roused up, and found myself lying in a pool of blood—I got hold of the wall to crawl to the station—I met another con<lb></lb>stable, Redfern, who accompanied me to the prisoner's house—we knocked at the door—the prisoner came, and Redfern said to me, "Is that the man?"—I said, "Yes, that is the man who assaulted me"—we took him in custody—he said to Redfern, "I will go quietly with you"—there is no truth in the statement that I challenged the prisoner to fight—I am still suffering—I have been vomiting blood and large pieces of flesh this length.</p>

               <p>—it was all done like lightning—it was not a voluntary act between the two of us—you did not lay, "Smith, I have reported you for this assault"—you never mentioned any word except, "Now I will give it you"—you did not say, "Do you consider yourself a man to strike me without provocation at my own door?" or, "I do not like to report you, but if you will fight me like a man, I will fight you and forgive you"—you have not submittted to my violence on several occasion—I never interfered with you in my life—I have not struck you dozens of times in George-street, and pushed you; never in my life—I never spoke to you but once, and that was at the police-court, when I said, "The Court is not open; you cannot come in"—you did not report me on this morning—between seven and eight months ago you stopped me, and asked me what time the court opened—I never in my life said to you, "You have reported one of our fellows, have you not?"—I said to you at the court, when you were coming in, "The Court is not open yet; the Magistrate has not come"—I do not know that you were there to report a constable for striking you—you went out at my bidding and I said that I would call you when the Court was opened—I do not know whether anybody called you, but you came in—you reported nobody—you gave evidence in favour of a drunken man—when we knocked at your door, you did not say, "Smith, what do you want to follow me here for?"—you might have said a great deal, but I only heard what I have said—I did not strike you; I was not near enough, except at the time you tripped me up—I did not know that that was your house, or I should not have gone to Hamblin's for you—there were three policemen besides me to apprehend you—I swear that you said you would go with us—I saw nobody collar you.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, V</hi> 213). On 13th May, about half-past 2 in the morning, I met Smith in Brewer's-lane, covered with blood, his eyes closed, and his nose broken—I went with him and another constable, No. 360, to the prisoner's house—I knocked at the door, and he came down and said, "I know what you have come for; I will go back"—Smith said, "That is the man who assaulted me"—I took the prisoner—he had been drinking, but he knew perfectly well what was going on.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I am in practice at Richmond—on the morning of 13th May, the prosecutor was brought to my surgery, suffering from dreadful contusions on the head and face—there was a great deal of blood about his face, which came from his nose—his right eye was com<lb></lb>pletely closed; his head was in a dreadful state; he was hardly recognisable—he was sent home, and on examining him I found he had other injuries—he had difficulty of breathing, and incipient cough, which led to a further examination, and we found that he was suffering from injury to the lungs, no doubt brought about by some immediate cause—he lay in danger, on and off, for four or five weeks, and my opinion was that it would terminate very badly—I continued to attend him up to the present time, and he has still consolidation of the right lung, and there is a cicatrix, an adhesion of the lung to the pleura—it seemed to me to have been caused by a kick or com<lb></lb>pression—there was great disturbance of the circulation, and I have no doubt that the heart suffered as well—he may be fit for duty in some months, but that is a question—he has lost flesh considerably.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> There were no external marks on the lower part of the body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he recovered from the external injuries in about ten days—it would depend on the size of the instrument, whether a blow or a kick would produce external marks—if the knee, or elbow, or foot were used, or if he was stamped upon, there might be bruises; but from the elasticity of the ribs giving way, there might be no bruises, but the lungs would have the direct force of the blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, stated, that like the Italians, the people of Rich<lb></lb>mond were groaning under the tyranny of the police, who made a point of hunting him down, and endeavouring to drive him from the town, where he earned his living as a shoemaker; that the policeman accepted his challenge to fight, but not knowing how to protect his face, got the worst of it.</hi>

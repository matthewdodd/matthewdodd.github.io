                  </hi>. I am a messenger, in Birchin Lane. On 25th March, about 9 o'clock at night, I was in Fenchurch Street, close to the Blackwall Railway—I turned up Church Court for a particular purpose, and two women came behind me, seized my arms, and asked me for money—I told them that I had no money—the prisoner was one of them, she was on my left side—the one who got away took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of this little pocket—it had been run over, and was defaced—I told her that it was of no use to any one, and while I was saying that, I heard a snap, and thought it was one of my buttons—the woman on my right ran away, and I found my guard hanging down without my watch—I took hold of the prisoner, and held her fast—she tried to get away, and wanted to know what I was holding her for; I said that I would tell her when I saw a policeman—she struggled very much, and began to kick and fight; it took all my strength to hold her—an officer came, and I gave her in charge—my watch was safe when I went up the court, for when Aldgate Church struck 9 o'clock, my watch was ten minutes too slow—the prisoner was hanging round me at the time I heard the snap.</p>

               <p>No, I had not tasted liquor the whole day—it was about 5 minutes past 9 o'clock—there were gas lights in the court—I and the other woman did not go some way up the court, leaving the prisoner at the entrance—I did not go up the court with the other woman to talk with her; I was in great trouble and distress, having had one of my children burned to death, and taken to the station house only twenty minutes before—I did not give the woman the shilling—the watch was not found on the prisoner, most likely she passed it to the other one—I am not aware that she is very large in the family way—I was not with her three or four minutes.</p>

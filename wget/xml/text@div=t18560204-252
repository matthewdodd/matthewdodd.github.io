                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, G</hi> 95). On 10th Jan., about half past 1 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Chiswell-street—I heard a cry of "Oh!" in a man's voice—I looked in the direction in which it came, and I saw a man lying on the pavement, and a woman bending over him, who, I after<lb></lb>wards found, was the prisoner—I saw her run off, and I ran and asked the man if he had lost anything—he said, "Yes; I have been robbed"—I then went after the woman—I am sure she is the woman that was leaning over the man when he was lying on the ground—there was no one else in the street—I called to her to stop, but she did not, she went on till I overtook her—I said, "You must come back with me; you have robbed that old man"—she said, "I have not"—I saw something in her hand, and said, "What have you got there?"—she said, "Money"—I said, "How much?" she said, "Only 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 4 1/2".—I said, "Is that all the money you have got?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Are you sure of that?"—she said, "Yes; that is every farthing I have got, so help me God!"—I took her back to the old man, and asked him how much money he had lost—he took out some silver from his pocket, and counted it, and said, "There is about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. gone; I can't say to sixpence"—his head was bleeding—the prisoner was trying to put her hand up to her breast—I asked what she had got there—she said her handkerchief—I said, "What does it contain? give it to me"—she said, "No; there are some earrings that belonged to my poor mother, who is now in her grave, I won't part with it"—I took her to the station, and held her hands all the way—I said to the inspector, "She has a handkerchief in her bosom; she refuses to give it me, perhaps she will to you"—she said, "Yes, I will" and she gave it him—there were 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it, and a pair of gold earrings—another constable said, "She has got some<lb></lb>thing in her mouth"—I looked and saw a lump in one side of her mouth—I asked her what it was—she said, "Nothing"—I asked what caused the lump, she said she had the tooth ache—I said, "We must look in your mouth"—she said, "No you won't" and she moved the lump—I took her by the throat—I told her several times to open her mouth—she would not—she shook her head—three other constables assisted, and at last she was obliged to open her mouth, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. dropped out—she had this room door key in her hand when I overtook her—there was only 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in her hand—she stated there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of the G division, I live at No. 63, Bunhill-row—I saw Mr. Chopping, the prosecutor—the Magistrate gave directions that I should examine him, and the prisoner was remanded—the last time I saw him was on Monday morning—he was very ill, and not able to leave his bed—he would not be able to come here to day, certainly, not without risk of his life—his illness arises from the extreme injury his head had sustained from this blow—erysipelas had supervened, but that had gone off, and he had an abscess on the right temple—it was</p>

               <p>an incised wound, with jagged edges, more than a lacerated wound—if a person had been struck with this key, I think it was likely to produce such a wound—I dressed his head at the time—he was not at all in liquor when I saw him—he did not smell of it at all.</p>

Yes, I did; I had not seen the key then—I was asked if I thought the blow was the result of a door key—I said I should think that a door key would have produced a more violent blow; but when I saw this key, which is only a room door key, I said that it might have been done with this.</p>

"I live at No. 2, Artillery-court, Chiswell-street—I am an attorney—as near as I can imagine, about quarter past 1 o'clock I was in Chiswell-street—I was walking along, I was conscious that I had been drinking—I had a very severe blew from behind—I do not know who struck me, I think it must have been a man—the blow knocked me down, and I was on the pavement—when I recovered a female was near me, close in front—I put my hand into my pocket, and I believe I hallooed out—a constable came—I took what money remained from my pocket, and was certain I lost 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had, I think, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. left—I had been at a Mr. Peters—I had there, no doubt, from 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was robbed by a female, I have no doubt, but I cannot identify any one—I had a cut at the back of my head, and bled."</p>

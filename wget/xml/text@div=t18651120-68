                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 217). About half-past 12 on Saturday night, 12th November, I was on duty in Commercial-street, Ro<lb></lb>therhithe, and took the prisoner and another foreigner into custody for being drunk and disorderly and insulting several people; the other had a stick and the prisoner had a stone, but he threw it away before I got up to him—they were calling people names, and saying what they could not do, in a sort of sneering way—it was said in broken English, I could hardly understand them—I was taking them to the station, but I could not get them on, and I sprang my rattle, and Reed came to my assistance—I asked him to take the prisoner for me—he did so, and took him along—I took the other—as Reed was taking him along the prisoner let a knife drop from his sleeve, and aimed at his breast—a button turned it off—he then made a second attempt and put the knife in Reed's left thigh and ran away—I let go of the man I had, and ran and took the prisoner in custody—he drew the knife at me—I had a stick in my hand that I had taken from the other Italian, and I knocked him down, and he threw the knife away—a green-grocer, who lived close by, picked it up—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a dagger.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 5, Queen-street, Hackney-road—on this Saturday night, about half-past 12, I was in Commercial-street, Rotherhithe—the springing of a rattle attracted my attention—I went up, and the policeman had the prisoner and another Italian in custody—he asked me to take the prisoner from him, which I did, by taking him by the collar, as we were going up the street he drew this dagger from his sleeve, and made an attempt to stab me in the breast, but a button on my coat turned it, and he then stabbed me in the thigh—I am sure it was the prisoner who stabbed me, not the other Italian—I did not see what he did with the knife—he ran away, and the constable after him—I was taken to the station, and a doctor was sent for.</p>

                  </hi>, Jun. I am a surgeon—I was called to the station, and found the prosecutor and prisoner lying on benches, both wounded and bleeding—I said, "Which is the most serious case for me to attend to first?" The inspector directed me to attend to the prosecutor—he was quite blanched from loss of blood, in fact the quantity of blood was so great that the place smelt like a slaughter-house—his trousers were completely matted with blood, and his boot and stocking—I directed them to be taken off, and took a sponge and cleansed the wound—the bleeding had then ceased—I dressed the wound—I did not ascertain its depth—it must have been either deep, or some large artery was wounded—the wound was just about the size which this knife would make—I then attended to the prisoner—he had a wound on the head such as a stick would make.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I know nothing about it—I was very drunk, and could not be able to stab anybody; besides, I had. no knife—being a foreigner I have nobody to speak for me, if I was in my own country I could have plenty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman it Woolwich. On the morning of the 29th of January, at two o'clock, I saw the prosecutor lying under the batchers'shambles in the old market-place—he had only one boot on, and no cap—I searched about and found his cap, but could not find his boot—I saw him again in a short time after, when I had been round my beat, and then his other boot was gone, and he was turned over—I took him to the watch-house, but could not find the boots.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police officer. I saw the prisoner on the 29th of January, about twelve o'clock in the night, with these boots under his arm—I followed him about two hundred yards, and asked him what he had got—he said, "A pair of old boots"—I took them, and examined them—they appeared to be military boots—I took him to the watch-house, and there found the prosecutor—the prisoner said he found them in the market.</p>

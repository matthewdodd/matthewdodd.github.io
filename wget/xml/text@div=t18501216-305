                  </hi>. I am in the service of James Church, of 3, Stamford-terrace, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. It is his dwelling-house—two of these coats produced belong to Mr. Charles Shanott, and the other to Mr. Thomas Green, I saw them safe about a quarter of an hour before they were lost—two of them were on the back of a chair, and one on the end of the sofa, in the front parlour—that was on 13th Dec, about twenty minutes before nine o'clock in the morning—the street-door was shut close, and fastened with the latch—in about half an hour I noticed that it was slightly open, and there was a rustling noise in the parlour—I went to the parlour-door, which was open; the prisoner stood just inside it—I had been to the parlour before, and had left the door open—he had a black bag in hit hand—he said, "Oh! say my name is Smith"—I said, "That won't do for me"—I put down the tray, and laid hold of him by the right arm—he dropped the bag, opened the street-door with his left hand, and ran out—I ran after him, calling, "Stop thief!"—a policeman stopped him—I did not lose sight of him—when I came back, the bag was still in the passage, I took it up; these three coats were in it—this bag does not belong to our house, I do not know it at all.</p>

I was in Trinity-street—I saw the prisoner running, and Evans crying, "Stop thief!"—I gave chase and took him at the corner of Trinity-street and Blackman-street, in the Borough—I took him back to 3, Stamford-terrace, and saw the bag and the three coats in it—going to the station, he said it was a bad job for him that I was coming along at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Peter Barralls, and live in Medley's place, in the parish of Bermondsey—it is his dwelling-house. On the 24th of August the prisoner came to assist me in washing—I had some sove<lb></lb>reigns wrapped up in a sock which I kept in a little press-bedstead—I saw them safe in the morning—she was gone, and I missed the sovereigns and the sock—I went and spoke to her about it in the morning—she told me she had taken them for safety—she said, "Yes, my dear, I have got them, and will return them to you again"—she put her hand into her pocket, took out a paper bag, and took out six sovereigns—I asked her what had become of the seventh—she told me she had changed it, and bought these things with it.</p>

               <p>the press-bed for a woman who was going to sleep in the house, as she was going to make away with herself; I said, "How can you think of doing so?" I made the bed, and this bag and money dropped out; I said to the little girl, "Take this purse down to your mother," and she took it down to her mother; I picked the sock up on the landing, and was going to throw it in the dust-hole.</p>

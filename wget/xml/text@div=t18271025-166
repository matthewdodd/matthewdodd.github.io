I searched the prisoner, and found in a pocket in her stays two sixpences, and between the bed and bolster a half-crown, key, and jointer; Payles afterwards gave me 5s. 6d.; the prosecutor was not drunk, but had been drinking. I went, by her desire to the Brazen Head public-house, and found he had been there with her, and changed half a sovereign.</p>

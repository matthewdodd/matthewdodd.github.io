I went out in the morning leaving my property locked up in two boxes - I returned at five o'clock in the evening; she had then taken a room higher up in the house as a lodging - she brought me the key of my room; I went in, and between ten and eleven o'clock next morning, I missed my property. I went with an officer to her room, and found two lace caps and other things, which I had not missed until I saw them on her bed. An apron was found in her box, which was mine. The whole of the property is mine - she had no authority to take it.</p>

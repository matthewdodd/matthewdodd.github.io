               <p>THOMAS HUNT. The prisoner came to me on the 10th of January, to request the loan of a set of pearl ornaments for a lady named Stevens. I knew Mrs. Stevens, who lived in the house which the prisoner had the care of. I lent them to the prisoner; she came as her servant; I lent them to Mrs. Stevens; I left orders at home, as I was obliged to be absent, for my young man to call for them: I have since found them in pawn.</p>

            . I am single; the prisoner lived in the house where I live; I took my lodgings of her. I sent her on the 10th of January, at her own proposal, to hire a set of ornaments, as I was going to the theatre, to which I belong. She said, "I think you would look better with some ornaments." I said, "Very well, Sarah, go and get them." I put them on my table at night when I went to bed; in the morning, when I awoke, I missed them, and said to her, "Sarah, where are the pearl ornaments?" she said, Mr. Hunt had sent for them.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Norfolk-street, Middlesex Hospital. I have some pearl ornaments, which were pawned for 4 l. 10 s. at my house, on the 11th of January, by the prisoner, in the name of Stevens. I am certain of her person; she said she brought them from Miss Stevens.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I asked him to let me have some time to get them; but he would not take them back without the hire; it was 5 s. a day.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HUNT re-examined. I lent them to Mrs. Stevens, and was to have 5 s. for the use of them for a day and a night. The prisoner said Miss Stevens wished to sit for her miniature, and they were to be worn on that occasion.</p>
               <p>E. STEVENS re-examined. Q. Had you them for any other occasion? A. No, only for the theatre that night. I have known her about three months, since I have lived in the apartments.</p>

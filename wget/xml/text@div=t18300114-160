On Christmas-day I left home at two o'clock, and saw my wife lock the door; I saw that it was fast - we left nobody in the house; I went home about eight, in consequence of an alarm, and met the prisoner in custody, about fifty yards from my house - I went with him to the watch-house; a purse with 2l. 6s. 9d. was found on him; I then went home and found three drawers broken open in the front parlour - the lock of the front room door was strained so that it would not catch; I missed nothing - I had sent my son and nephew home about five o'clock; and my two sons again about half-past seven.</p>

            . My father sent me and my cousin Galliers home about five o'clock; I found the house safe- we unlocked the street door - the front parlour door was locked; I saw my cousin fasten the window-shutter and window - we left a rushlight in the room; I saw him lock the outer and inner doors and tried both to see they were fast; the front door was double-locked - we took the keys to my mother; I returned about eight o'clock with my brother - we took the keys; I looked through a crack in the shutter and could not distinguish the light - I heard something fall in the front parlour; I went next door but one, and got Mr. Hopley - he opened the street door with the key, and I saw two men rush out of the parlour into the passage; we shut the door - they pulled inside, but we kept it too; I placed myself by the front window and saw two men open the shutters and jump out, one directly after the other - there is a gas-light opposite; the first man was shortish, in a dark great coat and blue trousers, and a black hat - the other was taller, and in dark clothes; he had on a tail coat - they ran together, but one left the other when they got a little up the street; I called Stop thief, and stood by the window, and in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes the patrols brought the prisoner into our parlour; he had on a dark great coat, blue trousers, and a hat covered with snow - he is a short stout man, and the same size as the one who first came out of the window; I believe him to be the man by his dress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate you could not say it was a black hat? A. Not to my recollection; I might have said so as I was frightened - the snow laid on the ground.</p>

            . On Christmas-night, a little before eight o'clock, William Card applied to me; I went with him - the street door was singly locked; I put the key in, turned the lock, pushed it open a little way, and felt somebody pulling within - I closed the door, called Watch! and heard a noise, as if they were getting out the backway; I then heard a noise in the front room - the shutter opened, and two men came out nearly together, and both ran down the street, towards the gas-light; I saw one had a dark great coat flying open - he was about five feet four inches high, and appeared rather stout in his great coat - it was a rough great coat; the other had no great coat, and I think was a little taller - I kept calling Watch! as I ran, and about fifty yards from the house, I saw Fry, the beadle; he turned up Kent-street with me - they were then running along Kent-street; we there lost one, and the other in the great coat turned down Cumberland-street - I lost sight of him for a second or two in turning the corner, but there was nobody else in the street - I was within five or six yards of him; when he turned Cumberland-street he had no hat on, which he had when he left Brunswick-street - I pursued him about one hundred yards down Cumberland-street, and he leaped into a hollow space, left for some houses; I left him there, and left Fry going into the hollow, with the hat in his hand, with two patrols, who came up; I returned to Card's house - he had not got home; two or three doors appeared to have been broken open, apparently by a chisel; a tea-caddy lay on the floor, with the glass broken - I had heard a smash; I went home, and saw a mob coming up Kent-street, with the prisoner in custody: he had a dark drab great coat on, but no hat; it was a coat of the same description as the man I pursued wore - I saw it as I passed the gas-light; I conclude he was the man from every circumstance - there was a gas-light between twenty and thirty yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it chiefly from the colour of his coat you speak to him? A. No; the great coat was something of an olive brown - I lost sight of him momentarily at two corners, and in the vacant space, which is no thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FRY. I am beadle of Shoreditch. I was in Brunswick-street, thirty or forty yards from Card's house a little before eight o'clock, heard an alarm of thieves, and observed two men come out of Card's house, but could not see from what part, one was dressed in a great coat - he ran on the same side as the house (I think the other had a small body coat); I tried to catch the other, but missed my hold, and crossing the field opposite Haggerstone church, where there is a little cut, near the end of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140079"></xptr>Kent-street, the one in the great coat fell down - his hat came off - I picked it up; the snow was about five inches deep on the ground - I did not notice whether there was snow on the hat; I kept four or five yards from that man all the way - he went along Kent-street and turned down Cumberland-street; I lost sight of him for a minute as he turned the corner - he turned the corner of a vacant space, and I lost him; I went into that space - there is a rough sort of paling there, at the side of some gardens; I heard a crack like the palings cracking - I saw two patrols coming in the same direction; they came down to the space - Taylor looked over the paling and said something; I then looked over the paling and saw the man in the great coat laying down inside the paling - he got up out of the corner and sidled to a wash-house, then made his way over the next garden paling; I left the patrols to guard that end, and went through a private house at the end, about fifteen houses off, and afterwards found the prisoner in custody - he had the same sort of dress as the man I pursued; I think he had a hat on then - I gave Roberts the hat I picked up before I saw the prisoner with a hat on; I will not swear he is the man, but he is the same size; I observed at the watch-house that his trousers were torn across the left thigh - they were a dark colour; I saw his hat took off at the watch-house, and knew it to be the one I picked up, by the string which confines the leather being out of the loops - I had observed that when I picked it up - there were twelve or fourteen loops out; I looked at it in the garden when I had a lantern lent me; I observed snow on it as we went to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How often did you lose sight of him? A.Twice. There was 2l. 6s. 6d. found on him at the watch-house, which was returned him; I consider him the man by the colour of his body-coat, I took it to be a dark olive - his great coat was unbuttoned.</p>

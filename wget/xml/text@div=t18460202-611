                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in High-street, Shoreditch; the prisoner was in my service as journeyman; it was his business to carry out the bread and receive money. I serve Mrs. Park with bread—it was part of tbc prisoner's duty to take bread to her, and receive money from her—her bill was sometimes paid weekly; sometimes it might go a fortnight, sometimes more, sometimes less—when he received money it was his duty to bring it back to me directly—he went his rounds, and after he had done serving the customers he came and paid me, or accounted to me for the money—on Saturday, before the 26th of Jan. I had a bill against Mrs. Park for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner did not account for that—he did go for it I believe—it was his business to go for it—he never paid it me—I settled his book myself that day—I do not know whether he keeps a book himself—he does not produce one to me—I call the names from this book, and if any one has paid him he tells me and pays me—I called Mrs. Park's name on Monday 19th, and he said they did not pay—I asked him again on the Wednesday alter—he said she had paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more to make up the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said nothing about the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Monday—he said on the Wednesday that he had paid me on Mon<lb></lb>day—that was not true—I denied receiving it, and discharged him next day—the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is marked off to Mrs. Park in the book; I cannot tell who by; I did not do it—no one had any right at my books, but they might do so without my knowledge—the prisoner came in at eleven o'clock on Wednesday evening, instead of returning after serving his customers—I said, "It appears you did not pay my father anything last evening, and now the names of three persons are erased"—he said, "Well, Mrs. Park I know paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the money, and I paid you 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I put 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more to it myself, to make the bill right"—he did not say to prevent a mistake—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—I signed this, and it was read over to me—he might have said "to prevent a mistake," but I have no particular recollection of it.</p>

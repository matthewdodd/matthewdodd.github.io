                  </hi>. I live at Hounslow-heath. Caroline Dowsett had been in my service, and after she left I missed the pillow-case and other things stated—they were all my property—I saw her, and told her I had lost some things, and I was satisfied she had taken them—she said she had not—I told her I was certain she had done so, and it was better to say so at once—I went to her mother, Mary Dowsett—she said she knew nothing about it, her daughter had not been home, she had left her at Sergeant Maloney's, at the barracks—I went, and found Caroline Dowsett there—we then went to her mother again, and said we had come for the things that her daughter sent home by her—she said sne had not got them—I told her she had, for her daughter had sent us there for them—after a little while, she said she would fetch them—she went into a field, and fetched a parcel, which I gave to the officer—it contained the pillow-case and other things, which were all mine.</p>

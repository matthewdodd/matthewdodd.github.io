I said no, I never was there in my life; he said, I beg pardon for speaking, I thought I had known you; I told him no offence, we were all liable to mistakes; he walked a little, and the prisoner said, Sir, shall we not drink together; I said I have no objection, though I am not your countryman, to drinking a part of sixpenny worth; we went into a public-house, and had sixpenny worth of brandy and water; I remember while we were in the house the prisoner said he knew very little of London, had been about six months from the country, and had no relations, in London, or hardly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110043"></xptr>any acquaintance; he said his business was a grocer, and he lived at the west end of the town; when the liquor was drank, we came out, and he bid me good night; we were together about ten minutes that night in a public tap-room, the house turned up a court, I cannot say I recollect the house, I never was there before, there were some more people drinking in the room.</p>
               <p>Was there any appointment made for you to meet again? - No, none, he asked me if I came often to town; I said yes; but there was no appointment made; I was in town on the Tuesday following, I was coming up Cornhill about nine in the evening; the prisoner followed me, and he clapped his hand on my shoulder, and said how do you do; who thought of having the pleasure of seeing you again; he asked me where I was going; I said to Holborn; he said he was going home; then in conversation we walked on; he said he had been in the city about business, and was very tired, and should have a coach, and said, you may as well go with me; I said I did not care, it would be giving me a lift; I agreed to go in the coach with him, and we took coach at Bow-church, he ordered the coach to Somerset-house; nothing particular passed in the coach; I remember he said he was not very well, he was rather sick; I said, I suppose you are not used to riding; he said he had been drinking with some friends, which was the cause of it; he likewise said he had no change, he would be obliged to me to pay the coach, and when he got out, he would get change and pay me; the coachman insisted upon eighteen pence; the prisoner said it was but a shilling, for he had often come the fare; I gave the coachman eighteen pence; the prisoner asked me which way I should go; I told him I was going to the top of Chancery lane, Holborn, and I should go back, and go up Chancery-lane, out of Fleet-street; we crossed from Somerset-house, and came back to Chancery-lane; on the opposite side in coming back, we stopped at a pastry cook's shop; I said I will go inhere, have you a mind for any thing; I thought it would give him an opportunity of getting change; I gave the woman a shilling, and she asked if she was to take for both; he made no answer; I then thought he had no money, I told the woman to take for both; I began to imagine him to be one of those people called swindlers, but I thought I would take care he should not swindle me any further; then I thought I would not go up Chancery-lane; I bid him a good night; when we got to the end of Chancery-lane, he said he wanted to speak to me; there were a number of people passing; it was no place to stand to talk; I went on; he said, I am out of place, I am distressed for money, I should be glad you would give me some; says he, I am very much distressed; I told him I could give him none, it was not in my power; he said he must have some; I told him I thought it was very strange he should run me to the expence of a coach, and afterwards ask for money; I told him he should have none: at last he said, oh do not make any noise about it; for if you do not give me some money, I will say you are a sodomite; we had got no great distance up the lane, about a quarter part of it, I do not know the places in the lane, I do not know Serjeant's-inn, or Lincoln's-inn; I will swear that you took me in a coach, and that you made an attempt upon me; I have got the number of the coach: I told him he must be a scandalous rascal to insinuate himself into my company, and then make such a charge as that; he said he would swear it, and how could I disprove it; I told him I would not give him any thing; he said he would not leave me, he would have some money, or else he would charge the watch with me; I told him he might do as he pleased; he said he would not leave me, he would ruin my character, he would swear it, and still kept following me on; when we came opposite the Six Clerks office, he said, will not you give me something? I said no; then he seized me by the collar, and said, b - st you, I will do for you, if you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110044"></xptr>do not give me some money; we were on the left hand-side of the lane, that is the dark side, and it is a very dull spot, and I saw nobody, I thought it was best to give him my money: I said do not use me ill, and I will give you my money; I gave him two half guineas and some silver; then he said, is that all? I said I have no more; he said, have not you a watch? I said, yes; but it is only a metal one, it will fetch very little; I was very loth to part with he said he would have it, and I gave it him; he then let go the collar of my coat, which he had had hold of all this time; then we walked on, and he then said he did not want my watch, if I would give him two guineas, I might have it again; I asked him how I was to give him that, when I had given him all my money; he said if I would meet him, and not acquaint any body with it, and bring the money, I should have the watch; I told him I would not acquaint any body with it, I should be afraid to tell any body, for fear they should believe it was true; therefore he might depend upon it I should come and bring the money by myself; for I told him I would not part with the watch for three times the money; therefore I told him I would bring it for him, and asked him where I should meet him, and he told me in Saint Paul's Church-yard; I asked him whereabouts; he said on the north side; I asked him when; and he said the Friday following; I asked him what time; and he said, what time would suit me? I said, about eight, or half past eight; he said no, it is not quite dark then; suppose we settle at half after nine; I told him I would meet him; then he left me.</p>
               <p>What induced you to part with your money at that time? - I was afraid he would do me a personal mischief.</p>
               <p>And you did it from fear and apprehension of danger? - Yes; I acquainted some friends of the affair; the first was Mr. Flintoff and Mr. Skinner, and they promised to go with me; I was determined to go.</p>
               <p>Court. When was it you first told Flintoff of it? - On the Thursday night, this was on the Tuesday night; I told them I meant to take him up, and they said certainly; we went there at the time appointed, and they agreed I should walk by myself because we thought if he observed any body with me, he might not come up; I walked by myself, and they walked at a little distance.</p>
               <p>Had you described the person of the man at the time? - I do not recollect, I was rather after time; I walked I believe five or ten minutes up and down; at last I observed the prisoner, I was at the top of the Church-yard, just turning to go down, and the prisoner said to me, have you spread the alarm, or have you given the alarm? I cannot be quite sure which; this was while I was walking alone; I made no answer to his question, but I said to him, have you brought my watch? and he said, have you brought the money? I said, have you brought the watch? and he shook his waistcoat pocket, and I heard something ratile which I supposed to be the watch and chain; he then turned up a court at the top of the Church-yard, and said, what do you mean to do; have you brought the money? The court was by the new buildings in the corner, on the right hand going to Ludgate-hill; I said, what do you turn up there for? let us go into the Church-yard, and I drew out rather to look for my friends; and he said, oh! if you have not brought the money, I shall not wait, and he went away, and I went out to look for my friends, for I had lost them; he did not at that time shew me the watch; I told my friends I had met him, and he was gone; they advised me to wait again, and I did so, and the prisoner in a minute or two came out of a small passage that leads into Paternoster-row; he said, what did I mean to do, would I give him the money? I told him I really could not raise the money, to keep him in conversation, for I thought my friends would come up, and I said, will you take a guinea? and he said, no, indeed, I shall not take two guineas; just at that time a person<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110045"></xptr>came out of a house and looked very hard at us, and the prisoner came out with me into the Church-yard, and walked towards Cheapside; my friends observed us, and the prisoner turned up the court by the print-shop, then my friends came up, and I said that is the man that robbed me; they took him, and he was searched in my presence at the Compter, and my watch was found upon him; it is the same that was taken from me in the manner that I have described.</p>
               <p>I will ask you, upon the oath you have taken, was there the smallest pretence for the charge made against you? - No, Sir, I swear there was not the smallest pretence for the charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you first made the affair known to your friends, why did not they advise you to have a proper officer to take me up? - I did not think it any way necessary.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, and you not wishing to take my life from me; did not you first meet me in Cornhill? - No, that was the second time.</p>
               <p>Did not you address me concerning a young man you had met, and ask me did not that young man perform at Hughes's? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you not, on the Tuesday night that you met me, go into a public-house crossing Lombard-street, and drink brandy and water with me? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you before we went into the coach together? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a ship-wright at Poplar; I know the prosecutor, his father and mother, and whole family; I have known him three years.</p>
               <p>Did you, in consequence of any story he told you, go with him to St. Paul's Church-yard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it? - On Friday the 25th of May.</p>
               <p>Who did you see there? - The prisoner; we had walked up and down the Church-yard four or five times, and then I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What did you see pass between the prisoner and prosecutor? - When I came up to the prisoner, Mr. Kains said, this is the fellow that robbed me of my watch.</p>
               <p>What did you see pass before? - I never saw them together till then; I went up to take him, just at the passage at Bowles's, the print-shop, the corner of the Dean's house; after he said so, I immediately seized the prisoner by the collar; and the prisoner said, what do you mean, you rascals? what, are you going to rob me? with that, a number of people, in course, began to collect about us; and I said it was not a place there to argue; if he was innocent, let him go with us and prove it; we called a coach, and ordered the coach to drive to the Poultry Counter; as we went along, he behaved in a very insolent manner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In what? - He said we were a parcel of rascals, and that he would do for the prosecutor, Mr. Kains; we took him to the Poultry Compter; he was searched there in my presence, and the watch was found upon him; in his waistcoat pocket, I think it was, to the best of my recollection; Kains claimed that watch as his own before the magistrate; the prisoner said Mr. Kains gave it him; Mr. Kains first told me what passed on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you hear Mr. Kains deny ever seeing me on the Sunday night, until the Tuesday? - No, before the Magistrate he omitted that part of the story, but afterwards told it simply.</p>
               <p>Did he say that he had not seen him on the Sunday, before the magistrate? - He said he had seen him, but in his first recital before the magistrate, he omitted telling the magistrate that he saw him on the Sunday; but he told it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did he, while he was before the magistrate, tell the magistrate he had seen him on the Sunday? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Never denied having seen him on the Sunday? - No, he did not mention it at first, but when the prisoner said he had seen him on the Sunday; he then said he had, and had drank with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did the prosecutor in the coach, deny ever having seen him on the Sunday? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you go with him to Saint Paul's Church-yard? - I did, on the 25th of May; Flintoff was with me.</p>
               <p>You went in consequence of some story the prosecutor told you? - I did; he was to meet somebody; he first told me on the 24th of May, it was Thursday evening, and there I saw the prisoner at the bar; we agreed we should not all three go in company, and that Flintoff and me should follow at a distance, and that one, when he saw the prisoner, should hold him in conversation till we came up with him; we got to Saint Paul's twenty minutes before ten, we walked up and down at a distance from him, and took no notice of him; about five minutes before ten, we lost Mr. Kains; then I said to Mr. Flintoff, I am afraid he has met the man, and we shall miss him; when we came through by the bookseller's, I met the prosecutor with the prisoner; the prisoner and Kains turned by the bookseller's; we followed them, he turned round his head and saw us behind him; he was going to make off; the prosecutor said, that is the man that has robbed me; I immediately caught him by the collar; he was searched in my presence at the Compter, and Mr. Kain's watch was found upon him; he behaved very insolent, all the way in the coach, and told me he would do for Mr. Kains, that he gave him the watch; he said he would give charge of Kains; I was present at his examination before the magistrate, he said he first saw the prisoner on the Sunday.</p>

               <p>Was you present the whole time while Kains was examined? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him deny that he had not seen the prisoner on the Sunday? - I think he did; as far as I recollect, he said that he had met the prisoner somewhere about Cheapside, and that they had something to drink.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you hear him deny seeing the prisoner on the Sunday? - I think he did, I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect what he said about it? - I really cannot recollect, I know there was some hesitation, and I desired Mr. Kains to tell the whole truth; I have known Mr. Kains and his family, and I know he is of an extraordinary character, a universal good character; I took the affair in hand on account of his family.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Skinner, when Mr. Kains denied seeing me on the Sunday night, did not I give a description of the clothes he had on, and I recollected he had a pair of new shoe-buckles on, and he shewed them to me, and he asked me how I liked them; did not he say that he could not deny that he had these clothes on?</p>
               <p>Court. Did this pass? - Very possibly it might.</p>
               <p>Why you went on purpose to recollect what passed? - There was something of the kind passed.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner talk of the buckles in the man's shoes? - He did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He then totally denied ever seeing me till the Tuesday night; but I desired the Alderman to indulge me to send for the people of the house, which was the Dolphin; then the Alderman importuned him to say it; and through a great deal of persuasions, he at last did acknowledge that we were together.</p>

               <p>The first time I ever saw Mr. Kains, I was coming from Whitechapel through Cornhill; about half after ten I met with a young man an acquaintance of mine, who stopped and asked me how I did; on my bidding him a good night, the prosecutor went by and said, I beg your pardon, does not that young man perform at Hughes's? I said no, he does not; he was going towards Whitechapel in his way home; he returned back with me, and in Cheapside he asked me to have something to drink; I said I did not much care; we went to the Dolphin in Honey-lane-market, Cheapside, which leads up a passage, he says, chuse your liquor; I chose sixpenny worth of brandy and water, and we sat down to drink it; I took up the weekly paper to amuse myself with; and I said to him, I will take this paper with me; but I said, I will not take it, they may want it, and it will be mean in me if they should miss it; he said, take it if you want it, and I will pay for it; this was half past eleven; by this time, I said, I must go home; he then pulled out his watch; says he, it is not so late as that, it is past eleven; then he was looking at the chain of his watch; he said is not this pretty? he gave me the chain to look at; I looked as it, and gave it him again; the woman of the house was just come in; she asked me to have something more to drink, and he gave the woman sixpence, and she was going to give him three-pence at the foot of the passage; I says, Sir, good night; says he, I am come all this way out of my way to have something to drink, go back with me a little way; I went back as far as Cornhill, and in the way to Cornhill, he says to me, if I may be so bold, young man, what business are you? I says, in a jocose manner, why, Sir, what trade are you? says, he, I think you are too young to be in business for yourself, and possibly I may be of help to you; says I, at present I am in no employ, but I have been in the grocery line, I am going to my friends at Exeter; he said it is a pity for a young man like you to go out of London, for you are stout; where do you live? I said in Holborn; says he, what part? says he, if it is convenient for me to call on you, I might meet with something to answer your purpose; says I, it is not convenient; says he, are you afraid of me? then says he, why cannot you tell me where you live? I said, I have told you my reasons, you must excuse me; we came into Cornhill, I said good night; he gave me his hand to shake hands; says he, I will go with you again; he returned from Cornhill into Cheapside with me again; I then bid him a good night; says he, will you meet me about nine, or about five or ten minutes after, on Tuesday night, and if not, on the Friday following, meet me in Cornhill, where I first spoke to you to night; I told him I would; he had then his watch and his money, for he had then paid for his brandy and water; if I had any intention to rob him, it was a late hour, and of a Sunday night, I should have robbed him then; but on the Tuesday I met him, according to my promise, in Cornhill, it was about ten minutes after nine; he says how do you do; I hope you have not been waiting, will you have any thing to drink? and we crossed Cornhill into Lombard-street, to the public-house; that he now denies; but I cannot recollect the house, and we had some brandy and water; he asked me to have something to eat; we drank the brandy and water; he immediately paid for it; when we came into Cornhill, he asked me where I was going; I said to Holborn; he said he was going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110048"></xptr>to the other end, of the town, and was tired, and should have a coach; so I thought I would ride to Somerset-house; at Somerset-house we came out, he asked the man what the fare was; the coachman said eighteen-pence; I said I believed it was but a shilling; he said it is eighteen-pence; says the coachman, my number is 718; he never seemed to wish for me to pay for the to for the coach; we crossed opposite to Somerset-house, he asked me to have something more to drink; I refused it, and at the back of the New Church in the Strand, there is a pastry cook's, he asked me to eat some pastry, he took up a two-penny tart, and I a penny one; he said eat one of these, which was the same he eat, he had four penny worth, and I had three-penny worth; he took out a shilling, and gave it to the woman; he then said, will you eat a custard? I denied it; he took his change and went up Chancery-lane, and in the way up Chancery-lane he says, I would not advise you to go into the country just yet, but what is in my power to do for you, I will do, though I am but a journeyman; we then came into Holborn; it was in Holborn he put his hand in his pocket and said, I have but a trifle about me, and he gave me two half guineas and some silver; I had about eight shillings or nine shillings in my pocket; there was the bad shilling among that silver; says he, I will meet you again next Friday night in Cornhill, or otherwise the same side of St. Paul's Church-yard; I looked at him, I thought it odd; I said I thought he would not meet me; he then immediately put his hand to his pocket, and pulled his watch out of his pocket, and bid me meet him, and he would give me a couple of guineas, to help me home to my friends; I asked him to let me go into some house, and let somebody see me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Prosecutor. Did not I, upon your oath, say, let us go into some house, that somebody may see you give me the watch? - No, he did not; it was the upper end on the left-hand side where he collared me, and the watch followed the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was then as early as ten, when he gave me the watch he bid me good night; after I asked him to let somebody see him give me the watch, he said no, what has any body to do with what passes between you and me; on the Friday night I went to the north side of Saint Paul's, with the watch in my waistcoat pocket, and I saw the prosecutor, and he said it was not in his power to give me the two guineas, and he had but one; I said that does not matter, here is your watch; I had the watch in my hand; and all of a sudden he said, come along with me, I am going to a friend's house in Cheapside, I will there borrow a guinea; and by Mr. Bowles's we met the two young men, and he says, this is the young man that has robbed me; Skinner collared me, and said, you rascal, have you robbed my friend of his watch and money? I said no, he gave it me; but according to his appointment I met him to night; I said, I have the watch, but I will neither give it to you nor him; when we was in the middle of the yard by the picture shop, they would not take me the nearest way to the Compter, but they carried me round in a coach; so they dragged up the windows, and they said, keep no noise, but give the watch and money, that is your best way; I asked Skinner what he meant to do with me; he said either give the watch up, or go into the Compter.</p>
               <p>Skinner. That is not true, he did not say any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Then we went into the Compter; then they gave charge of me; when I was taken the next morning before the Alderman, he then related the same circumstances which he has related to the Court, but he then denied having seen me till the Tuesday night; I desired to send down for the people at the Dolphin; then they asked him if it was so or not; and that he had better own it; and he said it was so, but before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110049"></xptr>that he denied it, he would have taken his oath of it; when the Alderman heard his story, I was fully committed; that is all I have to say.</p>
               <p>Court. Then if I understand you, he gave you the watch? - Yes; he said, if you doubt my word in meeting you on the Friday night more than the Tuesday, take my watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He said he had been drinking just before.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did you drink with him on Tuesday night? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As God shall judge me he did; and I would not say so now I am upon trial for my life.</p>

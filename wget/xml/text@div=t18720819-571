About 4 o'clock on 18th July, I was in Cheapside—I saw the prisoner with a man, their conduct was suspicious, and I watched them—when I first saw them one was a little in front of the other—they proceeded a little way up Cheapside, and I missed the prisoner</p>

               <p>—the man was waiting by the pavement—she returned with a little paper bag, as if containing confectionery—they walked slowly into St. Paul's Churchyard, until they arrived at the end of Paul's Chain—they remained there talking, and something appeared to pass from the man to the prisoner—I passed them two or three steps, and then the woman left the man—I turned back and she went down Paul's Chain—I followed, and found her running very fast—I pursued her—she turned up Carter Lane, along Knight<lb></lb>rider Street, into Bennet's Hill—as I passed No. 19, Leadbeater said "She has thrown something away—I caught her on Bennet's Hill—Leadbeater pointed to the area of No. 19, and said "She has thrown something down there"—I left her in the charge of a constable, and went down into the basement of No. 19, with Leadbeater, and in the area we found this black bag and five counterfeit half-crowns, wrapped separately in tissue paper—I then went back with Leadbeater, and told the prisoner I should charge her with unlawful possession of counterfeit money—she became violent, and made use of beastly expressions—I marked the half-crowns in her presence—I asked her if she was desirous of saying where she lived, and who the man was, and she said "No."</p>

I am porter at the Swan with Two Necks, Carter Lane—about 4 o'clock p.m., on 18th July, I saw the prisoner running down Paul's Chain and Bennet's Hill, where I saw her throw something down the area of No. 19, which rattled against the window—I went with Smith and picked up the bag and money—I returned to the station with Smith, and told the prisoner I had seen her throw something down the area—she said that she did not.</p>

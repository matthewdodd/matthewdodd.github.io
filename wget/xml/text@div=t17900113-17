               <p>I met the prisoner the 19th of December, between seven and eight in the morning, at the top of Oxford-road, towards the fields; he had a bundle on his shoulder; I retreated; after he passed me about ten or fifteen yards, I laid hold of his bundle; I perceived it was some animal; I followed him about two hundred or two hundred and fifty yards: when he perceived I followed him, he threw away the bundle, and endeavoured to escape; I laid hold of him, and he told me the bundle he had was given to him by a farmer, or some man in the country, to take to Oxford-street, who had given him a shilling; I asked him why he threw away the property; he answered me in French; he said he could not speak English, that the property had only been delivered to him, to take it to Oxford-road; I brought him back to the bundle; and in endeavouring to bring him back to the bundle where the property lay; he would not take it up any more; I asked him where he lived? he said he had no abode; I begged of him to take up his bundle, and go with me; he said he would not; so I with two or three more<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130028"></xptr>young men, put the bundle upon him, and went with him to the watch-house; when we opened the bundle, it was the hind part of a sheep, with half the skin on, which belonged to that flesh; it was quite cut right through; cut across; it was the hind part; the two hind legs; we examined him, but he would not speak English, any more than now, he would insist upon it, that this bundle was given him by a man in the country, to take it to Oxford-road; he did not say what particular place; I asked him; he said he did not know any other place, but that he was to take it to Oxford-road; Mr. Bond came and owned the skin.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had the prisoner any knife? - We did not examine him directly; but when we did, which was about four hours after he was taken, he had no knife upon him; his clothes were full of blood, and part of his shoes.</p>
               <p>Court to Bond. Have you seen the side of the sheep? - Yes the mark was across the loins, I marked it down the head and across the shoulders, and there were two crosses besides across the loins, which is the mark that the salesman puts upon them.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose the salesman puts his mark upon the whole lot, that he is to sell that day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was your own mark so particular that you could venture to swear to it? - There was my own mark upon it, a cross with red ochre; the butchers generally mark different marks, I can venture to swear to the skin from that mark; the drover told me he had found the other part of the skin, his name is Starkey, he is not here.</p>
               <p>(The skin produced.)</p>
               <p>Court to Bond. Take up that part of the skin that belongs to the hind quarter, and tell me if there is any mark upon it that you can swear to? - There is no part of my mark on this part of the skin; here is the saleman's mark.</p>
               <p>Does that piece of skin indent and tally with the other? - Yes, it does.</p>
               <p>Is there any certainty that these two pieces of skin must at first form one skin? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is impossible to say whether they do or not, for one is wet, and the other is quite dry.</p>

               <p>I look after my master's property; I go round the field every morning; in the morning, I found I had lost a sheep; I searched every where; it was one of Mr. Bond's sheep; we take in different butchers sheep; then I found the blood, and then I looked no further; in about an hour or two after, I heard a man was taken; I went to Mary-le-bone watch-house, and I saw the hind part: I thought I was sure it was mine that I had lost; in about three or four days, or a week, we found this other half of the skin in Mary-le-bone fields, which was plainer still; we found it with the flesh altogether; part of it was turning green.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect what the mark was, that was on the other part? - It was a dot across the face, and ochre all across the loins, and the salesman's mark, the same as the other sheep; the two parts were certainly parts of that sheep that we lost.</p>

               <p>Court to Henry. Did you tell me that the man said he should receive a shilling, or he was to receive a shilling? - He said he had received a shilling; I did not enquire whether he had any money then; when I searched him four hours after, he had no money.</p>
               <p>Had he spent any money in the interval? - I cannot tell; but he could not have spent any money before he was searched.</p>

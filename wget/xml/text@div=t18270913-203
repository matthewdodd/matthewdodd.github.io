               <p>SARAH BROWN. I am single. On the 27th of August, in the evening, I was at the <placeName id="t18270913-203-crimeloc1149">Brown Bear public-house, Bow-street</placeName>

Gray gave me a watch there to take care of for him, as he was not going home that evening; he remained there drinking till after it was lost; the prisoner Connor came in and cut my gown down, but I did not feel it, till I felt the knife sticking at my breast - I put up my hand and then missed the watch - I caught hold of her directly, and saw her pass it to Robinson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A. A servant; I had been drinking wine - I cannot say how much; I was sick there - I had been to Kensington, and had the wine - I drank nothing at this house; I was not sober. Gray called for three half-pints of gin, which the prisoners and other people drank, but I drank none - Gray is not here.</p>

            . I am cook at the Brown Bear - Brown came in with Gray, a baker, very tipsy indeed - she could hardly stand - Gray was drunk, and attempting to fight every body in the room - the prisoners were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130107"></xptr>there - Brown called for a glass of rum and water, and some gin; they both went up to the prisoners and interfered with them - Brown was very sick, and said she had got the man's watch; she wanted to go out, but my mistress said she should not go out with the watch - I heard her say, "Gray, I have lost your watch, I did not miss it till I found this knife here cutting my gown;" I saw that her gown was cut - an officer was fetched, who desired me to search the prisoners, but neither the knife nor watch was found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Brown take gin with them? A. Yes; they all had gin together.</p>

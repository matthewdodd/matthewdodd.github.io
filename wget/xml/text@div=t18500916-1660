                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Thomas Green—he keeps the George and Dragon, High-street, Woolwich—the prisoner had been in my service about six or seven weeks. On 12th Aug. I went out about seven o'clock, and came back about eleven—the prisoner was there when I went away—I had no idea that she was about to leave—there had been no warning on either side, but when I came back she was gone—I missed two dresses, a dress-pin, a finger-ring, some silk, and other things—the dresses were safe the week before—the bracelets were safe when I left home that evening—the other things were safe when she came to the house—on 24th the prisoner was brought by my father into the bar, and my husband said she had done a pretty thing for herself—she said, "So help me God! I have never seen the things; I know nothing about them"—she said she was willing to pay, but she could not pay all at once—I sent for Mrs. Poole, and I said to her, "Is this the person that brought you the silk to be made into a bonnet?"—she said, "Yes"—the prisoner again denied it, and I gave her in charge—she was searched at the police-station, and she had on a petticoat and a pair of gloves of mine—these are my property, and what I missed—the bracelets have not been found.</p>

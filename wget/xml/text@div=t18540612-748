                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the banking house of Messrs. Barnett, Hoare, and Co. Mr. Barnett's Christian names are George Henry—there are five partners—on Saturday afternoon, 13th May, I had occasion to go to the London Joint Stock Bank, in Princes-street, City, a few minutes after 4 o'clock—I had with me a leather case, for the purpose of containing notes and bills—this is it (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>); it contained among other things a cheque for 31,107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., drawn by the London and Westminster Bank on the Bank of England; and also two 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>—this is the cheque, and these are the notes—I was standing at the counter of the bank, with the case in my left hand, it was open; one of the flaps was turned back; the cheque and notes were all together in one pocket—(<hi rend="italic">The witness pointed, out to the Jury the manner in which he held the case</hi>)—the notes were folded up in halves—I did not observe any one on my left hand—I heard some one call out, "Barnett, this man has got your notes!"—I am called by the name of the firm—upon that, I immediately turned round and saw the prisoner—I think he was as near to me as anybody; he was on my left-hand side—at that time the notes were on the ground; I saw them there, and the cheque likewise—they were all crumpled up together; not as they were when they were in the case—I picked up the notes, and then caught hold of the prisoner, and he was given into custody.</p>

Barnett not quite a year—I had not laid the case down on the desk at all; it is an old case—I had put the notes into the case at the Union Bank, the last place I was at; that might have been about a quarter of an hour before—I am sure I placed the notes in this pocket—the cheque is a crossed one—I am sure the flap of the pocket was up—the notes could not have dropped out by themselves.</p>

I was in attendance at the London Joint Stock Bank when this happened—I saw Mr. Tasker there, and saw a banker's case like this in his left hand—I heard the name of Barnett called, and Tasker went to the counter—there were one or two between him and the counter, while he was waiting his turn—when the name of Barnett was called, he took out his book, and looked at it, to see the amount of the charge—I did not notice whether he moved from where he was; he might move a step or two forward—I had at that time noticed the prisoner standing at the counter: when Barnett's charge was called out, he walked to Mr. Tasker, took off his hat, and put it, with his right hand, over Mr. Tasker's case, and with his left hand he took the notes out of the case—I saw him take them out—I called out, "He has got Barnett's notes," or, "Barnett, he has got your notes"—I seized hold of the prisoner's wrist, and directly afterwards I saw what appeared to be a bundle of notes on the ground, close to him—I saw Tasker pick them up.</p>

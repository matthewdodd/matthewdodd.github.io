                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 101). I saw the prisoner going out of the Tower on 26th June, about 6 o'clock in the evening—there was a person named Bacon with him, who was carrying a basket—Clarke came up to me, and gave me a pass, which was a permission for them to go out with their tools—it said "Pass smith with tools"—I said, "Have you got anything but tools?"—he said, "No; it is all right, I have nothing but tools"—I said, "Let me see, and then I shall know whether you have got anything else"—Bacon put the basket down, I examined it, and found under the tools this bag, contain<lb></lb>ing 2 lbs. 6 ozs. of brass, and 71/4 lbs. of lead—I said, "Your pass specific tools, it says nothing about brass or lead; I cannot let you pass till I see Mr. Daly"—they both said they knew nothing about it—when Mr. Daly came, they both begged very hard for mercy from him.</p>

               <p>three years; there are twelve policemen there; there is always one at the front and the back—if the prisoner had gone the other way, he would not have passed me, but he might have passed several policemen—there might have been thirty or forty men went out at half-past 5 that night—some men work overtime till 7—there are perhaps a hundred labourers and mechanics employed there—when I wished to search the basket, Bacon immediately put it down, and the prisoner stood by—the prisoner said he was not aware that these articles were there—I told the prisoner to go for Mr. Daly, and he did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the works in the Tower—the prisoner was employed under me, and Bacon was employed to attend the prisoner as a labourer—I saw them at work about a quarter-past 5 on 20th June—I know this piece of brass to be part of a brass cock that the prisoner was fixing to a tank—I could not identify this lead; it is such as he was using—when I was up at the Tower, where he was working, he said, "I want a pass for my tools"—I told him I was going to the office, and I would write him one; I did so, and he came and got it, and presented it to the policeman—there was no authority for him to take out brass or lead, but only smith's tools—there is a store in the Tower where all materials are put—this brass belongs to the Board of Ordnance.</p>

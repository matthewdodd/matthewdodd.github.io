The Prisoner denyed the Fact, and said that he bought and sold Old Clothes about the Streets, and sold a Man a Coat for 10 s. and went into the King's Head in Cross-Street Covent-Garden to drink with him, and when he was gone another came in and said his Wife was dead and he must dispose of some of his Effects to raise Money, and offer'd him the Gown and Quilt for 4 l. than shewed him the Plate, and he bought that also at 5 s. 1 d. an Ounce; he called one

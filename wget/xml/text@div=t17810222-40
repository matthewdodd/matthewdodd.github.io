I said I would fetch her some. I had another customer I was at the same time serving with some muslin. She said if I did not serve her immediately she would go to another shop.</p>
               <p>Is this shop the place where your goods were usually kept? - It was our shop. I immediately took the other customer's money, and fetched the lawns to show the prisoner; I did not fetch them from above two or three yards distance. While I was gone. I saw her catch at a muslin wrapper, which had some muslin in it which I had shown to the other customer and had not wrapped up; the prisoner saw that I observed her and she did not attempt any thing more at the muslin. I brought several pieces of lawn, and shewed her. She looked at several. She asked me the price of one. I told her two shillings and two-pence. She said she would give two shillings. I asked her how much she would have of it? She said half a quarter. I cut her off that; while I was cutting it off I perceived she had something under her cloak. I did not see her take it. I took threepence of her; I gave it my master. I jumped over the counter. She had then got into the court. I cried out, What have you got? She turned round and dropped from under her cloak upon the ground this piece of lawn (producing it). It is my master's property; it has his private mark on it.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - She told my master when I took her into the shop, I was a very wicked man for accusing her with it; that I must have brought it out after her and dropped it.</p>
               <p>Was that one of the pieces you shewed her? - It was.</p>
               <p>What is the value of this piece? - It is valued at ten shillings; it cost Mr. Thwaites fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the place dirty or clean where she dropped it? - It was a wet day and the piece has some dirt upon it.</p>

               <p>I went to buy a bit of lawn; I bought it and paid for it. I was coming out of the shop; this man followed me. There were a dozen in the shop at the same time; there was a woman came out when I did. The man brought me back and accused me with having something belonging to the shop. His master asked if I had got any thing? He said he believed it was me. He asked me whether the woman at the door belonged to me? I said no, I knew nothing of her. Then the mistress asked me what family I had, and what I was? I told her. She said if I would tell her she would forgive me. I said I know nothing about it; I am a married woman and have two children, and am now big with child. I have been married twenty-two years and have three children.</p>
               <p>Price. I saw the corner of something white under her cloak while she was at the counter; I thought it was lawn, but did but just see the corner, so I could not be certain what it was.</p>
               <p>What number of people might there be in your shop at the time? - Eight, ten, or a dozen.</p>
               <p>Had you no other people who saw the transaction besides yourself? - Yes, but Mr. Thwaites is so much hurried with business that he could not well spare time to come.</p>
               <p>Did you see her drop it, or did you only find it after she dropped it? - I catched hold round her, and saw her drop it while she was in my arms.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My husband is a printer; I am turned of thirty.</p>
               <p>To Price. How could she take this piece without your seeing her as you suspected her? - I served two or three people at the same time.</p>

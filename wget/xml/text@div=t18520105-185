               <p>in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone. I am a cheesemonger. On 13th Dec. I went to bed about 10 minutes before 1 o'clock—I left the house all secure, the landing window was drawn down, I cannot say whether it was fastened—the shop-door was open—the back-door was bolted with two bolts—there is a small yard at the back of my house, and some small cottages which divide my yard from Devonshire-court—I came down in the morning about half-past 7—I saw the window open, and the blind tied up to one of the iron bars which go across to prevent any one getting in—when the win<lb></lb>dow is open, I should have thought no one could get in; but they must have got in there—the bars are about seven or eight inches apart—my little boy who is nine years old can get through, I should not think the prisoner could—I found the back-door leading into the yard open, which had been bolted the night before—the three tills were empty, and one stood on the counter—there was from 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. gone from the tills, we cannot tell exactly—I had seen them the night before; and I missed two coats, one of my own, which was hanging behind the parlour-door, and my son's coat which was left in the parlour—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—a person could not have got in at any other place but this window, unless they had cat the door.</p>

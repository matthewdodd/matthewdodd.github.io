I am a provision merchant and pork-pie maker, of 45, Lower Rosamond-street, Clerkenwell—in February last, the prisoner entered my employment as traveller, to serve the City houses—I was the first man who ever made pork-pies to serve London—I employed the prisoner to sell my goods on commission—soon after he entered my employ<lb></lb>ment, a sum of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing to me for some pork-pies that he had had—he paid me a cheque on the Dorking Bank—this is the cheque; it is for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the change that he ought to have received for the balance—I paid away this cheque to a salesman in Newgate Market, named" Masters," and it was returned to me dishonoured—the prisoner absented himself the next day, and it was three weeks before we could catch him—I cannot remember the day he gave me the cheque—I should say it was early in March—a publican in Warwick-lane offered me another cheque for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which he got from the prisoner—when he gave me this cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

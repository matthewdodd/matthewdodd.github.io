                  </hi>. I am a market-gardener at Fulham—Assiter was in my service. On 19th Oct. he was sent to Mr. Cubitt's, at Milbank, to fetch some straw—in about an hour after he had left, the two horses, and the empty cart were brought back by a strange man—Assiter had been allowed to take some oats and chaff in his nose-bags, but no more—I have seen the oats and chaff which is here—I have compared it with what was in my manger, and I believe it to be the same—it is more than Assiter would be allowed for his horses.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, V</hi> 39). On the morning of 19th Oct. I saw Assiter in charge of an empty cart and two horses—he turned them into a lane, and stopped at the yard of the World's End public-house, where Maynard is ostler—he had some conversation with Maynard, and returned to the top of the lane and looked about—he then went back to the cart and took a bag out, and handed it to Maynard, and Maynard gave him something in return—I went and took Maynard as he was emptying the contents of the bag into the horse-trough—this is the mixture—Assiter came back to the cart, and was taken.</p>

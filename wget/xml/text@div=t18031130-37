            ; I saw him pack up shirts, handkerchiefs, aprons, stockings, and waistcoats, into the bundle. As I was going along Shoreditch, I looked into a doctor's shop, and the least of the two prisoners, (Pounceford,) came up to me; he asked me if he should carry my bundle; I told him I was not going much further; as I went up Curtain-road, I met the other prisoner. Pounceford had followed me; they spoke together in the Curtain-road, but I did not hear what they said; I went into a public-house to ask what it was o'clock, and they stopped at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that for the purpose of getting rid of them? - A. Yes; and when I came out, they were waiting at the door; I kept on till I came to <placeName id="t18031130-37-crimeloc225">Vinegar-yard</placeName>

               <p>Q. They knocked you down before they took your bundle? - A. Yes, I had it in both arms close to my breast, because it was a large bundle; I screamed, and Mr. Holloway came out; the prisoners ran away, and Mr. Holloway ran after them; he could not catch them, and then he took me in, and wrote a letter to Mr. Wilson, where Mr. Penn lived. The next day I went with Brown and Elby to look after them, and we met them in Rose-lane, Spital-fields, leading towards Whitechapel; I told Mr. Brown it was them that took the bundle from me; they heard me say so, and they both ran away, and got into the broad place.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure those are the two boys? - A. Yes, I am certain of it, I have no doubt; I saw Pounceford at the doctor's shop, where it was very light, and I could see his face; I have not the least doubt they are the persons; I saw Green at a baker's shop in the Curtain-road, and I saw him at the public-house door; every light place I came to, I looked at their faces.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you look so particularly at their faces? - A. They would keep up with me, and wanted to carry my bundle; when I came out of the public-house, they were waiting for me; I ran away, and they caught me at Vinegar-yard; I am perfectly sure they are the same persons.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Has the property ever been found? - A. No part of it. I belong to the Public-Office, Shadwell: On the 21st of October I heard of the robbery, and sent for the boy, and asked him if he should know the persons again; he said, yes; I took him to the broad place where these kind of people toss up in a morning. In Rose-lane we passed the two prisoners; Elby was before me, and the boy behind; the boy said, here they are, both of them; upon that, they both ran away; we pursued them into the broad place, where there were, I suppose, twenty or thirty of these sort of people, and there we lost sight of the prisoners; I then had a private information of them, and I went to a private lodging in Wentworth-street, on the 25th of November, in company with Elby, and apprehended them both; they were in bed, in two different garrets; the servant went up first, and said, George, open the door, here is a gentleman wants to see you; he would not open the door, and I told him I would break it open; he then jumped out of bed, and unbolted the door; he was going into bed again, and I said, come, come, put on your clothes, I want you; I knew him immediately to be the person who ran away from me on the 21st; then I made the other get up, and open his door; the doors are close together; he said, Mr. Brown, do you want me too? he knew me very well; I told him, yes; we secured them, and brought them before the Magistrate. I knew them both before, and I am sure they are the same persons I had seen in Rose-lane; I took particular notice of the shortest, being very much pock-marked; they acknowledged running away from me in Rose-lane.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a French gentleman and an English merchant—I have resided in England twenty-four years—I live at East Pavilion, Sloane-street—on Monday, 15th April, I left the goods department of the Eastern Counties railway at a quarter-past 5—I took a cab and three minutes after I was in the cab I fell among these people; the cab was broken and fell down—on getting out of the cab I was immediately stopped by Morley, the one nearest to me, and immediately Mary Ann Welsh came and tried to unbutton my coat—I had the same coat on which I have now—they were all six of them after me—this was in Lower Keate-street, and about twenty minutes past 5—I struggled with them all and some who were behind me, about two or three minutes, with my hands, and crying as much as I could for help, but it appears that in that street they are all thieves, and no one came to my help—there were a great many people there—then Coker, after having unbuttoned my coat, succeeded in putting his hand in my right-hand trousers pocket, and Mary Ann Welsh put her hand in my left pocket, assisted very actively by Ellen Welsh, and they were saying, "Quick! Quick!"—when Coker put his hand into my right pocket I felt my keys, and some receipts, and all the bank notes taken from it—I had 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—they are all in the hands of the policeman—they were in my right-hand pocket—12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and a small bag were in my left—Mary Ann Welsh took that, assisted very actively by Ellen Welsh—the man Tucker took my gold chain, and snapped it from me—the ring went, fortunately leaving the watch in the bottom of my pocket, but at the moment I thought it was gone—I could see them very distinctly, because I was standing pushing at them—the Cokers were taken up first to the police-court, the same day—I recognised them again—I am quite sure that these are the people—I must state that during the time they were busy about me, the one in the black dress, Ann Coker, was throwing something red before my face—I do not know whether it was a handkerchief or an apron—I stopped the notes that very morning at 9 o'clock—I have not recovered the gold since, or an eye glass which I lost—I lost my hat in the struggle—they beat me on the back, and the more I struggled the more they pressed upon me, and beat me—Tucker snatched my chain—they were all struggling, but these two women did not leave me a second—they were at me exactly like dogs, and they stopped my voice with</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 114). I was near Keate-street, on Monday, 15th April, about twenty minutes, or from that to half-past 5—my attention was called to a male voice crying out, "Help! police! I am robbed!"—I went to the bottom of Keate-street, lending into Lower Keate-street—I was from fifteen to twenty yards off when I first heard the cry—I saw a cab broken down in Lower Keate-street, against the corner—I then went up to see what was the matter, still hearing the voice crying not," Police! I am robbed!"—I saw the prosecutor going away from the mob, and I also saw the female Coker running away from the mob—she ran into a lodging-house, in the same street, followed by the male Coker—just before he went into the lodging-house door, I saw him pull a handful of notes or papers of some description, I could not distinguish whether they were notes or what they were, out of his right-hand pocket, he looked at them, and put them in again, and then he ran into the door—I should have been soon enough to have taken him into custody then, only there was such a mob, I could not get through the mob, and in those streets they stop a policeman as soon as they can see them after any person—I then followed the last witness—before I came up to him I saw a boy kicking his hat about the street—he is not in custody—I picked the hat up and took it to the prosecutor—I asked him if that was his hat, and he said, "Yes"—he was in a very exhausted state—his mouth was bleeding—he made a complaint to me, and he went with me to the police-station—on going there I found this piece of chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) hanging round his neck, underneath his coat—I heard the charge given at the station—I went in search of the prisoners the same night, with Harvey, another police-officer—I went with him to the lodging-house where I had seen the two Cokers go, found them there, and took them into custody, to the police-station—the prosecutor saw them the same night—nothing was found on either—when I saw the Cokers in the mob of people, I did not recognise any of these other prisoners.</p>

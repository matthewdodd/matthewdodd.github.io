               <p>Court. How came it to your knowledge? - In consequence of those hand bills, and Mr. Nelson's knowing the Jew who bought it, he said, he had seen the prisoner, and was to take some things out of pawn, and if I would go and meet him that day, but I could not; but I saw the prisoner on Easter Tuesday, the 22d in the watch-house, in Fleet-market, he was taken up on suspicion of this robbery, I recollected him immediately, I believed him to be the same man.</p>
               <p>Did you charge him with the fact? - No.</p>
               <p>Was he told in your presence what he was taken up for? - He was examined upon it.</p>
               <p>What answer did he make? - The first time he said, he got the gown of a servant maid that was gone to America, and the last time he said, the Jew did not give him the money for the gown, and he denied having been in our house.</p>

             sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness; I lost a great coat, a woollen apron, and twenty guineas in money, last Monday was month; I keep a house in Gray's-lnn-lane, and sell fruit in the street; the prisoner was out of place, and I took her in, out of pity, to sleep with my children; I missed the things when I got up in the morning, the money was sewed up inside my petticoat, the great coat and petticoat were on the bed, the apron was on the back of the chair, there was nobody in the house but the prisoner and the children; she left the house without giving any notice, she was gone an hour, I dare say, before I missed the things, and never returned till I had her taken up; I found the great coat upon her at the pawnbroker's, last Monday was month, between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lent her that great coat? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had given her no authority to take it? - A. No; I saw the apron upon her, I said nothing to her about this business at the pawnbroker's, I thought nothing about the clothes; when I found her at the pawnbroker's, she was changing one of the guineas to take out some things that came to thirteen shillings and sixpence; I had her taken up, and searched at my brother's in Chancery-lane, I found nothing upon her but the coat and apron, and the change of the guinea; I charged her with taking my money, and she denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know your money was there? - A. I don't know that she did; she saw me stripping of a night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had it there? - A. Ever since I sold my milk-walk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What is your name? - A. Catherine Callighan.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you married to the last witness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You wheel a barrow about? - A. Yes; I have known the prisoner seven years, she lived with my brother before she came to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150078"></xptr>Q. At your request she came to live with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say you took her in out of charity? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a brother? - A. A brother-in-law; his name is Sullivan, a milk-man, in Chancery-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Cockran? - A. Yes; he is a brother-in-law of mine, a bricklayer.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been courting this girl, had not he? - A. I don't know what you mean; I don't know, he may for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you bring the girl to your house for the express purpose of his marrying her? - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, upon your oath, that he was not, to your knowledge, paying his addresses to her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean also to swear that you did not bring the girl there to induce her to marry him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you never made any proposition of that sort? - A. To be sure I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had this money? - A. A twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in fact, borrow any money during that twelvemonth? - A. Not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you never borrowed any money during that twelvemonth? - A. Never a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. You never, in the course of that twelve-month, pawned any of your things? - A. Yes; but not for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not pawned your own clothes? - A. Yes, but not for myself; I did for my brother; he wanted me to lend him a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you pawn these clothes? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to pawn your things when you had that money by you? - A. Because I was sworn not to lend money; my brother came and asked me to lend him a guinea; I said I could not, and lent him two gowns to pawn for a guinea.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Explain how you were sworn not to lend money? - A. Because my husband lent a guinea to a man some time back, and I made an oath myself not to lend any money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that lending money, when you took the things to the pawnbroker's? - A. No; I gave them to him to pawn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You preferred paying exorbitant interest when this money was lying by you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been in company with a Mrs. Kelly three or four days before you brought this charge? - A. I might be.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you remember telling Mrs. Kelly you wanted to purchase a milk-walk for your brother, which you could get for two guineas; that you wanted two guineas, and could neither raise nor borrow it, and was obliged to pawn your clothes? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sewed the money up in your petticoat? - A. My husband and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect borrowing half-a-guinea before that to lend to another brother? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you lend it to? - A. To nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your husband borrow half-a-guinea of the brother of the prisoner to lend to a man? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed the clothes, and money about six or seven o'clock in the morning, did you not bounce up at once, and run down, and make a noise? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the prisoner go out? - A. Between five and six.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said she did not go out till eight o'clock that morning? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. That you positively swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first go to the Magistrate? - A. Pretty nigh twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. The girl was in custody then, and you had searched her, and found nothing upon her; did you say one word to the Magistrate that you had lost this coat and petticoat? - A. Not the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to admit you said not one word about the coat before the Magistrate? - A. Not the first day, the second day I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe your husband came to town before the second time you went to the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you been with the friends of the poor girl before the first and second examination, to ask for money to make it up? - A. No; I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a coat is this? - A. I have it here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lend the girl a coat? - A. Yes; I have lent her my husband's coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she not the coat on when you took her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She wore these things publicly in the street? - A. Lending her a thing is different.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lend her your cloak? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lend it her for? - A. To wear.</p>

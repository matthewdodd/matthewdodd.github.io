On the night of the 12th, or early on the morning of the 13th, as I was getting out of my box, a person gave me information, and as I went by the prosecutor's house I stopped a minute at his front door, which leads into Tothill-street, and thought I heard a smothered cough in the house; I went to Cowley, at the next beat, and asked him if the Almonry watchman was on duty; he said he was: I said, "You go to the back-door of the Nag's Head;" he went away - I made no alarm in the front till I thought he had got there; I then made an alarm - the party made their escape, and the two watchmen caught them as they got out; I did not see them till they got to the watch-house, which was about fifty yards off; we found the two doors forced open - this lock was forced off one door, and laid down by the side, and this casement laid on the tap-room table, with the glass broken out.</p>

I received information from Boyd, and went with Brand into the Almonry, where Carpenter has a back door; we went to the door, waited there about half a minute, and the two prisoners came out - they were seized directly; Brand took price, and I took the other - we took them to the watch-hosue; I found the house had been broken open - I did not go into the house; one of the prisoners said, "What are you at?"

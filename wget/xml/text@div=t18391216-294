On Monday afternoon, the 2nd of December, the two prisoners came to my shop—Bates asked if I had a pair of pattens to dispose of—I said I had—I gave them to her—she had no money to pay for them—she said she was going on business to the west<lb></lb>end of the town, she should have money when she returned, and if I would give her 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. she would leave this umbrella till she came back—she said she could not pledge it, as the pawnbroker's would be shut up before she came back; that it was only lent her, and she dared not return without it—I gave her the pattens and the 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and took the umbrella up stairs—they both went away, and did not return—a gentleman came next day and asked for it, and I brought it down.</p>

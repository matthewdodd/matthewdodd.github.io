               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why did you stop? A. I had occasion to stop at the time - only the flap of my breeches was open when the prisoner came up; she did not say any thing to me, nor I to her - I did not take any liberties with her; I was not exactly sober - I was perfectly sensible - I did not call Watch! immediately, as I did not see any watchman near; I had asked the prisoner for the purse - I cannot tell exactly what I had drank; I had had half a dozen glasses of wine, and some ale, but no spirits or mixture - I told the watchman I had lost a sovereign and some silver, and I thought there was a half-crown among it, and that the sovereign had a cross on it, but I had had two sovereigns - the sovereign she gave the watchman had no cross on it, and there was no halfcrown found on her; the watchman asked me several times if I meant to persist in giving charge of her - I had seen the money not two minutes before; I did not say I had seen it at six o'clock in the evening - I was requested to search my pocket; I took a handkerchief out of my pocket, and put it into my hat - I did not after that accuse the officer of having my handkerchief - I am sure of that; he did not tell me to be careful how I spoke - I said I thought the sovereign had a cross on it, and I thought there was a half-crown; I had seen my money just before, but I might have dropped the half-crown - the sovereign she gave the watchman had no cross on it; she gave him 6s. 6d. in silver, but no half-crown - it had been in my pocket a few minutes before; the money I lost was 1l. 9s., but I mentioned 1l. 6s. 6d. because that was the sum I had in my purse, but the half-crown was not in the purse - my pocket was turned out; I did not miss the half-crown, but I knew I had the 1l. 6s. 6d. in my purse - I knew I had a half-crown, and I lost the whole of my money; I gave my right name to the watchman - I believe I gave the address of the persons I had been to; I was asked my name, and I gave my name right, as far as I know; I will not swear that; I cannot recollect what name I gave, I was confused.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Cripplegate. I was passing Little Moorfields at a quarter before eleven o'clock - I heard the prosecutor say to the prisoner, "Give me my money;" I asked him if he had been robbed - he said Yes, of a sovereign; I said, "Will you give charge of the woman?" he said Yes - I took her along Fore-street; in going along she passed a sovereign and 6s. 6d. into my hand - the purse was afterwards found in Green Dragon-court, the way she had gone in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prosecutor pass that way also? A. Yes - this was a quarter of a mile from where he said he had lost it; I did not hear what silver he stated at the watch-house, for I went out - the prisoner came to Guildhall the next day, voluntarily.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did the prosecutor say how much money he had lost? A. He said about 1l. 7s., in a green purse, and the prisoner gave me 1l. 6s. 6d.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why did you not name these valuable articles which were in it? A. I named what was in the purse - I do not think I mentioned the duplicates; I said there were some papers in it - these are not my own duplicates - I had them from a friend to whom I had lent some money; they are my own now - they are my own, I pawned the things myself.</p>

            . I was officer of the night, on the 2nd of May - the prisoner and prosecutor were brought into the watch-house, between ten and eleven o'clock; the prosecutor was very drunk - the watchman said he had 1l. 6s. 6d. given him by the prisoner; I asked the prosecutor if he knew the sovereign - he said it had a cross on it, and there was a half-crown in the silver he had been robbed of; I found no mark on the sovereign, nor any half-crown - he strongly persisted that he had been robbed, but he did not know that this was the woman; I searched her, but found nothing on her - I asked if he would give charge of her; he said, "No, I don't want to hurt her, nor to be exposed;" he then said, "Give me the sovereign, you can keep the 6s. 6d. among yourselves;" the prisoner said the money was hers - I pressed him to give charge; he said he would not - he was going out, but seemed much dissatisfied; the inspector then searched her again, but found nothing - she still claimed the money; I asked her if I might depend upon her coming the next day to Guildhall - she said I might, and I let her go; in three quarters of an hour the other watchman brought in the purse and the duplicates - the prisoner came to Guildhall the next day as she promised.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stonemason and builder, at Woolwich. I know James Watson—I saw him on 21st May, near the Lord Howick—he asked me if I was in want of any bricks—I asked him what they were, old or new—he said, "Either"—that he had purchased a great many bricks that day—I asked what the figure was—he said, "Twenty-eight shillings a thousand"—I afterwards went to his house—he asked me how many bricks I would want, and I told him about five thousand—they were new ones—he said I should have them, he would get them in, about four or five o'clock next morning—I believe the reason he gave why he would get them in so early was, that they would be in the way of the railway—a person named Moore was there, and an arrangement was made with him to cart them—they were to be taken to Sandy-hill—next morning I received some bricks, under a thousand—on Friday night, 25th May, I again saw Mr. Watson, at his own house—I was driving by, and called in—I asked him the reason the other bricks were not sent in—he said he would cart them in the next morning—I understood that the remainder of the five thousand were to come in—I understood from him that they were somewhere near the George the Fourth—on 26th, I received about 1,800 more bricks—they were delivered at Sandy-hill, near Plumstead<lb></lb>common—I have not paid Mr. Watson for any of them—the price was twenty-eight shillings a thousand—I think some of them were taken up and used for a water-closet—the officers came to me on the 26th—I pointed out to them where the bricks had been used—there was "W.

I was engaged on 26th May in taking some bricks from the yard of the George the Fourth to Sandy-hill, Plumstead—I after<lb></lb>wards went and took a load, in company with Record and young Mr. Watson—Langley's cart went with us—it was behind—I did not bear either of the Mr. Watsons say what I was to say supposing any one interrupted me; only young Mr. Watson said, the first morning I went to work, that we were going to take them down to Woolwich—the first morning I went to work was on Tuesday—on Saturday, the 26th, I took some more bricks from the George the Fourth yard—the last time I went there, young Mr. Watson and Record were with me—we loaded up a load of new stack bricks—there might have been one or two place bricks amongst them—they were all new—while we were loading them, Dobson came up—he walked round the cart and said, "Where are you going with these bricks?"—Record said, "To the Tunnel"—he said, "It is a strange thing; we have got thirteen or fourteen barges of bricks lying there, and more are brought here every day"—Record said, "I do not know anything about it; we were ordered by the man on the wharf"—I did not hear anything said by the elder or younger Watson about what answer was to be given, supposing anybody asked the question—young Mr. Watson said he would leave us to load the cart, and he would go and meet Langley's cart—I had two bricks in my hand, and I dropped one when Record said they were going to the Tunnel—Record said, "You have not got 500 bricks yet"—I said, "No, I know that;" and he took up the tail-board and began to drive the cart—(I dropped the brick, because I thought there was something wrong)—Record drove the cart on, and I said he had not got the pins—he said nothing, but kept driving on the cart—I took the pins and put them in—as we went by, I saw Langley's cart—Langley was with it, and young Mr. Watson—as were were going by he said, "Take them down to Charlton Tunnel"—their house is by the side of Charlton Tunnel—I went on towards their house—when we got there, we drew part of the way up the hill, took the horse across the road, hung the nose-bag on the horse, and there left it, near to the White Horse—I saw young Mr. Watson at that time—he said, "Leave the horse here, and if anybody should come, tell them they have been drawn to the Tunnel"—I left the cart and bricks there by the White</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hosier, and live in High-street, Aldgate. The prisoner was in my employ for nearly three months—my servants usually go to dinner between one and two o'clock—on the 15th of De<lb></lb>cember, the prisoner was in the shop at that time—he generally stopped in the shop while the others went to dinner—I was in the parlour, and had a view of the shop—in consequence of something which I saw the prisoner do, I went to him, and said he had been robbing me—he said he had not—I told him I saw him draw the till out, take out some money, and put it into his pocket—his hand was in his pocket a the time—I immediately told him to go to his brother, to tell him to come up—he returned with his brother, who opened his boxes with a key, which the prisoner gave him, and I saw these three silk handkerchiefs which are mine—I had had four of them nearly three years—I have the other in my pocket now—they had been in the window for sale, but they were in the glass case when he took them—I had seen them there within a month—when they were found, I told the prisoner they were mine—he said they were not—I immediately went for the one which belonged to them, and produced it—I told him that was exactly the same pattern, and they were mine—it matched in every way; he said they were made a present to him by a female—in consequence of that observation, and from what I afterwards heard, I caused inquiry to be made of Ann Willis, who is here.</p>

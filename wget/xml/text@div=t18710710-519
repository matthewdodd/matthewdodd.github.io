               <p>—on Sunday morning, 4th July, about 1.30, I was on Clerkenwell Green—I was suddenly attacked by two men, and was held back with their hands over my mouth—I fell on the ground—they rifled my pockets of a sovereign, a five shilling piece, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and some halfpence, a tobacco-box, and a leather pouch—I caught a glimpse of the prisoner, the other man I did not see—I went round towards St. James' Walk and met a constable—I could not speak to him at the time, I could not fetch my breath then; I told him I had been robbed—I stayed in Sutton Street and he went up the Broadway—I had been drinking, but I knew what I was about.</p>

On Sunday morning, 4th July, about 1.30, I was in St. James' Walk, and saw two men running from Clerkenwell Green—the prisoner was one of them—I knew him before by sight and by name—the prosecutor came up, gasping for breath—he said he had been robbed—I told him to follow me, and pursued the prisoner—I caught him at the corner of Woodbridge Street, and said to him "Cham<lb></lb>berlain, I want you"—he said "What for?"—I said "For robbing a person"—the prosecutor then came up and identified him—I searched him at the station and found on him a sovereign, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a knife.</p>

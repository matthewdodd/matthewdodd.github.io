                  </hi>. I am a City detective—on 7th April, about half-past 1 o'clock, I saw the two prisoners in Barbican, near the end of Redcross-street—they were standing talking together—two gentlemen passed by towards Long-lane; the prisoners followed them nearly to Aldersgate-street, where Green put his hand into the pocket of one of the gentlemen, and stole from it a handkerchief, Lynes being close up to him at the time—they im<lb></lb>mediately turned round, Green at the same time passing the handkerchief to Lynes, and they separated—I took Lynes into custody, to Moor-lane station; Green made his escape, and was subsequently apprehended—I found this handkerchief in Lynes' coat-pocket—I have no doubt it is the same that was taken from the gentleman—Lynes had no other handkerchief, and I did not lose sight of him.</p>

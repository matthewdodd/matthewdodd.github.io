               <p>THOMAS RICE. On the 13th of December, about half after five in the evening, I was going along the Back road Islington; I met the prisoner with a piece of timber on his back; I asked him where he was going to take it, he said, home; he said he had taken it from Mr. Pocock's premises, it was his property; I asked him if he worked for Mr. Pocock, he said he did, afterwards he said he did not; I then told him he must go back to see if Mr. Pocock had given him that wood; he did not wish to go back, I took him to the watch-house and sent to Mr. Pocock, he sent his foreman.</p>

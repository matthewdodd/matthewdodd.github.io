On the 11th of April I was walking down the Strand; when I got facing of my own window I saw the prisoner take some drops and put in his pocket, he was taking them from a lustre; I then went into my shop, it was about eight o'clock; he left work in a moment then. I was so much alarmed I said nothing to him that night about it; he went out. On the next morning about six o'clock he returned to his work again, I called him into the counting house, I told him I had seen him rob me the night before; I asked him where he lodged, he told me three or four places, but he never told me where he did lodge. I sent for an officer; Miller came and took him to Bow street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards find any of these things - A. I went with Miller and saw some of these things in Burleigh court, Burleigh street; we saw his wife there in the lodgings; we found the goods mentioned in the indictment; the pans I know to be mine, I believe them all to be mine; they have no particular marks, they are like our patterns; the glass drops he took away the night before were more valuable than those we found.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never discovered those drops he took away that night - A. No.</p>
               <p>- MILLER. I am an officer of Bow street. I took charge of this man on the 12th of April; when we came to the office he told me where he lodged. I went with Mr. Price to his lodgings in Burleigh court; Mr. Price said he had robbed him; the prisoner said he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew him the things that were found there - A. I produced them in his presence before the magistrate; he told the magistrate that he brought them in his bundle from Dublin.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is there any thing that you can particularize as yours - A. These pans are the same patterns as were in our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you venture to say that other shops cannot have pans of that make - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury - these articles are all my property; these spangles, that Mr. Price calls drops, I brought from Dublin with me; the other articles, the pans, I got them made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010053"></xptr>and had cut by my brother, I made them for a lady that employed me to make a pair of candlesticks; my brother cut them in this old fashioned way; the lady would not have them. The brass chain I made myself; I purchased the spangles, with a great many more articles. It is impossible for Mr. Price, or any body else, to swear to the things found on me; throughout Dublin and London there are similar articles, they are of the commonest sort; Mr. Price knows nothing of the trade. If I had had a mind to defraud Mr. Price of any articles these are not the things that I should take, when there were things of the newest patterns that would be worth something. There is no one in the trade that would give any thing for them; they are worth nothing.</p>

               <p>Herbert. He worked <rs id="t17470225-20-deflabel88" type="occupation">Journey-work</rs>

               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Herbert. At Chelmsford; the 11th of January my Lodger, after she heard me say I was robbed, she said, did you not come in the last Night, between the Hours of eight and nine, did you not tumble over the Pail? I said, no; she said she heard some Body come in, and go up Stairs, and open your Drawers; upon this I had a Suspicion of this Man's stealing these Goods; I had a Jealousy of this Man, and pursued him into the Country to Witham, and from thence to London; I pursued him here to London, and found him in Drury-lane; I challenged him with it, and he confessed it to me immediately; I said, what is become of the Breeches you made on Saturday? I says I shall lose my Trade; I said if the Coat is not found, I must never go Home again any more; he directed me where to find it immediately of a Pawnbroker; the Coat was at one Place, and the Breeches at another.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon this?</p>
               <p>Herbert. We went before the Justice, and I was bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoner. Would you ask him any Questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I never directed him, nor told him any thing about it; but he frightened me so with catching me, that I did not know what I was saying.</p>

            . Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Lankake. I can't say that I know the Person; I have seen him before the Justice; we had something that the Prisoner sent, which he owned before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was brought to you, the Breeches or the Coat?</p>
               <p>Lankake. The Breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Prisoner own before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Lankake. He told the Prosecutor where to find his Things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the Coat as well as the Breeches?</p>
               <p>Lankake. They had the Coat first.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174702250032"></xptr>Q. What did the Prisoner say as to the Breeches?</p>
               <p>Lankake. The Prisoner said they were the Prosecutor's; he said he owed Mrs. Petty something for Lodgings, and she brought them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Coat produced before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Lankake. Yes, he said he had them both from the Prosecutor's House.</p>

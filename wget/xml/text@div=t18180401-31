            , Esq. On Tuesday the 3rd of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I had information that that a boy had ran through the garden, which leads from the dwelling-house into the New-road, I went into the housekeeper's room, with the maid, and missed a sheet from the fire - I and all the other servants were in the house - I pursued as quick as possible, he was pointed out to me at a distance in the street - He turned into Little James-street, Lisson-green, and went into a house; not finding him I got a constable, he searched and found the sheet. I had seen the fellow one at the fire. Coates brought the sheet to me, I examined it and found my master's mark, W L 5, on it; I had been in the house for two hours before. I do not know that either of the prisoners was the boy.</p>

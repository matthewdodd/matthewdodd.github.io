I was then on my legs - I said "Yes, but I have lost all my money;" I had lost 11s. 6d. from my left-hand trousers pocket - I could not swear who took it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you lost it at that time? A. Because just as I was passing, I had my hand in my pocket, and I know it was there when I was knocked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090070"></xptr>down; the lamps were lighted, and I was confident of the prisoner, when I got up - when they saw the watchman coming, the prisoner and the man who helped me up, immediately ran away; most of the others also disappeared; the prisoner was pursued after the watchman came up, but we could not find him - the watchman told us to come there between four and five o'clock, as he might have a chance of seeing them; I and Rogers went and saw Jones, the watchman - we had not been talking to him many minutes before we saw the prisoner coming down a street very near George-street; we pointed him out to the watchman, he ran, and got into another street through an entry, and the watchman could not find him -I did not see him again till last March, when he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When did you see Rogers last? - A. Not for six months; he went into the country to work - I had but one pint of porter the whole evening and was perfectly sober; I had never seen the prisoner before; it did not last above ten minutes - I was rather confused; I know the prisoner, because I heard him speaking to Rogers.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Giles'. I remember Roberts coming down George-street, a little before twelve o'clock at night, on a Saturday in June -I saw him in George-street; another young man was with him; Roberts complained that he had been robbed, and described the person; I had known the prisoner before, and had seen him a great many times in that neighbourhood - the description given induced me to suspect him to be the man; I went to look for him, but did not find him; I advised them to come again in the morning at four o'clock, and they came - while they were with me, I saw the prisoner in Buckeridge-street, which runs out of George-street; he was in company with another man - Roberts said that was the person who knocked him down, pointing to the prisoner; they were then on the other side of the way - it was said loud enough for the prisoner to hear; he ran away directly; I pursued, but was not able to take him, for he turned into Bainbridge-street, where the doors are open all night long; I lost sight of him - he must have got into some house; I did not see him again till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How wide is Buckeridge-street? -A. Not very wide; George-street is frequented by a great number of the lower orders, who dress pretty much alike; the prisoner had on a blue coat and a hat, but it did not cover his face at all.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Clare-court. On the 9th of April, the prisoner came to my shop with thirteen law books to sell - I asked him how he came by them; he said his brother was a student, and wished him to sell them, to buy new ones; I said if he would leave them, I would perhaps buy them; he did so, and came again about five o'clock in the evening; I gave him a guinea for them. Next day, about twelve o'clock, he brought thirteen more, and left them with me. I gave him 25 s. for them. I sold the first lot to Mr. Rolph. He called again next day with more, and I had him secured.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Bow-street. The prisoner came to my shop, and bought a catalogue, about three months ago, and in April, he brought some books, which he said his brother had to sell. I bought them; he brought two or three parcels since that, consisting principally of law books. The last time he brought me twelve volumes of Reports - he said his brother had a great many more to sell. I said I had better see his brother - he said he would go and ask at what time it would be convenient; I did not see him afterwards.</p>

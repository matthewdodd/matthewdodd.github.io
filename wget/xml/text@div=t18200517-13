On the 27th of April, about half-past five in the morning, I went to the shop and found the staple of the lock drawn, and a bill and spade stolen. I saw them safe about eleven o'clock the morning before. I got a search-warrant, went about ten o'clock to the prisoner's house, which is about twenty yards from my house, and found the spade and axe. I had not missed the axe till I found it. I do not know when I had seen that last. I had not sold it. Nobody but my son and myself serve in the shop.</p>

            . I am constable of Enfield. I went with a search-warrant to the prisoner's house, and found the spade in his back room - he said he found it. I said he must give a better account, and went up stairs and found the axe under his bed. He said he bought that of an old-iron man for 3 s. or 3 s. 6 d., but he did not know the man. He said it was without a handle when he bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before did he say he bought it - A. About three months. I heard him examined before the Magistrate. What he said was taken down and read to him, he admitted that it was correct, and was asked to sign it. I think he said he could not write. The Magistrate put his name to it - (looking at it) - this is it. Nothing whatever was said to induce him to confess.</p>

            . I am son of the last witness. On the 26th, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I made every thing fast, and I knew the spade was there then, because I had it in my hand. I knew it by the handle, there was Bishopsgate-street written on it - it is now scratched out. I know it by the make and shape. Part of the axe is my own work. I saw it safe within two months of the robbery, and never sold it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say it belonged to another man - A. Yes, it did; we new laid it - (Examination read).</p>
               <p>"The prisoner says he found the spade about fifty yards from the said shop, between nine and ten o'clock last night, and took it home and put it where it was found; and that he bought the axe six months since of an old-iron-cart man - gave him 3 s. for it, and put the handle to it."</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the morning of the 5th of April I saw some sashes behind a caravan, in the road near the Small Pox-hospital - Souter was standing by them; I afterwards saw the prisoner and Minifi, who were in conversation, but I could not tell what they said; I went up, and took the prisoner and Souter - the prisoner said he had bought the sashes on the 4th of April, at a sale over the water, but he could not tell the place, or the auctioneer's name - he gave me his address, which I found correct; the people said he had lived there eight months, but they did not know how he got his living.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. It is not an uncommon thing to have sales over the water? A. No; I did not see the sashes in any cart.</p>

            . I am porter, and lodge in King-street, Borough. On the 4th of April I was standing to be hired at London-bridge; the prisoner came and engaged me to carry some sash-frames to Battle-bridge the next morning, and the next morning, at half-past five, or a quarter before six o'clock, he took me to Joiner-street, Tooley-street - there were gates and a yard there; the bar was down - the prisoner opened the gates; I saw these sashframes there, on a tank, and the prisoner helped them on my knot - I carried them; I asked him whether I should go over London-bridge, as that was the nearest way, but he said he wanted to go to the Borough-market - I went on, he with me, and when we got to a joiner's shop, I pitched them down, and untied them - he went to a man named Minifi; the Policeman came, and took me and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Then you were taken as well as the prisoner? A. Yes; I said he took them out of the yard, and so he did - I was not afraid I should be tried; I am a jobbing porter - I hand known the prisoner before; he had not paid me - I often do jobs without knowing what I shall have for them: the sashes were all tied up when he opened the gates, and he took them.</p>

            . I live at No.14, Battle-bridge, and am a glazier. The prisoner came to my house on the morning of the 5th of April, about eight o'clock, and asked if I wanted to buy some old windows; I said I did not know that I did, but where were they - he said, "Over here;" I went to look at them, and had some conversation with him - I said they did not suit me; the Policeman came up just as I left them.</p>

I have seen these ten sashes - they are my masters; I cannot tell what they are worth - they had been kept in the first floor warehouse near the counting - house; there was a considerable quantity of goods there, and these were behind the other things I went about ten o'clock in the morning of the 5th of April, and missed them; there was a lock on the back gate adjoining Joiner-street, and that had been forced, and then they must have crossed the premises; I should not have known how the gate could have been opened after the lock was off, till the Policeman showed me how the chain could be slipped over the bar; I had no suspicion of the sashes being lost till the policeman came - they would have been in the loft for twelve months; there was nothing removed on the Monday evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Were they new sashes? A. No, old ones, purchased at the old buildings in a street adjoining Tolley-street, some months ago - I do not know when; I had seen them in the loft very likely a month before - there were three blank panes in one of them- I have seen the prisoner at the premises - he came and said he was doing business for this gentleman, and that gentleman; he came there under pretence of buying, and laid out perhaps a few pence - I took his money, but it was very little.</p>

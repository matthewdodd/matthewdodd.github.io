                  </hi>. I am footman to Lady Jane Carr—she is a widow—her house is in the parish of Ealing—the prisoner had been in her service three weeks—I was present about two o'clock, on the afternoon of the 16th of Aug., when the housekeeper gave him warning—he then left—I was after<lb></lb>wards sent for by Miss Perceval, and directed to take charge of the plate—I went to the pantry, and saw the prisoner in the act of putting a silver sauce boat into his box which he was packing up—I said, "Good God, what are you about?"—I took it from him, and put it in its proper place in the pantry—the bell rang, and I left—after I had answered it, I went back to the pan<lb></lb>try—he was there still packing up—I remained with him till he had finished—the sauce boat belongs to mistress, and was in a closet across the pantry—this brush is hers—the policeman found that in the prisoner's box—its proper place was in a drawer in the pantry—there were four of these sauce boats left out for dinner.</p>

                  </hi>. I was sent for to Lady Carr's, in the afternoon, and searched the prisoner's box—I found a quantity of ends of candles, a bottle of wine, a bottle of beer, and about the middle of his box about 3lbs. of sperm candles—he said he knew nothing about them—neither had he put them there—in taking him to the station, he said it served him right, he should have left when he had an opportunity, and then he would have been all right—he had been drinking, but knew what he was about—he said before the Magistrate that he brought the candles from his last situation.</p>

When I came back again he was still standing there in the same manner, and much about the same place; I am certain it is him, I pointed him out immediately I saw him. I afterwards observed that the two persons that came to administer joined together with him after they had been sworn; this took place on the 3d of April.

Before I went to Doctor's-commons one Vaughan wrote a letter as if coming from major White; Monk and Knight produced a list of names of men that belonged to major White's company at Monk's lodgings in Orchard street, Westminster; Knight and Monk together gave Gibbons fourteen names out of the list of major White's company in the eighty seventh regiment; and they consulted with him which was the best; the particular name that was taken at that time was

I saw them come back again and Monk went into Mr. Ward's house, and, I believe, Gibbons, I am not sure of that. When they came but, we all joined company and went away together; they were to call in two days for the administration. On the day they were to call for the administration it was coming off guard; I was to meet them at the public house in the street were Mr. Ward lives.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet them there. - A. Yes, I met Monk and Gibbons. We went down to Greenwich hospital. Monk went into the office there, and I was to wait outside of the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which office it is. - A. He went into one of the further side of the yard first, and then he went into another. I waited at the outside about twenty minutes; he returned to me after he came out of the office and he (Monk) gave Gibbons twenty four pounds one shilling and sixpence; Gibbons took it and gave him what he pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your share. - A. Two pounds fifteen. I believe Monk had about four or five pounds, and Gibbons had the remainder for paying for the administration and the coach hire.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Monk. - A. I have known Monk these two years or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him by any other name than Monk. - A. No, I never knew him by the name of Nugent only as going to Doctor's-commons; Gibbons said it was no harm to nobody going in the name of Nugent; he chose that name, he said it was a sure one. Monk and Knight said they knew he was dead. Knight said he had no relations at all; that he was to go as his brother.</p>
               <p>Court. When was this that you made the discovery first - A. I was taken up in the city. I made the discovery before the lord mayor; I was liberated to take Vaughan. I took Vaughan myself, he said I knew all about it; he made the discovery not to me, I was taken up after that to Bow street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you made the discovery to save yourself. - A. I was not guilty of any thing as I know.</p>

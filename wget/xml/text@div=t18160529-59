             is a German; I keep my clothes in my box in that room; my box was locked; I found it broke open on the 9th of April, at about half past three in the afternoon, and my clothes were gone. I had seen them at about half past ten that morning. They consisted of all the articles named in the indictment. I had not seen the prisoner that day, until we apprehended him. I saw him on Tuesday; he was on guard on Monday night, and we took him on Tuesday the 9th of April, at about half past four, about an hour after I missed the things; we took him into custody in Tothill-street, Westminster; he had my small clothes on under his overalls, and he had some more of the things tied up in the bundle in which they are now. The breeches were the only things be had wearing on his person. I asked him if he could tell me where the rest of the things were, and he said no, that he had sold them to people that he did not know.</p>

            , I assisted in taking the prisoner, about half past twelve I had observed him coming out of the house where they lodged, with a box on his shoulder. I stopped him, and put a question to him, where he was going with the box; he said, he had two boxes, and he was going to dispose of the one for which he had no use. I thought that a reasonable excuse. The house is in St. Martin's-court. I afterwards took the prisoner into custody. I found a turnscrew in his pocket, some marks of which were on the box. We asked him where the rest of the things were; and he said, we might have the money, provided the prosecution was stopped; he had twenty-six shillings, which he said, were the produce of the articles, all except six or seven shillings, which he had received as his pay.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, of 175, Great Dover-Street, Newington—on the evening of 2d January, I closed my shop about 9 o'clock, and at 11 o'clock I barred the doors and shutters, and went to bed—I was disturbed about a quarter to 4 o'clock by a policeman—my lodger went down first, and then I went down, and the policeman told me some<lb></lb>thing—I saw two shutters down, the window smashed, and a portion of my goods on the pavement—the shutter-bar was bent—I missed seven pieces of silk velvet, two pieces of ribbon, a feather, and 5 plaid scarves, which were safe when I went to bed—I saw one scarf and a piece of velvet at the station—the house is in the parish of St. Mary, Newington.</p>

About half-past 3 o'clock on the morning of 2d January, I was on duty in the Dover-road, and saw two men standing on the pavement near the shop which was broken into, and a man on the opposite side—the two went ever to the one, and they walked away</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186501300110"></xptr>
               <p>—I pursued them to the top of Brunswick-street, having heard a rap at the shutters, but did not overtake them—I did not know that they had done anything—I went back to the shop, and found that it had been broken into—a bonnet-shape was lying on the pavement—I called the prosecutor.</p>

About half-past 3 o'clock on 2d January, I was in Brunswick-street, and saw the two prisoners and another distinctly—I was within twenty yards of them, and knew them by sight, having seen them before—Mabley spoke to me after they had passed, and from what he said I followed them down Brunswick-street into St. George's-street, New Kent-road—I pursued them over a mile into Brent's-court, Borough—I was going down the court when Osborne bolted out of it, and a constable who was in front of me stopped him—I had not lost sight of them—I distinctly swear Osborne is one of the men—Lawson escaped over a wall at the other end of the court, and No. 360 sprung his rattle—I distinctly saw Lawson, and am sure he is the man.</p>

On 26th January, I was on duty near St. Saviour's church, and heard a rattle springing—I saw Lawson run<lb></lb>ning, pursued him, and got up within a yard of him—he undid the front of his trousers, took a piece of velvet out, and threw it at my feet—I imme<lb></lb>diately struck him, secured him, and found this scarf (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his pocket—he said, "The other man has got the <hi rend="italic">lob</hi>"—that means the bulk of it <hi rend="italic">Lawson's Defence.</hi> I met a fish-carrier, who I know; he had two parcels, and said, "I do not want to get these wet." He put one inside his trousers, and I put the other inside mine. There was a taller man with him, and when we got into the court he said, "You must throw that velvet away. To tell you the truth, I did not come by it right." I threw it away, but I did not throw the scarf away, as he made me a present of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Osborne's Defence.</hi> I had been to the Surrey theatre, and was stopped by a policeman. Nobody gave me in charge.

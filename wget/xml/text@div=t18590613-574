I am engaged with my father as accountant—on 27th May, about noon, I was passing the <hi rend="italic">Sunday Times</hi> office, and saw a list of races outside—there were a number of people there—I had a watch in my left pocket, and the chain was fastened to this button-hole—I stayed about two minutes—the prisoner stood on my right, and faced me sideways—I felt a jerk at my watch guard, and saw the chain come back from where the prisoner stood, and then saw his hand go down—I seized him by the left hand, and said, "You have stolen my watch"—he said, "It is not me, it is that man by the side of me"—I walked with him to the corner of Bride-lane—he then shook himself off—I, followed him to a public-house in Bride-lane, and gave him in custody—I have never seen my watch since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am articled clerk and manager to Mr. Dobbs, a solicitor—on 27th May, about 12 o'clock, I was passing the <hi rend="italic">Sunday Times</hi> office, and saw a crowd at the door—I saw the prosecutor and pri<lb></lb>soner close together—I was behind them—I saw the prisoner's right hand drawn sharply down among four or five men—it appeared to come from the prosecutor, who said, "You have stolen" or "You have taken my watch," and he seized the prisoner by the wrist—the prisoner said, "I have not," or "It is a lie"—the prosecutor laid hold of him by the upper part of his left sleeve, and walked with him to the corner of Bride-lane—he wrenched him<lb></lb>self away, and went through a crowd of men who are always standing there—the prosecutor and I followed him—the prosecutor got close to him—they walked down the lane together, and the prosecutor gave him in charge close to a public-house—I never lost sight of the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many persons were there at the <hi rend="italic">Sunday Times</hi> office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twenty or thirty—I was about two yards and a half from the prosecutor when I saw the hand drawn from him—there were four or five men on one side of the prosecutor, and seven or eight on the other, because he was at the back of the whole body of the people; but there was nobody so close to him as the prisoner, I swear that—they were so close that I could only just keep on the kerb without going into the road—the prisoner may have been a foot from the prosecutor; I do not think it was less.</p>

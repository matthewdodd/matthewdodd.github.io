I am head chambermaid at the Trafalgar Hotel, kept by Mr. Isaac Churchyard Dowsing—Ryan was the second laundry-maid there—I have all the linen under my charge—on 20th August I counted the calico sheets, and missed one—I spoke to Ryan about the loss—she did not make any answer then; she said it would be found—on 29th, I counted them again, and missed two calico sheets, two linen sheets, and one towel, marked "72"—I spoke to Ryan about it, and she said that she would try and find Maria Gratton, that she was gone to lodge with a friend of hers, Mrs. Honour, and they had removed their lodgings—I said if she went out, I should go too, to find the sheets, as I had to make them good if I lost them—I afterwards received a letter—I identify these portions of sheets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as the property of Mr. Dowsing.</p>

A. D., Trafalgar Hotel" on it—I saw it cut off the sheet—I said it was the Trafalgar Hotel's property, and Mrs. Honour took it from me, and put it behind the teaboard.</p>

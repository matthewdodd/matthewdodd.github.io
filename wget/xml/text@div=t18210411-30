I saw three horses coming up the road, two men were on two of them, the other was led horse, the prisoner was leading it, and riding another, galloping up the road. I saw him fifteen or twenty yards from the old gentleman - the other man passed him without hurting him; the prisoner came up, and the chest of the horse he was riding, ran against the man and knocked him down, that caused the horse and the prisoner to fall together.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body called to the old man - A. Several people called to him - so did the prisoner, and tried to stop his horse, but he could not - he sung out</p>
               <p>"Hoy," for the man to get out of the way - I do not think the old man heard him - he was about fifteen yards off when he called.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he try to pull up, when he was fifteen yards off - A. He tried but could not. I ran to the old gentleman and helped him on a shutter - he was very badly wounded on the temple - his head was fractured very much. We took him to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, I remained there half an hour - he never spoke, I saw his body the next night - he was then dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. How far were the horses from you when you first saw them - A. About twenty yards, the man had a cap on - I do not know whether it prevented his hearing, the prisoner did all he could to pull up, he was very much hurt himself, and it was ten to one he was not killed - he was leaning on his right hand, and had only the left to pull with.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The other man was galloping too - A. Yes, it is a populous neighbourhood.</p>

            . I saw the accident. Three horses were galloping on a-breast, and were about twenty yards from the deceased when I first saw them; the horse knocked him down - I picked him up - he was laying almost double, and bleeding at the nose very bad, his temple was fractured and his eye bruised. I carried him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110018"></xptr>to the hospital, he died in about three quarters of an hour - he never spoke after he was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear the passenger's call to him to stop - A. Yes, and I think one of the men on the horses called, he endeavoured to stop his horse just as he came abreast of Cromer-street, but could not; the prisoner was hurt very much, it is a wonder he was not killed himself - the old man fell, and then the horse and prisoner fell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Another man was riding with me, the horse the other man was riding slipped and ran away with him, then my led horse began galloping, which caused the other to start as well; I kept pulling them as hard as I could, but the more I pulled, the more they ran. I never saw the man till I got within three or four yards of him, as I was noticing the horses all the time; when I saw what danger I was in, I called out stop as well as I could.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Malcott, a stonemason, in Newgate-street. I was in Gray's Inn-lane, with my master's riding mare, on the off side of the road, the prisoner was on a horse leading another - we were walking very gently; my mare started opposite the dust-yard, which is about 200 yards from Cromer-street - she went right into a gallop; I heard the prisoner behind me, and supposed by my mare starting, it caused his to start too, he had no saddle - we were not racing.</p>

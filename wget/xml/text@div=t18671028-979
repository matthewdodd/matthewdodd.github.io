"—I said, "This order"—the constable then took him in custody—he brought him back shortly after, and said that the prisoner said that if I went to a public-house at the corner he would show me the party that gave him the order—I left him in charge of Mr. Davison, a carpenter, who was working at my master's shop, and went with the constable to the public-house, but could find no one there—when Oldacre first came in I believe he said he brought it from Mr. Scully, of Gee Street.</p>

In consequence of information I went to the Bunhill Row post-office at a quarter-past ten on the morning of the 2nd October—I stopped behind the counter near a side door till about eleven o'clock, when Oldacre came in with some papers in his hand—I heard him say, "It is an order, but you had not found the advice when a person called before; I brought it from 25 1/2, Gee Street, Brick Lane"—I let myself out of the side door and went into the shop—I said to King, "What is that? "—he said. "This order"—I asked the prisoner where he got it from—he said, "From a man he knew well; I don't know his name or where he lives"—I said, "You must consider yourself in custody, and go to Old Street Police-station with me"—I took him out<lb></lb>side about ten yards and said, "Which is the public-house the man was at?—he said, "The corner of Bath Street; take me there and I will point him out"—I said, "No, I can't do that"—I then took him back to the post-office and left him with a carpenter in a little room, and King and 1 went to the public-house and found no one there—I then took him to the station—on the way he took this letter from his pocket and said, "Here is tho letter belonging to the order "—I afterwards took Gillett—he said that the man he had it of was named "<hi rend="italic">Cris</hi>"—that was after the examination, when he was going to the cells.</p>

On the 15th of August, between nine and ten o'clock at night, the prisoner came and asked for a ready-made shirt, I shewed him two, he selected one which came to 9 s., he also bought a pair of stockings for 2 s., and gave me a 1 l. note. I asked his address - Norbury and another boy were in the shop with me. He gave his name</p>
               <p>"Reeves, No. 2, Lisson-green, Paddington" - I am certain of it; I asked him twice - Norbury wrote the address on the back of it. I had plenty of change, but suspecting the note, I sent Norbury out for change. The prisoner remained in the shop; and while the boy was gone my husband came in, and asked what the man was waiting for? I said he was waiting for change, and that I had sent the boy for it. Mr. Byers gave me 9 s. from his pocket, which I gave to the prisoner. I told Mr. Byers I thought the note was not good, but he said,</p>
               <p>"It is good; I have seen it." The prisoner was near enough to hear it; he then went away. The boy returned in a few minutes and said it was bad; my husband immediately sat off up the street, brought the prisoner back, and asked him where he got the note? he said he took it of a higgler for fowls, at the Red Lion, Paddington. He was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You took the note of the prisoner - A. Yes, and gave it to Norbury, who immediately wrote on it - it was not out of my sight till he wrote on it. I always ask strangers for their names. I am confident he gave the name of Reeves; he gave it twice to me and once to the boy.</p>

               <p>"Reeves, No. 2, Lisson-green," which I wrote on the note - (looks at one) - this is it; it has that on it in my hand-writing and my initials. I took it to Mr. Miller's, in Dorset-street, and enquired about it - it is the first turning from my master's house. I saw my master at the corner shop. I shewed the note to Mr. Miller, he returned me the same. I took it home, and told my master what he thought of it - Mr. Byers went out, and returned in a few minutes with the prisoner. The note was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you gone - A. About five minutes. I asked twice for his name to make sure of it, and wrote what he told me.</p>

On the night of the 15th of August I was at the corner of East-street, the boy came up and gave me the note, I examined it, and thought it good; I came home directly, and gave my wife 9 s., which she gave the prisoner, who was there - he went out directly. The boy returned immediately he left. In consequence of what the boy said I fetched the prisoner back - he had only got five doors off. I asked him where he got the note? he said he took it of a higgler at Paddington for some fowls. Wales came in and took him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 15th of August I apprehended the prisoner at Mr. Byers's shop, and found three duplicates on him, but no money. Seeing the name of Reeves on the note, I asked him if his name was not Lee? as I knew him before, he said it was. I asked him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180026"></xptr>if he lived at No. 2, Lisson-green? he said he did not, but he had lodged there the night before. I asked at what place, Lisson-green? he said by Lisson-green. I asked the name of the street? he said he did not know. I said there were several streets about Lisson-green, and asked if he was sure it was No. 2? he said it was No. 2, but he could not tell the name of the street. I asked who kept the house? he said Dunford. I took him in charge. On the following morning I went to Lisson-green, and enquired at the neighbouring houses for such a place as No. 2, Lisson-green, but could not find any such place. I found a woman named Dunford, at No. 14, Little James-street, Lisson-green, but could learn nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never asked him to shew you the house - A. No. I am well acquainted with Lisson-green. I do not know Lisson-green-street, grove, terrace, or court. I have lived half a mile from Lisson-green for nine or ten years. All the streets about there are called such a street, Lisson-green.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner an impediment in his speech - A. He has not.</p>

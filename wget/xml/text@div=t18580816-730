                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 496). On Sunday, 11th July, a little after 2 in the afternoon, I was on duty in Queenhithe, and saw the prisoner coming from one of Mr. Drew's warehouses on the wharf; he was in the act of closing the door—I knew he was the Sunday watchman there. I saw him stoop as though he was placing something on the ground; I could not see what he was doing—I was about twelve or fourteen yards from him—there was a van in front of the door at the same time. I saw a female standing in Queenhithe, about twelve yards from the warehouse door—it was the prisoner's daughter—I afterwards took her into custody about 200 yards off, and found about 6lbs. of flour in her possession, tied up in a bag, and an old handkerchief or duster—the prisoner remained on the wharf.</p>

I cannot tell how many warehouses there are on the wharf—I was sent on duty there by my Inspector. I swear I saw the prisoner come out of the warehouse; it is a tin and copper warehouse, but there were some bags of flour there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 486). I was with Putney. I saw the prisoner come out of the warehouse, turn round, and close the door after him—I walked away with Putney, and he took the daughter into custody. I afterwards went back and took the prisoner into custody—I told him he must go to the station with me, and asked where he got the</p>

I asked what he was doing in the warehouse—he said he was not in the warehouse. I asked where he bought the flour—he said he bought it of a man, but he could not tell me who he was; he said he should not know him if he saw him again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Augustus Drew Harding, of Bell Wharf, Wharfinger. The prisoner was employed as a watchman on the Sunday—he had no right whatever to be in the warehouse—the keys are kept hanging up in the counting-house—the prisoner could get access to them by opening the window, and getting in—there was flour stored in this particular warehouse—I have examined the flour produced; I believe it formed a portion of the flour in our stock, by the appearance of it—I could not swear to it. I have examined and weighed some of the sacks in the warehouse, and found 3 sacks out of 10 in one consignment deficient to the extent of 9lbs., 7lbs., and 61bs. I saw that the warehouse was locked on the Saturday night, and the keys hung on the usual nail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long was the prisoner in the service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has been there, on and off, ever since I have, which is a year and nine months—he was employed as a labourer during the week, and on Sundays as a watchman—the flour came from Snake, in Suffolk. 2 sacks in another consignment were alao short—sacks never come to us short—I never knew it</p>

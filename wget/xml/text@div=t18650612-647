I am a widow, and live at 10, Salamanca-court—I knew the deceased by sight, but never spoke to her—she lived at 1, Salamanca-street—on Wednesday, between 10 and 11 o'clock, I saw the deceased and the prisoner close against the side gate of the mother's house quarrelling—the deceased went up to the prisoner and put her fist in his face, but whether she hit him or not I cannot say—he then hit her with his fist in front of her forehead—she staggered and fell on her back on the ground—I picked her up, took her down the gate-way, and supported her back against the wall—she was sensible—I gave her a little water, but she would not drink—I saw no more of her till the evening, when I was fetched into her room, and found her dying—the prisoner walked away after striking her—he saw that she fell—when she put her fist in his face, she said, "You vagabond, how dare you call me such a name"—they both lived in the same street.</p>

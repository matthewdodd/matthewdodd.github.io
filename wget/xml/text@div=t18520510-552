Q.</hi> What time did your father leave this house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On 21st July; Mrs. Burridge was in the house with me then—she remained till the distress was put in—the house was closed by Mr. Chase, the broker—I remained in the house till 19th Dec.—I remained there till Feb.; I was not turned out—I happened to be out on a little business—I was going into the house, and I was told by Hardy that Mr. Lane had been there and taken possession—I have not been near the house since then—I saw my father in the house a fortnight or three weeks before 19th Dec.—he came there very seldom—there was no furniture there after 21st Nov.—the fixtures were all in the house up to 8th Dec.—the furniture was sold on 21st Nov.—I do not know what the things sold for; I was in the house, but not at the sale—I had no bed there, nor chairs, nor tables—I remained there from 8th Dec. till Feb.—I remained in the empty house without doors and windows—Terry came first on 8th Dec.—there was whitewashing going on, as they called it, but it was water washing—they first whitewashed, and then sent men to wash it off again—there were no repairs going on at all—the sashes were taken out—the same sashes were replaced after I left in Feb.—I did not go into the house, but I looked outside and saw they were the same sashes—Hardy was there on 8th, 12th, and 19th Dec; he was there to pro<lb></lb>tect me—Hardy was tried at the Middlesex Sessions for an assault on one of these men—I was examined on that trial—Terry was examined on that trial—I do not know that I was in Court at the time—a young man, named Gilson, was with me there, and my sister—Terry was one of the men who took me up and placed me on the window sill, and a man whom I saw in the Court this morning, a painter, I do not know his name, and some one else—the sashes of the window were away; the shutters were there—I was sitting on the window sill, and they nailed a door against me—when I got out I got in again at a window—the window was four or five or six feet high</p>

               <p>—the persons outside helped me in; I was lifted up—Hardy, Gilson, and Worms were there on the night of the 18th—I and my sister were there, but we did not remain all night—Gilson and Hardy and Worms remained—Worms was the man in possession—I and my sister and Mrs. Hardy left—no, I was there all night on the 18th—if my sister did not remain all night she was at Mrs. Hardy's—Mrs. Hardy remained all night, and Hardy and Gilson and Worms, the man in possession on the part of of Mr. Lane—Worms was there the whole time, I think he left about the 3rd Jan.—Hardy was up every night—I was up the best part of the time—we had two or three small barrels that we sat on, there was nothing else in the house to sit on—there were carpeted seats fixed round the parlours, which Terry took precious good care to wet that no one should sit down—Terry was there every day, and he has been there till as late as 1 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, to see that I had no fires, and to put them out—he used to come at all times—some of them went away at 4 or 5, some of them were left to throw water on the ceilings wherever I went—Woodward has remained there all night, and George Anstey, and George Bull, who used to be left on Sunday—the 12th Dec. was the first time any one remained all night—when one left at 6 o'clock in the morning, another came and stopped till 12—Terry was there every day—there were no repairs done in the public house—I believe he undermined one house and let it fall—there were no repairs done on the pre<lb></lb>mises, unless you call that repairs, that they whitewashed the ceiling and had it all washed off again—there was nothing done to repair the top that I am aware of—he used to go to the upper part of the house to pour water down the chimney, and throw bricks—I gave Terry in charge on the 8th to the police<lb></lb>man; I do not know his name—I attended before the Magistrate on that charge—I charged him with stealing the window sashes, my father's property—when Terry came on the 8th, he told me I had better go out, for he meant to take every door off, and every window out, and the stoves, and then to take the floors up wherever I went—Gilson is a young man living in Essex, he came up on the 18th on business—I have seen Dixon, he is a master sweep—I believe he was in the house on the 19th—I do not know who let him in—when Terry came on the 19th, I was in the bar parlour—Hardy and Gil<lb></lb>son were there—they were lying on a shutter across two little casks—I do not know that they were asleep—they had a blanket over them, and they had a pillow—it was between 2 and 3—I dare say they might have been there an hour—they were both up the night before with me—my sister was with me—she came on the 18th, the day before—the blanket and pillow were lent me by a friend—I almost forget whom—I did not go for them, they were brought by the daughter of the person who lent them—I had not been at all lying down that day, nor had my sister; she came the day before—I cannot say whether we remained all night, we used to go over to Mrs. Hardy's—while I was in the room, I was reading, and my sister was reading—I used to pass the time by reading—Worms was in the tap room, which is some little dis<lb></lb>tance from the bar parlour—I could not get along; the flooring was all up.</p>

               <p>house—Tudgey was there on the 19th, to the best of my recollection, but there were so many I cannot tell who was there—he was there on the 12th—he was the man that knocked me down in the room—Mr. Bryan, a surveyor, saw these premises immediately before Terry came, and immediately, after—some man used to stay all night—they were not repairing—they staid to put my fire out—Bull was left on the premises on a Sunday—I said I should light a fire, and he said, "If you light a fire I shall put it out; it is Mr. Terry's orders."</p>

                  </hi>. I am an architect and surveyor. I examined the pre<lb></lb>mises of the Horseshoe and Magpie, by Mr. Coffield's request, about the 14th of Dec.—the windows were all out when I went there, and every door off—I should say there was no reason why those windows should be taken out, and the doors off, by way of repairs—as far as I could judge there was no cause why the floor should be taken up, and the stairs cut down—they were good timbers cut through—I should say that before all those outrages were com<lb></lb>mitted the premises were in tenantable repair—the place was in a filthy dirty state, but it did not require the floor taken up—the drains were taken up, and allowed to run down into the basin—it smelt so bad I could hardly stay there—there was no necessity for doing that, decidedly not.</p>

I remember the 19th Dec., when there was this disturbance at the Horseshoe and Magpie—I had frequently seen Terry previously to that—there had been a meeting at my house—I know one man who was there, a painter named Rogers—I know him by his getting his name on my slate, and there it has been ever since—Terry was not there—the others have frequently been in and out—on the 19th I heard a great disturbance, and hallooing "Murder"—that was about 3 o'clock—I went out and saw Miss Coffield hanging from the window—Terry and several men were in the house trying to put her out—a portion of her was hanging inside, and Terry said, "Up with the shutter"—I said, "Shove the shutter away"—I put my hand against it, and several other men put their hands to it and shoved it away, and Miss Coffield was drawn outside—I had called the attention of the police<lb></lb>man to it—I said, "You are seeing a woman murdered"—he said, "We have nothing to do with what is done inside"—Cooper was there, I would not swear that Tudgey was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman carpenter, and live in Thornhill-street, Caledonian-road. On 19th Dec. I was employed for Mr. Terry—I was working at the private house, but I was called into the Horseshoe and Magpie, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I was in the yard at work, and Mr. Terry called us over the wall to assist him, as these persons were acting very wrong to him—I do not know how Mr. Terry got into the public house, but we got over the wall, and went in the back way—when we got in the back parlour I saw two men laying hold of Mr. Terry violently, and one of them had a chopper in his hand—I took it from him—as well as I could understand, one of them was Hardy—we assisted in putting them out—Miss Coffield was present—the man who had the chopper said if any one touched it he would cut our b—brains out—I said, "Well, I shall take this from you first"—I assisted afterwards in blockading the place up—after these persons were put out we blocked up the parlour window, and they got in at the back, in at the tap room; but we had several rounds violently to get them out—the blood flowed violently; there was fighting with sticks and brickbats—I would not go through it again for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my mate can prove it, he was cut violently—he is not here—when the persons were put out of the window we barricaded the door; and as fast as we put them up they cut them down; and then we thought it was time to leave—Hardy came back, as well as I could understand, through the doorway, and then I left—I saw him cutting the barricading down, as fast as we put it up—we first barricaded the parlour window, and after they broke that down, they swore that they would cut our b—heads open—we were obliged to leave.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How long have you collected bones and iron? A. These fourteen years; there were ten or twelve persons in the house - the donkey I then had was my uncle's; I was tried at Reading once about a donkey, and was twelve months in gaol, but I was innocent.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PEASGOOD (Police-constable T 28). On the 16th of April I was on duty - the prosecutor said he had been robbed; I took Larkin against the distiller's, and he said, "This fellow (the prosecutor) has robbed me of a sovereign;" I said, "Come to the station, and I will search him;" he said, "Search him under the lamp;" I said No, and took him to the station - Larkin then said he had been with Cobby - I said I knew him - I went and found Treadaway at a public-house, the Running Horse, with two girls; he said, "What do you want?" I said,"Come out, and I will tell you;" he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out something, and was putting it down; I said, "That won't do for me;" I caught his hand, and found three shillings in it.</p>
               <p>Larkin's Defence. I accused the prosecutor of robbing me of a sovereign; Treadaway said, "It is in his cart" - he was going to get into his cart and Treadaway struck him - I had two sovereigns and two or three shillings in my pocket, and one sovereign was there when I was taken; the prosecutor was intoxicated.</p>

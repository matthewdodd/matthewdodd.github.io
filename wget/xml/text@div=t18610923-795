                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Harrison, pawnbroker! in Wardour-street—on 28th August a shawl was pledged there, I cannot say by whom—I have no belief as to whether the prisoner was the person or not—I said before the Magistrate that I could not say for certain—this is the shawl (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on 4th September, a person called with the ticket—I have it here—I refused to give the shawl up then—a few hours before the person came with that ticket the prisoner came with a declaration, and I delivered up the shawl to her with the declaration—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Sometime previous to the declaration being brought, I believe the shawl was stopped, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I believe your husband stopped it.</p>

               <p>the date—she wished to sell two tickets, one of a shawl, which had been twelve months in pawn—I purchased the ticket of the shawl for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had it six weeks in my possession—she said she was afraid I should lose my shawl, and I went to Mr. Harrison's to get it, and found there was a declaration on it—they advised me to go to the Magistrate—I went to the prisoner and said, "You bare taken a false declaration upon that shawl"—she said, "Yes, and you may go and do your worst"—she was detained as she came out and locked up in the station, where she had been the night before—I am sure that was before 3rd September—I had the ticket six weeks in my possession, and she came three days before that and asked me if I had taken it out of Mr. Harrison's shop—and I said, "No, I had not the money to take it out."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> She said she would go with me to get a declaration on the shawl; if they had asked me whether I had lost the ticket, I should have said "No." I was to give her 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the shilling after the month; I got the shawl out and took it to her with tie money; she knocked the money out of my hand, and kicked me till I was black and blue. I had not the slightest idea that I had told a falsehood; I should not have done it if I had. She told me she had lost the ticket, and I was willing to pay her the money for it.</p>

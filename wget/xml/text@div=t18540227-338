                  </hi>. I live at No. 17, Glasshouse-street, Whitechapel. I know the prisoner—he came to lodge in our house for three or four days—he slept in the same room with me, in the next bed to me—it is a lodging house—he got up before me in the morning—I missed my shoes the moment I got up—I saw him looking under my bed, but I had no idea he would have taken my shoes, for he was pitying me the day before, being an old man—he went down stairs, and went out at the back door—I never saw any more of him for five days afterwards, till he was taken up on another charge—he never came nigh our house after that—I afterwards saw my shoes at Arbour-square police-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What mark have you got on the shoes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never put any mark on them, further than from their being the shape of my feet, and from the holes that the maker bored in each of them—I have had them three months—there are iron tips on the heels, and nails in the soles—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—they were made by a man of the name of John Miller, of No. 26, Rosemary-lane, or Chapel-street—he keeps a large shop—I have worn them about three months, not every day, and I am sure they are mine—I bought them as rights and lefts—I never said my shoes were straights.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). I took the prisoner into custody on Sun<lb></lb>day morning, 29th Jan., on another charge—the prosecutor, hearing that he was in custody, came to the station, and saw the prisoner there, with these shoes on—he claimed them directly he saw them—I said to the prisoner, "You hear what he says; let me have those boots off"—he took them off instantly, and gave them to me—I showed them to the prosecutor, and he claimed them directly—he said, "Let me look at the bottom of them"—I</p>

               <p>did so, and he said, "I know they are mine by these big nails that are here"—the prisoner said not a word—he said nothing at that time—just after going before the Magistrate, the prosecutor was calling him a rogue; and he said, "Well, stop it; I did take them"—I do not think that he at any time said he did not take them—I can read.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You told me just now that when he was going in before the Magi<lb></lb>strate he said that he did take them; is that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as I recollect, it is; I think he said that; but it is a month ago, and I may have forgotten myself—I am quite certain he said he did not take them; but as to his saying he did take them, at this moment I cannot be quite positive—I knew there was something took place, but at the moment I could not recollect what it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at the George the Fourth public-house, East India-road—I carry on the business for Mr. James Grundy. On the 30th of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the bar and asked for change for a sovereign—I said, I would see—he said unless I could give it, he could not have a pint of beer—I sent the change by my niece, and he sent a supposed sovereign—he was in the tap-room, and I was in the bar—she laid it on the table—it turned out to be a medal—I went and found the prisoner in the Grave Maurice, Bromley—I asked him if he had been to the George the Fourth, and changed a sovereign—he said, "I have not been out of this house"—I said, "I am certain you are the man, who had change and gave me a bad sovereign"—he said he could give the change back again, and make it all right, but the policeman would not allow it.</p>

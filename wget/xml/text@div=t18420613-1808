The prisoner was my cutter and foreman for about nine months—on the 19th of May I received information from his wife by a letter—I called the prisoner into a private room, and said," Clancey, I understand you have been robbing me"—he said he expected something of that kind would come from me, or words to that effect—I showed him this piece of Persian silk—I said, "Clancy, what do you say to this?"—he said he expected that would be brought forwards against him, that his wife had bought it for a bonnet—I said be must be convinced in his own mind, that I must be aware that this was my pro<lb></lb>perty, he might as well tell the truth, as I knew, perhaps, more than he was aware of—he then made a statement, in consequence of which I went to hit father's house, and there saw a little boy—I noticed he had a jacket on—I believe, from the appearance of it, it was part of my property—I took it back, and showed it to the prisoner, and said, "Clancey, what do you say to this?"—he said he took the doth and had it made up for nothing—a man who was at work for the establishment made it up for him—I believe the silk and cloth to be mine.'</p>

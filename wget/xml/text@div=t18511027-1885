                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner six or seven years. On 28th Sept., I was drinking with him at the Bell, beer-shop, Fryern Barnet; we went there between 12 and 1 o'clock—I paid for some beer we had, and the prisoner saw me put my money, two half-crowns, two shillings, a sixpence, and twopence, in a pocket inside my jacket—I buttoned my jacket up again, and went to sleep—we were sitting on a settle, alongside each other, in a little back-yard—there was no one else there—when I woke up, the prisoner was standing before me, with his hand in my pocket, and my jacket was unbut<lb></lb>toned—I asked him what he was doing with his hand in my pocket, and he said he was looking for a pawn-ticket, which he was afraid I had lost—there was a knife, comb, and some tickets on the seat by my side, which had come from my pocket—there was no one else there—I had a pawn ticket in my pocket, but it did not belong to him—he went away directly after that, and about twenty minutes after that I went home—when I had been at home a little while I missed all my money—I had not been anywhere in the meantime, or been asleep again—I then went in search of the prisoner, and found him in bed—it was a long time before he would come down to me; when he did, I asked him if he had got my money—he said no, he had nothing of mine; and be only had a shilling the first thing in the morning—he had paid for a pint or two of beer, and I had lent him sixpence, as he said he had no money—I was quite sober, and the prisoner also.</p>

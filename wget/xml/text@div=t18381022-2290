                  </hi>. I live in Rochester-row, North. On Monday, the 1st of October, at seven o'clock in the evening, Field came to my father's house alone with four collars, and asked me to buy them—I said my father was not at home, he must call again—at eight o'clock the same evening Hayes came, and said he had come for the money for the collars—I said my father was not at home, he must come in the morning—I told the po<lb></lb>liceman of it, and in the morning when Hayes came for the money, the policeman took him—I went to Mr. Dalton's to point out Field—Hayes did not say he worked for him—I believe he told the policeman so, but not in my presence—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—this is my writing—it was read over to me before I signed it—Hayes did not tell me he worked for Mr. Dalton.</p>

                  </hi>. Four collars were left at my premises on Monday, the 1st of October—I saw Hayes the next morning—he said he came respecting the price of the collars—I told him I understood he was to bring a back band, a chain, and a cart saddle—he wanted 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him to send the right man who brought them—he said it did not make any difference, whether I paid him or the other—he then went away—the po<lb></lb>liceman followed and took him—the policeman fetched my son to Dalton's wharf to identify Field.</p>

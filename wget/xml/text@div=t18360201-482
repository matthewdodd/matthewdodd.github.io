                  </hi>. I am a butcher. I have an unfurnished house in Mile-End Old Town—the gutter was safe on the morning of the 20th, and next morning I saw it had been stripped of the lead—I know nothing of the prisoner—this is the lead that was left in the gutter, and the other, that was at the station-house, corresponds with it—about one hundred weight was taken.</p>

I locked the door at four o'clock on the 20th—the next morning I came at eight o'clock, and found the roof was stripped—I went to the station-house, and gave information—the door was not broken open—there was a back fence, which they got over, and in at the back window.</p>

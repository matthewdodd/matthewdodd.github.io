               <p>Q. Did the situation, in which he was, command a view of the shop? - A. Yes; I delivered the sixpence into the hands of Jones in the shop; he remained in the shop while I fetched it; I did not see Powell at that time; then he went out, and in two or three minutes both of them returned; there was then nobody in the shop but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they able, from the outside, to observe whether there were more persons in the shop than one? - A. I do not think they could; Jones asked to look at some gold rings, the smallest we had; then I pulled out the fancy-ring drawer; they said, they were not the kind they wanted; then I put in the drawer immediately, and shewed them the other plain gold wedding-rings, which I shewed them on the block; then Jones bought one of them for 4s. and paid for it; he then asked to look at some gold seals, which we kept in a drawer; I shewed them some gold seals; they did not like them; and then they enquired after silver seals, and we had not any; then they went out.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you were serving these people, was there any other person in the shop but yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you served any body before with rings? - A. No, never with these kind of rings; my bro<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110068"></xptr>ther John came down in about two or three minutes, and missed the rings.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not accustomed to serve in the shop? - A. No. On Saturday, the 13th, they came again; Jones came in about half past seven in the morning, and asked me if I would take some halfpence for silver; he then stepped to the door, and called Powell in; there was nobody in the shop but me; he asked for gold seals.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did you take any halfpence? - A. No; Powell was looking at some gold seals, and Jones was counting out the halfpence; afterwards Powell went all round the shop, and looked towards the parlour, as if he wanted to see if there was any body there; then presently my brother came out, and shut the street-door, so that they could not get away, and they were taken; we never found the rings or seals again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. (Counsel for Powell.) Q.Jones came on one of the days, the 10th, by himself? - A. He came in first, and called Powell in; he was in the shop about two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Webb? - A. At the bottom of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been present either when you or your brother, or any body else, had taken an account of the goods in the shop? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know how many rings there were in the shew-glass? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who served in the shop the whole of the 9th of July? - A. I served nobody but them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many customers came in that day? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not shew any body else any rings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who served in the shop besides yourself that day? - A. Mr. Essex; my brother was very ill in bed that day; Mr. Essex served in the shop on the 10th.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knowlys. On the 10th of July, about a quarter before eight, or thereabout, I came into the shop, and saw some money lie upon the back counter, it was 4s.; he told me what had passed, and I immediately looked at the block of gold rings; I had not seen it for two or three days, for I had been confined to my bed; I compared the rings with the entry-book, which is here; we enter them in the book, and tick them off when they are sold; I missed eight rings, one sold, and seven that were stolen; and then looked at the seal drawer, and I examined the entry-book, and compared them, and found two missing; I had not taken any particular notice of the seal drawer before; the block of rings was full two or three days before, excepting four; it holds forty-eight; I communicated this to Mr. Essex, and, in consequence of his directions, I watched for these people again three mornings successively. On Saturday, the 13th, they did return again between seven and eight in the morning; my brother was in the shop; I was in the parlour; I rung the bell for Mr. Webb to come down and assist me; I saw Powell come round and look into the parlour; he looked over the curtain at the parlour window; I did not think he saw me, but he appeared very uneasy; then I went out to the passage door, and went round and shut the street door, and secured them within; I locked the street door, and I had provided myself with a pistol in case of resistance; I came up immediately, and laid hold of Jones, with a pistol in my hand; he wanted to know what I was about; I told him I knew perfectly well what I was about, and he knew perfectly well too; Jones made no resistance at all; he did not attempt to go away; Powell did resist; Mr. Webb was with me, and had a pistol also, and I told him, if he made any further resistance, I should certainly be under the necessity of discharging my pistol; he had endeavoured to wrench the pistol out of Mr. Webb's hand; I threatened him, and then he submitted.</p>

               <p>Q. You never found the seals nor the rings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Is your's a shop of considerable business? - A. Pretty well.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been ill at this time? - A. Yes; I believe I was three days that I had not been in the shop; I had been in the parlour by the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the custody of the things in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you were ill, were you present when an account was taken of the things in the shop? - A.Within a month before I had made an inventory of all the articles in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a time when the town is pretty full? - A. No; it is a time when the town is pretty thin.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it, in the course of that month, a great number of customers must have been in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose half a dozen, upon the average, per day? - A. Yes; I dare say there were that.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you satisfy the Jury, whether the articles might not have be sold or lost from your shop in the course of that month? - A. The rings were there three days prior; the seals I am not so positive of.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you speak of the number of rings that were on the block three days before from recollection of the number, or do you compare them with any entry? - A. From recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you number the vacancies upon the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110069"></xptr>block, occasioned by so many being off the block? - A. The vacancies are always left at one corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that that is the practice of every body else? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This shop, in Bridges-street, is your's? - A. Yes: On the 10th of July I was made acquainted with this loss, but I cannot exactly say what part of the day.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you recollect whether you were in the shop on the 9th? - A. Yes, I might, just to see that things were right; I examined, and found deficient eight rings and two seals; one of the rings was accounted for as being sold.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that one accounted for in the book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the practice of your shop to enter these articles as they are sold? - A. Yes, in the entrybook, when they are sold; and in the course of time, when we can get an opportunity, we tick them off in the stock-book; I directed that these people should he watched, and I actually watched myself two mornings; I went up every day as much as I could, while

               <p>Court. Q. But you had your eye upon the shop? A. Yes, I could see every transaction that was done perfectly.</p>

               <p>Powell's defence. When the gentleman put the pistol to my breast, I said, what have you got doing; upon which Mr. Edmund's said, you villains, we have got you; the man's hand that held the pistol to my head trembled so, that I desired him to hold it a little lower, for I was not going to make any resistance; I came from Birmingham, and was only in town three weeks.</p>

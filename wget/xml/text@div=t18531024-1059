                  </hi>. I am clerk to Richard Hicks and Son, of Newgate market; they are salesmen. I received three legs of mutton and one leg of pork from the last witness for sale—I sold them, the prisoner came after<lb></lb>wards and asked for the bill and money for Mr. Archer—he said for three legs of mutton, and one of veal for Mr. Archer; I said he was not correct, he had better go and get the correct account—he went away and came back afterwards, and said three legs of mutton and one of pork were brought—that was right and I paid him 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., knowing him to have been previously in Mr. Archer's employ—on the next day Mr. Archer came, and asked for his money—I told him I had paid his man, and gave him a copy of the bill I had given to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>.

I am licensed hawker, and live in Kent—I was at last Croydon fair on the 2d October—I saw the prisoner there on the 4th, the third day of the fair, with a grey gelding—ho was offering to sell it to some persons there—he asked 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and came down to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I called him on one side and said, "What are you going to take for that horse?"—he said, "I have 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take home to Mr. Barlow, and except I get something for myself I shall not sell the horse; I shall ride it back to Mr. Barlow"—I then said, "I will give you 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, that will be 10A for yourself, but I should like to go before some witness to pay my money"—he said ho did not mind about that, and we went down the street to the police-station—a policeman asked me what was the matter—I told him I had bought a horse for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and I wanted to pay the money before some witness—the officer said he would send some one to Mr. Barlow's, and we all went to Mr. Barlow's house—the next day Mr. Barlow came to Croydon and saw the gelding.</p>

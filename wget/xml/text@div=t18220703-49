            . On the 26th of May, about nine o'clock in the morning, I was at the <placeName id="t18220703-49-crimeloc260">King's Head, public-house, Orchard-street, Westminster</placeName>

He called for a pint of beer, and drank to the prisoner, and asked him to lend him a shilling, saying that he had no money; he lent him one. Then the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Let us have six-penny worth of rum and water." Lowick was going to sleep - the prisoner held the rum and water to his mouth, and put some into his mouth, and the rest ran down his bosom, but he fell asleep directly. I then saw the prisoner put his right hand into Lowick's right-hand pocket, and turn all his money out, and put it on the table; he was going to count it, but seeing me look at him, he put it all into his own right-hand pocket, and kept asking Lowick to drink more; but he was so stupified, he could not answer him. I then saw him take his watch; he was going to put it in his own pocket, but I said,</p>
               <p>"Stop, that is not yours - you have robbed the man of his money before." I called the landlord, and wanted him to give the landlord the money and watch to keep for the prosecutor; he said I was a liar, and struck at me two or three times; he gave the watch to the landlord, but denied having the money. I sent for an officer. Betts came, and asked him what money he had in his pocket when he came from home; he said 7 s. or 7 s. 6 d., not more; and if he had more, it was not his. Betts found in his right-hand breeches pocket 14 s., four sixpences, and one penny. He said nothing; he was rather tipsy, but knew what he was about.</p>

               <p>"Old gentleman, will you take a draught of porter." I was drunk, and did not know what happened; I had been in liquor the night before - I believe I was more drowsy for want of sleep than drunk - I knew nothing about what happened to me.

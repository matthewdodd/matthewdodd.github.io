                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Shoemaker-row, Blackfriars. On the 7th of January, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my shop for a penny saveloy—he put| down a shilling—I gave him change, and he went out—I put the shilling into the till, where I had no other shilling I am certain—I looked at it against in less than three minutes, and saw it was bad—I took it and went down two or three courts, but I could not see him—I brought back the shilling, and put it on a shelf behind the counter by itself—on Saturday evening, the 12th of January, just before nine o'clock in the evening, he came again, and asked for half a quartern of cheese, which I refused to cut—he then asked for a quartern—I served him—he put down a shilling—I saw it was bad—my wife was on the other side of the shop—I asked her if she had got a sixpence in the till—I then went round and charged him. with being the man who brought the other shilling—he said he did not, and asked me to give him the shilling he had brought then, which I would not—I sent for the officer and gave him in charge—I recognized him the moment he came into the shop—I marked the shillings and gave them to the officer.</p>

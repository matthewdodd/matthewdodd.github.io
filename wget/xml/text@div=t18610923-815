I live in John-street, Woolwich—on Friday night, about 17th August, I went to the Woolwich Theatre—I had a silver watch in my pocket—I witnessed the performance—Surrey sat next to me—I fell asleep during the performance, and when I woke up, I found my watch was gone—I do not know of my own knowledge who took it—I did not give anybody permission to take it—I did not see Surrey leave—he was gone when I woke—I have not seen my watch since—it was worth six guineas.</p>

I live at Crescent-road, Plumstead—I was at the Woolwich Theatre on the night of Friday, the 17th—I saw King there, and Surrey, whom I had known before—I went down between one of the acts, and when I was in the street, Surrey came up and told me that he knew where there was a watch to be taken—he said that he had taken it out of King's pocket and looked at it—Lee and two others were with him them—we all went up again together and sat down, and I saw Surrey put his hand into King's pocket, and then take it out again—I could not say that he had a watch in his hand when he took it away—when I saw that, I paid another penny and went down into the pit, intending to tell a policeman when I got down there, but no policeman was there—Lee was sitting the fifth from Surrey—I did not hear Lee ask to borrow a penny—I did not see the watch at all.</p>

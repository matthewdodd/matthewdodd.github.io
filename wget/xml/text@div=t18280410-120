            . I am servant at the King's Head. I remember the prosecutor and the prisoner being there, drinking together - the prosecutor was drunk; the prisoner sat alongside of him; I brought in what was ordered, and took the money - the prosecutor paid first; I thought they were friends - they drank together for two or three hours: the prosecutor had some seals hanging out of his fob when he came in; but I did not take notice whether he had them when he went out; I thought he had not: the prisoner went out about a quarter of an hour before him - I do not know whether the prisoner was sober.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Shoreditch. On the 20th of March I heard of this robbery, and the next morning I took the prisoner out of a stable; I said, "Young man, I want you;" he said, "Want me - what for?" I said, "Come along with me;" he took his coat from behind the door, and took it on his arm, and when he got twenty or thirty yards from the stable he said, "I know what you want me for - we were only having a bit of a lark last night; the man had a little drink - I took his watch from him, and have it here;" he gave me this watch from the coat.</p>

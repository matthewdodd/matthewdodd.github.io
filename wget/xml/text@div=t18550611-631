                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I live at Albert-place, Turnham-green, and am a tailor. On Wednesday morning, 25th April, I came up to town on business, with a horse and chaise; I was very short of money, and thought if I could sell it I would—"For sale" was written with chalk on the chaise—when I came to St. Martin's-lane, a policeman told me I was not allowed to stand there with it, so I went off—I was looking to see a man named Turner, who was at Aldridge's—in about ten minutes two parties came and asked me if I would sell the pony and chaise—I said, "Yes"—one of them looked at the pony to see if he was sound, and tried him to see if he was young or did—the short man then said that be should like to see the pony going, and got into the chaise and asked me to drive him; I drove them to West-street, to the Marquis of Granby—he asked me to come in and he would make the bargain—one man came into the house, while the other minded the pony—the man who came in offered me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the pony and chaise, and made a bargain for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we remained there about twenty minutes—we then left, and the pony and chaise remained outside the Marquis of Granby, while I went to another public house with the man who was to buy it; his name was Ringwood; there was a man to mind it—we made a bargain at the other public house—there were two men there—I asked the landlord to write a receipt, and after it was written I saw the prisoner coming towards me with a horse—one of them, Brydges, said that the horse belonged to them, that he was</p>

               <p>steward in ft Quaker family, and the prisoner was the coachman, and in order that the prisoner should not know how much Ringwood paid for the pony and chaise he sent him away with Brydges—Ringwood had the money in his hand to pay me, and I saw the prisoner walk very quickly towards my chaise—I called to him to leave the chaise alone, and Ringwood ran away towards the other corner—the prisoner jumped into the chaise, and drove away as rapidly as possible, while I held the horse that the prisoner had been holding; Ringwood had begged me to do so—I never saw my pony or chaise again—Ringwood never came back to pay me the money—1 ran after him, and called to him to stop—I next saw the prisoner on 27th April, near the City-road, and gave him into custody—the horse I was left to hold was a black one, worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have no doubt whatever that the prisoner is the man who ran away with my chaise—I am a cripple, and cannot run.</p>

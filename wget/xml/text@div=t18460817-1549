                  </hi>. I live at Star-lane, Fulham, and am a rag-sorter. I was in the tap-room of the Crown public-house, with James Bennett, one Tuesday night—a little after eleven o'clock the landlord shut the house up, and Bennett came out with me—he was very much intoxicated—directly we came out, the prisoner and another man came up—the prisoner asked for a drink from a pot of beer a which I had brought out in my hand—I let him drink, and then went inside to light my pipe—when I came out again, Bennett was standing in a fighting posi<lb></lb>tion,</p>

               <p>challenging the prisoner, who was holding his hand to his mouth as if he had been struck—he said to me, "Did you not ask me to drink out of that pot of beer?"—I said, "Yes"—he said Bennett had struck him in the mouth because he had drank out of the pot—Bennett said something about striking him again if he offered to touch the beer—I said nothing then—they began quarrelling, and the prisoner struck Bennett with his fist—I think it was on the side of the head—before that Bennett had threatened to strike him several times, and swore at him, but did not square at him—after the prisoner struck him they both stood up in a fighting position—Bennett aimed a blow at the prisoner, and fell, either at the first or second round—I was quite sober—the prisoner did not strike Bennett at that round, to my recollection—Ben<lb></lb>nett stood up in a fighting position again, and the prisoner butted him with his head in the lower part of his stomach, and at the same time caught hold of his legs and threw him down—the prisoner fell upon him—Bennett got up again, and they stood in a fighting position and fought eight or nine rounds—the prisoner was the most sober of the two—neither of the rounds lasted long—Gibbs knocked Bennett down half a dozen times through butting him with the head, not every round—Bennett fell on him once or twice—the last time Bennett was knocked down he was on his hands and knees—Gibbs asked him if he was going to fight longer—Bennett said he was too drunk to fight—Gibbs then asked him to shake hands—Bennett refused—a man came up and asked Gibbs to go away with him, which he did—somebody assisted me to lift Bennett up, and I took him towards his home—he said he was tired, and asked me to let him sit down—he only sat down once to my recollection—he wanted to sit down before, but I would not let him—he was about 300 yards from where the fight was—I went within 250 yards of his home with him, and left him sitting down in Crown-lane, North-end, about twenty minutes or a quarter to twelve o'clock—Bennett very sel<lb></lb>dom succeeded in striking the prisoner, nor the prisoner him—very few blows were struck—it was chiefly throwing one another down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital. I saw the deceased there on the afternoon of the day after he was brought in, but he was not immediately under my care until the 1st of July—Dr. Spiller attended him until then—lie was the house-surgeon till then—I had seen him from time to time from his first coming in, but on the 1st of July I ex<lb></lb>amined him—he was suffering from an abscess in the neighbourhood of the bladder—an incision had been made the previous day, on the left side of the abdomen, and the abscess opened, there was a very foul purulent discharge, mixed with urine, and very large sloughs—the supuration increased a great deal, and he died at half-past eleven o'clock on the morning of the 9th of July—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the 10th—I found two ruptures of the bladder at the anterior part, one about the rim of the pubes—that rup<lb></lb>ture was the cause of the inflammation which led to the abscess, and finally caused death—that rupture was caused by some violent blow, either direct or indirect, on the region of the bladder itself—there was no indication whatever of violence on the body—the internal organs were for the most part healthy—there were some old marks of the lungs being affected—there was nothing to cause death but the rupture of the bladder—I have not a doubt that was the cause of death,</p>

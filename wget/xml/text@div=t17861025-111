Stiff and Wightman's; I do not know who took them; I saw a man go through the passage with my buttons, but I thought it was a friend of mine taking care of them, so I did not stop them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. In the confusion of this fire, you lost a great many things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your friends got them out of the house as soon as they could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had the box ever been opened after it came to your house from Birmingham? - No, Sir, I never opened it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250195"></xptr>Then how is it possible you should know they were in the box? - I have since found a quantity of buttons, which answer the order I sent for to Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Court. These are buttons, you had ordered from Birmingham? - Yes, they came in a box, which was nailed up as common boxes are.</p>
               <p>Was it nailed down when it came to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you sent the particular pattern? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not the pattern come up with the box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the pattern in the box, or on the outside of the box? - Inside the box; but I did not see the pattern.</p>
               <p>Had you any letter of advice? - No.</p>
               <p>How long have you had them? - They came up in November twelve month.</p>
               <p>Had you drawn the nails of that box? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>What buttons were they? - A plain yellow metal, perfectly plain, and white shanks to them.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you order your buttons all coat, or did you order them coat and breast? - Coat and breast.</p>

               <p>I am in partnership with Mr. Stiff, in New-street, Covent-garden; on Monday, the 6th of October, between the hours of ten and twelve, the prosecutor came to our shop for some buttons; he came behind to my partner and me, as we were sitting at the desk, and told us, he understood a person was to come to sell some buttons; about one the same day, the prisoner came to my partner and me, as we were sitting at the desk, and produced two buttons, one of each, and mentioned that he had a quantity to dispose of; we asked him if he was the manufacturer of them; he said no, he had them of a taylor who lodged in his house, who was gone to Liverpool, and that it was all he had for fifteen pounds; we asked him what price he asked for them; he said, he could not think of taking less than four shillings and sixpence; he did not say, nor we did not mention, whether he meant the single gross, or the double gross, as we did not want an explanation, only to get possession of the buttons; we appointed him to come at three; about ten minutes before that, he brought the buttons tied up in two handkerchiefs; he put them on the counter in the front shop; I desired him to step into the back shop, which had not the command of the shop door, as I expected the prosecutor with his friends, to come at three; the prosecutor came in with two gentlemen belonging to the Sun-fire-office; and the foreman of the fire men, when he came in, he gave me a small slip of paper, upon which was wrote the number of the buttons, and the description of the buttons, and the quantity; the number that was affixed to them, if they were his buttons was ninety, upon which they just pulled open one corner of the handkerchief; I had not unpacked the buttons; I looked and saw it agreed with the paper, which the prosecutor had given me; and agreed with the numbers on the front of the buttons, upon which the prosecutor and the gentlemen from the office called the prisoner forwards, and untied the handkerchief; he was asked if they were his property; he said they were; one of the gentlemen belonging to the Sun-fire-office said, Sir, you must produce the person you had these buttons from, they were stolen, at which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250196"></xptr> the prisoner seemed surprized; he was taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the quantity of them? - Twelve double gross.</p>
               <p>(Produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The manufacturers in Birmingham send up buttons which are numbered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So did the correspondent in London send down the number? - Certainly; if the manufacturer should send these buttons to a hundred different sorts of people, they would have been the same.</p>
               <p>Have you any of them? - I do not keep any of the sort; I had them a very little time; it may be common with other button-makers.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Stiff and Wightman; on the 5th of October, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner came to our house, and brought with him two patterns of buttons, the same as these that are produced, and desired to know whether these were buttons that we dealt in, and whether it would suit us to take a quantity of them, as he had twelve double gross of them, that he had taken for a debt of fifteen pounds; I told him if he would call on the morrow, my master would be in the way, but I could not give him an answer; the next morning the prosecutor came for other buttons, and asked if we kept such buttons, and described his loss and the quantity; he went to speak to my master.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Prosecutor. Look at these buttons? - They are my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you ever see them before you saw them at Wightman's? - No.</p>
               <p>Who do you deal with at Birmingham? - I do not know him; a friend of mine wrote for the buttons.</p>
               <p>Did not he write for that sort of button, that was numbered 92 on the card? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If I wrote to him he would send them to me? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>If any body had looked at this card for that button, would not they have found it 92? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now you have never seen these, how can you say they were your property? - He sent me white once.</p>
               <p>How can you say he did not do so now? There is the proof of it.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you by that paper that you delivered in to Mr. Wightman? - My friend who wrote for the buttons gave it me; his name is

               <p>How came your friend to write it? - By my desire, because Mr. Wightman said, he wanted to ascertain the number and the quantity; and I went to my friend who wrote for the buttons, and he looked in the bill and there he found the number; I produced that number to Mr. Wightman, and the number and the quantity answered with these offered to sale at Mr. Wightman's; from all which, and the box being found in the prisoner's lodgings, I conclude they are my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Umpage. Where did you find the box? - Down in the kitchen; when I went to his house, I asked him where the box was that held the buttons; he said it was in the kitchen, but desired me not to make a noise; it was publicly there.</p>

Was that the night of the fire? - I do not know; when I went up it was Mr. Fox, and he said, Molly, I have picked up a box, but what is in it, God knows; I asked him, where he found it; he said, in the street, on the pavement; he went up stairs; Mr. Fox said, take it in the kitchen, perhaps we may find an owner for it; the next day in the afternoon, Mr. Fox came down into the kitchen and looked at the box, and said, Molly, there is no direction on the outside, I wonder if there is any within; he opened the box, and there was no direction, only a parcel of buttons; he said, he did not think they were of much value; he would look in the paper to see if they were advertised; on the day that he went to sell them, he said, they were not advertised, and he might sell them as well as another.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What is Mr. Cooke? - He keeps an academy.</p>
               <p>How near is Well's-street where you live, to Vine-street where the fire was? - No great way.</p>

               <p>About seven in the evening, whereabouts upon the pavement did he find it? - He did not tell me; he said, to the best of my knowledge in Vine-street; my master never comes into the kitchen; nobody goes into the kitchen but myself.</p>
               <p>Did you look at the outside of this box to see if there was any direction? - Yes; there was no direction.</p>
               <p>No mark upon it? - Not to the best of my remembrance; I saw none upon paper.</p>
               <p>What became of the other part of the box? - I do not know; there was no direction on the box.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You would have found no difficulty in burning it if you had been desired? did not you advise him to go to Vine-street where the poor people had been burnt out? - No, I had no business with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my parents in Ash ford-street, Hoxton, my father is a wax-maker. On the morning of the 16th of August I was playing with my little brother, Josiah Erasmus Muncey Hinds—the pri<lb></lb>soner came and took hold of his hand, and asked me what his name was—did not tell her—I went to the square—she said, "Go and fetch a lower, and I will mind your brother"—I went, and when I came back my brother was standing without any shoes—I am sure the prisoner is the person—the gardener, was in the square.</p>

On Saturday, the 18th of August, I was crossing Old-street-road, and was given in charge by a little girl to a policeman for robbing her brother of his clothes—when I was taken to the place the boy said it was not me, it was a woman with a white plaster on her mouth, and I had a black one on—I was taken to the station, and the inspector said that a child had been stripped on the Thursday, but it was a woman with white bonnet and pink ribbon—and on Sunday a little girl was brought, and she said I was the young woman—I saw several children at the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate's, who had been robbed, but I did not know them—I am quite innocent.</p>

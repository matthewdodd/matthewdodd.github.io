             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Hodges, an Attorney, Brick-court, Temple; I called on Mr. Bullen; he told me, he had an order for some goods, and begged me to make out the bill, which I did; and I went down to Billingsgate with him; and the goods were put in the tap room, at the Queen's-head, Dark-house-lane; the prisoner was not there then, but came soon after; he then asked Mr. Bullen, to give him change for a fifty pound bank bill, but he could not; then the prisoner, said he would go and get it changed, but returned and could not; then he said, he could go and borrow the money, but did not return; I then went with Mr. Bullen, to look for the goods, and they were gone; I said, you are taken-in, and defrauded of the goods.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went down to Mr. Bullens; I gave him an order for the goods; I asked him to give me change for a ten pound bank note and five shillings, which was all the money I had about me: well, says he, I am not afraid to trust you, you will pay me when you come to town again.</p>
               <p>Court. I am to understand you, that Mr. Bullen agreed to trust you? - He did, he met me, and called me a thief, and took me to Clerkenwell, there I bailed it; some time after, I met him again, and he collared me again, and said I was a thief, and I begged he would not expose me, but I would go where he pleased, and desired we might go to a publick house, there we drank together.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord, I had a load on my back; and there I would have taken him then, but there was no persons in the tap room, and I could get no assistance, so let him go: the first time I saw him, he was taken and committed to Clerkenwell in February 1787, and he bailed it, and flew from his bail; he was indicted in February 1787, but the prisoner was not in custody, and the Christian name was spelt wrong; he was taken first at the Queen's-head, in Tower-street, then I could not take him: I met him last Monday in Crooked-lane, and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor told me, if I could give him seven pounds, and a bond of indemnification, that he should not be hurt, he would not prosecute me.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that true.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I said to the poor woman, with a child in her arms, that I should be glad to do any thing that the law would permit me.</p>
               <p>Jury to Matthews. Was you in Newgate to see the prisoner? - I was, I went to see if he was the person I saw at Dark-house-lane, who ordered the goods, but had no conversation with the prisoner, about this business. I, in reality, went to see a debtor, an acquaintance; but I did drink with the prisoner, merely to see if he was the person that ordered the goods of Mr. Bullen.</p>

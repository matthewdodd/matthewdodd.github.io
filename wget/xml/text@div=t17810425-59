               <p>Upon the 6th of March, between nine and ten at night, I was going home to Little Wild-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, from the Maze, on the other side of the water, being a little intoxicated: two men and a woman came up to me; one of the men was tall, the other short and stout; they said, Sir, you seem to be very much in liquor; which way are you going? I said I was going home to Little Wild-street; they said, you are going the wrong way, and they took me down Water-lane: there I was knocked down, and my watch taken from me. The next morning I went to the Public Office in Bow-street, and lodged a complaint, and advertised it on the Saturday following in the Gazetteer. Upon the 5th of this month I was sent for to the Office; there I saw my watch; it was stopped by the pawnbroker: I cannot swear to the prisoner.</p>

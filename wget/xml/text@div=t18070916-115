            . Q. On the 21st of July, in consequence of any thing that was passing, was the prisoner put into your house. - A. Yes, I put him in care of all the property; he was in possession nearly two days, at 5 s. a day.</p>
               <p>Q. When the property came afterwards to be examined, did you find any thing to be missing. - A. I did; twenty-two pair of shoes, a pair of boots, two skins of leather, and a vast number of things; I caused the prisoner's lodgings to be searched.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Your affairs had unfortunately been embarrassed, and you agreed that a sort of assignment should take place. - A. I put this man in possession, and sent to my creditors directly that they might see that all was fair. I authorised this man to sell for all the creditors. Mr. Barker and Mr. Chalmer were my principal creditors.</p>
               <p>- HISLOP. I am a constable. I searched the prisoner's lodgings. I found two pair of children's shoes, and a pair of men's shoes, they have been worn; two kid skins, and several pieces of leather. I found a duplicate; I went to the pawnbroker's, and there I found three pair of shoes.</p>

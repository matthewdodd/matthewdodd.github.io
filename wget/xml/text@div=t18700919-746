I lifted her up, and went with her to a public-house, and gave her some gin. I went back with her to the same place, and she kept pulling me; I pushed her away from me, and on account of her being tipsy she fell down. I went across the road, and a constable came up to me, and asked me who I was, and if I was with the woman. I said I was the man, and he took me in custody.</p>

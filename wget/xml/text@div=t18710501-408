                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—I was living with him at 257, Bethnal Green Road, on Sunday, 19th March—he had been very strange indeed, in the way he was going on that morning; talking very strangely—about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing out of the side door, and he caught hold of me by the hair, and struck me on my back—it knocked me on my knees—we struggled together—some minutes afterwards I saw that he had a small knife in his hand—he struck me with it on the head several times—I suppose it must have been the knife that struck me on the back, but I did not see it—after some minutes, someone came in, and took me away to the doctor's—I had some wounds on the head, not very bad ones; they were very slight—I can't recollect whether they bled much—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife—it is one he uses in his business—he is a clog maker—he seemed to be very much troubled in his mind at this time—he has always been very kind to me and to his children, when sober—we have had a deal of trouble through losses in business, of late, and that has preyed very much on his mind, and he has given way to drink, through depression of trade and losses in our family; before that we were always very comfortable—it was not my wish to prosecute—we have three children.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, of 155, Dorset Street—on this Sunday afternoon I heard screams of "Murder!"—I went to the door of the prisoner's room, and heard a struggling going on inside—I went in, and saw the prisoner and his wife in the parlour; they were then standing up, and struggling—I saw her go towards the door, and slip down, and the prisoner fell on the top of her—I dragged her away, and I and another young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> took this knife from the prisoner—the prosecutrix was bleeding, and her hair was all down—the prisoner seemed sober to me, but very much excited.</p>

                  </hi>. I am divisional surgeon of police in this district—on this Sunday afternoon Mrs. Battersby was brought to my surgery—her face and hair were covered with blood, and her clothes also; she was very faint—she had four scalp wounds; they were to the skull, to the bone, and there were a large number of smaller wounds—I can't say that either of the scalp wounds were dangerous in themselves, unless erysipelas had set in—there were two deep wounds penetrating to the left bladebone, upwards—on the head and shoulders she had fifteen wounds, besides those on her hands—she appeared to have been struggling with her hands; in fact, she saved her life by means of her hands—they were wounds that might have been inflicted by such a knife as this—they were about an inch deep, and about an inch wide—I saw the prisoner at the Court, on the Monday—at that timo he was mad—I think it was not the madness of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens;</hi> some persons call it so, and most do so when it occurs from drink; but the man was as mad as possible when I saw him on the Monday—I did not see him on the Sunday—it was a tem<lb></lb>porary madness—I can't say whether he is liable to a recurrence of it; if he exposes himself to the same exciting cause, he is very likely to have it again; but I think not without.</p>

I went down next morning, and forgot it; about 1 o'clock I felt in my pocket, and could not find any money; I asked my wife for some money. I should have murdered her if she had not called out about her children"—He was a little excited, but at the time he said that to me he did not seem excited, because he had eaten a good dinner—that was on the Sunday.</p>

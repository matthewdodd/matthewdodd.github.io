                  </hi>. I am a brickmaker, and live at Uxbridge. On the 25th of September, the prisoner Moore came to me at Uxbridge, and said he had been down to my field at Drayton, three miles from ux-bridge, and had seen some bricks there which he thought would suit him—he asked me if they were for sale—I said, yes, and I should be glad to sell them—I asked him if it was to be a ready-money transaction—he said, "No"—I said, as he was an entire stranger to me, I should not think of letting my goods go unless I had good security for them—he said if I would meet him in London, he would take me to his ground-landlord, who would be answerable for the amount of the bricks—ha appointed for me to meet him next day at eleven o'clock, at the Bell, Holborn, to go with him to the ground-landlord—I got there at twelve o'clock—Moore was not there—I left the Bell, and bad a message, which fetched me back—I returned to the Bell, and found Moore there—he had a man with him whom I found afterwards to be named Toovey—he called him his foreman—we agreed on the price of the bricks—I set off with Moore to go to the ground-landlord, in a cab—while riding, I asked him how far it was—he said not far, that it was at the Retreat, at South Lambeth—I asked him his ground-landlord's name—he said, Grobecker, and that he kept a large grammar-school—we at last got to the Retreat—it was a very large house, with a lawn in front, and a garden and two large hot-houaea behind—we got out there—the servant came to the door—I accompanied Moore through the house into the garden—we found Grobecker there—Moore introduced me, and said, "This is Mr. Grainge; I have been down to look at his bricks for the buildings in Sidney-square"—he had told me before that he was going to build Sidney-square, and a street there, and should want about 300,000 bricks—I said, "Mr. Moore has been looking at my bricks, and says you are the ground-landlord, and are going to build Sidney-square, and the street there—will you be the security for the bricks?"—Grobecker said, "Yes, I am—it makes no difference whether I pay you, or Moore—have you bargained for credit?"—I said I had no ob<lb></lb>jection to give the usual trade credit—upon which Grobecker said, "Per<lb></lb>haps we shall manage it better than that, when we have got the goods?"</p>

I missed this property from a drawer in the lower room, and had left him in the next room - there is a door between them, which was left open. Last Saturday week, two children came to my door, and gave me a brown paper parcel, which contained the silver milkpot and watch.</p>

I said it was time to go home; they asked if I would have any thing to drink. I was angry at seeing such company there, and said they had better go. Till went first, and then the prisoner. Next morning between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner came and asked if Till had been there. I said not, and asked his reason for giving my wife things to pawn or sell, and how he came by them; he said "I stole them from my master." I asked what he had stolen; he said a silver milkpot, a silver watch, a gown and scarf; and that Till had persuaded him to do it. I said I should be forced to give charge of him; he said "Tell me the way to Paddington, that I may be off:" but I fetched an officer - he remained in my room while I went, and might have left if he liked. I was not gone above four minutes, and did not tell him that I was going for one, and I left my wife in the house.</p>

            . I live with Cohen, as his wife. The prisoner came to my room with Till, (whom I knew before,) on the 24th of November, at five o'clock in the afternoon; Till came to see his child; the young woman in the next room was out, and had left it with me. The prisoner was down stairs, and did not hear what Till said to me. I pawned a silk gown and scarf for Till, and when I returned gave him 10 s.; he went down, and shortly after brought up the prisoner; they sat down, and shared some money - Till gave him 13 s. and odd - for after I gave Till the 10 s. he produced a silver milkpot and a watch, and went to sell them; he asked me to sell them, but I refused - he went down, and brought the prisoner up in half an hour, and gave him the 13 s., and said he had sold the milkpot and watch for 1 l.; the prisoner said nothing to it. When Cohen came home he seemed angry, and they went away; I told him what I had done. Next morning the prisoner came and asked for Till; Cohen asked why he had brought me the things to pawn, and where he got them from; he said he had robbed his master of them; Cohen went down and got an officer.</p>

He then asked if I knew any thing about these things; I said No; he said he should send for an officer if I did not tell him - I said he might.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Who settled the business about a bill of exchange for 126 l. - The prisoner left that at my brother's house the night before he was taken up, I never saw it before, there was another bill drawn out by Mr. Hughes.</p>

               <p>And that meeting was about a place for you? - Yes, I was to give him 126 l.</p>
               <p>How came the prisoner to accept a bill for 126 l. to be drawn for your brother upon your account, if the stock was not to indemnify him? - I did not ask him to do it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner has given a bill of exchange f 126 l. which your brother has signed as the drawer; was not this stock of your brother's to be a security, and to go in part payment? - No.</p>

               <p>Yes there was, what were you to pay for that place, and to whom? - Sometimes he said it would cost 100 l. sometimes 120 l. and at last he got up up to 126 l.</p>
               <p>Then why do not you say so; who was it to be paid to? - To Mr. Hughes at the Treasury Coffee house; I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him at all? - Yes, I saw a man whose name they said was Hughes.</p>
               <p>How long was that after the transfer of your brother's stock? - About 4 months.</p>
               <p>Then it was not very long before this man was taken up ? - Not above ten days.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110110"></xptr>I do not know the transfer office from any other office.</p>
               <p>Is it a small room or a largish room? A largish room.</p>
               <p>Is it square or round? - I am not positive Sir, I have been there once since about a week ago.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was the transfer office? - As he and the stranger went in, I cast my eyes over the door, and I happened to see the three per cent, wrote there; to the best of my memory it is the left side.</p>
               <p>What brought you there a week ago? - I understood I was to be called on this affair, and I wished to be as clear as possible.</p>
               <p>Then, the time you was there, you took no particular observation? - I never expected to be called upon.</p>
               <p>No, but as you never had been at the Bank before? - Nobody desired me to go a week ego, I went that I might be clear in my evidence.</p>
               <p>When were you first desired by the prisoner to come and be a witness for him? - About eight days ago the prisoner sent for me, I knew nothing of what he was in here for; I went, and he asked me what I could recollect of this affair; I told him.</p>
               <p>You are a gentleman no doubt of it, what made you take such particular notice of this conversation? - The peculiarity of the stranger's dress; he had an apron on, or a cloth roun d his waist; and he had sleeves on like a Butcher's: that made me take more particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>What made you listen to the conversation ? - I was going to address the prisoner and he interrupted me.</p>
               <p>You made no minute of this conversation? - I did not, my attention was drawn at the time towards the prisoner, because I was going to speak to him; I am not perfectly sure as to those being the very words, but they were to that effect.</p>
               <p>What were they, mention them again? - When you want the money for the place for my brother, you must come here and get it, you can do it, or you can get it without me.</p>
               <p>Was any body by at that time? - There were several people round but I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>What time of day might it be? - Between 11 and 12 in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Where was this conversation? - It was just going out, just as they came out to me, out at the door, at the Bank door.</p>
               <p>Where there? - Pretty near the outward door going into Bartholomew-lane.</p>
               <p>And nobody else near? - None that I saw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You did not come to town on purpose for this business? - I did not, there are people in town that can justify what I say.</p>
               <p>If the ship had sailed in August, you would have gone with the ship? - I would.</p>
               <p>- MILLS sworn.</p>
               <p>I have conversed with the prosecutor two or three different times in the middle of August about this business; I have dealt with Mr. Groves some time; I never saw the prisoner before now; Groves said if he could get his money, he did not care if the prisoner went to the devil; he said he had got a note for 120 l. and this money was in part of it, and if he had paid him his interest, he should never have thought about it; it was agreed to take the money from a Mr. Dupree, but a Mr. Shackelford came down to my house and said, he would lay me five guineas he would have Berthaud hanged, and he would have him hanged if his brother would not: it was owing as I understood, to this Shackelford that the prosecution was set on foot; for Groves seemed very sorry, and said, he would not have a man hanged upon any account, and that if it had not been for Sheffield he would have taken the money.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Prosecution. You made no minute of this conversation? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you communicate it to any body? - do not recollect, there was a person with me who was the prisoner's friend.</p>

            . Look at that Mr. Stewart, do you remember seeing that man at the bank? - Never saw the man in my life to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>You have heard what he has said? - I never said so.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did you ever say that to the prisoner? - I never said so in my life.</p>
               <p>Nor you never said any thing to the other witness? - If he had paid in the interest I should have known nothing at all.</p>

               <p>Mills. He said he should have been satisfied in his keeping the money if he had paid him the interest; over and over again.</p>
               <p>To Groves. Did you ever say in the presence of Mills that the prisoner might have kept the money? - If he had paid me the interest I should not have known any thing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Court. Why do not you give a direct answer? - If he had brought me the interest of the money I should have never thought any thing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Did you say so or not? - I did say so; I said so far as this, if he had brought me the interest of the money at the Bank, I should not have known any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Court. But that is not the question, Did you say, that if he had paid you the interest of the money, he might have kept the money, you would not have prosecuted him at all? - I never said any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Mills. Further Groves said, if his father-in-law will pay me the money, I will not prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say so or not Groves? it an easy question, why do you hesitate? - I said so far as this, if he had brought me the interest, I should have known nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the reason you do not give an answer to the question? - Yes, Sir, if he had given me the interest of the money, I said so to him, I said, if the prisoner had brought me the interest -</p>
               <p>Have not you heard what Mr. Mills has said?</p>
               <p>Mills. He said there was a debt about 30 l. besides the money, which would very high make up 100 l. if Mr. Dupree or any body would pay it, he would not hurt him.</p>
               <p>Groves. I said, I would not hurt the man if I could help it; but I could not help it: I never said, that money was in part of the money.</p>
               <p>Mills. I will challenge Mr. Groves if he can say I have told one syllable of untruth.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

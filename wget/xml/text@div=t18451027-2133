                  </hi>. I live at No. 119, New-street, Deptford. The prisoner is my wife—on the 15th of Oct. we had a few words before this matter happened, which was between one and two o'clock in the day—she was very much the worse for liquor—I had my dinner, and was just going to return to my work, when she stabbed me in the cheek with the knife she was using—I had been persuading her to stop in, and not go out, and we had had a few words—we have been married five years—we have no family—we have lived pretty happily—when I found I was stabbed, I went to a chemist's shop, and she went with me—I do not think the intended to do me any mischief—she did not say anything at the time—she had been using the knife at her dinner—I cannot say how much she had been drinking—she was very tipsy—I do not think she knew she had the knife or that she used it—the wound was about two inches long—it passed slightly through the cheek—I did not give her in charge—she was taken by Sergeant Fenn in the chemist's shop at Deptford—I had been there about half an hour—she was there all the time—it is about 100 yards from my house.</p>

               <p>husband came into the house—the husband sat down and had his dinner—just as he had finished they had a few words—I could not exactly make out what they were talking about—the knife was suddenly snatched from the table, and plunged into the jaw—an attempt was then made at the left side—I knocked the prisoner down and took the knife away—I went directly and fetched an officer—the husband took the wife in his arms, and said she should not go—I said, "If you will not allow her to go, you shall both quit the house, for I am not going to have murder committed here," and they both left—in about half-an-hour the sergeant came for the knife, and told me to follow him, which I did, to the doctor's shop—I gave him the knife, and as soon as the prisoner saw it, she said, "that is the knife"—I followed them to the station-house, and heard her say she would finish him—she was intoxicated, but not so drunk but what she must have known what she was doing and saying.</p>

About half-past two o'clock on the Wednesday afternoon, I was in Flagon-row, Deptford, and seeing a large number of people round the chemist's shop, I went in to see what was the matter—I saw the prosecutor with his cheek severely cut, and asked what it was done with—he said, "A knife"—the prisoner directly said she had done it, and she would do more for him—I asked where it was done—they said at Mr. Newby's, No. 119, New-street—I left her in custody, went to Newby's, and got the knife, which I produce—the prisoner appeared to be sober, and not at all excited—when I returned to the shop she said that was the knife; she wanted a separation, and she would finish him—she said several times in going to the station that she would finish him; she wanted a separation—she was quite sober.</p>

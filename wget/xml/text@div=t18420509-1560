                  </hi>. I live with my mother, who keeps a shop in Frede<lb></lb>rick-place, Hampstead-road. On the 15th of April, when I came home, about seven o'clock, I missed my double-barrelled gun from the shop-window—it has not been found.</p>

About three or four clock on the 15th of April, I was close to Mrs. Deacon's shop, and saw the prisoner Taylor come out of the shop with the gun in his hand, and as he was getting over the door, he said to Armstrong, who was ten or a dozen yards off, "Stop a minute, <hi rend="italic">Jack"—</hi> they then went together round William-street—I called Mrs. Deacon—I and Charles Cotton went after them—when we got to the other end of Wil<lb></lb>Ham-street, they were at the corner of Brook-street, and when we got to the corner of Brook-street we lost sight of them—in the New-road we caught sight of them again, and then lost them again.</p>

               <p>them to Fitzroy-market, and then lost sight of them—I am quite sure the prisoners are the persons.</p>

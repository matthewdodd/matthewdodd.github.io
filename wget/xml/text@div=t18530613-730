                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, and live in St. Ann's-lane, St. Martin's-le-Grand. On the night of Friday, 22nd April, my premises were broken into by some person, and property stolen to the amount of about 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made some stir, and gave information to the police—on the Monday morning after the robbery I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—after I had received it I put an advertisement into the <hi rend="italic">Advertiser</hi> newspaper on the Tuesday morning—there is no one here who has a copy of the newspaper—in the course of the same afternoon I received a second letter, and in consequence of receiving that I put live sovereigns, wrapped in a paper, into a hole in the wall in Smithfield-market—I put them myself, about 8 o'clock, on the same Tuesday evening—I did not watch the spot after I put them there, nor did I give directions to anybody else to do so—on Wednesday morning I received this third letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not give any information to the police before I put the money in the hole in the wall—I did afterwards, on the Wednesday after I received the third letter—after this there were five farthings put in a hole, but I did not put them in; I gave them to my brother-in-law, Tippett—before I gave them I had communicated with the police, in consequence of the third letter—I never saw any more of my five sovereigns</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, D</hi> 7). I saw the prisoner after he was apprehended—I had received these two letters from Mr. Burchett—I showed them to the prisoner—I asked if he knew the handwriting—he said, "Yes," it was his handwriting, and he had seen his error—he said these two letters were his writing, as well as those sent to Mr. Burchett's—here is the mark I put on these, as well as on Mr. Burchett's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it your usual mode to go and question a man to get evidence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I consider it no harm—he did not say, in reference to one of these letters, that he knew nothing about it—that was another letter which the other officer had got, relative to another case where he had obtained money, no doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This was the same morning he was taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I had not then made inquiry whether I could get evidence of his writing or not.</p>

I fully expected the parcel would have been in the place; if it is not there to-night by 8, you will lose all chance, for, as I told you in my last note, the goods will be removed to-night at 12, after which all trace will be lost; so you can please yourself.

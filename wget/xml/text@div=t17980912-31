               <p>Wray. This stock-buckle is my property, I can swear to it with certainty.</p>

I had been out of place about a week, I heard of a place at the Windmill-inn, St. John-street, and then I met a man who used to be a waiter at the Paul's-head, Cateaton-street, and he gave them to me to sell for him, and told me to meet him the next day at Highburybarn; he said he was going up there as day waiter.</p>

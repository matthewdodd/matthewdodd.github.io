                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Sheriff of Mid<lb></lb>dlesex. On the 12th of July I had a warrant from the Sheriff to arrest the prisoner—I went to execute it on the 2nd of September, at his house, at Irongate Wharf, Paddington—he is a slater—I had seen him before—I once had an execution in his house—I did not see him then, but he came down to our office—when I went on the 2nd of September, I found the house-door wide open—I knocked at the door, no body answered—I went up stairs to the front room, first-floor—the door was open—I saw the prisoner and his wife in the room—I told him I had an execution against him from the Sheriff, at the suit of William Marks—I took the warrant out of my pocket, and showed it to him—the. wife said, "You shall not take him"—I then said, "I shall take you"—the prisoner said, "You shall not, I will not go with you"—I told him I was determined to—his wife and him both rose from their seats—the pri<lb></lb>soner struck me, and struck my hat off—I then went to take him by the collar, his wife came up to me and took me by the hair, and he leaned back towards the fire-place, took a short poker, or round instrument, and struck me across the front part of my head—my hat was still off—I then had a scuffle with them both—we went into the next room on the same floor, in the scuffle, I trying to get him out, holding his collar—(I had collared him after my hat was knocked off—he got the poker while I held him)—he and his wife were trying to throw me down, and he said, "I will bite your b y ear off"—he threw me on the floor, then struck me</p>

               <p>in the eye with his fist—he had dropped the poker in the scuffle—I then called for assistance—I had left Caperton, who had accompanied me, in the yard—I called to him, "Jemand "Murder"—the prisoner then said to his wife, "Go down, shut the door, and keep him out"—she went down, and the door was shut—I cried out several times—the door was broke open, I believe—Chaperon came up, and we both dragged the prisoner down stairs—he would not walk—while we were dragging him down he called out for a knife, and to the bystanders for assistance—he said, "Bring me a knife, and I will rip him up"—he then called for a hammer—his daughter brought one, but it was not given into his hands—we had got him down into the yard—Matthews, a policeman, came, and we took him to the sta<lb></lb>tion—he struck me at the station—I rode outside a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> going to White<lb></lb>cross-street, and he kicked me once through the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> window, and struck me once with his fist.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Sheriffs officer's man. On the 2nd of Sep<lb></lb>tember, I accompanied Gibbs to Irongate Wharf, to arrest the prisoner—when we arrived, Gibbs got in—the door was open, I believe—I was five or six yards off—I saw him enter the house—I remained outside—I afterwards heard him call for assistance, and "Murder"—he called <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>—I went and found the door bolted with two bolts—I broke it open, and Mrs. Hussey was on the stairs going up, which prevented my going up—I got up, and Gibbs was contending with the prisoner—they were strug<lb></lb>gling together, Gibbs with his back on the floor, and Hussey on him—the wife was aiding and assisting to rescue her husband from custody—Gibbs's head was bleeding profusely—the prisoner was kicking and beating him, in fact he would have murdered him if I had not prevented him—he kicked him repeatedly, and me to, on my * * * and bit me—he said he would not be taken—he would not go—I offered him fair means to go quietly—I tried to get him out of the room, but he would not walk—he did all he could to annoy us, kicking and beating, and his wife assisting him—we caught hold of his arms and dragged him down stairs into the yard—we were then endeavoring to get him away, but he would not—he was kick<lb></lb>ing, beating, and pulling the rails down—after I hallooed for five or ten minutes the policeman came up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you been at his house before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—I saw Gibbs go in—I do not know whether' he knocked at the door—I was not close enough to see—I think he found the door open—it was very unusual to be open, by what the officers say—I cannot tell whether it was open or shut—I was not close enough—I was not four minutes outside before I heard him call out—I did not see the door, because it was in a corner—I saw him go to the door, but did not see how he got in—I was within sight of the door—he had nothing in his hand when he left me—I saw no pitch-fork—when I got in I laid hold of the prisoner—we tried to secure him—he was down repeatedly—we pulled him down stairs, hold<lb></lb>ing his hands and feet—Gibbs held his feet—he might be on the ground at the bottom of the stairs—very likely we were all three on the floor there—we did not kick him there—I never kicked him, nor did Gibbs, to my knowledge, nor hit him—I did not knock him down in the street, nor did' Gibbs—he did not say at the station that he had asked Gibbs to show him his authority, and he would not—it was produced at the station, and read—I never heard Gibbs say he was a blackguard for not coming up with the fees.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. About seven o'clock on Friday evening, September 2nd, the prosecutor called on me—I found an incision on the top of his head two inches and a half long—the sur<lb></lb>rounding skin was very much bruised and swollen, consequently I infer that it was produced by a blunt instrument—it was a very severe blow, such as a poker might have inflicted—the skull was not fractured—it was a blow likely to be attended with serious consequences—the bone of the skull was exposed the whole extent of the incision—he complained of sickness, of violent pain in his head, and giddiness, which would be symp<lb></lb>toms naturally consequent on a severe blow on that part of the head—I attended him for about a week—I ordered him to keep to his room, to have low diet, and proper medicine—in my judgment it was necessary he should do so in order to avert serious consequences—there was a very extensive bruise on his left eye—if that had been from a blow with a fist it must have been a very violent blow, as there was extensive discoloration of the skin surrounding the eye—I applied leeches to the eye—he was very seriously injured, and until the present day he has occasionally com<lb></lb>plained of very violent pain in his head.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where do you live? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. 25, Richmond-street, Portman-market—I have lived there eighteen months, and in the neighborhood all my life—I work for myself—I know very little of the prisoner—I have known him about two yean by unload<lb></lb>ing materials at his wharf, and he always wanted the money before I got the materials out of the boat—on this occasion I had a contract with Mr. Vale, of 167, Edgeware-place, and was waiting for a boat of materials coming in—I had not been on the campshed more than fourteen minutes, I should say—the prisoner had not seen me—I had not spoken to him—I did not remain in the same place all the while I was there, I walked about—I have been a well-borer since I have known what it was to do anything—I am twenty-four years of age—I have not brought the pitch<lb></lb>fork with me—the prongs of the fork were about six inches wide—he put them into the crevice of the door, about the middle of the door as near as I can say, about where the lock or bolt may be—after he had got it open a little way he put his fingers in, and then the door came open and he went tip stairs—he left the pitchfork down stairs—I did not hear that he made any noise in forcing open the door, I was too far off—I did not hear the door creak or a noise of any kind—I did not look to see whether there were any marks of the pitchfork on the door—I held a situation as police-con<lb></lb>stable on the Great Western Railway two years back, for twelve or fifteen months—I cannot say exactly how long it is since I first went—it was about winter time—I did not exactly hold a situation as a constable, although I was a constable on the line, I did the Company's work as well—I was not an excavator—I was a well-digger and borer—I was a constable and followed that capacity at the same time—I left because I could better myself, for nothing else—I swear that—I wore the Company's uniform when I was not at work at ray well-digging—I left their employ about a year and nine months ago—I was never a journeyman Slater, that I posi<lb></lb>tively</p>

                  </hi>. I take in washing, and go out nursing sometimes—I went to the prisoner's premises on the occasion of one of his children being drowned, and was there at the time this disturbance took place—Mr. and Mrs. Hussey had been out together, and on their return I went down stairs, unbolted the door, and let them in—I had kept the door bolted during their absence—I was not aware at that time that he was in difficulties—I am sure I bolted the door after I let them in—there was a latch to the door, but it was broken, and the door was always bolted instead—there was one bolt where the latch should be—there was no lock—we always bolted it to prevent any one coming in till they were let in—after I had bolted the door again I heard a noise, which I found afterwards was the door burst open, but there is always a great noise down in the yard on ac<lb></lb>count of the omnibuses and things—after I heard the noise Gibbs walked into the kitchen up stairs, where I was with Mr. and Mrs. Hussey and the children—I was going to get tea ready—he walked up to Hussey—I do not know exactly the words he said, but I heard Hussey say, "will you show your warrant? which he refused to do—he said, "No"—he did not produce any warrant that I saw—he said something, I could not under<lb></lb>stand what, and high words ensued between Hussey and him—he wished to take Hussey away—he went up to Hussey, and caught him by the collar as he was sitting in a chair—he did that before Hussey struck him—in fact there was a scuffle altogether, it was not fighting—one was</p>

               <p>pulling one way, and one the other—the scuffle began soon after Gibbs came in—Hussey wished to stop in his place, and Gibbs wished to take him away—after there was a great noise, another man came up—they then got into a loft on the same floor where there were some coals, and they all fell down together—Gibbs fell on the coals—he seemed hurt with the fall—he complained about his head, and said he was hurt, and when the other man came they all three rolled down stairs together from the top to the bottom—Hussey never took hold of the poker or any thing else, and struck Gibbs with it—I did not see any poker used—the police were sent for—Gibbs and his man conducted themselves in a very rough way to Hussey—they all used bad language, both the officers and the prisoner—I do not recollect Gibbs saying any thing about fees.</p>

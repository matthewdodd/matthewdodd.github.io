            . I was at Mr. Sherwood's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you directions to search the prisoner's house?</p>
               <p>Macknabb. Yes; on Saturday night the 30th of last month.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find there?</p>
               <p>( Macknabb produces several things.)</p>
               <p>Q. Where is his house?</p>
               <p>Macknabb. At Mill-yard in the parish of Whitechapel; I found the prisoner there too; he was sitting by the fire with a child on his knee.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sage. I am a moneyer at the Tower; I saw these instruments before at Justice Sherwood's.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you call them?</p>
               <p>Sage. I do not know what particular name to call them by.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of them?</p>
               <p>Sage. For edging of money.</p>
               <p>Q. According to your skill are they instruments fit for the purpose of edging of money? do you know any use for these things but that of edging of money?</p>
               <p>Sage. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. to Macknabb. Where did you find them?</p>
               <p>Macknabb. In the fore garret; I searched the man; he had two good guineas about him and some half crown pieces; all good money as far as I saw; there was a thing to clean dies called a scratch brush to clean it out; here is a 5 s. 3 d. I believe it to be a very bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any edge to it?</p>
               <p>Macknabb. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that an edge resembling a 5 s. 3 d. coined in the Mint?</p>
               <p>Macknabb. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with these instruments when you got them there?</p>
               <p>Macknabb. I carried them to Mr. Sherwood's; I produced them there and have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. At what house did you say you went to search?</p>
               <p>Macknabb. No. 3; I cannot take upon me to say whether it is the gentleman's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Because I believe it was taken by the Court that it was his house.</p>
               <p>Macknabb. I cannot say that; I saw him sitting with a child on his knee.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray where did you find these things?</p>
               <p>Macknabb. Up stairs in the fore garret: part of them, the two brass things, and the 5 s. 3 d. he had four half crowns, a crown piece and two guineas, very good money as far as I understood.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no bad money whatever about him?</p>
               <p>Macknabb. None at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Were these the other things you found there?</p>
               <p>Forrest. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sage. I looked over these things at Justice Sherwood's; I saw nothing there but what the melters use in general, nothing in the coining way at all; there is mould and sand, pearl ashes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170047"></xptr> and mercury, and those kind of things they use in the fluxing of gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to be understood that though you do not use them in coining they are not for the purpose of coining, or that they cannot be used for coining?</p>
               <p>Sage. There is nothing there I should conceive that can be used for coining.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to use the term coining as in contradistinction to melting, and the whole process, or how?</p>
               <p>Sage. This is proper to melt the gold to reduce it in the kind of way to impress it, which is a previous preparation.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. You mean to say there is nothing there particularly adapted for coining more than other melting?</p>
               <p>Sage. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the house with Macknabb?</p>
               <p>Sage. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things locked up particularly?</p>
               <p>Sage. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They were open then?</p>
               <p>Sage. Yes; all laid about.</p>
               <p>Q. Like lumber?</p>
               <p>Sage. When the officer went up into the garret the charcoal was not quite out in one of the furnaces.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. I think you said the prisoner was there at the time?</p>
               <p>Sage. Yes; he was with the officer all about the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say about its being his house?</p>
               <p>Sage. First he said the front part of the house was his; afterwards he said the house was his, only part of it belonged to a lodger that was not at home; there was a bed in the house; we went all over his apartments.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things found in one of his apartments?</p>
               <p>Sage. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any bed in this garret where these things were found?</p>
               <p>Sage. No, no bed at all.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Was there any other thing in the garret besides what is brought here?</p>
               <p>Sage. There was a furnace in the cellar and one in the back garret.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the coals were hardly out in a furnace, where was that?</p>
               <p>Sage. In the garret where these things were taken from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the furnace in the cellar appear to be used lately?</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he live?</p>
               <p>Grove. I never knew where he lived.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. A gentleman here has run this piece of money over the grove produced and it has made a milling on the edge.</p>
               <p>Grove. I was desired to ask him how he sold his shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to ask that question of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Grove. I lived with one Mr. Shurbut; he put the bad money off; I was sent to ask the question by one Harwood, how he sold his shillings; he said the best sort 27 s. for a guinea; I asked him if he could not make two for one; he said he could, but they would be of a worse metal and would not wear so long; I asked him if he would make me forty shillings worth of his shillings; he said he would against the Saturday night following, and he appointed me to meet him at the White Lion, in Red Lion-street; he said he had been very busy and had not quite finished them; that he had about a couple of hours work more to do to them, but if I would come in the morning I should have them, and he appointed nine on Sunday morning; I was to have forty shillings of his shillings, and to give him twenty good shillings for them; I met him on Sunday morning; he called me up into a chamber in the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Grove. About the latter end of September last; there he gave them to me on condition if I put them off I was to pay for them, if not he was to have them again. He produced two half crown pieces, and said he sold them two for one, and two guineas, he said he sold them four for one; he said I might take them with me and try to put them off; I had not had the silver but two or three days before it turned colour.</p>
               <p>Counsel. That was your own fault, he told you the money would not hold if you took beyond the sort of 27 s. for a pound.</p>
               <p>Grove. No.</p>

               <p>Grove. No; I told one of Justice Sherwood's men I would send a little girl up to look for him, the landlady's daughter; she brought word he was not at home but they would send him; after some time he came; I told him I had an acquaintance out of the country that wanted a little of his goods; I asked him if he had got any whites.</p>
               <p>Q. What do they call whites?</p>
               <p>Grove. Shillings; he said he had not any; but he could make some against the Friday following; I asked him if he had any yellows, that was the gold; he said he had none with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Bellamore hear this conversation?</p>
               <p>Grove. Yes; he said he could make some against the Friday following; I asked him if he had any yellows; he said he had none with him, he would fetch them; he went, and in about three-quarters of an hour he returned; he called us into the parlour, and produced as many yellows as came to two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. How many came to two guineas?</p>

At the rate of four for one; he said he would not sell under two guineas worth; I went to Justice Sherwood's; he sent a couple of guineas up; when we came up almost to that place Bellamore came out, and said he had made his escape from him; the reason we sent for the money was Bellamore said he had not so much money about him, but must send to his lodgings for it.</p>

               <p>Bellamore. Yes; last Saturday three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How was you dressed?</p>
               <p>Bellamore. I had this coat on that I have now, and another coat over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bellamore. Grove sent for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. To what place?</p>
               <p>Bellamore. The White Lion, in Red Lion-street, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bellamore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him?</p>
               <p>Bellamore. Yes; when I first went in Groves pulled his hat off to him, and said, how do you do sir? says he I thought you would not have come; he told Piddock I was his countryman, and asked him if he had got any whites; he said he had got none, they were hardly worth making; says he have you got any yellows, let us have some, the young man is going into the country; he said I have none, you shall have some in about half or three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk about the price?</p>
               <p>Bellamore. Yes; I was to have eight guineas for two.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you ask for?</p>
               <p>Bellamore. He brought me two guineas worth. I was to have some five and three-pences; he would not let me have any without I was to have two guineas worth.</p>

               <p>Q. What were they, guineas, half guineas or five and three-pences?</p>
               <p>Bellamore. I believe there were a guinea or two among them; the rest were half guineas and five and three-pences.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all sold at the rate of four for one?</p>
               <p>Bellamore. Yes; then I said to

               <p>Q. You did this with a design to hook him, did not you?</p>

            . I live in Mill-yard, Goodman's-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner there?</p>
               <p>Jeffs. Upwards of three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live last Christmas and January?</p>
               <p>Jeffs. I cannot say where he came from when he came to Mill-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live there?</p>
               <p>Jeffs. Till last Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Till he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Jeffs. One Sanders took the house for his brother of Mr. Poole; I had the key left at my house.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner live?</p>
               <p>Jeffs. At No. 3, Mill-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he leave the house?</p>
               <p>Jeffs. He never left the house to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. He is in Newgate now; did he live there home to the time of his being taken up?</p>
               <p>Jeffs. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a lodger in the house or was it his house as you understood?</p>
               <p>Jeffs. I took him to be the occupier?</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any lodgers in the house?</p>
               <p>Jeffs. Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you going to say of Sanders?</p>
               <p>Jeffs. He was the man that took the house, and said he took it for his brother.</p>
               <p>Court. Who came into it?</p>
               <p>Jeffs. Piddock, and occupied the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the occupier of the house when it was searched?</p>
               <p>Jeffs. Piddock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>As to this Groves he says he bought things of me; it is something very extraordinary that he should throw them away, why did he not bring them to the Court and bring something against me? as to Bellamore, I never saw him in my life or ever had any connections or dealings with him, nor with Groves any farther than buying a pound of tea or so of his master, and I can bring people into court to prove these things are not mine. I was not an inhabitant of the house but a lodger, and these things were not mine, and I hope I shall satisfy the Court and Jury it is so. Mr. Jeffs knows I am not the proprietor of it, that Mr. Sanders lived in the house and worked in it every day.</p>

               <p>Q. Are these your receipts (producing them)?</p>
               <p>Poole. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you let that house?</p>
               <p>Poole. Mr. Sanders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he occupy the house?</p>
               <p>Poole. I suppose so, I do not know; he always came to my house and paid me the rent regularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go to the house and happen to know who lived in it?</p>
               <p>Poole. I have been to the house several times and have always seen Mr. Sanders except once, then he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. For what time, for the last three quarters of a year?</p>
               <p>Poole. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner there?</p>
               <p>Poole. I cannot recollect that ever I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known Sanders before ever you let this house to him?</p>
               <p>Poole. Not a day before.</p>
               <p>Q. What rent is the house let at?</p>
               <p>Poole. Sixteen pound a year beside the water rent.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you let a house to a man without knowing any thing about him or for what use it was intended?</p>
               <p>Poole. He told me he was a gun-smith, and he and his brother were to live together in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. That was all the knowledge you had of him?</p>
               <p>Poole. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon that small narration of Sanders did you let him the house?</p>
               <p>Poole. Yes; if I recollect right I enquired his character and they told me he was an honest man; I believe I spoke to Mr. Jeff.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170050"></xptr>Q. Was it Sanders or Sanderson? because one of your receipts is to Sanders, the other to Sanderson; to which of these two men did you let it?</p>
               <p>Poole. I have an agreement.</p>
               <p>Q. But answer that first.</p>
               <p>Poole. One is a mistake; I can refer to that only by the agreement which I have at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you frequently saw this Mr. Sanders at any other time by paying you rent?</p>
               <p>Poole. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him again if you see him?</p>
               <p>Poole. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that man at the bar the Sanders or Sanderson?</p>
               <p>Poole. No</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before?</p>
               <p>Poole. I may have done it but I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. And whether Sanders or Sanderson lived in the house you do not know?</p>
               <p>Poole. I have seen him in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe so, because there was a partner with him I believe, did he take it for himself or who?</p>
               <p>Poole. For himself and his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the name of his brother?</p>
               <p>Poole. No.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. You say upon your oath that you let it to a Sanders by agreement, and received your rent so late as January last of Sanders?</p>
               <p>Poole. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Poole. In Queen-street, Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you go to this house after you let it?</p>
               <p>Poole. After quarter day I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to collect the rent, or is it brought to you?</p>
               <p>Poole. I went to collect the rent; the first time I went Sanders told me he would call upon me, and came and paid it at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the two last times he came to your house?</p>
               <p>Poole. I went to his house to collect the money; he said it was not suitable to him then, and he called upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. He came to you to pay it afterwards?</p>
               <p>Poole. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you had this bit of old brass in your hand too?</p>

               <p>Eversley. No; he helped me in the gun trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Since you had nothing to do in Sanders's shop, and this tool was found there, how came you to think of taking this tool up and breaking it up or destroying it?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I had no business there.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no business there?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I did not know it was of any use.</p>
               <p>Q. Use or not use what business had you to go into Sanders's shop to take up this thing; this bit of old brass as we will imagine it to be; what business had you to go into his shop and break up this piece of old brass?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I did not know it would be any injury to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he tell you it was?</p>
               <p>Eversley. He did not tell me that it was of any use, only he said it belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why you did not want to be informed of that, you knew it was in Sanders's shop; did not you know all that was in the shop was Sanders's, and you had nothing to do with it; it was in Sanders's shop, was it not?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it up imagining it not to be Sanders's?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I did not think it would be of any hurt; I did not think it would be of any great injury.</p>
               <p>Q. You did think it to be Sanders's when you meant to break it up?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Thinking it to be Sanders's, and taking it out of Sanders's shop, you did think to break it up, and why did not you break it up, why because you was told then just as much as you knew before, and neither more or less, that it was Sanders's: now scratch your head and at it again, tell me?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I cannot tell you any more than I did tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood it to be Sanders's and meant to break it up, and afterwards did not break it up because you understood it to be Sanders's?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I brought it in to him and he told me it was Sanders's.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you break it up?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Because he said it was Sanders's.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you find a use for it?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I could tell you a use but it would cost you your neck.</p>
               <p>Eversley. I do not desire to make that use of it.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. You say upon your oath Sanders worked in the back garret, and the prisoner and you in the fore garret, and these things here belonged to Sanders, and you did not work in that garret, and that these and the other things are the property of Sanders who worked as a silver-smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoner and you in full business there?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes; I worked for the office of ordnance seventeen years.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner worked in the fore garret with you?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. What is become of Sanders?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you worked in this house?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Ever since last Michaelmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the occupation of the house when you first came to work there?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Sanders belonged to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there before you came, or did he come with you, or after you?</p>
               <p>Eversley. He was there when I came.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you found him and Sanders there both?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to come there, did you lodge there?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did you lodge in?</p>
               <p>Eversley. In the back chamber.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170052"></xptr>Q. Under the back garret?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did the prisoner lodge in?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Not in the house at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What other person did lodge in the house?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No body else.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Sanders's brother?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Sanders's brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you any relation of him?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any such person as his brother?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure respecting the piece of brass where you first saw it?</p>
               <p>Eversley. In the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Sanders in the room when you first saw it or not?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What he used to leave his room door open to go in and out when you pleased?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you never saw him work in your life?</p>
               <p>Eversley. No.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I lodge at the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you lodge there now?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I go backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Eversley. I lodge there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lie there last?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Last night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your landlord?</p>
               <p>Eversley. Why the prisoner at the bar; he rented two rooms and let me one.</p>

               <p>Veritas Humphreys. I have known the prisoner sixteen or seventeen years: he files brass, works the furniture for guns; we call him a labourer to assist the gun-makers; he has worked with me nine or ten years; he lodged next door to me; I never knew a better man in my life; he has been in my house when he might have robbed me, and I declare I believe him to be as honest a man as ever broke bread; I never heard any other character of him.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. When you say that ever broke bread, do you mean to say any more than this, that he has never wronged you, and you have no reason to doubt his character?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I never heard a tittle against his character.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of where he has worked for the last six months?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. At the top of a place called Mill-yard; I have called there once or twice as I was going by, and have told him I had little jobs, as I could; our business has been very stack since the war; being so I have not employed him much this three months; but I do a little now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this in the town way of milling?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I know no use of this more than the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not for making molds I take it?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I know nothing of the use of it.</p>

On the night of the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of March the prisoner accosted me in the Hampstead-road—she asked for drink—I said I would have nothing to do with her, and I had nothing to give her—soon after I met a policeman I knew, and asked him to take something to drink, and got into conversation with him—I met the prisoner again—she persuaded me to give her something to drink, and I did, out of that which I gave the policeman—this was in the street—I never saw her before—I then took the cup into the public-house, and wished the policeman good night—when I came out, the prisoner was waiting, and followed me some distance-shortly after she left me, and within five minutes I missed my watch—I went back, and informed the policeman, and within the hour he found her in Mary-street, Hampstead-road—she said she had not seen the watch, and in the meantime it dropped from her person—this is it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter.</hi>) I am a trunk-maker, and live in the Strand—I have lived there six months. The pri<lb></lb>soner was in my service from the end of June to the 29th of December, when he left—I had found him at Boulogne, and he offered his services—I took him, not knowing the English language myself—he slept and boarded in my house—he had all he wanted, but no fixed wages—he went away between three and four o'clock on the 29th of December—I did not know he was going—I was in the water-closet when he left—I had been about five minutes without seeing him—when I returned to the shop, I was very much surprised at seeing the parlour cupboard open, which had been locked before, and I had the key in my pocket—the lock was not broken—Ido not know how it had been opened—the prisoner was gone, and I missed my box, containing the money and articles stated, which are worth about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not recovered any thing but the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-note, and twelve sovereigns—I saw the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-note six or seven days afterwards—the name of Barclay was on it when I missed it—when I saw it again there was another name on it, which was not there before—the note now produced is it—it has the name of Barclay on it, which I mentioned before it was found, and here is the other name on it, which I think is in the prisoner's hand-writing—I have seen him write a great many times, and believe it to be his—about a week after the robbery I found the prisoner at Ports<lb></lb>mouth, in custody—the day before the prisoner went away, I surprised him just in the act of opening the box—I took it from him, and searched him, but he had nothing on him—the box was open in his hand—an hour before he left I opened the box to take a sovereign out, and found every thing safe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police at Portsmouth. I saw the prisoner there on Sunday evening, the 3rd of January, about half-past seven o'clock, in the High-street, on horseback, very much intoxicated—Ihad him taken to the station—in about a quarter of an hour I questioned him at the station—he was able to answer—I asked who he was—he said, a gentleman lodging at the Fountain inn—I told him to take his gloves off, and his hands appeared like those of a working man—I said be had not been long a gentleman, and asked what he had about him—he said he had some silver—I found 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in his waistcoat pocket—he said that was all the money he had—I made further search, and in the fob of his trowsers found twelve sovereigns, wrapped up in two separate pieces of paper, seven in one and five in another—I locked him up for some hours, and I saw something in the "Hue and Cry"—when he was sober I took him out of the cell, and asked his name—he said, "Charles Bright"—I asked where he came from—he said, "From Brighton"—I asked his busi<lb></lb>ness—hesaid he was a saddle and portmanteau maker—I asked who he worked for—he said, for Mr. Rosseaux, of Brighton—I asked what street Mr. Rosseaux lived in—he said, the main street, called High-street—I asked if he knew Mr. Rosseaux, of the Strand, London—he said, "Yes"—Isaid, "Did you ever work for him?"—he said, "I worked for him about two years ago, but not since"—I took all his clothes off, and he asked if I was searching for Bank-notes—I said, "Yes"—I asked if he knew any thing of Mr. Rosseaux's property—he said no, he did not—I asked how he came in possession of these sovereigns—he said he had had some words with Mr. Rosseaux on Sunday, the 27th, and left him, and going up Oxford-street late on Saturday night he picked up twenty sove<lb></lb>reigns, wrapped in the corner of a handkerchief—I went to No. 20 and No. 24, Mark-lane, and there was no such person as Albertis living at either numbers.</p>

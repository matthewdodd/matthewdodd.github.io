            . Between two and three in the morning of the 10th of July, I was called down; there was an alarm at the door; two or three persons had seized the prisoner; they told me they took him in a barn; I asked the man why when the girl cried out, as he said, he did not go to assist her; he said because the man swore if there came any body to assist her he would rip him up, and he had a drawn knife in his hand; I asked him how he knew that; he said because the girl mentioned something of it in her crying out.</p>

            , he got up into the hay lost, and said there was some straw to lie upon; he said come up here and lie down; I got up; I was feeling about upon my hands and knees; I could not see where he lay; I was afraid to feel upon my legs for fear of hurting myself; I clapped my hands upon a woman's gown; I said here is a woman; she made answer and said if I lie down with one man, I will not with two or three; I lay down at some distance from them; the girl made answer and said no man shall be concerned with me except he pay me for it; he said what do you want; said she sixpence, and whether he gave her sixpence or threepence that she said she lost I cannot tell; I never spoke another word till they took me.</p>

            , the prisoner; and another man.</p>
               <p>Watson. I never heard the other man nor saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know he was there?</p>
               <p>Watson. No, I don't know he was.</p>
               <p>Q. to Fielder. Who told you that there was another man?</p>
               <p>Fielder. The two witnesses that came to call the beadle up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were they?</p>
               <p>Fielder. I never saw them before nor since; they were two country girls that go gathering pease in the summer time for farmers; we found a hat there that nobody owned.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutrix. Did you ever see the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Fry. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him till after this matter was over?</p>
               <p>Fry. No, it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you of?</p>
               <p>Fry. I work in the gardens gathering pease.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been there?</p>
               <p>Fry. Ten or eleven weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do your relations live?</p>
               <p>Fry. In Hampshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you sent to them upon this occasion?</p>
               <p>Fry. I have only one sister in Hampshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body appear here to give any account of you?</p>
               <p>Fry. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. As this was done in the dark and you could not see this man, how do you know it was this man as there were two of them?</p>
               <p>Fry. Because the man was at the end of the barn with me all the time; when he heard the people coming he got from me, it was then peep of day.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you venture to swear it was not another man?</p>
               <p>Fry. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I asked you just now and you said you never saw the man till this matter was over?</p>
               <p>Fry. Not till they brought him into the yard; I am sure there was none but him.</p>

               <p>Q. Well but who did the hat belong to?</p>
               <p>Fry. I did not see the hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never wronged man, woman, nor child of a pin or pins point in my life; I was asked if the man was gone off; I said yes, I dare say he committed the affair, I must suffer for; she knew the man was in the place, before I came; in he was a broad side of her.</p>

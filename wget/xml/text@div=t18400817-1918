ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you go into Mr. Cox's service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In 1836—I continued in it till 1839—I was not out of his service any time, that I am quite sure of—the defendent was not in his service in any way from the time he left till after February—he used to come backwards and forwards—I do not know what he came for—I do not know that he collected debts and things for him—he was not there all day as I was—I cannot tell whether he was not employed as an occasional on-and-off servant—I left Mr. Curlewis in consequence of a quarrel about some clothes going home—it was not about any thing else—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some duplicates</hi>)—I know these duplicates, they belong to me—I gave them up to Mr. Curlewis—most of them are for my own things, some are for things of his, which I pawned without his leave—I sometimes took things to the pawnbrokers for him, but not these, these I pawned for myself, and kept the money—here are eleven duplicates of things which I pawned of his from July, 1839, to January, 1840—I was not in Mr. Cur<lb></lb>lewis's service then, but I used to go backwards and forwards, and do about for him—I never could get any thing for doing it, I was obliged to take the things, no one advised me to do so—Hindmarsh did not know of my doing it—I believe what I pawned amounts to rather more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was with Mr. Curlewis three years, and if he had paid me in an honourable sort of manner it would not have occurred—I can blame him for it—he does not owe me any thing by agreement, but he does by right—I had no regular salary—I used not to be paid for two or three weeks sometimes—I went to him by my father's wish, and he paid me what he pleased—there was no agreement—I had been there three years when I took these things, and when I left him he employed me to go to different places for him—these other duplicates are for things of my own—I some<lb></lb>times pledged in one name and sometimes in another, but I generally gave the name of Wright I believe, that is my brother-in-law's name—I was subpoenaed in the cause at Westminster, and attended, but was not called on—I do not remember going to a Mr. Pinch in February, 1839—I do not remember the defendant employing me to go there—I was looking after him by Mr. Curlewis's instructions—the defendant said he had found some clue to him—he interested himself about Mr. Curlewis's business the same as I did—I am quite sure when Mr. Cox came out of the little room that I saw notes in his hand—there seemed more than one note to me, but I did not take particular notice—they were Bank notes—Mr. Cox held the door open, and Mr. Curlewis called out to Way—4 do not know what he did with the notes—he came out, and went away with the notes in his hand.</p>

               <p>and found they were not gone, he accused me of neglect, and said I might go there, and then if I liked, and I did—I had no regular wages when I first went there—my father worked there at the time—I pawned these things as I was in want of money—three or four weeks before I left, Mr. Cur<lb></lb>lewis said I was to have my board and lodging, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and if I behaved myself I was to have more—he paid me once or twice, but I never could get it regular—he knew I had no other means of living, but by my wages—I applied to him from time to time for my wages—I can<lb></lb>not exactly say whether Mr. Curlewis was in good or indifferent circum<lb></lb>stances—when he spoke to me about these things, I told him where I had pawned them, and gave him the tickets, and the tickets of my own as well, so that he might see how I lived, and I have never been able to get my own tickets since—I was not in the habit of going to job for him after I gave him the tickets—he sent for me once or twice afterwards about the trial at the Queen's Bench—I think that was some time in February last.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Curlewis, and have been so about two years and a half. I have seen Mr. Cox call there several times—I believe I was not present when the money was lent—I sit at a raised desk in the cutting-room—I believe I saw Mr. Cox there about the 2nd of February—I did not see him in the little room when Gordon was called there—I have seen Gurdon come out of that little room many times—I do not remember any particular day—I did not on any day in February make a memorandum of any transaction between Mr. Cox and Mr. Cur<lb></lb>lewis—Mr. Cox never came to me to desire me to make a memorandum in the presence of Mr. Curlewis—I never drew out any paper which Mr. Cox signed—I have seen a paper, but I never drew it out—the whole of it is in Mr. Curlewis's hand-writing, except the signature—I remember the action being tried at Westminster—I was subpoenaed as a witness by Mr. Cox's attorney—I was in Court the whole time, but I was not called—I believe Mr. Cox was in Court the whole time—I saw him part of the time—the defendant was in Mr. Curlewis's employ from the end of November up to the 11th of March—he was in the habit of coming backwards and</p>

Gentlemen,—I have received a letter from Mr. Curlewis, who has an account against your client, Mr. Thomas Cox, amounting to some-where about 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; for the difference of the amount he is willing to hand you a small bill, of about the same amount, which has two months to run.

Dangerfield to Mr. Curlewis before I wrote this letter—I think Mr. Curlewis showed it to me, no, I received the letter during his absence, and called down there in consequence, and saw Mr. Dangerfield's clerk—I think Mr. Curlewis may have seen that letter before I wrote this answer—I certainly think he had, I should say I have no doubt about it—he was in London when he saw their first letter—that was some time previous, I cannot recollect how long—I do not suppose they were very long in taking their proceedings—I know in consequence of the first letter I called on them—I should say it was a week before I wrote this letter—I do not remember the date—I cannot</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With respect to your being in possession, was there an officer of the Sheriff in possession before you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the warrant I held possession by was delivered to me by the officer—Mr. Curlewis was aware he was handing me the warrant, and the creditor was aware also—it was done to save expense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who was the creditor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember—I know he was aware of it, because the officer would not have given me the warrant without—Vallance was the name of the attorney, and, I think, Hammond was the name of the creditor—the officer used to call sometimes to see that I was there—no one made any complaint about my being there—I conclude the debt was paid, for the warrant was afterwards given up—the attorney in that proceeding had done business for Mr. Curlewis—if his father was a creditor on either of those occasions, his name did not appear.</p>

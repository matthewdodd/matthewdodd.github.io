            . I live behind Hide-park-corner. I deal in liquor with Mr. Threadgold, and keep a tap-house in the field. On Saturday about six in the evening, when I was paying my men, the prisoner brings the gin in that I had ordered in the forenoon; I said, have you brought the receipt? He said, no, I have not; said I, then I shall not pay you. He came on Monday morning about eight o'clock; said I, what do you want? we do not want any liquor: Said he, my mistress has sent the receipt; he shewed it me, and I gave him half a guinea and four pennyworth of half pence ; that was for the five gallons he had brought without a receipt; he called for a quartern of gin, and I drank one glass along with him.</p>

               <p>Q. to Threadgold . The receipt is put into his hand. Is that your brother's writing?</p>
               <p>Threadgold. No it is not his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose writing do you think it is?</p>
               <p>Threadgold. I take it to be the prisoner at the bar's</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence . My master and I went out with some liquor, and he sent me back again: This Hancock had been at my master's. My mistress called my master's brother down to write a receipt, but he would not come down; she said, Thomas, do you write it. I asked her if I should write it in my master's name; she said, yes. She stood over me when I wrote it on the counter. I went with it to Mr. Hancock's according to my master's orders on Sunday; they did not want liquor; said he, have you got the bill? I said, yes; so he paid the 10 s. 10 d.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the money afterwards?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had spent some of it; so I was afraid to come home.</p>
               <p>Q. to Threadgold. Did your wife order the prisoner to write a bill and a receipt?</p>
               <p>Threadgold. She ordered him to write a bill of parcels but not a receipt.</p>

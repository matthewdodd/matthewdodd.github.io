                  </hi>. I am housemaid to Mr. John Hollams, Paragon House, Blackheath—on the night of 21st July, about 9.45, I was in Mr. Hollam's dressing-room, preparing a bath—I heard footsteps in the next room—there was a candle in the next room—I looked up and saw a man near the dressing-room door—he turned round, and I followed him, and then heard him jump from the window—I believe the prisoner is the man—I called the gardener, and he went in pursuit—when he was brought back, I recognized him as the man—I had seen him in the bedroom—he could have got in at the bedroom window; it was open.</p>

I am gardener to Mr. Hollams—on 21st July, I was on| the stairs, and heard the last witness call out—I went up stairs—from what she told me I went out—I met a young man outside who accompanied me—after going a short distance, we met the prisoner coming towards us—I asked him where he had come from; he made no answer—I asked him again, and he said, "What's that to do with you"—I then told him he must come back with me—he said he had been on the heath, and was going to the station—when we met him he was going away from the station—he came back with me, and I gave him in charge—Mary Ann Tolley identified him at once as the man she had seen in the bedroom.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stable lad, in the service of Mr. Rigby—about 9.45 on 21st July, 1 was standing opposite Mr. Hollam's house—I saw a man come out of a window over the street door of Mr. Hollam's house—I was about five yards from him—I asked him what he did there, and he said, "That is a pretty flower"—he walked a few yards down the road, and then ran—I saw the gardener come out, and we went after the man—to the best of my belief, the prisoner is the man who came out of the window, but I can't swear to him—I was with the gardener when he spoke to him—he had a hat on similar to the one the man had who jumped out of the window.</p>

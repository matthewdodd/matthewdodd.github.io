On the 21st of April I was from home - I was sent for, and found the prisoner in custody with these things, which I had left safe in the morning in my bed-room up three pairs of stairs; the street door is open in the day time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you carry on business in the house? A. No; a solicitor occupies the lower part of the house - I know nobody named Jones lodging near there; I do not think there are any lodging-houses about there; I should think the prisoner was drunk, and did not well know what she was about - I have heard she had been seeing a friend into the country, and that she has six children, and was never suspected before.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Jacks. About a quarter to three o'clock I was going up stairs, and observed his bed-room door on the third floor open; I am the only servant in the house - I know that the door was shut before, and Mr. Jacks' clothes were hanging on pegs in the closet; the handkerchiefs were in a bag in the same closet - they were all safe when I left the bed-room; I went in, and observed the prisoner rolling up these things - she had got them out of the closet - I asked what she did there; she replied that she wanted Mr. Jones - I said no such person lived there; and she said it was quite a mistake; I know no Mr. Jones - I asked what she did with the clothes - she again said it was quite a mistake; I detained her, and sent for my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she seem to know what she was about? A. I cannot say whether she was tipsy; I do not think she could be sober - she did not seem right down tipsy, so as not to know what she was doing; there were no drawers in the room - there are boxes.</p>
               <p>MR. JACKS. There was a wash-hand-stand with drawers under it, a dressing-case, and trunk.</p>

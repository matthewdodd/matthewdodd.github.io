                  </hi> I live in Essex. On 1st March I had fourteen sacks of flour at my residence—they were placed eight in one cart and six in another—the eight were in the prisoner's cart—they were to be taken to Phœnix-wharf, Kingston—I employed two carts to take them to Stratford—one cart was driven by the prisoner—the sacks had been weighed—they weighed 280lbs—I had a complaint afterwards that they were not full weight.</p>

                  </hi> I am foreman to Mr. Jenner, of Phœnix-wharf, London-bridge. On 2nd March the prisoner brought eight sacks of flour to the wharf—he gave me sixpence, and said, "I shall always give you that when I come now"—he said I was to buy a drop of beer with it—that raised my suspicion, and I weighed the flour—the first sack was 29<hi rend="italic">lbs</hi> short—I took the sixpence back to him before weighing any more, and told him not to bring me money to take short weight—the next sack was 58<hi rend="italic">lbs</hi> and the next 22<hi rend="italic">lbs</hi> short—the other four were quite right—when I said the weight was short, he said, "I do not wish you to say anything about it"—I said, "I shall give your master an account of what is short, you must make it right with him."</p>

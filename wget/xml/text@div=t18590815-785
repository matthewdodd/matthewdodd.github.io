I am the wife of Joseph Smith, of Rifle-terrace, Bayswater—I keep a boarding-house there—the deceased lady, Miss Isabella Bankes, became an inmate of that boarding-house on the 20th September last year—the prisoner and his wife were inmates there at that time, and had been so for some time, at different times; the last time for about five months—Mrs. Smethurst was, I should think, twenty years older than the prisoner-after Miss Bankes became an inmate of my house I noticed some familiarities that I thought were improper between the prisoner and her—in consequence of that I desired Miss Bankes to leave my house—I heard her tell the prisoner that I had given her notice—I told him why; he said he was very sorry that I had pained her mind, that if I had named it to him he would have taken care I should not have been annoyed—I still persisted in my desire that she should leave the house; and the prisoner said that he should go away himself—Miss Bankes left my house on 29th November, the prisoner left on 12th December—he said he was going to visit a friend, he did not say where he was going—he left his wife behind him in the house—after he had left he returned to his wife, I am not certain how soon after, but I should think about a fortnight—I don't think he stayed any time; he slept there once, but I was not aware of it until afterwards—he came several times.</p>

I live with my mother at Richmond—in February last Mrs. Smethurst and the prisoner came to my mother's house—I used to wait on them; when anything was brought to the door for Mrs. Smethurst I used always to take it in, if my mother was not there—medicine used to come sometimes from Dr. Julius—if I took it in I placed it on the dining-room table—after Mrs. Smethurst became ill she had her breakfast in the bedroom, I think before she got up—I took her breakfast into the dining-room, and placed it on the table—after she had had her breakfast the things were generally brought into the dining-room; I think by Dr. Smethurst—they were taken from the parlour, where I left them, into the bedroom—I took them down afterwards—after she became ill she generally took tea for breakfast of a morning, when she could take it—the tea was not poured out before it was taken up—I took up the kettle—the bedroom was on the same floor—in the course of the day I used to take the arrow-root into the dining-room—sometimes Mrs. Smethurst was there, and sometime in her bedroom; sometimes she was in bed, sometimes sitting up—I used not to leave the food in the dining-room—I recollect taking an egg to Mrs. Smethurst on the morning on which she left; I gave it to her; she ate it, and said she enjoyed it very much—I saw that she was sick some time after she had eaten the egg—it may have been two hours perhaps—I had not taken anything to her room in the meantime, after the egg and before she was sick.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Wheatley, and live at 10, Alma-villas, Richmond; I was living there in the month of April last—I let lodgings—I recollect the prisoner, Dr. Smethurst, engaging lodg<lb></lb>ings at my house on the 15th April; he came on that day with a lady he called Mrs. Smethurst—they came in a cab; they engaged two rooms, a sitting-room on the ground floor, and a bedroom over that; those were the only lodgings I had to let in the house—Mrs. Smethurst appeared to be in a very delicate state of health at that time; she was hardly able to walk; she went to bed very soon after she got up stairs—from the time she remained in our house till her death, she came down into the sitting-room about four times, in the way of having her bed made, and to purify the room—as soon as she came to me, Dr. Julius or Mr. Bird attended her every day—after she had been with me a day or two, Dr. Bird came in place of Dr. Julius—I used not to wait on her; Dr. Smethurst waited on her—I pre<lb></lb>pared her food down stairs; then I either took it to the dining-room, to Dr. Smethurst, or sometimes I have taken it to the bedroom-door; once or twice—when the food had been taken, Dr. Smethurst generally put the things outside the door, on a box in the passage—medicine was brought from the surgery of Dr. Julius for Mrs. Smethurst to take; when I took it in, I either took it into the dining-room to Dr. Smethurst, or to the bed-room-door, and he took it from me there—when there were any evacuations to throw away I took them from the landing—Dr. Smethurst placed them outside on the landing himself.</p>

               <p>a trifle easier. I shall look most anxiously forward to a note on Friday morning. To hear of your gradual improvement will be a source of the greatest comfort to me, although I feel most grateful that you have such a tender and kind nurse. To say nothing about the Doctor's commendable patience, his countenance bespeaks amiability of disposition, and he must have the greatest anxiety for your speedy recovery. We must hope that you will be better than ever when this severe indisposition has passed away. The air is so pure and fresh that I hope all is in your favour. I quite enjoyed a sniff of the country, and got home very comfortably. Was quite beset with inquiries respecting you by Mr. and Mrs. Rigge. If there is anything I can make you fancy, let me hear through the Doctor: you shall have it at once. I shall run down and see you when quite agreeable; and rest assured I shall be perfectly silent about everything that concerns you. To-day I am going to purchase a little hat as a present for Rhoda's 'little Bee,' but having no bairns of my own, I am quite a novice in such matters. And now, God bless you, dearest, and with best remembrances to the Doctor, and affectionate love to your dear self, ever your own fond Loo.") This is the answer I received to that letter (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "10 Alma-villas, 21st April, 1859. My dear Miss Bankes,—We are in receipt of yours of yesterday's date, for which we are greatly obliged. After your departure dear Bella had a very bad evening and night of it, purely from the excitement of seeing you, and the fatigue consequent thereon. Vomiting and purging set in at a fearful rate, which of course prostrated her greatly. Her doctor therefore at once forbade any visitors for the present, or he would not be responsible for the effects attendant thereon. Last night was a good one, but I am sorry to say to-day has been a trying one. She is now, however, again better, and I am happy to say recovery is really expected by all. I will write again shortly. Dearest Bella sends her kindest love, and with kindest regards, believe me, yours faithfully, T. Smethurst.") On 23d April I sent her a jelly—I did not send any letter with it, I sent it by post, before I sent the jelly; this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Friday afternoon, 22d April, 1859. Dear Doctor, the jelly I shall forward by omnibus to-morrow, Saturday afternoon. If you will kindly send for it, I will direct it to you, and order the same to be left where the omnibus goes to. I sincerely hope the dear invalid is better: I am so anxious about her, poor darling. What do you think to Mr. Lane seeing her; it might be managed with ease, and I am sure you would feel pleased to have his opinion, being a very clever and experienced man. Best love to my own darling sister, and kind regards to yourself. Ever sincerely yours, Loo. Excuse great haste. I could make any arrange<lb></lb>ment with Mr. Lane you thought fit, and he need not know circumstances.") I think I sent this piece of paper inside that (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "These are for you, my own darling Bell. I am anxiously looking forward to to-morrow's post, and sincerely hope and pray you are going on favourably. I am preparing a little nice jelly for you, dear, and shall come down and take a peep at you, with the Doctor's consent, on Saturday or Monday, which I hope will be agreeable to you both. Prepare nothing, or I shall not like to come again.') Before I could pay that visit I received this letter from Dr. Smethurst (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "23d April, 1859. My dear Miss Bankes, Bella's dearest love and best thanks for your kind attention, in which I most cordially unite. She has not yet got over the emotion of meeting you, poor dear, and is still looking forward to a very early interview; indeed, she would like to name Monday next for your taking a chop with me," but I think it would be more advisable to say the middle of next week, for the doctors even this morning have pro<lb></lb>hibited</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150101"></xptr>
               <p>everything of a nature which might try her very weak powers, since it would be impossible to bear up against shocks to the nervous system; and on these grounds alone she is ordered to keep her room, in order to treasure up strength. The aspect of affaire is favourable if great care be observed, and we three doctors have every hope of a successful termination. I shall not fail to call for the jelly. I purchased some very beautiful yesterday, and dearest Bell has partaken of two or three glasses of it, and I think with benefit. Dearest Bell says she would rather not see uncle Lane; however, we will talk this matter over at our next meeting. With every kind wish, in which dearest Bell unites, believe me, yours faithfully, T. Smethurst.") In conse<lb></lb>quence of these letters, I abstained from going down—I received another letter, dated 27th April—this is it(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Wednesday afternoon, 27th April, 1859. My dear Miss Bankes,—Dearest Bella requests me to thank you kindly for the jelly. Poor thing, she tries her very best to eat it; it is, however, I imagine, too sweet for her taste, especially so now, with constant nausea. Sometimes it is retained on the stomach, at others it is speedily vomited. I obtained some from town, which is not so sweet; but this she puts aside for yours. I very much regret to say she has not once properly rallied since seeing you. Her nervous energy must be very low indeed, or this would not have happened. Still we have every hope of a good recovery. To-day I have insisted on having a consultation with Dr. Todd, of King's College Hospital, the first physician of the day, with her two regular medical attendants, who are also the first doctors in this town. She is still ordered quietude, and all visitors to be excluded for the present; therefore dearest Bella begs of you to wait a little longer than was anticipated before calling here. As soon as I have got Dr. Todd's opinion, I will send you a few lines on the subject. With our united love, believe me, yours faithfully, T. Smethurst. P.S. Dearest Bella always reads your letters before sending. T. S.") On the 29th I received another letter(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "29th April, 1859. My dear Miss Bankes,—We saw Dr. Todd from London last evening, as late as 10 o'clock, in consultation with Dr. Julius, of Richmond, one of dear Bella's daily medical attendants. He not only acquiesces in what is being done, but recommends a perseverance in the treatment, with some slight addition of his own prescribing, and entertains favourable hopes, like the rest of us. The bilious vomitings are entirely arrested, but sickness still prevails to a great extent, with occasionally violent retchings, which almost shake her very life out of her; and the bowels continue to act from 8 to 10 times in the 24 hours, in spite of all we can do. This action is very different from what is usually called diarrhoea, and is the result of impacted bowels and congested liver, which must have existed for a very long period, judging from the amount of filth which has passed. I am sorry to say there is no appetite, and that is the only thing which raises a fear in my mind; for how nutrition is to be obtained equal to the expenditure of loss of strength under the circumstances does, I confess, somewhat puzzle me. Nevertheless, there are still good and improving points in her, which I sincerely hope may be the means of creating a rallying point from which we trust to build our hopes upon. I much regret the state of the case will not yet admit of even your seeing her for the present, since any or the least anxiety only tends to debilitate her nervous system. We both, however, anticipate very shortly seeing you here. Dearest Bella sends her kindest love and best wishes, in which I beg to unite, and believe me, yours ever faithfully, T. Smethurst.") I wrote a letter upon that, and I got this letter from him late on Saturday evening (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "30th April, 1859. My dear Miss Bankes,—In reply to your</p>

               <p>favour of yesterday's date, I am exceedingly sorry to say dear Bella has passed a wretched bad night—passed 15 motions in the 24 hours, and of a very bad description: there is now much blood in the stools, and besides which there is an entire loss of appetite, consequently I have great dread for the result. She read your kind letter, and agrees with me that it would be better that you should be near to us; so that if you will run down as early as convenient, you can then take a room or rooms near at hand. It will indeed be a source of comfort to me to have you with us. I much regret there is no accommodation in this house for you, as we occupy all there is to let, and have not room enough for ourselves. Dearest Bella sends her kindest love, and with every good wish, believe me, yours faithfully, T. Smethurst. P.S. There was no wish on my part to prevent you calling, beyond the consideration for the critical state of dearest Bella, in which her medical attendants perfectly united. She has never rallied once since seeing you, and that alone was the reason for keeping her quiet. T. S.") On the receipt of that letter I did not go down until the Sunday, the following morning—I got down between 2 and 3 o'clock—I saw the prisoner—nothing was said to me about my sister's having made a will that morning—he did not take me up to see her at once—he said she was very ill—I had been to church, and came down after the morning service—I went up a few minutes after I got in—I found her in a very bad state indeed—she recog<lb></lb>nised me—she held out her hand—she could not speak—I only remained in the bedroom a few minutes—not alone, Dr. Smethurst was there—I then went down stairs—he asked me to come down—I did not go up again for some time after—he did not remain with me while I was down stairs—he went up stairs, leaving me downstairs—he gave no reason for that—he said she was too ill to bear me in the room—I had brought down some soup with me in a jelly, that was when I went up the first time—I gave it to the prisoner—he took two teaspoonfuls from it, put some warm water to it, and took it outside the room to cool it—he said he took it out of the room to cool—he was out of the room with it a minute or two—I could not see him when he was out of the room; I could hear him stirring it round—when he brought it back he gave it to my sister, and she brought it up immediately—I only saw my sister once afterwards that day—I remained with her a very short time indeed the second time; I left her because she was so ill the Doctor said I had better not remain in the room—he took me down stairs, and then he returned to the room—I don't think she took any arrowroot in my presence—nothing else was given in my presence that I remember—I recollect writing some letters there, which I wanted to have posted—I told the prisoner I wanted them posted, and he said I must take them, as he could not send any one out with them—I took them, and returned again—during the day he called my attention to the effect of Dr. Todd's pills; he said that they had made my sister much worse; he described the effect as a burning sensation all over the body—about 11 o'clock I proposed to Dr. Smethurst that I should remain all night with my sister; he said he would rather not; he would wait on her himself—I had taken a room at a cottage near, and an arrangement was made that I should attend at half-past 9 the following morning—the reason he gave for my not coming earlier was, that he should wish to prepare the room before I came—I came at that time on the Monday morning—when I got there, the prisoner came down stairs to meet me; and while I was there Dr. Julius came in—a conversation took place be<lb></lb>tween the prisoner and Dr. Julius about some fresh medicine—Dr. Smethurst wished to try something else—he wished me to go and fetch it—that was</p>

I am a solicitor at Richmond—on Satur<lb></lb>day, 30th April, the prisoner came to my office, I believe in the afternoon, about 1 or 2 o'clock—he was a perfect stranger to me—he asked me if I could come up the hill, to make a will for a lady; she was too ill to come to the office—I said I would; I would go directly—he said, "No; not to-day, to-morrow"—I said, "Monday, you mean?"—he said, "No; I mean to<lb></lb>morrow, Sunday"—I told him I had an objection to doing anything on a Sunday; but he said if it was a work of necessity, would I come; and I said I would—it was arranged that he was to fetch me if there was a necessity—he said the will would be very short, and he then produced this paper, which he said was sent to him by a barrister, a friend of his in London—he said that the lady wished to write it out herself, but he thought it better that a professional man should do it—I just looked at it, and handed it back to him—about 9 o'clock the following morning, he came to my private house—he asked me if I could come immediately; at least, he said, "Come about 10 o'clock"—he said the medical men were coming at half-past 10, and he wished it all done before they came—I said I would come—I had asked him that the medical man might be present; but he said there was no occasion for that, as the lady was perfectly right in her mind, and was suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting—I went at half-past 10—I was shown into the parlour—the prisoner was there; in fact, he met me at the door, and asked me to walk in; and he then said he thought it better to tell me, before I went upstairs, that, although he and the lady were living as man and wife, they were not married, and he said that was the reason why he did not wish the medical man to be present—he said, as soon as she was better, and her Chancery affairs were settled, they were going to leave Richmond to be pri<lb></lb>vately married, and return and settle there—after that I went up stairs; he accompanied me—I went into a bedroom over the room where we had this conversation—I found a lady in bed there—he walked into the room before me, and introduced me to her, saying, "My dear, this is the gentleman who has come to make your will"—she did not say anything; she merely bowed—I went towards her, and she handed me this paper from under her pillow; I immediately recognised it as the same paper I had seen the day before—I said, "You wish to make your will, do you not?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Then perhaps you will allow me to read this to you?"—she nodded assent, and I read it through slowly and carefully to her, and I asked her if that was right—she said yes; except that she wished to leave a brooch to a friend, and she said she did not know how I should describe it—Dr. Smethurst, who was standing by, said, "Why, it contains the hair of your late father, does it not my dear?"—she said, "Yes, it does, and set with diamonds and pearls"—I said, "Oh, that is quite sufficient; I will describe it as such"—she men<lb></lb>tioned the name of the lady she wished it left to—upon that, I went down stairs again with Dr. Smethurst, and prepared this will (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the pri<lb></lb>soner was talking to me all the while I was writing it, but upon different subjects; about Richmond, and so on—when I had prepared it, I went up stairs again, and read the fair copy of the will all through to the lady—I asked her if it was according to her wishes; she said, quite so—I then asked for another witness; I said two would be necessary—Dr. Smethurst said he would fetch the daughter of the landlady, if that would do—he men<lb></lb>tioned that she was a young girl—I asked how old she was—he said 17 or 18—I said that would do very well, and he fetched her—before he fetched her, he said, "I suppose you will tell her it is some Chancery paper?"—I said, "No; she must know what it is, that it is a will; and the lady must</p>

               <p>ask her and myself to witness it;" and he said, "Oh, very well"—Susannah Wheatley was then fetched, and she and I witnessed the execution of the will by the deceased—on her entering the room, I told her what she was wanted for—after the will was executed and witnessed, I handed it back to the lady and left it with her—the prisoner and I then went downstairs together—this is the signature of the deceased—that was all I had to do with it. (<hi rend="italic">The will was here read, as follows.</hi>)</p>
               <p>"This is the last will and testament of me, Isabella Bankes, now residing at No. 10, Alma-villas, Richmond, in the county of Surrey, spinster: I give and bequeath to my beloved friend, Miss Jenkins, of Walthamstow, Essex, my brooch set with brilliants and pearls, and containing the hair of my late father; and as to all my real and personal property, estate, and effects what<lb></lb>soever and wheresover, and of what nature or kind soever the same may be, I give, devise, and bequeath the same unto my sincere and beloved friend, Thomas Smethurst, doctor of medicine, now also of No. 10, Alma-villas, Richmond aforesaid, for his own use absolutely and for ever. And I hereby appoint the said Thomas Smethurst sole executor of this my will; and hereby revoke all former wills or testamentary dispositions at any time heretofore made by me, do declare this only to be my last will and testa<lb></lb>ment.

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine, practising at Richmond, and am also a registered surgeon—I have been in practice since 1832—I was called in to see the lady who I now know to be Miss Isabella Bankes on the 3d of April—I found the prisoner there—he stated that she was suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting—I put very few questions to her as to her previous state of health—I came late—when I got to my sur<lb></lb>gery I sent some medicine—all the medicine that I sent from my surgery was made up by my assistant, Mr. Caudle—I went to see her on the following day, and she was not any better; she was still suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea, and the medicine had no effect in arresting it—Dr. Smethurst had given ten drops of laudanum as an injection, and also some castor-oil—that was not the medicine I had sent; I sent chalk mixture, containing catechn, and so on—nothing was said about the probability of her being in the family-way at that time—I saw her on the following day, the 5th, and learnt from the prisoner that things were going on still in the same state; he drew my attention to the vomiting and purging, that she was very bilious, that a very large quantity of bile came away, and said she would not be better until it did come away—I sent medicine containing grey powder and Dover's pow<lb></lb>der, which is compound ipecacuanha powder; that did not seem to have any effect whatever—he proposed to give her a mixture containing quinine and gentian, dilute sulphuric acid, ether and gentian, and hydrocyanic acid—I said that I did not think that prescription calculated to do good, that it was not quite the right treatment for the case; he said that he was constantly</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150109"></xptr>
               <p>there, and would watch it; he gave it with an idea to give her an appetite, and should it disagree he would stop it immediately—I accordingly sent that mixture—hydrocyanic acid is prussic acid—I went again on the 6th, and learnt that she had taken that medicine, but that there had been no ill effect from it whatever, but no good had been derived from it, the vomiting and purging still continued—I saw the motions and the matter vomited, which was of a grass-green colour, and which was shown to me by the prisoner as evidence of her bilious state, but I did not see any yellow bile—there was blood found in the evacuations, not so early as the 6th, but on the 8th; there was nothing particular, about them—I continued to send medi<lb></lb>cine to her from time to time, and saw her every day up to the time she left those lodgings; the symptoms kept increasing from day to day, the diarrhea as constant, the vomiting still continued, with violent retching and straining, and frothy mucus was brought up off the stomach—there was great hardness of the abdomen, and I perceived that her strength was failing daily—she used to complain of burning heat in the throat and mouth, burning all through the bowels, and she told me that the very act of swallowing made her sick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you made inquiries as to whether she was in the family-way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Early in my attendance, Dr. Smethurst told me that she was poorly, that her usual periods were on her—that was within five or six days of my first attendance on her—I am not certain as to the date—I tried a variety of remedies, but the same effect was always produced by whatever was given; no medicine produced any effect in arresting the disease, the symptoms continued the same after taking everything that she did take—I learned from Dr. Smethurst that during the purgings there was a great deal of straining and a great deal of tenesmus—I cannot say whether he used the term tenesmus; most likely he did—tenesmus is a con<lb></lb>tinued desire to go, without doing anything—I noticed her mouth, and before the 18th I noticed on her tongue what in common language is called thrush, apthous spots, up to the time she left Old Palace Terrace—Dr. Smethurst was always present when I saw her, with one or two excep<lb></lb>tions—I got the character of her symptoms from him in her presence—she removed to Alma-villas on the 15th, and I continued to attend her on the 16th and 17th; I found that she was gradually getting weaker; there was no change in the symptoms; they continued precisely the same—about that time Dr. Smethurst wished to give her a mixture containing prussic acid, which I did not precisely approve of, and I told him that it was a remedy of an uncertain character, and to a person in her delicate state, it was hardly advisable to give it; he told me he was accustomed to its use, and he could always test its effect by throwing pieces of bread out which had it dropped on them, and seeing its effect on the sparrows—a mixture was made up in accordance with his wishes, but milder than he had directed, milder than he wished it to be—at this period, the 18th, I had formed an opinion that there was something being administered which had a tendency to keep up the irritation existing in the stomach and bowels—I am not, on reflection, able to account for it in any other way—in consequence of that opinion I requested my partner, Mr. Bird, to visit her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you communicate to him what your opinion was, or did you leave him to form an unbiassed judgment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I left him to form an unbiased opinion—I did not see the lady again until after three days—I next saw her on the 21st or 22d, I think the 22d—I then found her decidedly much worse, much weaker, and looking very ill and reduced—I inquired into the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150110"></xptr>
               <p>symptoms that had been exhibited during the period I was away, from Dr. Smethurst—I learnt from him that the medicines which had been ad<lb></lb>ministered had been of no use, that the effect of certain remedies which had been given had been excessively violent, producing excessive irritation of the bowels and stomach—I learnt from him that injections were administered—the injections were being administered throughout the illness, so he told me—the symptoms of blood in the motions continued throughout from the 8th of April—there was a proposal on his part to have another medical man—that was before they left the Terrace—he said, did I not wish to see some one else, and asked whether I would like to see Mr. Hills or Dr. Hassell—I said I had no objection to meet any one, but I would rather meet a person from London, as I was the senior practitioner in Richmond, I preferred seeing a person from London—I never heard the lady herself express a desire about having other advice—I continued attending her—I found no difference, except that she was getting weaker from that time—I continued varying the remedies from time to time in conjunction, at the latter part, with Mr. Bird—I was not present at her death—I saw her a few hours before her death—Dr. Todd came down on Thursday, the 28th—he came to me, and I drove him up to Alma-villas—with the further opportunity that I had had of observing the case, I did not at all alter the opinion I had formed—I purposely abstained from communicating my suspicions to Dr. Todd.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because the pills came there when I was in the house; I think it must have been about a quarter to 10 when I went up there.</p>

               <p>evacuation; she was then very low and excessively exhausted; and I did not wish to speak much to her—I took the evacuation home, and gave it to Mr. Caudle—I saw her again the same afternoon; I did not see Dr. Smethurst that afternoon; I saw her again on the following morning, Saturday, the 30th; I saw her again on the Sunday and on the Monday; she died on the Tuesday morning—during the whole of the period, the disease was not at all arrested by the medicines that had been administered to her—the symptoms certainly could not have been produced by the medicines I administered—in consequence of what passed between me and Dr. Todd, and what I observed myself, I made a communication to a magistrate on the Sunday, and in consequence of that, the prisoner was taken into custody on the Monday—I appeared before the magistrate and made a statement—before I made any communication to the magistrate I had received an account from Dr. Taylor, in relation to some evacuation that had been seat to him—after death there was a post-mortem examination of the body; I was merely pre<lb></lb>sent at it—the stomach was sent up to Dr. Taylor; I did not minutely examine it; the examination was conducted by others, not by me—I met the deceased's sister there on the Monday; I was not aware that she had been there before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give any direction at any time that she should not see her sister? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never heard the subject alluded to—I never heard of her having made a will—up to the time of her death I had no idea of the nature of the connexion between her and the prisoner; I supposed them to be husband and wife—supposing small doses of some irritant poison had been administered from time to time, I think that would decidedly have accounted for the appearances that were indicated throughout the disease.</p>

               <p>somebody from town—he did not suggest Dr. Todd at that time; I am certain of that—I did not suggest that my partner, Mr. Bird, should attend then—I don't think I suggested it to him until some days later than that—Mr. Bird began to attend on the 18th—I suggested his attendance before that, that he should attend instead of me—there was no arrangement that I should cease to attend—he had not suggested that Dr. Todd should be sent for before I suggested Mr. Bird—I told him Mr. Bird had been a pupil of Dr. Todd's; that was not in consequence of his suggesting Dr. Todd to me—I told him that Mr. Bird had had great experience in diarrhoea, and diseases of that kind—it is a fact that Mr. Bird has had considerable experience, in the Crimea; knowing that, I recommended him to Dr. Smethurst—at that time I had formed an unfavourable opinion that my remedies were counter<lb></lb>acted; I had at that time formed an unfavourable opinion, as to the possibility of the lady's recovery; I thought her in a very precarious state; I mean on April 18th, there is no mistake about that—I did not communicate my impression to Mr. Bird—I was present when Mr. Bird was examined here on the last occasion—I heard him examined—I did not hear him say that I had communicated to him my unfavourable impression; I certainly had not—Dr. Smethurst suggested Dr. Todd's coming down after this; I think that was on Wednesday, the 27th—he came down on Thursday night, the 28th—I wrote a note to Dr. Todd, and sent it up by my son—I saw Dr. Todd when he came down; it must have been a few minutes before 10 when he came; I met him at the station, I should think about a quarter to 10; that was the time the train was due—I had not communicated to Dr. Smethurst that he was expected by that train—that was not the latest train; there are several later than that; there is one at 12 o'clock—I had not told Dr. Smethurst the time I expected Dr. Todd to call—it was a little before 10 when I went with Dr. Todd to Alma-villas; we went there direct from the station—I simply told Dr. Todd the symptoms from which she was suffering, and the remedies that had been used—I told him that all those symptoms had failed to yield to my remedies—I told him what the remedies were that I had used—I never conveyed to him any further impression than what I have stated—I did not express to him my great surprise that they had failed—I will undertake to say that I never expressed anything more to him than just detailed the symptoms and the medicines I had used—I have not got the note I sent to him—I cannot recall to my recollection Mr. Smethurst saying, that if the patient had been under his responsibility he should have preferred soothing re<lb></lb>medies; I do not recollect his saying he should have given her a slight occasional emetic, with calomel and opium, and no irritants—nothing of the kind was expressed to me, to my recollection—hydrocyanic acid, or prussic acid, is very frequently used to check sickness; it is used to check vomiting in the early stage of pregnancy; it is a medicine that is very fre<lb></lb>quently used for that purpose; it is of a very sedative character—I thought, the dose that Dr. Smethurst suggested was a very large dose for a person in the weak state in which she was; it was 2 drops of Scheel's strength, mixed with the ordinary dose of water, of course—I have the prescription here; it is 12 drops of hydrocyanic acid, 2 drachms of carbonate of soda, syrup of orange-peel, and 6 oz. of water; that would be 2 drops to 1 oz. of water—an ounce of water is 2 table-spoonfuls—that was not the dose to be taken, because she had to dissolve a powder in some more water, so that she would perhaps take 3 or 4 table-spoonfuls of water; that would dilute it still more—there were 6 doses in the bottle, to be taken with a powder to make it effervescent—I sent a dose that was one-third less than that; Mr. Caudle</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the case of a woman who becomes pregnant for the first time at 43, is her state likely to be more critical than if she had become pregnant just after maturity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I think not; her confinement would be very much more difficult; I do not think her pregnancy would be more critical—I do not think the age of 43 would make a state of pregnancy more critical or more likely to disturb the system,' than any other age, such as 20 or 25—I state that decidedly as the result of my experience; the confinement would be very critical indeed, but not the period of pregnancy—as a rule the periods stop within a month or six weeks of pregnancy; there are some very rare exceptions where they do not, but they are very rare, I think; in my opinion there is rather less danger of miscarriage in a woman's becoming preg<lb></lb>nant for the first time at 43, than at 20 or 25, I should say that from my experience; the danger is rather less at an advanced age than in early youth—you may have the usual symptoms of pregnancy—vomiting is a very common Symptom—if I heard that a woman who was pregnant vomited, or felt sensations of sickness when she awoke of a morning, I should consider it was likely to arise from the pregnancy—it would be an exceptional case if sensations of sickness occurred in moving across a room—sickness in moving is a common symptom.</p>

W. Richardson, of St. George's Hospital; I am not aware that I have ever consulted him in difficult mat<lb></lb>ters; I think I met him on one occasion; I think not more; when he was living at Mortlake, I used to see a good deal of him professionally; I have not had opportunities of seeing him since he has been in London; we have occasionally been engaged in post-mortem examinations together—in the course of the treatment of the deceased lady, laudanum injections were used constantly; that laudanum was obtained from my surgery; Mr. Caudle can tell you better than I how much was supplied; the opium injections were used with my full approval—I am a doctor of medicine; my degree is not</p>

I am a registered surgeon, and am practicing medicine in partnership with Dr. Julius at Richmond—I have been with Dr. Julius between 2 and 3 years—before that I was practising my profes<lb></lb>sion in the Crimea—I had opportunities there of seeing many cases of bowel complaint and dysentery—I was requested by Dr. Julius to go and see the deceased lady, Miss Bankes, about 18th April—I did so—at the time Dr.</p>

               <p>Julius requested me to attend Miss Bankes he did not mention or allude in any way to any suspicions he entertained with respect to her treatment—I saw her on the 18th or 19th—the prisoner was there—I found her labouring under diarrhoea and vomiting—the prisoner did not tell me that he was a medical man, but I gathered it from my conversation with him—he described to me what she had been suffering from, and what treatment Dr. Julius had adopted for her—he gave me his opinion of the cause of her illness; he said that the lady had neglected her bowels for a considerable time, and that now he thought the liver and bowels were unloading themselves by means of the diarrhoea and vomiting—he read notes to me, which he said he had made of her symptoms and the course of her treatment—I at first continued the treatment that Dr. Julius had been adopting previously, which was an effer<lb></lb>vescing mixture, containing hydrocyanic acid and other medicines—I con<lb></lb>tinued that about 3 days, and I also recommended that ice should be used, and that she should have enemas of beef-tea—I also coincided with what the prisoner said he had been doing before, which was enemas of small doses of laudanum—this treatment had not the least effect in mitigating the symptoms under which she was labouring—the prisoner was always there when I visited her—I noticed the evacuations during the time I attended—at first the evacuations that were shown to me presented no remarkable appearance, but afterwards they contained blood and considerable quantities of mucus—the mucus was stained with blood, and there were also shreds—some of the motions I saw consisted almost entirely of mucus stained with blood—there was no foecal matter at all—the prisoner reported to me what he said was the effect of the treatment I recommended; he said that the effervescing mixture did not seem to check the vomiting, that the beef tea enema seemed rather to increase the diarrhoea, and that the ice also did not check the vomiting—I have been present when she has vomited; there was a very great deal of straining—finding these remedies ineffectual, after a few days, I suggested bismuth—I did not suggest acetate of lead before that—I spoke to the prisoner about it—he said that Dr. Julius had suggested that before, and that he (the prisoner) had thought it was not a likely medicine to do good; however, I over persuaded him, and the medicine was pre<lb></lb>scribed and sent; it was in doses of 5 or 6 grains, I forget which—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Caudle here referred to the book, and stated that it was 7 grains."</hi>)—the acetate of lead was afterwards prepared by me, combined with opium at first—I suggested that it should be combined with opium—the prisoner remarked that he thought it would act equally well without the opium; but he at last coincided with me that it would be better to give opium with it, and it was given with opium—the nitrate of silver was given on my suggestion—the prisoner informed me, which I found to be the case by my own observation, that the opium which I had combined with the acetate of lead, had had rather too much effect upon the patient, and accordingly, we decided at first that the opium should be omitted from the prescription, but, upon fur there consultation, we decided that nitrate of silver should be given instead without opium, and it was sent out without opium—I heard from the prisoner that it had been given—he said it had produced a very hurtful effect upon the patient; he said it had caused violent burning pain throughout the whole of the intestinal canal, and that the diarrhoea had been increased, and the motions had contained more blood—in my opinion the nitrate of silver was decidedly not calculated to produce the symptoms that he described—it was given in the form of pills—it was discontinued in consequence of that state<lb></lb>ment of the prisoner—the quantity given was a 1/4 of a grain in one pill</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that the result of your own judgment on the symp<lb></lb>toms, or had you any conversation upon the subject with Dr. Julius before you formed that opinion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had a conversation with Dr. Julius about it; that was about three days after my first visit to the lady—Dr. Julius asked me what was my opinion of the case, before he told me his own suspi<lb></lb>cions—in answer to that enquiry from him I gave the opinion I have now given, and upon that he told me his own—I believe Dr. Todd was sent for and came down to Richmond—I did not see him—I had a conversation with the prisoner upon the subject of Dr. Todd being called in; that was, I should think, certainly more than a week previous to the time that Dr. Todd did come—the prisoner informed me that he should like to have Dr. Todd sent for—the deceased had previously expressed herself desirous of further assist<lb></lb>ance, in the prisoner's hearing and in mine; she expressed that desire more than once—I went to see her on the morning following Dr. Todd's visit—I also saw the prisoner; he said that Dr. Todd had prescribed sulphate of copper and opium—he said that it had been administered, and that the result was exactly the same as when the nitrate of silver pills were given—I think it was past mid-day when I went there; I am not quite certain—I can't say quite certainly; but my impression is that he said only one of Dr. Todd's pills had been given—he said that the pills prescribed by Dr. Todd had pro<lb></lb>duced violent palpitation of the heart; he used the expression, that it seemed as if her heart was jumping out of her body—I never heard of sulphate of copper combined with opium producing any such effect—he spoke also of an injection ordered by Dr. Todd; it consisted of catechu and starch, and he in<lb></lb>formed me that this seemed rather to increase the irritation of the bowels—I should have expected to have found the effect exactly the reverse; they are astringents—I then said that as the sulphate of copper pills seemed to have produced such a bad effect, they had better be left off, and she had better take no medicine by the mouth at all, but she had better continue the injec<lb></lb>tion of 10 minims of laudanum; and I also recommended that brandy should be given; that had been given previously; that was by the mouth—her mouth was sore, she had apthous spots on the mouth, and she had complained of a sensation as of a ball in her throat—she complained of thirst, and the prisoner informed me that she drank very large quantities of cold water—on the 30th I told the prisoner that I wished to take away a portion of one of her evacuations, that it might be examined under the micro<lb></lb>scope to see if there was any purulent matter in it, that we might judge if there was ulceration of the bowels—the prisoner upon that poured out a portion of an evacuation, about 4 oz.; he tied it over in a tumbler with a piece of old newspaper, and gave it to me—I took that to the surgery and gave it to Mr. Caudle, who labelled it and sealed it with my seal in my</p>

               <p>presence; another bottle containing some liquid was sealed at the same time; that was numbered 1; Dr. Julius brought that to the surgery—those vessels numbered 1 and 2 were then put in a basket in my presence and sent to Mr. Buz<lb></lb>zard by Master Julius—he left the room with them intending to go to Mr. Buz<lb></lb>zard—he is a medical man, living at 41, Great Marlborough-street, London—sometimes the evacuations were removed from the room to the landing, and the prisoner either fetched them into the room to me to look at, or I went out to look at them, but sometimes I saw them in the room; they were not more offensive than ordinary motions—I know the term <hi rend="italic">dysuria;</hi> it signifies pain in making water—the prisoner informed me that that was one of the effects of the sulphate of copper pills—I went there on Sunday, 1st May, the Sunday before the death; I found the deceased very weak, and much worse than I had seen her before; her tongue was of a very bright red, and covered with a white fur, and she had also apthous spots on the tongue, as I had noticed before—her pulse was quick and weak, I counted it; it was about 130—the diarrhoea was still frequent—the vomiting had to a certain degree subsided; was it less than it had been previously—a nurse came on the following day—I saw Mr. Buzzard on the Sunday; a conversation then took place between Dr. Julius, myself, and Mr. Buzzard, in my house—after that conversation Dr. Julius and I went to Mr. Penrhyn, a resident magistrate at Richmond; a statement was made to him, and he wrote a note to Dr. Taylor, which was given to Mr. Buzzard to take to London—next day I went again to the house—I saw the prisoner—on my entering the house he remarked that she was rather better—he proposed that syrup of iron and quinine should be given—I said I thought that was a most inappropriate remedy, and that we had much better give some vegetable astringent, as we found that the mineral as<lb></lb>tringents had not produced a good effect—the prisoner showed me an evacu<lb></lb>ation at that time, and I took a portion of it in a white jam-pot—I put it into a bottle myself, and sealed it myself, which I had not done in the other cases; Mr. Caudle had done it; it was numbered 3—the prisoner was taken into custody on the Monday after, I think about 5 o'clock—he was taken before the magistrate and admitted to bail, or released on his own recogni<lb></lb>zance—I returned to the deceased's house with Inspector Mclntyre and the prisoner; we all three returned together—Mr. Mclntyre then took possession of the bottles and vessels about the deceased's room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was that done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went into the deceased's room with the prisoner, and we together handed the bottles and pill-boxes to McIntyre, who stood outside the door—at this time the nurse, Chetwood, was in attendance upon the deceased; whilst she was there I gave the deceased some arrow root mixed with brandy, also beef-tea mixed with brandy, and I saw some given her by the nurse; I think I gave it myself at least three times, and I must have seen the nurse give it two or three times more, at short intervals—I gave her a whole teacupful myself at one time; that was retained on the stomach, all of it—the prisoner had been away from the house about four hours before he returned with me—the deceased did vomit during that day; the prisoner informed me that she had vomited in the morning, before my visit—I did not see her vomit after the giving of the arrow root and brandy, but I was informed by the nurse that she did vomit—on the following morning I was sent for suddenly to go up to the house—I found the deceased sinking—there was no vomiting or diarrhoea at that time: she was perfectly conscious, though evidently dying—I was up and down stairs, talking to Miss Bankes, and coming up again every minute or two to the patient, and at the time she expired I was below.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>regularly to the symptoms, to the vomitings, and to the evacuations? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did; and I saw them regularly from day to day—I have mentioned three vessels containing evacuations sent for analysis; they were all three ulti<lb></lb>mately sent to Dr. Taylor—that was on Saturday, April 30—the bottle No. 2 was the one given to me by the prisoner on the Saturday, and No. 3 was given subsequently, at the time of my visit on the Monday—the prisoner gave me both No. 2 and No. 3—I directed the administration of acetate of lead, nitrate of silver, and bismuth—the acetate of lead was the first; there was one grain of it in each pill; Mr. Caudle, I think, made up four pills; I will not be certain; it was either three or four, I think—the prisoner informed me that two were taken, if I remember right—the next thing was the nitrate of silver; there was a quarter of a grain in each pill—I think four were sent; I think she only took one of those, but I am not quite sure about it—I can't say how many were sent; Mr. Caudle will be able to state that—there was no bismuth pill; it was a mixture; either five or six grains for a dose; that can be told by referring to the book—I directed it to be taken every four hours, I think for three or four days, I can't say exactly—when I first went to the deceased I continued the mixture that she was then taking, which Dr. Julius had left her taking—that mixture contained hydro<lb></lb>cianic acid—I continued that from the 18th to the 22d—I do not know what quantity of sulphate of copper was administered; I don't know that Mr. Caudle had the opportunity of knowing that—the bismuth and other drugs were purchased of Hearon, McCulloch and Squires; I really cannot say where they reside; I leave that to Mr. Caudle—I was present at the first part of the post mortem examination; I took no part in it; I was merely present when the brain was opened, and then I was compelled to go away—Mr. Smethurst particularly requested that I would attend the con<lb></lb>sultation with Dr. Todd; I believe he said, because I had been in the more immediate and direct attendance upon Mrs. Smethurst while she was at Alma-villas—I did not attend, because I had another engagement; he begged of me to attend; and if it had not been for that engagement I should have attended according to his request—I arrived at the opinion that death was caused by some irritant poison partly from my own observation, and partly from the symptoms, the nature of which Dr. Smethurst described to me from day to day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But did the symptoms that Dr. Smethurst told you of, differ at all from those you had an opportunity of seeing yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in the least—I saw the vomitings myself; the motions were shown to me, apparently having been just, passed; and partly the lady told me herself of her symptoms—the account that she gave of herself completely agreed with that Dr. Smethurst told me, and with what I observed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Dr. Julius, and have been so for about a year and a half—I had studied medicine before entering upon my employment with Dr. Julius—I made up the whole of the medicines sent from Dr. Julius's surgery for Miss Bankes—the first I made up was an ordinary chalk mixture, on 3d April, consisting of prepared chalk, aromatic confection, tincture of catechu, and compound tincture of camphor—the following day there were three pills of grey powder and compound ipecacuanha powder; I put two grains of the grey powder into each pill; they were to be repeated every four hours, one to be taken at a time—on 5th April, by Dr. Julius's direction, I made up a quinine mixture; that consisted of eight grains of quinine, a sufficient quantity of dilute sul<lb></lb>phuric acid to dissolve the quinine, two drachms of chloric ether, and infusion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150122"></xptr>
               <p>of gentian to make up six ounces; there were also fifteen drops of dilute hydrocyanic acid—the next medicine sent was a few more of the pills similar to those on 4th April; four of them, I think, or six—there was also a draught containing powdered rhubarb, tincture of cardamums, and magnesia—on the 7th of April the quinine mixture was repeated the same as before—on the 9th the same mixture was sent again—on the 12th six more of the grey-powder pills were sent, the same as those sent on the 4th of April; "the pills as before" was directed to be put on the box; I do not know how many were to be taken; it was one every 4 hours—on the 14th of April I made up another bottle of the quinine mixture as before—on the 17th another bottle of quinine mixture as before—on the 18th I had to make up a prescription with 12 drops of prussic acid of Scheel's strength; Scheel's acid is stronger than the ordinary Pharmacopoeia acid; I had not Scheel's acid in the surgery at the time, and instead of the 12 drops of Scheel's, I used the Pharmacopoeia acid, 4 drops in each dose, instead of 2 drops of Scheel's; that would be 24 drops in the mixture, instead of 12; my reason for that was, partly because we had none of Scheel's; I could have got Scheel's with a very little trouble; but the 4 drops of the Pharmacopoeia acid was not quite so strong as Scheel's would be, and I thought 2 drops a very large dose, and was rather nervous at giving it; I thought it rather safer to give under the dose than over it; Dr. Julius was not at home at the time, and I wished to send it at once, and I thought it the safest thing to do; the rest of the prescription I made up precisely as Dr. Julius had prescribed it; there were 6 powders to go with it to cause effervescence, to take with each dose of the mixture; those powders were citric acid, simply to cause effervescence—on the 22d of April Mr. Bird prescribed for Miss Bankes; the first pre<lb></lb>scription of Mr. Bird's that I made up contained bismuth, carbonate of soda, hydrocyanic acid, and water, and, I think, a small quantity of the solu<lb></lb>tion of acetate of morphia (<hi rend="italic">referring to the book</hi>); there were 7 grains of bismuth for a dose, 42 grains in the mixture; it was a 6-oz. bottle; the sixth part was to be taken at a time; there were 20 drops of the Pharmacopoeia dilute hydrocyanic acid, 20 drops of the acetate of morphia, 2 drachms of carbonate of soda, 2 drachms of gum-powder, containing bismuth in solution, and water; that mixture was to be taken 3 times a-day—on the 24th that mixture was repeated—on the 25th I made up 8 pills of acetate of lead and powdered opium; the dose in each pill was 1 grain of acetate of lead, and half a grain of powdered opium; one pill to be taken every 6 hours—on the next day, Tuesday, the 26th, I made up 4 pills of nitrate of silver; there was a quarter of a grain of nitrate of silver in each pill; the prisoner saw me make them up, and saw me weigh the nitrate of silver; he appeared to be very particular how I did it, unnecessarily so; I used great caution, and mixed them very well, and he requested me to do it more, with my hand; I asked him whether Mrs. Smethurst was better or no, and he said no, he thought she was in a very critical state; that was on Tuesday; at that time he also obtained some laudanum from me; he gave me a bottle that had had laudanum in it before; as nearly as I can remember, I filled it—I did not see Dr. Todd when he came on the 28th—on the next morning I made up some sulphate of copper pills; I sent 4; I beg your pardon, I sent 6 sulphate of copper pills; there was a quarter of a grain of sulphate of copper in each pill, and a quarter of a grain of powdered opium; one pill was to be taken 3 times a-day, about every 4 hours—on that same day there was some tincture of catechu sent, 4 ounces, and another quantity of laudanum; they were sent separately; I suppose they were sent for injections—on the morn<lb></lb>ing</p>

               <p>of the 29th, Dr. Julius brought to the surgery a bottle, apparently contain<lb></lb>ing an evacuation; it was a 6-oz. bottle; it was not marked then; subsequently it was marked No. 1; I put that bottle in a cupboard, locked it, and kept the key in my own possession—on the following day, Mr. Bird brought a tumbler containing part of an evacuation; he gave it to me, and I put it in a bottle; I was very careful in the selection of the bottle, in the first place, and very careful to wash it as well; it had contained simply liquorice-water before I put the evacuation into it; I took the liquorice out, and washed the bottle, and then poured the evacuation into it from the tumbler; that bottle, and the one I had received from Dr. Julius, were then labelled; Mr. Bird was present; he wrote the labels, and I put them on; Dr. Julius's bottle was labelled No. 1, and Mr. Bird's No. 2; and I sealed them with Mr. Bird's seal, in his presence; it is a Turkish seal, with his name on it, I believe, in Turkish letters; when they were sealed, they were placed in a small basket, and given to young Mr. Julius, with directions to take it to Mr. Buzzard—On Monday, 2d May, I called on Mrs. Chetwood, the nurse, and took her to Alma-villas; I called at the surgery with her in a cab on the way, and took with me some medicine that had been made up; some hydrate of magnesia; that is an antidote to arsenic: I believe that was ordered by Dr. Taylor; if I remember rightly, Dr. Buzzard said so; I left that with Mrs. Chetwood at Alma-villas, with instructions how to use it—after the 29th of April, either Dr. Julius or Mr. Bird were always present when I made up the prescrip<lb></lb>tions; I must except the hydrate of magnesia; Dr. Buzzard was present on that occasion; I helped Dr. Buzzard to make it—we have two preparations of arsenic in our surgery; they are Donovan's solution and Fowler's solution; they are kept in a cupboard by themselves entirely, with other poisons, in a cupboard apart from other drugs—we have also antimony in the surgery, in the form of tartarized antimony, what is called tartar emetic, and antimonial wine; the tartarized antimony is placed on a shelf in a small bottle, with a small row of bottles of a peculiar shape, on a very high shelf; it is a row of bottles quite different from any other bottles in the surgery, and very small.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In any one of the prescriptions which you made up, and which were sent to Miss Banker's house, was there any arsenic, or antimony, or bi-chloride of mercury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most certainly not—after the death of Miss Bankes I gave some specimens of the bismuth, the sulphate of copper, the nitrate of silver, and the acetate of lead to Inspector McIntyre—they were taken from the same stop-bottles of those drugs from which the medicines had been taken that were administered to Miss Bankes—a boy named Wil<lb></lb>liam Marchant took out the chief of the medicines from the surgery; an<lb></lb>other boy took a note, I believe, and I think one bottle of medicine; I am not quite sure; I delivered one or two myself in the early part of the illness.</p>

I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and Assistant-surgeon and Lecturer at Charing-Cross hospital—I have been in practice about eleven years—I made the post mortem examination of the body of Miss Bankes, about nine o'clock in the morning of 4th May, twenty-two hours after death—I performed the examination; I was assisted by Mr. Palmer, of Mortlake—the back part of the body externally was of a dark purple, on account of being full of blood, from the position in which the body lay; I gathered from that that the blood was fluid, more fluid I should say than usual; the arms were perfectly flexible; the legs were very rigid; the feet were a good deal bent downwards and turned in, and the muscles at the bottoms of the feet were hard; that would indicate that there</p>

               <p>may have been some cramp or spasm in the lower extremities of the body; the abdomen was drawn in; and the muscles were also tense and hard; the tongue was rough; and the papillae, the little rough eminences, were more elevated than usual—I saw no signs that I could put down as apthous—the face was much emaciated, and of a dull clay or earthy colour; and the lower lip was drawn in under the upper teeth; the front of the body generally was of this dull earthy colour—I examined the head; the result of my examination of it was that the brain was perfectly healthy, and that there was nothing whatever to remark except that there was the same engorgement backwards, on account of the position of the body, from her lying down, the fluid blood naturally gravitates towards the back—there was nothing at all about the lungs wrong; they were healthy; but there was the same engorgement at the back or lower part—I hardly examined the liver care<lb></lb>fully at that time; I did not cut into it; I examined it afterwards, but I saw at that time that the liver was firm and full-sized, rather large—I examined the <hi rend="italic">uterus;</hi> I found the common signs of pregnancy, and there was a foetus with a deciduous membrane a vascular fold attached; I believe it was somewhere between the fifth and seventh week; it is not a very easy thing to determine accurately; I think I could determine accurately within those limits; it was somewhere between the fifth and seventh week—the heart and great vessels connected with the heart were perfectly healthy; there was, perhaps, a little more serum than usual in the bag of the heart, the pericardium, as it is called, but nothing to amount to a morbid or diseased appearance—I examined the liver subsequently; it was slightly fatty, rather fatty, the remainder hard; the liver when it becomes fatty is usually soft, but in this instance it was hard, and it was coloured in the usual manner, speckled—the oesophagus, or gullet, was healthy; I saw no signs of inflammation upon it—the outside of the stomach, the smaller end, that nearer the intestine, was red; the larger end, that near where the gullet enters, was of a dark colour; in the center it was pale—upon subsequently examining the inside of the stomach the narrow part or small end was also red; at the larger end was a large black patch from effused blood; near the small end of the stomach the mucous membrane was congested, that is at the other end from the black spot and near where the red part was—the contents of the stomach were a brown mucus mixed with blood and some bile, I should say—there were no ulcers in the stomach, and no perforation, nor appearance of acute inflammation—I have some short notes of my observation of the intestines made for my own guidance—on the outside of the intestine I noted on 4th May, that was at the first examination, that the commencement of the intestine was very red; the small intestines generally were inflated and minutely injected with blood, and in certain spots they were roughened by lymph, the result of inflamma<lb></lb>tion, and glued together at certain turns where this lymph or glutinous inflammation was effused; they were coherent together from that cause; that did not apply to the entire length of the intestines, only to a few parts, and chiefly quite the lower parts; those are the external symptoms—internally, the first part of the intestine, technically called the <hi rend="italic">duodenum,</hi> was inflamed for about three inches from its commencement, but the mucous membrane was quite firm, and there was no ulceration—from that point the rest of the mucous membrane was only slightly injected, not inflamed—in the next intestine, the <hi rend="italic">jejunum,</hi> the mucous membrane was still firm—in places the vessels were injected with it's own blood, showing the branch<lb></lb>ing way in which the vessels run remarkably plainly, but this only in spots—then I go to the <hi rend="italic">ilium,</hi> or lower part of the intestines—there was</p>

               <p>much the same appearance at the commencement as in the last, except that on approaching the lower part the injections increased very much, and at last, about three feet from its end, the mucous membrane was greatly altered; there was a deposit of lymph therein, and a thickening of the membrane; an ill-organized granular lymph; the membrane at the same time was roughened, and the glands, which are in the intestine there, were less visible than usual—this deposit of lymph did not begin in the glands, but went over the whole surface of the intestine, and concealed the glands instead of rendering them more prominent.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not actually your<lb></lb>self examine the intestines. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they were brought to me, but I declined to examine them—when I gave my opinion before, I stated that, in order to arrive at a perfectly accurate opinion, the intestines ought to be carefully examined; not a mere cursory examination—I advised the gentlemen who applied to me, to put the intestines into the hands of two competent men, who had more leisure than I had, in order that a very accurate examina<lb></lb>tion should be made—I have never made the post-mortem examination of a body that has died from the administration of slow irritant poison; that answer includes the three poisons I have named—slow poisoning is of very rare occurrence—I have never known any case or cases of the early preg<lb></lb>nancy of a woman of about 40 or 45 years of age, in which there has been violent vomiting, violent diarrhoea, and severe dysentery, which no ordinary medicines would stop, and in which the life of the mother has only been saved by the abortion of the <hi rend="italic">foetus</hi>—no such cases have come under my cog<lb></lb>nisance—I think it possible that excessive vomiting and great diarrhoea may be caused by the early stage of pregnancy, and symptoms somewhat allied to those under which this poor lady died; but I think it is quite impossible that pregnancy alone, in an early stage, or in any stage, could produce intense ulceration of the bowels—I think where it is a doubtful case, it is conclusive evidence against the theory that the symptoms were caused by early preg<lb></lb>nancy, that you have found such extensive ulceration as existed in this case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you yourself in your great experience ever come across cases of</p>

               <p>dysentery, from which the patient has died, which you have been unable to refer to any cause? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have come across many cases of chronic dysentery, dysentery of a long standing, which were connected, generally speaking, with exposure to miasmata—I have not seen any isolated case of very acute dysentery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is a thing that does not occur in this countay? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only as an epidemic under particular circumstances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there not constantly cases of dysentery occurring here and there in this country? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not of this kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But dysentery generally; rapid and acute dysentery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the term is used, very clumsily very frequently for ordinary diarrhoea—the fact that this lady had been the subject of bilious sickness, and occasionally of bilious purging, and that she was of a highly bilious temperament, would not at all alter or modify the opinion I have expressed, not when the whole cir<lb></lb>cumstances of the case have been brought before me; I mean the whole circumstances of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing an early stage of pregnancy, in which you admit it is pos<lb></lb>sible that violent diarrhoea and violent vomiting might occur, would not the fact that the patient had suffered from bilious sickness and bilious purging form any element at all in your consideration? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would during the life of the patient, but it does not affect my opinion in this particular case; I have got the whole case before me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it produce inflammation and ulceration? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you aware that there were greenish vomit<lb></lb>ings up to the 18th or 20th of April? did you hear Mr. Bird state that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that would direct my attention to another form of poison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Antimony; I mean the incessant vomit<lb></lb>ing of green matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not bilious matter green? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Bile is not green; bile, when it passes into the stomach and is acted upon by the acid of the stomach, becomes green; if it was then vomited it would be green; that explains the green colour of the vomit—it would not be the green colour of the vomit alone that would direct my attention to antimony; the green colour shows great intensity of vomiting; it shows that bile is carried into the stomach; and when by a sort of inverted action, it shows that a large portion of the bowel below the stomach is involved in the effort of vomiting; it shows that the vomiting is an intense vomiting—what I mean to say is that antimony would produce intense vomiting—I have taken that into con<lb></lb>sideration in the opinion I have expressed; it is one of the elements upon which I formed my opinion; as far as the green vomiting goes, I explain it in that way—I have no experience of a case of violent vomiting in the early pregnancy of a woman between 40 and 45, which has only been checked by procuring the abortion of the foetus—I don't know that I was here when that was stated by Dr. Julius—I do not say it could not happen—by "experience" I mean my own personal experience, and my general know<lb></lb>ledge and reading.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the term "experience," do you include your general learning, and acquaintance with the profession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Exactly.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You must have read, I apprehend, of cases of very violent vomiting from early pregnancy which has been incapable of being checked by ordinary remedies, and where, in order to save the life of the mother, the foetus has been aborted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is quite possible I may; but I do not charge my memory with any case of the kind—I am certainly</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150131"></xptr>
               <p>not prepared to say that it could not happen—Dr. Julius did not mention a word to me about irritant poison—he told me that this diarrhoea and vomiting had failed to yield to any of the medicines he had applied; and he stated to me that Dr. Smethurst was very impatient of the continuance of remedies, and that after each change of remedy the symptoms became worse—when I first formed my opinion, I stated that I had formed it not only from what I had observed in the bedroom of the dying woman, but also that I had been amply informed as to the case by Dr. Julius, as to the symptoms—it was then that I stated that, without a full examination of the intestines, I should not like to deliver a positive opinion—it was upon my seeing the patient and hearing the description Dr. Julius had given of the symptoms, that I at once formed a strong suspicion of the existence of irritant poison—I think I said arsenic, or some other irritant; I think those were my words—I cannot undertake to swear that my exact words were, "I said that I had a strong suspicion that this was a case of arsenical poisoning."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Or that they were not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Or that they were not—my impression is that that is not a correct statement of what I said; I said, "arsenic, or some other irritant poisoning."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it what medical men call anxiety? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was not anxiety, it was something beyond that, it was terror.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where there is great exhaustion and great de<lb></lb>bility, is there not always a look of anxiety. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is a peculiar look which a practised eye is familiar with, but it is very different from that—I was not with her very long making these observations, more than five minutes—I really cannot say the time, for I did not look at my watch; perhaps about ten minutes; I was in the house longer than that, a good deal—I was observing her perhaps about ten minutes—I was there a sufficient time to enable me to form a judgment of what was proper to do in the case—I did not think it necessary to ask her many questions; she said very little to me—I have nothing to do with midwifery, or that branch of the profession.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you a personal friend of Mr. Bird's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am—I should imagine, from the note sent that it was not originally intended that I should make the analysis—I cannot explain why it was sent through me to Dr. Taylor—I was with Mr. Bird in the Crimea—our experience was pretty much the same, not entirely, but substantially—the patients were all males—I had been seeing patients long before I went to the Crimea, assisting some gentleman in practice—I was not then established by myself; since I returned from the Crimea I have been—I am on visiting terms with Mr. Bird, and with Dr. Julius—since this matter I have been in the habit of visiting them, and they me—Mr. Bird has called upon me several times, as he was constantly in the habit of doing before this—I have never attended a patient who suffered or died from slow arsenical poisoning—I have never made the post mortem examination of a body killed by arsenical poisoning—Reinsch's test was the only test that Dr. Taylor applied in my presence; that was to about two teaspoonsful of the liquid, two drachms—the rest I replaced at the time, fastened down the stopper, and sealed it in Dr. Taylor's presence, and took it home and locked it up; and that same night, on my return from Richmond, I took out those two bottles from the closet in which they were locked, and conveyed them to Dr. Taylor—when Dr. Taylor applied Reinsch's test in my presence, he commenced by taking an empty test-tube; he placed in that a mixture of hydrochloric acid and distilled water; he then introduced into that a bright copper wire, and placing the test-tube over the flame of a spirit-lamp, he boiled this liquid for several minutes; he then removed the wire from the test-tube, and we observed that it was as bright as when it entered the solution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the object of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The object was this: very often arsenic is present in hydrochloric acid, and it was to ascertain the existence or non-existence of arsenic in that particular sample, and also to ascertain the cleanliness of the test tube.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Very often arsenic present in hydrochloric acid, you say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I understand so—it is part of my business to be acquainted with that fact; I believe it is not invariably found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But it is found so often, that Dr. Taylor thought it necessary to test this hydrochloric acid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does Reinsch's test consist of the putting a fine copper gauze into the liquid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Putting copper in; any copper, copper wire—on this occasion Dr. Taylor used a quantity of copper wire, thin wire—he put that into two spoonsful of the evacuation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before that did he test the copper wire in any way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No more than by the process I have described; boiling it in the hydrochloric acid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would that be a test for both? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't think it would be much of a test for the copper, because the copper is not dissolved by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, in fact, the copper wire used by Dr. Taylor was not tested? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say that the copper wire was tested—the arsenical crystals were shown to me that same night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As long as the copper remains undis<lb></lb>solved, the only question is the external surface, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Exactly; to take care that that is properly cleansed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the College of Physicians, and am physician of Queen Charlotte's Lying-in-Hospital, assistant-physician to the Children's Hospital, and am a physician accou<lb></lb>cheur—in the course of my practice I have seen cases of acute dysentery; it is nearly eighteen years ago; about six or eight cases then came under my notice—they were of an epidemic character, in Lower Chelsea; I think in 1847 I also saw two cases in the same neighbourhood—I am not certain whether they were epidemic; I only knew of the two cases—I have heard the evidence given here of the symptoms of disease under which this lady laboured, and also of the appearances which her body presented after death; I have also heard the remedies that were administered—taking all those circumstances into consideration, I do not think she died from acute dysentery—I should think that she died from having taken some irritant medicine; from the effect of irritant medicines.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever in your practice been acquainted with instances of very violent and severe vomiting and very violent and severe purging and diarrhoea in an early stage of pregnancy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in the early stage—it is a complication generally at the later period of pregnancy; I mean the diarrhoea—I have certainly been acquainted with it in an early stage—I don't think that advanced age has anything to with it—the condition of a woman between 40 and 45 years of age, pregnant for the first time, is not more critical in the early stage—I have known instances of violent vomiting in the early stages of preg<lb></lb>nancy; not of violent diarrhoea; there are such cases recorded, certainly—I don't remember any of so severe a character as to endanger life; I do not know of any case in which the life of the mother has been saved under such circumstances by procuring abortion; not within the first three months of pregnancy; rather later, between the sixth and seventh month it is more common, I should say—I do not remember having read of an instance within three months; I would not pretend to say it was impossible, but improbable—I was present on the former occasion; I had been called upon to give evidence before that—I made a post mortem examination of the cases of dysentery that I have spoken of, assisted by the apothecary of the dispensary, in each of the six cases—I have no notes of the two last—I believe the six cases arose from an epidemic—that was in 1841; that was not the cholera year; the cholera years were 1832 and 1848—they were not cases at all in the nature of cholera; no symptoms like cholera; severe dysentery simply—they were accompanied by vomiting and violent retching—violent retching is a frequent symptom in the early stage of pregnancy, but it is not an unfavourable symptom, the patient is not at all the worse for it afterwards; on the contrary, it is rather looked upon by accoucheurs as a good symptom—I have not known, in my own practice, of cases of violent vomiting which was unable to be stopped; I have heard of such cases—violent vomiting would then become unfavourable, but as an ordinary symptom I do not consider it at all unfavourable—I do not remember ever to have heard of a case of violent vomiting without diarrhoea within the first three months of pregnancy, in which, to save the life of the mother, abortion has been procured—I do not know Dr. Barker, of Bedford.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150136"></xptr>
               <p>between the present case, and the six cases in which you made the post mortem examinations? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was not the same amount of sloughing in those cases, that there was in the post mortem appearances described by Dr. Wilks; I mean of the <hi rend="italic">coecum;</hi> there was not the same amount of destruc<lb></lb>tion of the mucous membrane; the glands were in a different condition; in the dysentery cases, the glands were entirely destroyed, quite obliterated; and, in three of the cases, there was perforation of the intestine—the symp<lb></lb>toms in those six cases were different from the symptoms of the case I have heard described to-day—there was no burning sensation of the throat in those cases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that burning sensation of the throat a sensation at all connected with dysentery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not; the burning sensation and con<lb></lb>striction described, is not a symptom of dysentery.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> To what, in your judgment, would you refer the burn<lb></lb>ing sensation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the effect of some irritant poison—in my judgment, there was no connexion whatever between the state of pregnancy, in which the deceased is described to have been, and the state of the intestines, as described by the witness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the College of Physicians—I am the author of different medical works; amongst others, "The Dictionary of Practical Medicine"—I was in Africa in 1817, and at that time had an opportunity of observing a good many cases of dysentery, generally acute dysentery; I may add that I had opportunities of seeing a good deal of dysentery, in 1815 and 1816, on, the Continent, after the peace, where in<lb></lb>spections were frequent in the French and German hospitals; I saw them merely as a spectator—I witnessed several post mortem examinations—I have been for many years practising as a physician in this country—I have been present during this trial, and have heard the symptoms under which Miss Bankes is said to have laboured; I have heard described the different remedies which were from time to time administered; and I have paid attention to the evidence with regard to the post mortem appearances—viewing all the evidence, in my opinion her death is not referable to acute dysentery—in my opinion, the symptoms during life, and the appearances after death, are referable to the exhibition of irritant poisons, either by the mouth, or by injection, given at intervals, or in small quantities, frequently exhibited.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever made the post-mortem examination of any animal body, human or otherwise, that has been killed by slow arsenical poisoning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not; I may mention that I have seen within the last few years several cases of slow poisoning by arsenic to which I have been called in; arsenic taken by mistake, or prescribed, and its use ex<lb></lb>tended beyond the proper time; but in only one case, that I know of, has the case terminated fatally, and in that case arsenic was given by an iodate of arsenic—the gentleman who called me in in consultation inspected the body; I was to have been present, but was prevented from being present; he fur<lb></lb>nished me with the particulars of the examination—in the last three or four months I have seen, I think, two cases of poisoning by arsenic; one was from accident or mistake, and the other was from continuing arsenic for too long a period; they produced very severe symptoms of vomiting and purging; those two cases recovered—they produced burning pain in the oesophagus, down the gullet into the stomach; the stomach was obviously inflamed to a certain extent at the time, but whether the parts would exhibit appearances of in<lb></lb>flammation afterwards, is a different matter—in a case of slow arsenical poisoning I should look for inflammation of the oesophagus, but I should not be disappointed in not finding it—I might expect to find traces of the poison in some parts of the tissues—I might expect to find it in the liver, certainly, and in other tissues; but if there was, as there would be, constant vomiting and purging, I should consider a considerable portion of the poison would be eliminated from the system—purging and vomiting do accompany slow irri<lb></lb>tant poison, if the poison be frequently exhibited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would you not expect to find in the tissues of a body traces of the actual arsenic, of the metal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have never made the examination.</p>

               <p>expect to find traces of the metal in the tissues, more especially in the liver, but I should scarcely expect to find much where there is much sickness, vomiting, and purging; because when a mucous surface is in a state of in<lb></lb>flammatory action you have active discharge from the surface, and the other vital function of absorption scarcely takes place—absorption ✗n scarcely take place from a surface from which there is a constant discharge—vomiting and purging are not invariably the constant and continued attendants of slow arsenical poisoning; they are the general attendants—the poison may be exhibited in such a manner as to produce very little vomiting, although it may afterwards produce a great deal of purging—I have paid very little attention to midwifery diseases; I do not practice in that way—I am inti<lb></lb>mately acquainted with Dr. Herbert Barker, of Bedford; he was a pupil; he attended my lectures at the Middlesex Hospital.</p>

               <p>antimony, but I cannot say distinctly what metal, or whether there might not be mercury—I did not proceed further at that time—I desired to have the authority of a magistrate to proceed further—bottle No. 2 was then resealed in my presence, by Mr. Buzzard, and taken away by him—he also took away bottle No. 1—after he had left, I proceeded further with my process—the application had been made to me to do something to save the life of this lady; and though I do not make analyses on a Sunday, I thought it proper to come to a conclusion as soon as I could—I knew that the enquiry had reference to a living person, with a view of seeing what treat<lb></lb>ment should be adopted—I tested the liquid further by boiling some copper gauze in the remainder of the liquid that was in the tube, so that I removed all that could be deposited on copper from that liquid—I examined the copper under the microscope, and there I saw an appearance closely resem<lb></lb>bling metallic arsenic—I then proceeded further—I heated a portion of the gauze, coated with metal, in a tube, and obtained crystals of arsenic—this is one of the tubes containing the arsenic (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have no doubt that these are crystals of arsenic; not the slightest—the shorter tube is the one with the experiment performed—if you take the tube out, under the micro<lb></lb>scope the crystals are perfectly clear—in this little sediment, if you put it against a dark cloth, you will see a little ring of crystals—it is quite plain in the sun-light—I examined it still further—I have applied another test-tube, not to these crystals, but to some I obtained in the same way, a further examination of No. 5—a portion of the crystals are sublimed; I first obtained crystals from the tube; I then examined them by the microscope, and afterwards applied the test of nitrate of silver and nitric acid, and found that it was really metallic arsenic—on the evening of the same day Mr. Buzzard came again; he brought back both the parcels, and a letter with an order from Mr. Penrhyn, the Magistrate, to proceed further; this was still at my house—on the following morning I proceeded to analyse the contents of both bottles; I took two ounces of the liquid of No. 2, and made a still further examination by the same process, further to satisfy myself that there was arsenic—the result satisfied me that I was correct—I used a portion, of the copper gauze—I repeated the pro<lb></lb>cess and had the results on a stronger scale; that was the only difference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You repeated the same process you had used on Sunday; what was the difference in quantity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The quantity was more, but I did not estimate the quantity; the estimate I made on Sunday was with two drachms; supposing the drachms to represent the whole liquid, I calculated that there was less than a quarter of a grain in the whole four ounces of the evacuation, certainly less than that; it was evidently a very small quantity that was present—there is a point which I omitted respecting the analysis; I endeavoured to ascertain whether the arsenic was in a liquid state; that is, whether it was dissolved—there was a quantity of blood in the bottle; I filtered a portion of it, and I found arsenic in the filtered liquid, therefore clearly showing that there was arsenic in the blood contained in the bottle.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you find anything else besides arsenic? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made a subsequent analysis and found copper; merely a trace; just enough to enable me to say that there was copper there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>time; bismuth, antimony, and mercury are all detected by it; it is the only process known to chemists, that will at once enable them to give an opinion upon the probability of any one of these four metals being present, antimony, arsenic, bismuth, and mercury—I examined the organic matter of No. 2, by the microscope, and found it consisted of fibrous matter, fecu<lb></lb>lent matter, such as one sees in watery evacuations; apparently food changed more or less, and mixed with bile and blood; it also contained mucus—I did not perceive any indication of pus—I noticed nothing very remarkable in those organic contents, except this, that I came immediately to the conclusion, from the discovery of arsenic in the blood, that it was such an evacuation as a person labouring under that form of poisoning would probably pass—I advised immediately the use of the antidote for arsenic; the hydrate of magnesia—I examined the contents of No. 1 next morning, and found no arsenic, no metallic matter at all; the contents of it were simply biliary matter, foecal matter with mucus—there was no blood, merely feculent matter with mucus, and no metallic compound; no metallic matter at all; it was of a greenish yellow colour, rather of altered bile, biliary matter and mucus, feculent matter—I ought to mention that it had also a smell rather of feculent matter—on Thursday, 5th May, I received a large jar from McIntyre sealed up, which was found afterwards to contain a portion of the viscera, the stomach unopened, the spleen, the large and small intestines, the liver, part on the oesophagus or gullet, and the uterus or womb—and on 7th May I received other viscera; I received a bottle containing the two kidneys, and a small bottle containing blood said to have been taken from the heart—I received a number of medicine bottles from Mclntyre; I can hardly tell the number separately; I labelled both the bottles, packages, parcels, pill-boxes, and a great number of other articles; I numbered them all; they are in the hands of Mclntyre, I believe—the highest of my numbers was 26 at that date; I afterwards received others, making a total of 28; then there were others that followed on 14th May, which I numbered 29, 30, &amp;c.; those are chiefly specimens of the medicines supplied from the surgery of Dr. Julius—I examined the contents of all those twenty-eight bottles or packages—omitting No. 5, and No. 21; I found nothing that it is at all necessary you should be acquainted with; I examined them with reference to arsenic—I did not examine them before—I examined the bottles containing the viscera—I first examined the uterus, I did not analyse it, but examined it; and I concur in all that Mr. Barwell has said respect<lb></lb>ing it—it was in an impregnated state; I agree with what Mr. Barwell says, between the fifth and seventh week, as nearly as I could judge—I next examined the oesophagus or gullet; there was only a portion of it sent, about one third of its length; that was injected on the mucous surface slightly, which indicated some cause of irritation of the throat—there was no arsenic or antimony in the gullet—I next analysed the stomach, and found none there—the appearances have been already described—I concur in them; it contained a yellowish liquid, coloured with blood—on analysis I found antimony in the small intestines in two distinct places; the middle portion of the small intestines contained the largest quantity, the other part was above and below; some was found both above that and below that, and some was found in the coecum—altogether the quantity was very small that was found in the body—I found some in one kidney, and there were traces in the blood of the heart, and traces of antimony in the blood from the jar; the drainings of the jar—the other kidney was not examined—there was none in the liver or in the spleen—I was assisted by Dr. Odling in the analysis, and we calculated that the whole quantity did not exceed probably</p>

               <p>from a quarter to half a grain—I also observed that the coecum was ulcerated, and its lining membrane nearly destroyed throughout—the colon was also ulcerated; the large intestines were ulcerated more or less through<lb></lb>out, four feet of them, and in parts of them there were dark patches where blood had been effused, and patches of inflammation in the rectum, or rather of irritation—the most remarkable appearance was the almost entire destruction of the lining membrane; there was no perforation in any part of the intestines—I tested the contents of the stomach; the only remarkable point I can state is that there was blood and biliary, matter in the contents—the appearances were such as were described by Mr. Barwell yesterday—my judgment and knowledge suggested that some great cause of irritation was the cause of the blood in the stomach—there was no appearance of disease in the other organs at all to account for death; that is the spleen and liver, I observed nothing about them to account for symptoms or death—I next proceeded to examine the contents of certain pill-boxes, which I received on 7th May from Mclntyre—I found that they were what they were represented to be, and contained, one mercury, another silver, another copper; they were not all labelled, but the account I had of the prescriptions corresponded with the contents—of the pills containing metallic medicine there were four of the sulphate of copper; one was taken for analysis—by copper pills I mean pills containing a quarter of a grain of sulphate of copper, with a portion of powdered opium corresponding with what was prescribed by Dr. Todd—I found nothing but what corresponded to the labels or prescriptions—I examined besides an Indian rubber enema bottle and a glass syringe—I found in the wadding of the glass syringe, which I removed, traces of some white metal; it was neither mercury, bismuth, or silver, but what I cannot say; it was a mere trace of white metal—I then examined the large number of bottles and packets of powders which Mclntyre had delivered to me—there were two bottles of the bismuth; it looked to me as if an ounce or an ounce and a half had been removed from one; the other was unopened, and quite full; in the other bottles I found prussic acid, quinine, and sulphuric acid; that corresponded with the prescriptions—I examined also some sugar and tapioca, and matters of that sort, brought to me by the constable: I found nothing at all suspicious in them. Bottle No. 5 was among the articles delivered to me by Mclntyre, the inspector; it was unlabelled, and contained, I found on examination, 355 grains of chlorate of potass; I examined that, and found it was free from anything; it was what I found it to be—in the first instance I had to determine its nature by analysis; there was nothing to guide me to it—it is not muriate of potass; nothing of the sort; that is a detonating salt, an explosive compound, used instead of saltpetre in making explosive mixtures—that bottle has been broken since it has been in my possession; it is broken in two—bottle No. 21, about which an error arose, purported to be a bottle like the other medicine bottles with a label that I could recognise by the handwriting, corresponding to a quinine mixture; it contained about one half of a clear watery liquid, of a saline taste—I handed an ounce and a half of it to my assistant to boil for testing by Reinsch's process, as I had done with the other 20 bottles—I had not at that time Dr. Odling's assistance in applying that test—what I did with the bottle was this: on the 13th, I think, of May, in proceeding to the analysis, I found that, in using the test that had served my purpose throughout the whole of this investigation, that the copper was destroyed, entirely destroyed, and was dissolved; that seemed rather a remarkable circumstance; at any rate, it had never occurred to me in my experience</p>

               <p>before; and thinking, from the appearance of the copper when first put in, that there was something like arsenic about it, I plunged a portion of copper gauze into it for a very short time; removed the copper gauze, examined it, and obtained crystals of arsenic; that was in an ounce and a half of it, about one half the quantity—I then put this bottle aside, and went on with the other analyses, thinking there was something remarkable about it, and wishing to have the assistance of another chemist in the matter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did that lead you to suppose that there was arsenic in it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did; Dr. Odling assisted me in a further examination, and we both came to that conclusion; it turned out ultimately that there was none—there was no arsenic or antimony in the fluid; the arsenic was found, by subsequent research, to come from the copper gauze we had used.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The copper gauze being dissolved, set free any arsenic that was in it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; chlorate of potass is a cooling medicine, and acts as a diuretic—we had not tested the copper before using it by destroying it in that way; we had in the ordinary way by boiling it; but it was the chlorine in this salt that destroyed the copper—the test would have been one to be relied on if the effect of the experiment had not been to destroy the copper by the chlorine of the chlorate of potass—the arsenic was set free; our testing had not gone the length of guarding against that; that is to say, it is never necessary to dissolve the copper; as a general rule, in applying the test we never dissolve the copper—the chlorate of potass is a cooling mixture, and it is also moderately diuretic; it acts on the kidneys, and so far tends to carry off other matters—I have heard the evidence of the symptoms under which this lady laboured, the remedies applied, and the post mortem appearances; taking all the circumstances into con<lb></lb>sideration, I can ascribe the death to nothing but the action of irritant poison.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you examined in this case before the Magistrate and the Coroner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I think twice before the Magistrate and once before the Coroner—I have spoken of finding traces of arsenic in the evacuation No. 2; it was altogether less than a quarter of a grain—I have stated that it was about the hundredth part of a grain from the two teaspoonsful, and there were 17 teaspoonsful; 34 altogether in the bottle; and if the amount were the same throughout it would be about seventeen-hundredths of a grain, that would be the proportion of one-sixth part of a grain; I always reckoned it so; I think you will find in my deposition before the Magistrate that I stated it—I used the copper gauze that is here—I have got in my laboratory copper gauze, copper foil, and copper wire—this was a portion of the same copper gauze that I afterwards used with bottle 21—in every experiment I tested the copper to see whether it contained arsenic by boiling it, as I have explained to his Lord<lb></lb>ship—the copper was used in every other vessel, and observe, there was no change until the suspected liquid was added; that is, until the evacuation was added—from the copper I used in my experiment on bottle No. 21 I actually deposited, myself, arsenic in the liquid that remained; and the reason was this, it was the only bottle of the whole number which con<lb></lb>tained chlorate of potass, and it was the chlorate of potass which destroyed the action of the test—Dr. Odling assisted me; he made an independent experiment himself on the mixture, and came to the same conclusion that arsenic was present in bottle No. 21 in the liquid we were analysing: in that respect he was wrong, as I was wrong—besides Reinsch's test I applied March's teal to bottle 21, that is, to a portion of the same liquid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150143"></xptr>
               <p>that I was examining, and which contained the chlorate of potass; I did not know fully then, when I was making this examination, that the chlorate of potass was present; I had to find that out—we found, ulti<lb></lb>mately, that we had deposited arsenic, but our belief at the time was that the arsenic was in the liquid—I stated that belief most positively, both to the Coroner and to the Magistrate—I made the discovery on the afternoon of the 20th—on the morning of the 21st I went down, and having commu<lb></lb>nicated the matter to my friend, Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, he thought that it was such an important subject that it ought not to be for one moment concealed—I did solemnly, on my oath, before the Magistrate, and before the Coroner, state, more than once, that I had discovered arsenic in the bottle, and it was my belief at the time that it was there—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were not your words before the Magistrate, "Understand, Sir; I tested all my tests before I made this discovery of arsenic"—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is, we tested them in the usual way in which they are tested for the application of this process—I have used the copper gauze for fourteen years, and I never found a trace of arsenic in it until this—I have given evidence before on the faith of this copper gauze, and shall do so again; but I shall take care not to put chlo<lb></lb>rate of potass in my liquid—I have made in this case seventy-seven analyses—arsenic was found, only in one; and if there were any strength in your remark, arsenic would be found in every one—I first gave evidence about this on the 21st of May, I think; I think it was the 21st of May; either the 21st or 20th; I think it was the 20th—I have a note of the day on which I attended; it was on Friday, May 20th (<hi rend="italic">The deposition being put in and read, contained Dr. Taylor's statement that he found arsenic in the bottle.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you delivered that evidence before the Magistrate and Coroner you firmly believed, did you not, that you had made a correct analysis of this bottle, and had discovered arsenic in it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—and I firmly believed that that arsenic had been placed there at that time, not by my tests, but by somebody else—that did not enter as an element into my judgment—I intended by the term "the analysis," the discovery of antimony in the body—I did not include that, when I used the expression, "and from the analysis I have made"—I excluded it, in so far as this, that I told the Magistrate and Coroner that the symptoms were more referable to antimony than to arsenic—I am not sure whether that is in my deposition, but that is what I said, whether it is in the deposition or not. (<hi rend="italic">The other depositions were put in and read. In the deposition of 20th May it appeared that the witness stated, "I can only account for death by supposing it to be the result of antimony and arsenic administered in small doses at intervals.</hi>") I have to state that I had not made the analysis at the time of the deposition which has just been read; therefore, I could give no opinion of the cause of death—at the time I gave that evidence, the result of it was this, that if this 6-oz. bottle had been full of the mixture that I analyzed, in each ounce there would have been a grain of arsenic, which would certainly have been a very serious mixture to administer to any one situated as the deceased was—the bottle I had was only partly full—I formed no judgment about the administration of this liquid to the deceased at all—we fully and finally came to the conclusion that it was the copper which had deposited the arsenic somewhere about the 7th June—I made my original analysis, in which this mistake was made, from half of the contents which had remained in the bottle—Dr. Odling took a portion afterwards to make his independent examina<lb></lb>tion—we then sealed the bottle, and resolved to do nothing more with it—we did not receive special directions to analyze the remainder; we advised</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150144"></xptr>
               <p>it ourselves, considering the circumstances—the subsequent analysis was made in conjunction with Professor Brande; we asked him to be present—Professor Brande, Dr. Odling and myself were together—Professor Brande used Marsh's test—Reinsch's process was also used; no other, we had so little liquid to operate upon; there were only two or three teaspoonsful to operate upon; three teaspoonsful altogether—one teaspoonful was sub<lb></lb>jected to one test, and two to the other; one to Reinsch's, two to Marsh's—we then agreed that there was a mistake in the original analysis—my copper was tested before that; that led to the necessity of testing the contents of the bottle—by being tested. I mean entirely destroying the copper—we destroyed it with chlorate of potass, and also with nitric acid—the acid of the human stomach would have no effect at all in dissolving copper—I do not think it would—it might, to a limited extent, dissolve copper: to a very limited extent—it would be difficult to suppose that any quantity should be dissolved, because copper is not dissolved by acid except under the free access of air, which cannot get into the body—it might have a limited, or a very limited effect—my tests have been contested; they have been disputed sometimes; at least, they have been examined into—I never re<lb></lb>member an occasion when I conscientiously believed my tests were correct, and they were found not to be correct upon further examination—I have no recollection of an instance of that kind occurring with Professor Rodgers—I never analyzed powders for the purpose of discovering arsenic with that gentleman; but I remember, eleven years ago, I had to give an opinion about his analysis here: I do not remember analyzing; I do not remember an instance in which my tests were objected to, I myself believing them to be correct, and afterwards finding that I was wrong; nothing of that sort, most certainly—I speak of chlorate of potass as a diuretic, and capable of carrying off the arsenic in the urine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing no foreign agent of that kind to be used in cases of slow poisoning by arsenic or antimony, would you not expect to find traces or deposits in small quantities, more or less, of antimony or arsenic, in the tissues of the body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would depend upon several circumstances—in cases of slow arsenical poisoning, I look, as a general rule, for arsenic in the tissues, and expect to find it—I communicated, by a paper to Mr. Penrhyn, that I had found arsenic in the evacuation; but not to Mr. Buzzard, that I know of—this was while the lady was living, and I judged it was passing from her body—I wrote a letter, I think it was to Dr. Julius or to Mr. Penrhyn—supposing there is no disturbing influence, we expect, as a general rule, in cases of slow arsenical poisoning, to find the actual metal in the tissues—the question was put to me, as to whether chlorate of potass would have any particular effect, and I said it would act as a diuretic, and carry off the arsenic or any mineral matter that might have been administered—before I analyzed this bottle, I had never had any actual experience of the effects of chlorate of potass in carrying off any mineral poison—when I found the chlorate of potass, I did not form this as a theory in my own mind to account for the absence of arsenic in the body, that it had been carried off by means of this diuretic; there are other causes which might lead to that in this particular case; that is not one; it did not enter into my consideration beyond this, that it acts generally as a diuretic; and the question put to me by Mr. Serjeant Ballantine was with regard to mineral matter, or foreign matter, not arsenic—(if you look at the depositions; you will see) whether it had not the property of carrying off foreign or metallic matter from the body—that was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150145"></xptr>
               <p>the question—I was called in, in the case of Mr. Wooler, who was tried at Durham, for the murder of his wife in 1855, by slow poisoning—I went down by order of the Government—I made myself master of all the details of that case—there was no question there that the poison had been administered; the only question was, by whom—arsenic was discovered in the tissues of that lady's body, and in the liver—it was found in all parts of the body, more or less—I had to examine the liver and intestines—the total quantity I found was a grain—Dr. Richardson, of Durham, found half a grain, and she had taken the poison for seven weeks—I found a grain in the liver and intestines, taken together; that allows for calculation for the whole—there might have been more in the rest of the body, but I cannot say that—that was the whole I found—the liver is the great criterion; it is the great seat of deposition—I did not examine the stomach; it was examined by Dr. Richardson of Durham—I did not see it at all, and know nothing of the state of it from my own knowledge—I heard the evidence of some other gentleman about it (<hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered that evidence as to this could not be given, not being within the witness's own knowledge</hi>)—As a result of slow arsenical poisoning the stomach might present this appearance, that all the groups of vessels might be gorged with blood, that might be so great as to be almost universal, I mean congestion of the vessels of the stomach—it was so in this case—there might be effused blood under the mucous membrane—there would be a great effusion, undoubtedly—in irritant poisoning there is generally effusion of blood—pustular eruption of the skin is sometimes the result of poisoning by arsenic, but it is not very common—inflammation of the conjunctiva, or lining membrane of the eye, is a frequent consequence of slow arsenical poisoning—it existed in Mrs. Wooller's case—I did not see her living; I only know it as a fact that I heard at the trial—I can state as a matter of science that it is so—inflammation of the conjunctiva is a frequent result of slow poisoning by arsenic—there is an eruption known to science called the <hi rend="italic">eczema arsenicale;</hi> it has received its name because of its appear<lb></lb>ance on the skin in the case of slow arsenical poisoning—excoriation of the anus is a symptom in slow arsenical poisoning—great redness of the nostrils, and even ulceration, would be a symptom of slow arsenical poisoning—some<lb></lb>times the mouth and the lips are excoriated—when the arsenical eruption takes place, it appears on the arms, and sometimes on the free and neck—the arms and hands are the parts generally affected—a hacking cough is a frequent attendant upon slow arsenical poisoning, where there is irritation in the throat,—a mucous discharge any way is always increased by the action of arsenic—I am not acquainted at all with instances of dysentery; I only know about it as a matter of general medical knowledge—I never attended any cases of dysentery—I do not practice or visit patients—my avocations are chiefly in regard to legal medicine—in antimonial poisoning a clammy sweating is chiefly observed where there are not discharges in other directions; where there is not diarrhoea—I have myself stated that that is what I look to as a consequence of antimonial poisoning—suppos<lb></lb>ing the discharge takes place more from the bowels, then there is less from the skin; if the bowels are constipated, then these perspirations occur; still that is a symptom—if the bowels are constipated there will be a clammy skin; but if there is diarrhoea and vomiting, then the fluids pass out in that direction, and I should not expect it—in all cases of antimonial poisoning there is not invariably vomiting; it depends upon the dose—in antimonial poisoning I have recorded instances where there was no vomiting: one instance; but as a rule I expect it from the administration of doses of antimony—I also expect purging generally as a consequence—I believe</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150146"></xptr>
               <p>that a cold clamminess of the skin would exist, but not a feverish state of the skin—the administration of small doses of antimony would have a tendency to enlarge the liver, and to cause a deposit of fat, and sometimes to soften it; the chief thing is the deposit of fat—small doses of antimony have been found to cause enlargement of the liver and also to cause a deposit of fat on it, and also sometimes to render it brittle—this liver was firm, decidedly—according to my experience, slow poisoning by antimony has not a tendency to soften the liver, but cases are recorded in which it has softened the liver; I believe it depends more upon the amount of fat deposited—I have stated in a book that I have written on this question of antimony, before this case, about a deposit of fat being a consequence of it, and in a remarkable way, that at Strasbourgh they actually give sulphate of antimony in their food to fatten their livers—it has a tendency to soften the liver, to deposit the fat; I stated that in my book in the case of the poisoning of Ann Palmer; in the Guy's Hospital Reports there is a full account of that case.</p>

I was formerly Professor of Chemistry to the Royal Institution, and have been engaged in the practice of chemistry for fifty years—I was required to examine a portion of the liquid that had been in the hands of Dr. Taylor, with a view to ascertain whether, in reality, there was any arsenic in it—I examined a portion of it by Reinsch's test, and a portion by Marsh's test, and the conclusion I arrived at was that there was no arsenic—I have heard of the liquid composed of chlorate of potass; it turns out that that has the effect of dissolving copper—when matters do not contain any substance that does not actually dissolve the copper, Reinsch's test is in all cases an admirable one; in my opinion and judgment it was properly applied to test the intestines and evacuations; and in my opinion the result obtained was a correct one, one upon which I would act.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How much did you give each time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About one-third of a grain for a dose, as near as possible, from one-third to one-fourth, and with a scruple of the potassa upon an average, but it varied a little; when the animal was ill it would not take its food; sometimes it refused its food, and then I had to vary the dose a little; I then killed the animal and made a post mortem and chemical analysis in conjunction with Dr. Thudichum and Dr. Webb—I found arsenic in the liver, in the lungs, in the heart, a trace in the spleen and in the kidneys, but by far the greater part in the liver. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is what you would have expected to find if you went on feeding it and giving it arsenic, and then killed it sud<lb></lb>denly and made the examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a question whether chlorate would eliminate it; that was what I was aiming at; that was the chief object of the experiment, to show that chlorate of potassa does not elimi<lb></lb>nate it, that is the whole value of that special experiment chemically; I</p>

               <p>would add that there was intense inflammation in the stomach of that dog, and in the lower part of the alimentary canal intense ulceration; the ali<lb></lb>mentary canal of a dog generally resembles the human—arsenious acid is what is ordinarily called arsenic; it is the white arsenic—I administered arsenic, the metal—when they talk of a grain of arsenic, they do not mean a grain of the metal, they mean a grain of white arsenious acid—I cannot say how much arsenic I found altogether, but there was abundant evidence of very fine mirrors of arsenic on glass—I will not venture to say that I found half a grain, or a grain; I could not venture to give that kind of evidence at all which was not determined absolutely by the balance—I did not take it for the purpose of making a quantitative analysis at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Give me leave to say the value of the experiment is nothing if you give a dog arsenic day by day for 16 days, and then it is killed, and some arsenic is found left in it; is that all it proves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was done to prove whether after arsenic had been given in small quantities with an over<lb></lb>whelming portion of chlorate of potassa, the chlorate would eliminate the arsenic as fast as it was introduced—I left twelve hours between the interval of the last dose and the destruction of the dog, which was purged and was sick in the meantime—I did not examine the motions, I did the urine, and found arsenic in it—I think I could really venture to say that I found one-fourth of a grain in the body, but, with your Lordship's permission, I would rather put it in this way; that if in the case of supposed death from arsenic I found as much arsenic as I found in the tissues of that animal, I should have no doubt about connecting the case with arsenical poisoning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> All that the experiment proves is, that chlorate of potassa does not eliminate the whole of the arsenic, because it eliminated all but half a grain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> But if there had been no chlorate of potassa given, as I shall show by a future experiment, the result would have been the same; the chlorate made no difference—I had given 18 grains in 16 days, and there was some arsenic left, but what I cannot say, in the tissues I examined—I examined a limited portion of the body; I think I could from that say that there was in the whole body half a grain, but what I meant was the amount of arsenic that came before me—I could not form any opinion how much was left in the whole animal; there were no data to guide me to such an opinion, not even whether there was a grain or half a grain; my attention was at that time directed to a supposed discovery of a mixture of chlorate of potass and arsenic in this case; I afterwards took two other dogs, and placed them under the same conditions, I mean living in the same way and fed with the same food, in the same way and gave the same quantity of arsenic, one had anti<lb></lb>mony and one had arsenic on alternate days; one with, and one without chlorate of potass, that animal died in eleven days; it had two and a quarter grains of antimony; I gave it three doses a day; that would be little less than one-third of a grain in each dose; the other dog was started at the same time, June 15th; it was commenced with the same day and continued in the same way, with alternate doses of arsenic and antimony—that third of a grain applies both to arsenic and antimony; this dog had chlorate of potassa besides; it had three grains with each dose—it died the morning after the other, on the twelfth day from the commencement of the experiment—the object of these experiments was to compare the effect of having the chlorate of potassa and the not having it, and it made no difference, either as regards symptoms, pathology, or the chemical result—I collected the urine of the dog that was taking no chlorate of potass, and found arsenic in that also, as well as in the other, during the time.</p>

               <p>pass away to some extent by the urine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Always—the symptoms detailed as having taken place in the case of Miss Bankes are not altogether reconcilable with slow poisoning by antimony, not taking them altogether; sweating would be one of the symptoms in a case of slow antimonial poison<lb></lb>ing, profuse sweating, especially in the early stage of the process—a kind of pustular eruption is also a symptom—I have seen it in one case, and it is frequent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have seen it in one case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; where antimony was given in excess; that was not a fatal case, it was where antimony was con<lb></lb>tinued for a long time and in large doses—it was virtually a case of poison<lb></lb>ing, but it was given properly as a medicine—the pustular eruption appeared in consequence of the excess of the antimony; it was given in moderately large doses; the doses were one-third of a grain of the tartar emetic every four hours—I have seen no other case where the poison acted slowly, but I have seen two cases of acute poisoning by antimony, neither of them fatal—they had not pustular eruption; the attack was not long enough—I have seen no other cases of slow poisoning.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As a matter of medical science and reading, would you expect to find those two symptoms, sweating and pustular eruption? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They have been very commonly noticed in cases of this kind—I can only speak of the effects of antimony on the liver from experiments I made in 1856-7; it was a series of experiments that I performed on animals—there are really no data upon which to form a judgment of the effect of antimony on the human liver—it has been found softened—there is nothing of this sort recorded in any medical book that the profession at large can refer to; the evidence is exceedingly scanty—there have been so few cases of chronic antimonial poisoning carefully recorded—the liver is very imperfectly noticed in the best case of the kind, that is McMullen's case—there is a reference to it in Dr. Taylor's book—I hope I am quite understanding the questions; I am speaking only of chronic cases, where the antimony has been given over a long time; the case in question is what I should call a chronic case—in a case of slow antimonial poisoning I should expect an effect on the lungs, congestion possibly, from the great fluidity of the blood, which exists always in antimonial poisoning—I have no experience of that fact in the human subject, only on animals—if antimony were exhibited in small doses, I should expect to find it on analysis in the liver; that is from experiments on animals, and from experi<lb></lb>ments that have been made on the human subject, from what I have read, and from experiments—I heard Dr. Taylor examined—the liver is the great depot both for arsenic and antimony—I have not had very much experience of dysentery—I have seen a few cases; I can scarcely recollect how many; perhaps two or three in this country—I have suffered from it myself—the word dysentery is of very general import or construction; it is used very loosely—I should prefer to take Dr. Abercrombie's definition of it; he being the greatest writer on the subject, both of the acute forms and the chronic—my description of it would be a disease marked by purging, the matters thrown off by the bowels being tinged with blood, or mucus, or bile, not always the same in each case, but ordinarily, and marked definitely, occa<lb></lb>sionally or always, with blood, sometimes with shreds of membrane, taking on a form of dysentery, which I believe has been called, by the German school, diptheretic dysentery, more recently; attended not unfre<lb></lb>quently with vomiting, intense thirst in proportion to the purging and vomiting; in fact, in proportion to the loss of fluid sustained by the body; and attended with great prostration and sinking—fatal cases of dysentery</p>

               <p>are by no means uncommon in this country, if we take the mass of cases—the dysentery I have described, if carried to an extreme extent, would have the effect of injecting the coecum, and effusing it with black patches—I have never in my own experience met with a case of dysentery in the early stage of pregnancy—I have seen diarrhoea and vomiting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having heard the description of the liver, as examined after death, in your judgment would Isabella Bankes have been a likely subject for dysen<lb></lb>tery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think so; dysentery sometimes comes on of its own accord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You tell me that, having heard the description of her liver, you think she would be a probable subject of dysentery; I ask you whether, having heard that she was liable to nausea and frequent sickness, that would confirm or alter your view that she was a favourable subject for dysentery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> So far, that it would point out that she was a favourable subject for disease of the liver—I mentioned that I had seen one case of diarrhea in early pregnancy—I know, apart from my own experience, that diarrhoea and sickness are met with in pregnancy—persons in the family-way are subject to diarrhoea as well as other people—I have met with one instance of diarrhoea arid vomiting as a consequence of pregnancy, arising from it—that was between the third and fourth month—I never met with it between the fifth and seventh week—the sickness and vomiting of pregnancy ordinarily increases, then decreases, and sometimes increases again—the earlier stages are those in which it is the most violent ordinarily—sickness is sometimes the very first indication of pregnancy—if a person were subject to bilious attacks I should consider them predisposed to irritation of the mucous membrane from any cause—I have analysed the ordinary drug, trisnitrate of bismuth, which is the form of bismuth usually administered in medicine, and every specimen of bismuth in London that I have examined contained arsenic—I have not made a quantitative analysis—as a matter of medical science, I am aware that arsenic is generally found in bismuth; the quantity varies very materially—the largest quantity that I am acquainted with is very nearly half a grain to the ounce; there are 480 grains in an ounce—I examined but one specimen myself, but I saw ten—the specimen that I examined came from Squire and McCulloch's—I have a patient to whom I have given bismuth as a medicine—I analysed the urine of that patient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How much did you give? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five grains of bismuth three times a day, from Tuesday morning till Sunday night, six days; that would be 90 grains—the urine passed on the seventh morning was subjected to analysis—I did it with Dr. Thudichum and Dr. Webb, and found arsenic—I could not give the quantity; it was a distinct evidence, a good metallic mirror in the tube, but I would not say that there was the fiftieth part of a grain represented—the medicine was commenced on July 26th this year (<hi rend="italic">looking at a book</hi>), and continued to Sunday, the 31st, but I did not put the termination—it was for dyspepsia, a form of disease I frequently give bismuth for.</p>

               <p>evidence carefully through, and then I got a dog to try it—the experiments on the other dogs were a continuation—I did not communicate the result of those experiments to Dr. Smethurst or to anybody—Mr. Humphreys, the solicitor for the defence, called on me and asked me, not in reference to the experiments, but as a scientific man, some particulars, without knowing I had been antimonising the dogs or giving the arsenic—it was not done so that it might come round to Mr. Humphreys' ears—I had communicated it to two or three of my fellow lecturers at the Grosvenor School; that is what was called St. George's School in Palmer's trial—it is the school established by Mr. Lane; and in order to distinguish it from the hospital, it is called the Grosvenor School—Mr. Lane has nothing to do with it now—I have not the slightest knowledge how it was that Mr. Humphreys called on me—I was not quite surprised—the experiments I made in 1856 were likewise to dis<lb></lb>cover arsenic; they were not for the purpose of Palmer's trial; they were both before and after the trial—I did not mention them in that case at all—I was a witness in that case—I did not come to prove that the death was caused by angina pectoris; I gave evidence about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In that case the imputation being, death by strychnine, you came to prove that it was angina pectoris? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That it might be angina pectoris; I did not say that it was—I gave a case that was caused by it, and which was analogous to the man Cook's case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not asked "Are the symptoms described in the evidence more like the symptoms of angina pectoris," and was not your answer, "Speaking scientifically, I should say that the person suffering under them was more likely to be labouring under angina pectoris." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot answer whether those were my words or not; it is not the effect of them, not if the case was put correctly—I in no way endorsed the theory of angina pectoris—I gave it on the trial of Palmer, who, it was said, poisoned a person by strychnia, but I gave no negative opinion about strychnia, it was affirmative all through that it was analogous to Cook's case, and that Cook's symptoms might be taken for what I had seen—I gave the opinion from a case of my own, that the death of Cook might be from angina pectoris—I did not say that the symptoms were more likely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say they were more like it than death by poisoning?—did not this pass: "Do I understand you to say that, in your opinion, it was a case of angina pectoris?" "I do; it accords with all the descriptions of angina pectoris by the best authorities." And did you not then quote La<lb></lb>tham, Watson, Bolleau, Sir Everard Holme, and Ridge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Latham I quoted; that is, Latham on diseases of the heart, in 2 vols; but I quoted more than are there—the weight of what I said rested on a case that I had seen—my opinion was founded on experiments mainly, and on the best authorities—I do not dispute, in point of fact, that I went to support the theory of angina pectoris—I have not given evidence in other criminal cases; only before coroners' juries, not on trials for murder—I have given evidence eight or nine times before coroners; I cannot recall it at the moment; I have been neither on the part of prosecution or of the accused; they were cases where an accident had occurred, and I had seen the patient before or after death; there has been no prosecution—I have not been a scientific witness in any case except Palmer's; I was consulted on one criminal case, and gave an opinion, but was not called—on the 26th I got a large dog; I gave him 18 grains of arsenic in 16 days; I do not know how much came out, but a con<lb></lb>siderable quantity would be eliminated; the dog was kept tied up, or he would not have stayed; the arsenic was put in his food as long as he would take it; the fact is, he was made to take it, because if he did not he was</p>

               <p>left without it; he took it very well—he took it in milk very frequently—the chlorate of potassa was made into a solution with the arsenic—he did not take the arsenic in milk, and the chlorate of potassa sometimes in milk and sometimes in something else—I mixed the two together first, in a solution, and it was put into milk sometimes, and sometimes it was mixed with chopped meat—I dissolved the chlorate of potassa by putting it into water, and to make sure of dissolution of the arsenious acid, I boiled it, and let it cool—I looked at the urine—the arsenic would go off by means of the chlorate of potassa—I did not examine the urine in either experiment, to ascertain the amount of arsenic eliminated—no part of my chemical analysis was quanti<lb></lb>tative—I did not once very nearly poison a patient myself with antimony—it was not a patient of mine, nor a friend's patient—it was many years ago—I think it was in 1848—I saw the case with a medical man—the patient did not die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am alluding to a case in which you gave 15 minims to a stout, active, well built man, who asked you to prescribe, and to be careful (<hi rend="italic">reading from the Lancet</hi>) "There was no mistake in the dose; the dose was taken, and from its result I lost caste with the patient for some time. I admit that the re<lb></lb>sults were severe, and such as no medical man would expect from such a dose. There was no purging, but abdominal pain and griping." Is that your description? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I beg pardon; you are referring to another case—I am not prepared at this moment to say how much actual antimony there would be in the sixteenth of a grain; it would be from the one-eighth to the one-sixteenth of a grain; from the one-twelfth to the one-sixteenth of tartar emetic—all these serious results were produced on a fine healthy subject—it surprised me exceedingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose after that you would not like to pledge yourself for the operation of antimony on the human subject; to give any opinion of the results to be produced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As a general thing I could—this was a stout active man; if it was a woman, who was not prepared to receive it, it would make no difference—frequently feeble persons bear it very well—sometimes it causes purging, and sometimes, in eases of antimonial poisoning, it causes costiveness—there are not sufficient cases to prove that it more frequently causes purging—it causes sickness and heat in the throat—it would depend entirely upon the general history of the case; but if immediately after taking medicine, heat is felt from the mouth, through the body, to the anus, through the whole intestinal canal, that would be in accordance with a large dose of copper—that would also be caused by other substances; but arsenic, immediately after taking, does not produce pain, nor does antimony immediately afterwards, not as it is taken—I do not think a sulphate of copper pill, with a quarter of a grain in it, would produce a burning sensa<lb></lb>tion from the mouth to the anus—I have never prescribed it—any irritant poison given for a long time would produce that effect unquestionably—if a person had been kept under the influence of irritant poison two or three weeks, and a further dose of irritant poison was given, the effect would con<lb></lb>tinue—if the irritant poison had been administered from time to time, in small doses, for three or four weeks, and a larger dose than usual was ad<lb></lb>ministered, it would produce purging, and it might produce a burning sen<lb></lb>sation through the whole intestinal canal—I would not say it would do that always—supposing a person to be suffering from violent irritation, however caused, of the intestines, there are medicines that could be properly given, that would produce such an effect—I believe the whole class of metallic medicines would produce that effect.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have already told me that the quarter of a grain of sulphate of copper pill would not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> But I am assuming a healthy person—I did say that in a healthy person the effect would not be immediate, but would only be the result of a continuation; but that was with regard to arsenic and antimony—I agree that arsenic and antimony, given for a long time, would produce those symptoms to which I have referred—I would not say that the symptoms would not be brought on at once by arsenic or antimony admi<lb></lb>nistered for the first time—arsenic would produce it, especially as compared with antimony—I have never in my experience met with or heard of a case in which antimony and arsenic were used, each of them occasionally, on the human subject—the tests applied to the discovery of poison are not confined to cases where there has been only one poison used, but the majority of cases would be those in which only one poison was used—almost all the cases in which medical men have experience, are cases of one poison only—when I speak of dysentery, I do not speak of the Eastern form, not of tropical dysentery, but of the disease of this country—I have been speaking to you of what is known in medical science as acute dysentery—acute dysentery and Eastern dysentery are not necessarily terms used for the same disease—acute dysentery does not mean the dysentery of hot climates—there is a form of disease which in some districts differs from the dysentery of hot climates—I have never seen a body opened which died of any form of dysentery—the dysentery I speak of may occur in this country, either from a specific poison, or from disease of the intestines—I have never met with a form of dysentery which I supposed to be epidemic, or arising from the taking in of a poison—the form of dysentery which I should think a lady, with a liver like Miss Bankes, would be subject to, would be the form of sub acute dysentery; not dysentery arising from poison, but which is prolonged over a very considerable period—I do not mean chronic dysentery, but sub acute dysentery; some<lb></lb>thing between acute and chronic, but too severe to be strictly chronic—that would not harden the coats of the stomach—it would produce a great deal of mischief in the bowels—it would not thicken them, but it would lead probably to a deposit of false membrane—it would not harden them, but a false membrane would—if there was very great congestion, the wall would be thicker.</p>

I was a professor of chemistry for 17 years, at the Old St. George's School of Medicine, which I resigned on my appointment to Known College—I am a registered Doctor of Medicine—I am not now properly engaged—I left the St. George's School about two years ago—I was examined as a witness on Palmer's trial—I am acquainted, by</p>

               <p>my reading, with the effects of slow poisoning by arsenic upon the human body—I know a drug or chemical mineral called chlorate of potass—I am constantly called upon by Coroners to make chemical analyses of the contents of human bodies—I think I have the greater number of cases in London—chlorate of potass is in itself a perfectly innocent salt—I do not think that, supposing small doses of arsenic or of antimony were administered to the human subject, either in chlorate of potass, or chlorate of potass cotem<lb></lb>poraneously administered, the action of the chlorate of potass would have the slightest effect in eliminating the poison from the system; if it did so, you would have no poison—if chlorate of potass was removing poison from the system as it was given, the poison would not have time to act as such; and consequently, it would be a kind of antidote; it would be administering poison with an antidote at the same time; that is, if it would eliminate it, but I do not think it would—I have made experiments—I have given chlorate of potass with both antimony, and antimony and arsenic, and arsenic alone, and I have found just the same amount of poison in the animals as though there had been no such mixture given as chlorate of potass—I believe that chlorate of potass is a perfectly harmless agent—it is largely prescribed by many practitioners, and used as a wash for sweetening the mouth—if arsenic or antimony were given in small doses to a human patient for a period extending over four or five weeks, I should, as a matter of chemical science, or as a matter of general science, medical or chemical, expect to find arsenic in the tissues, and antimony also, particularly in the liver; the liver is the great criterion—in a case of alleged arsenical or antimonial poisoning, the absence of the poison from the liver would cause me to doubt whether the allegation was correct—I should expect to find either arsenic or anti<lb></lb>mony under such circumstances in the kidneys and in the spleen as well; their absence would be a strong element in favour of that opinion—if I found poison in the blood, I should expect to find it in the tissues and everywhere; but if I found it in the liver, I should not necessarily expect to find it in sufficient quantities to determine its presence in the blood; it might be in the blood, but not in sufficient percentage, if I may so say—I do not believe it is possible to find traces of antimony in the blood without also finding it deposited in the liver—the blood in the heart must be regarded as a sample of the whole 28 lbs. or so that is circulating in the system: if you find it there in one small portion, you must find it wherever blood flows—in a case of alleged slow metallic poisoning, the absence of the poison from the tissues would raise the greatest doubt as to poison being the cause of death—my experience has been confined rather to chemical than medical researches—I have some medical knowledge, but I have not devoted myself to medical science or the pathology of diseases—I am a surgeon and apothecary—I have practised medicine—my specialty is toxi<lb></lb>cology and chemistry, not pathology—I am acquainted with the fact that the bismuth generally exhibited contains arsenic—I have in my pocket a quantity obtained from about six doses (<hi rend="italic">producing some</hi>)—by another analysis I found upwards of half a grain in an ounce of bismuth—an ounce is 480 grains—I think Marsh's test for discovering arsenic in bismuth is not a correct one to have used, for I have failed to find it by that process, when I have found it by another of my own—I heard Dr. Taylor state that he used Marsh's test, and I would state, that in the way he performed the experiment there may have been arsenic there, and he not find it—the object of Marsh's test is to get stains of that character, by a flame on the porcelain—if you have a very minute quantity, you have a very slight stain; for instance, on this piece of porcelain (<hi rend="italic">producing a piece</hi>), that was produced</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150159"></xptr>
               <p>by arsenic; but if the test had been made with a piece of glass of this description (<hi rend="italic">exhibiting a piece of glass</hi>), this, not having a white ground, would not show the stain, which the white would—as Dr. Taylor made his experiment with a piece of glass, I say that arsenic might have been in the bismuth, and yet not be found by that experiment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is half a grain the largest quantity you ever found in an ounce? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have never made the estimation before as to quantity, but I have had specimens that I have obtained such quantities from, that I should infer it would be larger—in that specimen the quantity I found was such as to make it improper to use bismuth as a medicine—I think that the state of bismuth in the medical market is not generally such that it is improper to use it as a medicine, only in some specimens—bismuth is frequently prescribed by physicians in cases where it would appear proper; and it has done injury instead of producing benefit; and I have very little doubt that that has been from arsenic there, and not from any fault in bismuth as a remedy.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you examined grey powder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but I am aware it is frequently impure; I know, as a matter of knowledge in my profession, that it frequently contains antimony—com<lb></lb>mercial mercury is used, and it is often impure; whatever would be in the mercury would be in the grey powder; I do not remember in what propor<lb></lb>tion, but I should think more than the arsenic I found in the bismuth—this I know more from what I have heard and ascertained, than from what I know from my own personal experiments—antimony is used in several medicines—if any traces of antimony were found in a body, the greatest caution should be used as regards attributing such traces to actual improper administration, owing to the circumstance that it is contained in a great many medicines that are innocently taken; in James's powder, for instance, and in a substitute for that, called antimonial powder; and then there is tartar emetic, and anti<lb></lb>monial wine—in a case of actual slow arsenical poisoning I should expect to find the smaller intestines greatly injected and ulcerated in parts—I have not seen a case of slow arsenical poisoning or any slow poisoning; they are very rare—I have seen cases of rapid poisoning by large doses of arsenic, but not by antimony; four days is the longest time that I have personally known—from my knowledge of the effects of mineral poison, such as arsenic or anti<lb></lb>mony, upon the mucous membrane and the lining of the intestines, I should expect to find, in a case of slow arsenical poisoning, the stomach and the small intestines greatly injected and effused with blood, and ulcerated in parts; the absence of those appearances would make me hesitate in attri<lb></lb>buting the death to slow poisoning; I should expect to see the conjunctival membrance of the eye suffused and injected and red; that is considered almost a specific result of slow arsenical poisoning; my attention would be immediately directed to the lining membrane of the eye—I am aware that there is an arsenical eruption called <hi rend="italic">eczema arsenicale;</hi> I should, from my reading, expect to find such eruption on the arms and shoulders in a case of slow arsenical poisoning—the lining membrane of the nostrils would be affected by arsenical poisoning—excoriation of the anus has also been observed, and all the orifices of the mucous tracks would be so—I should expect in a case of slow poisoning by antimony to observe as a symptom, whilst the poison was being administered over three or four weeks, a clammy perspiration of the body, a sort of death coldness; I may speak from my own experience there, for I have found antimony acting most injuriously upon persons—I should expect from the record of such things given by Dr. Taylor, and also from my experiments on animals, that in a case of small doses of antimony chronically administered, the liver would be softened—a great</p>

               <p>bulk, by far the greater portion of toxicological knowledge, that is a knowledge of the effects of poisons on the human frame, is derived from experiments on the lower animals—the cases of poisoning of human beings where opportunities for observation have been offered are very rare—it is the practice of the greatest toxicologists, both here and on the Continent, to make these experiments continually; and they are recorded in the greatest works on medical science; many are referred to in Dr. Taylor's own book; they are in Christison, and in Orfila, the great French toxicologist.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the St. George's School what is called the Grosvenor School? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is; it was the first school connected with St. George's—I appeared in Palmer's case, to prove that strych<lb></lb>nia may be found in a body if once the patient has taken strychnia—I appeared for the defence; I gave evidence that no strychnia appeared; that it must be found if the party died of that poison; that is decidedly the case—I had practised on animals for the purpose of coming to a conclusion, not exactly for Palmer's ease; but Dr. Taylor had made a statement that it could not be detected, and I, being constantly consulted upon these matters, was anxious to determine whether that was the case or not; I have done so on this occasion; another gentleman from the Grosvenor School (Dr. Richard<lb></lb>son) was also a witness then—if it is well ascertained that in an evacuation there is one-sixth of a grain of arsenic, I could form an opinion of how much arsenic had been in the body; if in an evacuation I separated the one-sixth of a grain of arsenic, I should be convinced that there was a large quantity remaining in the stomach somewhere or other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you ceased to be connected with the Grosvenor School? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two years—the Grosvenor School has been established about thirty years; it is a laboratory where chemical expe<lb></lb>riments are constantly being made; the Governors of St. George's Hospital would not allow an anatomical school to be attached to it, and it was esta<lb></lb>blished, by Mr. Lane, some thirty years ago—it is a separate school of medi<lb></lb>cine, not connected with St. George's Hospital—if I did not find any arsenic in a body from which an evacuation containing one-sixth of a grain of arsenic came, it would lead me to doubt whether the experiment had been correct or not—I do not think it a wise thing to use a piece of untested copper to make an experiment with upon such an evacuation, nor a piece of re; I always used pure electrotyped copper for experiments—there is a means known to skilled persons who make experiments of this kind, by which the copper they use may be perfectly pure and free from doubt—when a man's life is to be brought into question, unless the copper be perfectly pure and free from doubt, it is a most dangerous experiment to make as regards the ascertaining the existence of poison; to use untested copper leads to error—at the trial of Palmer, and with reference to strychnia, I confined my evidence to the statement of what I believed to be a chemical fact, viz., that if strychnia had been administered while living, and had caused death, it ought to have been found in the body; that is still my opinion, and I am not singular in that opinion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Doctor of Medicine and Lec<lb></lb>turer on Practical and Experimental Chemistry—I was a pupil of Professor Liebig—I also carried on chemical inquiries and investigations at the labora<lb></lb>tory at Heidelberg, and received the great Prussian medal—I have heard the evidence in relation to the symptoms exhibited by Isabella Bankes, also the treatment and the post-mortem examination—in my judgment her death is compatible with natural causes—I have met with instances of pregnancy, with diarrhoea combined, though in early stages of pregnancy only; but I</p>

               <p>know that such cases occur in all stages of pregnancy—in addition to the circumstance of pregnancy I should attribute the death of Isabella Bankes to diptheretic dysentery; I believe the term "diptheretic" dysentery is known everywhere; the name of diptehrites has been common these twenty years—taking the symptoms altogether, they are incompatible with slow arsenical poisoning; they are also incompatible with slow antimonial poisoning—in my judgment, the administration of chlorate of potass, either in slow arseni<lb></lb>cal or antimonial poisoning, would not modify the symptoms so as to make her death reconcilable with either—in cases of slow arsenical poisoning I should expect to find the stomach ulcerated—I quite concur in what Dr. Richardson and Dr. Rodgers have said upon the pathology that they would expect to find in the case of slow arsenical or antimonial poisoning—in either case I should expect to find the arsenic or the antimony, as the case might be, in the tissues after death.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing bismuth to be taken which contains arsenic, and it is used, and in an evacuation traces of arsenic are found, such as the 100th part of a grain in two spoonfuls, as Dr. Taylor stated, might the fact of bismuth so containing arsenic reasonably and scientifically account for the traces in an evacuation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might; if antimony was taken in a medicine, and a trace of antimony found in the intestines, that might reasonably and scientifically be accounted for by the presence of antimony in a medicine otherwise con<lb></lb>sidered harmless—that is what I mean by saying that it might account for the analysis.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How would you have ascertained that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By a close examination of the symptoms; and by an examination of the mammae and the uterus—if I found vomiting and purging going on, I should not have con<lb></lb>sidered the fact that the catamenae had appeared once, of any importance, because it will frequently appear once after pregnancy; that would not have prevented my examining into the existence of pregnancy.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We heard that this lady suffered from nausea and sickness, and vomiting; are you acquainted with cases of very severe vomiting from early pregnancy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am; in very severe cases of vomiting I know that the only way of stopping it, and saving the life of the mother, is to procure the abortion of the foetus—I am speaking of vomiting only—I know this from my study and reading—I do not know a case; they are certainly not cases of every day occurrence—the way in which pregnancy acts is by sympathetic irritation of the intestines—I am of opinion, founded on my practical experience and general knowledge, that severe vomiting, and severe diarrhoea, which would not yield to ordinary treatment, may arise from an early stage of pregnancy—if the pregnant woman, the subject of that severe vomiting and diarrhoea, was also subject to bilious irritation, that would increase the symptoms—in all cases of severe vomiting and diarrhoea, where great acidity is generated in the system, there in always a burning sensation in the intestinal canal, from whatever cause it may arise—I include the throat in what I speak of, and the whole intestinal canal; I have seen those symptoms in early pregnancy—if a patient who was suffering from severe dysentery and vomiting, and great consequent exhaustion, complained of the sensation of a ball in the throat, I should attribute it, if it was a female, to hysteria—I think there is a great distinction between what may be termed a ball in the throat, and the sensation of burning—great debility produces that sort of hysterical affection—thrush would be a popular word for apthous spots—such an appearance of the tongue might be presented during severe vomiting and diarrhoea, from whatever cause it might arise—I would say that appearance is observed in all cases of exhausting disease—I am aware that for the last few years it has been matter of obser<lb></lb>vation in obstetric science, that that thrushy appearance of the tongue occurs—exhaustion was, no doubt, the immediate cause of this lady's death—I consider sulphate of copper, nitrate of silver, and acetate of lead, most incorrect medicines to prescribe in the case of early pregnancy—bismuth is perhaps an exception, if pure; if of an arsenical description, it would also be a most incorrect medicine to prescribe—I think the lead, silver, and copper most improper, and the bismuth, unless it was pure—I consider that such medicines would have more tendency to increase irritation of the in<lb></lb>testines, if it existed, than to allay it—I am acquainted with a work by Dr. Hutchinson, of America, upon the diseases of pregnancy.</p>

               <p>Bankes, might arise from the vomiting and diarrhoea of pregnancy—I have read of cases of that kind which are fatal, and which sometimes baffle medical skill altogether—there is a disease known in this country called dysentery, which is fatal—I agree with Dr. Wilks, who was examined on the part of the prosecution, that cases of dysentery occur which it is impossible to refer to any particular cause—the two cases re<lb></lb>ferred to by him in Guy's, which were styled dysentery, were in fact cases of idiopathic dysentery; a disease which is killing hundreds every year in this country.</p>

               <p>sensation of the throat and of the intestinal canal, the sensation of a ball in the throat, accompanied by ulcerous appearances in parts of the body, that would not, in my judgment, necessarily lead to the conclusion that she must be the subject of arsenical or irritant poisoning, and that alone; unless I found other symptoms, it would never enter my head—in the case of anti<lb></lb>monial poisoning, I should expect to find a clamminess and cold perspiration of the skin; and, as far as any experiments that I have seen on animals go, I should expect to find a softening of the liver; but I cannot speak of the human subject—I think that a very large portion of the knowledge of the effects of poison on the human frame is derived from experiments on the lower animals—a large proportion of the use, the pathology of the parts of the body, is derived in the same way; every great fact in pathology is found out in the same way; the circulation of the blood and everything, and the use of certain nerves—Sir Charles Bell's division of the nerves has been very much confirmed, if not discovered, by experiments on animals—chlorate of potass is an innocent salt, and is used sometimes as a wash for the mouth; it would very probably be used advantageously in cases of foul breath—I am of opinion that it would not in any way affect the operation of arsenic or antimony if mingled with them—in cases of slow arsenical or antimonial poisoning, I should most decidedly expect, if death resulted, to find the poison in the tissues; as Dr. Taylor has said, the finding poison in the liver is the great criterion—as far as my reading enables me to judge, I should say that in cases of slow arsenical poisoning the small intestines are most likely to be affected, as far as their appearance after death is concerned—I have heard the appearance of the small intestines here, and I think their appearance and that of the stomach together are not compatible with arsenical poisoning—in cases of slow irritant poisoning, it is to the stomach and the small intestines that I should most immediately direct my atten<lb></lb>tion, especially to the stomach—in cases of slow irritant poisoning, the inner coating of the stomach is very much inflamed from injection of the vessels; it is suffused with red patches of blood, and it would very probably be ulcerated; certainly inflamed—the duodenum is the upper part of the small intestines—if the coats of the duodenum were firm, and there was no ulceration, that is not an appearance which I should expect to find after slow arsenical or irritant poison; in antimonial poisoning, I should expect to find the lungs after death intensely congested and red—supposing a person had had small doses of antimonial poison administered to her, I should certainly not expect to find the lungs pale or perfectly healthy—supposing Mr. Palmer's account to be correct, that the liver was very large, very hard in the left lobe, that would most certainly be an indication of a long standing disease, and would be what I should expect to find where a person had been suffering for some considerable time from bilious irritation and chronic inflammation—it is as much the peculiar effect of arsenic in small doses to influence the stomach as I have described, as it is of mercury to produce salivation; arsenic acts on the stomach specifically as much as mercury acts on the salivatory glands, or cantharides on the bladder; I should say on the urinary organs; I speak of the kidneys and bladder together; and in whatever way introduced into the system—in cases of antimonial poisoning, I should expect to find the stomach reddened, congested probably, and a condition of apthous ulceration; that has been observed in the human subject in cases of poisoning by antimony—in every case of poisoning by arsenic in animals that I have met, witnessed, or been a party to, I have found the inner coats of the mucous membrane of the stomach</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150167"></xptr>
               <p>very much inflamed, very red and ulcerated—I should expect to find arsenic in the kidneys and the spleen from slow arsenical poisoning, as well as the liver; I should expect to find it in the liver first—I start with the liver as the great criterion, from the absence of these symptoms and appearances in Miss Bankes's case, I am fortified in my opinion that she died from natural causes—if I am testing a liquid for the presence of arsenic or any other irritant poison, in arriving at a perfectly accurate judgment as to the quantity, I ought to make what is called a quantitative analysis; that is done by actually weighing the whole that I find—any other mode of proceeding is likely to lead to the most erroneous results, most certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Dr. Taylor calculated that there was the 1/100th of a grain of arsenic in two spoonsful of liquid, and then he appears to have multiplied those two spoonfuls by the whole quantity of liquid, and arrived at the result that about one-sixth of a grain of arsenic was contained in the whole; would you consider that to be a safe or reliable mode in a case where the life of a human being is concerned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I consider it a mere guess, and of no importance whatever—I have made experiments on bismuth, and have nearly found a grain of arsenic in an ounce of it; that is between four and five tenths of a grain—I never found more than that, but I can swear it was a quantitative analysis—I have analysed qualitatively, and thought I found more, but I cannot swear to it; because, unless a quantitative analysis is made, no one can swear to a chemical quantity—the qualitative is to find the agent, the quantitative is to find the presence and exact measure; therefore, without a quantitative analysis, I should be very sorry to swear to the exact quantity—that applies to every chemical substance, to arsenic as much as antimony—I have not examined grey powder—I took part in the analysis for finding arsenic in the urine of a gentleman who had been treated with bismuth for some complaint, and a trace of arsenic was found in the urine—no quantitative analysis was made there; it was a very small quantity, but quite sufficient to be certain it was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Doctor of Medicine, I have had considerable experience in midwifery—I have delivered upwards of 3,000 women—I have occasionally met with cases of pregnancy combined with diarrhoea and vomiting; diarrhoea superadded to vomiting; and I have had cases in which pregnancy was combined with dysentery; on one occasion of a very severe character, but from which the patient recovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, if a person were pregnant, and suffering from dysenteric symptoms, such as you observed in that case, would it be proper to give mineral medicines? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not give any in pregnancy, nor on any occasion whatever, unless I found it to be serviceable; not in any dysenteric case whatever, unless I made out the reason why I should give it—I would find out the immediate cause of the dysentery—in this country it generally proceeds from a disease, which has been very well expressed by a celebrated man, Dr. Copland, who has most admirably described the disease which is most common in this country—it commences in that portion of the intestine called the coecum, extending thence to the anus, inflammation of that portion of the intestine, ending in ulceration and death if it is not stopped—the best way to stop it is that which I adopted; the application of leeches to that portion of the coecum, which, if a careful practitioner exer<lb></lb>cises his fingers, he would be sure to find out—I have heard the symptoms which Isabella Bankes exhibited during life, the remedies, and the post mortem examination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, was her death to be attributed to poison or to the effects of dysentery combined with pregnancy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I see the whole of the symptoms traceable to the dysentery, and to the consequent ulceration and exhaustion—that would certainly account for the appearance of the coecum—idiopathic dysentery would be a proper phrase to give it—that is a special disease originating in itself, one single malady, one single suffering—preg<lb></lb>nancy and dysentery would quite account, in my judgment, for the diarrhea—I have had several cases of dysentery at the early stages of pregnancy, one of them very severe, in fact, contemporaneous with it, I would say, symptomatic of pregnancy—in many cases, instead of the usual change occurring at the period when women exhibit that change peculiar to them there has been some disease of diarrhoea in the early months of pregnancy; this would be much aggravated by a bilious temperament and any affection of the liver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician-accoucheur—I have for more than fifteen years devoted myself to midwifery and the diseases of women and children—I am the author of a book called "The Manual of Obste<lb></lb>trics," and of several other works—I am a Member of the Royal College of Physicians, and a Doctor of Medicine of the University of London—I have been present during very little of the medical evidence in this case—excessive vomiting in the early part of pregnancy is often met with; sometimes from the very earliest period—I am acquainted with instances in which this excessive vomiting in pregnancy has caused death; cases which have yielded to no medical treatment and ended in death—where symptoms of vomiting and general intestinal disturbance occur at the beginning of pregnancy, it would be advisable to ascertain whether pregnancy does actually exist; if I were called in to a patient, a married woman, suffering from vomiting and intestinal disorder during the child-bearing period, I should certainly think of pregnancy amongst other causes, and should do my best to ascertain whether it existed or not—sometimes the periods go on after pregnancy has commenced; in some cases during the whole of pregnancy, but those are exceptional cases, they not unfrequently happen—excessive vomiting would be one of the marked signs of pregnancy, just as the cessation of the monthly periods would be another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say "it not unfrequently happens;" do you mean that it happens to one woman in a hundred, or one in five hundred? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be difficult to give any statistical idea, but one very often meets with cases in which patients are regular during the early months—it certainly happens as often as once in a hundred times—the cessation of the monthly periods is an ordinary normal natural symptom of pregnancy—women who have any uterine disorder are more likely to be unwell during pregnancy than other women—I have been consulted in at least four cases of vomiting during pregnancy which ended in death, and a considerable number of other cases in which vomiting was excessive, and in which there was danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We have heard that this lady, Judging from the foetus, was from the fifth to the seventh week at the time of death; are you able to say whether an accurate judgment may be formed from the foetus as to the time, or might it be more than that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would require considerable skill to say the exact age of a foetus—I have seen great mistakes made by persons who considered themselves skilled—if a person accustomed to examine dead bodies said, I found a uterus which appeared to have been impregnated to the extent of from the fifth to the seventh week, that would be valuable, and one might say it was a foetus probably from the fifth to the seventh week; but there are instances in which the foetus may die and remain in <hi rend="italic">utero</hi> without development, and you may have the case of a foetus which has really been in <hi rend="italic">utero</hi> three, four, or seven months, only presenting the size of seven weeks—sometimes no decomposition takes place—where women have been subject to bilious irritation and bilious attack; they are more affected by vomiting and intestinal irritation, including occasional purging, than others, during pregnancy—I have seen occasional purging as frequently as three or four times a day in connexion with vomiting—in the case of pregnant women, who have been suffering from excessive vomiting accom<lb></lb>panied by occasional purging, there is sometimes observed an apthous or thrushy ulcerous state of the tongue and fauces; for the last three or four</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150172"></xptr>
               <p>years, since we have had diptheria and disorders of the throat in this country, many pregnant women, and women during their confinement, and during nursing, have been subject to an apthous state of the mouth—that has been observed more within the last few years than usual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the excessive vomiting in the early stage of pregnancy, accom<lb></lb>panied by occasional purging, produce a burning sensation in the throat and along the intestinal canal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In those cases, heartburn is a very com<lb></lb>mon symptom—it depends upon the secretion—if there is a great amount of acid in the stomach, the irruptations, the matters vomited, are more acid and burning than usual—the heartburn of pregnancy is a household term—a burning sensation along the intestinal canal, the throat, and so on, is often complained of in cases where nothing but ordinary pregnancy, attended by unusual vomiting, exists—the statement that the foetus was of about the age of seven weeks, makes no difference in the opinion I am expressing—the early part of pregnancy, the first three months, is the time specially marked by vomiting—that is inclusive of the whole period, from the beginning to the end of the three months—women who suffer from diseases of the <hi rend="italic">os</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cervex uteri,</hi> for which nitrate of silver is used as an injection, suffer more from inflammation in the stomach by the uterus than other persons; that, and the more frequent occurrence of the monthly periods in the early part of pregnancy, mark cases of disorder of the <hi rend="italic">os</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cervex uteri</hi>—a woman in the early stage of pregnancy, such as I have described, suffering from excessive vomiting, might also have purging and diarrhoea—the diarrhoea might degenerate into dysentery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known cases yourself where there has been excessive vomit<lb></lb>ing and general intestinal disturbance in the early stages of pregnancy, in which it has been necessary, to save the life of the mother, to abort the foetus and procure a miscarriage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a recognised practice in the vomiting of pregnancy which threatens life—nature generally does it herself, and this practice has arisen from an imitation of nature—if by an effort of nature the child is not got rid of, then the medical man intervenes and pro<lb></lb>duces abortion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known in your own practice cases of excessive vomiting, accompanied by purging or diarrhoea, with a burning sensation, such as you have described, erroneously attributed to poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have known one, case in which there was a great amount of vomiting, and some amount of purging, in which the friends of the lady could not be brought to believe that her husband was not poisoning her, they taking their impressions from themselves, from their own notions—the symptoms that I have described might become so violent from the natural causes I have alluded to, as to be mistaken for a case of poisoning; I have known that happen, and I have known evacuations examined by a chemist under that impression—I mean that I have seen that case in my own practice—an effervescing draught, composed of hydrocyanic acid (prussic acid) is one of the most valuable remedies in the vomitings of pregnancy—persons in these cases die of starvation, as much as though they were deprived of food—in fact no food is kept on the stomach—where persons are suffering from excessive vomiting there is a perfect indisposition to take food; it would give them a of vomiting to speak of or smell food—a woman in that state rejects everything, a few minutes after it is taken—vomiting would come on even when they are not taking food—I have known this vomiting to cease a few days or a few hours before death; that was the case with Charlotte Bronte, the well-known authoress, who died from the vomiting of pregnancy; for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150173"></xptr>
               <p>a short time before her death she was able to take food, and sickness ceased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In cases of death occasioned by the natural causes you have described, and which are within your particular knowledge, have you noticed a peculiar expression of the face? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The expression is that of death from starvation—it is recognised that there is a peculiar expression of the face in such cases—Dr. Paul Dubois, the first obstetrician in France at the present time, observed twenty cases of death by vomiting caused by pregnancy, in thirteen years, and he marks as one. of the four or five distinct signs of danger, a peculiar expression of the face, "a painful expression of the face," and I know of no other man who has had equal experience in the same space of time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the symptoms of vomiting and occasional purging had begun at the time that conception or pregnancy had begun, and had continued for four or five weeks, accompanied by the burning sensation of the throat and the intestinal canal, and apthous irritation in the mouth, and a sensation sometimes of a ball in the throat, do you believe that all these symptoms might have arisen from what you have described? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The ball in the throat I take to be an hysterical feeling; the other symptoms might; that is, if you consider morbid pregnancy a natural cause.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the discussion by Monsieur Dubois with a view to show that, not with standing all these symptoms, there was neither ulceration nor inflammation of the stomach and intestines? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not; I believe it had no reference to any ulceration of the intestines—if a pregnant woman has diarrhoea and dysentery, it would go on to sloughing, exactly as in natural dysentery or diarrhoea—if dysentery su<lb></lb>pervenes, there would be the dysenteric symptoms—I have seen cases in which death has occurred from vomiting, conjoined with purging, but I believe the vomiting to be the great cause of death in those cases—ordinarily, if dysentery be excessive, abortion is produced, or an irritation of the intestinal canal, the intestine is nearer the uterus than the stomach—dysentery kills by exhaustion.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing to a woman pregnant for the first time, say 40 years of age, or between 40 and 45, doses of irritant poison were administered, would you not expect then to procure abortion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think them more likely to procure abortion than idiopathic disease, disease arising by itself—we avoid, in the case of pregnant women, giving any medi<lb></lb>cine such as you have described, for fear of producing abortion; one would not salivate a person in the family-way—we avoid giving irritating medicines in those cases; we leave as much as we can to nature, but we would correct nature as far as possible.</p>

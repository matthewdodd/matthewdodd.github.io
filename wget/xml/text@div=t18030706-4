               <p>SARAH LEWIS sworn. - I let the room to the prisoner; he was to pay two shillings and sixpence a week; my husband gave him possession of the room; he never slept there at all, nor I never saw him again till he was taken up; he took the duplicate out of his pocket, and said he had pawned them.(A pawnbroker's servant produced a sheet, which was identified by Mrs. Lewis.)</p>

               <p>ALEXANDER STEVENS sworn. - I am a constable of Cripplegate ward (produces a duplicate and a sheet); I received the duplicate from the prosecutor, and the sheet from a pawnbroker in Fleet-market; he gave up the sheet, and refused to let his man come.(Mrs. Lewis identified the other sheet.)</p>

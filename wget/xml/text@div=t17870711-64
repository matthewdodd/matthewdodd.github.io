               <p>Did you see Steel then? - I cannot say in particular that I saw him, because it was dark; but there was no want of any one being absent, because the officers visited every one the same night.</p>
               <p>Does Steel and you go out in the same guard? - No, there are different guards, and we go to different places.</p>
               <p>Then how happens it that you so particularly remember this was on the 19th of May? - Because I heard a disturbance, and I got the roll of the guard, which the corporal has lost since; I recollected that this man was on duty at that time, as soon as I heard the disturbance.</p>
               <p>How came you to be so particular, as to remember that this was one of the men that was to go and relieve the guard at twelve at night? - Because I saw him march out.</p>

               <p>How far is that from the fire-engine in the road to Chelsea? - Better than a mile, my Lord, as far as I can guess; it was my business to post the centries, and I posted him myself; about twenty minutes, or a quarter before one, I went round with the serjeant, an officer, and two more, and all the men were on their posts; I did not see him particularly; but I found the men on their posts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. William Mardon—we are solicitors, in Newgate-street. The prisoner has been in our, service more than once—the last occasion was between Nov. and 13th April, when he left—his first duty was settling some accounts which were in arrear, and after that he was employed as out-of-door common-law clerk—he was to go to the public offices to issue writs and serve subpoenas, and do the me<lb></lb>chanical duty which was not done in chambers—we had a suit in which it was necessary to serve Mr. Glass with a subpoena—I have the prisoner's, day-book, in his own writing—I settled with him on Saturday his account for the week preceding—here is an entry, "Copy of subpoena served on Mr. Glass, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d."</hi>—I settled this account with the prisoner on 22nd Dec—this guinea was included in that account—the balance of it was money due to us—he carried forward 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., hut on casting up the book I find it was only 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due to us—that was carried on to the next week's account.</p>

               <p>subpoenaed Chapman, but I will not swear that Walker did not—there was a client named George Capstick—I do not know whether Walker did not serve him—Walker kept a book—I did not take it from him—he was discharged in April—I never discovered his irregularities till a day or two before he was discharged—I had required him to make up his book—his salary was three guineas a week, but we did not give it him towards the close, as he did not make up his account—he had no money furnished to him—he did no outdoor work—I cannot say that he did not issue a writ, but it would be contrary to his duty—I have never heard my partner come to the prisoner for money and give him the items, or any clerk in the office—I did not require from Walker the list of the irregularities—we found out a great number of irregularities—I do not know where Walker is—I have instructed the police to take him if they can find him—he always wore spectacles—there is in this book some marks of a W. against some items—here is "Bulpitt-court fees, Mr. W."—I don't know what it means—it is the prisoner's writing—it is an account I passed, but that was not there when I passed it, to the best of my belief—this balance of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is my writing, but the prisoner has put down his salary—he puts down the sums he receives and what he disburses, and at the close of the week he strikes the balance—his salary was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—if he put down his salary, the balances were sometimes in his favour, but his salary was not a payment—if he expended what money I gave him, he would apply to me for more—I discovered the irregularity about this guinea when the affidavits of increase were made—the prisoner had left four days before that—I had not consented that Walker should remain in our place after we discovered his irregularities—we dis<lb></lb>missed him directly—the prisoner said he had been the dupe of Walker; I said, "I am very sorry for you if it is so"—he said that, at the time Walker was discharged, on the 1st or 2nd of April—he was in our service a fortnight after Walker was gone—that was after we had discovered another irregularity with respect to the prisoner—he said he was the dupe of Walker, and we kept him on till we found something that he had robbed us of, with which Walker could have nothing to do—a week before Walker left I did not have him and the prisoner in my room and have some conversation about this account—the prisoner did not say, "Walker has had money of me, call him in"—if he had required it I should have had Walker in—the prisoner said that Walker had had money of him, but Walker was then gone—I never saw Walker after that expression of the prisoner.</p>

OVEREND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Walker left you on 1st or 2nd April? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and the prisoner left on the 15th—during that interval the prisoner had access to this book—on 17th Jan., here is the name of Walker opposite an entry—that account had been passed by me—if that name had been there then, I should have required to have had it explained, and not have passed it in this state—in my judgment, the word "Walker" is not in the same ink as the other writing—on the Saturday night before the prisoner left, I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that he has not entered in his book—this book was in his possession till the time he left—I made inquiries for him after the 15th, and was not able to find him—I found out this charge four days after he left—in the course of business, he would be aware that we were going to tax these costs—we could not get a bill of costs without the affidavit of this money—there were some things discovered before this, but they were distinct from this charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Edwards, of Sambrook-court. The prisoner served me with a subpoena on 31st Jan.—he paid me one shilling, and no more—that was in the suit of Edwards and Bartholomew—in obedience to that, I went and gave evidence.</p>

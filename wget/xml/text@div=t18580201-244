                  </hi>. I live in Wharf Road, Kingsland Road; I work for Mr. Silver, in the City. On the evening of 27th Jan. I went and got the materials to make half a dozen linen shirts, and one pattern shirt; they were done up in a paper parcel—I was going home, and as I went along Bishopsgate Street, the prisoner came out of a court, and took the parcel from under my right arm—he ran up the court, and I after him—he got to a place where I lost sight of him—I saw the face of the person who took the parcel—I met the policeman, and he got the prisoner; he was the person who had taken my parcel.</p>

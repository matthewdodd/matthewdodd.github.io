I am a butterman in the employ of the London, Brighton, and South-Coast Railway, Willow Walk Goods Depot—Stageman was in their employ—I delivered the butter to him, and it was his duty to deliver it to the consignees—on 4th November there was a consignment of 60 tubs and 72 crocks of butter for Dixon, Carter, and Co., of Whitechapel—I saw them laid on the prisoner's van—there were 40 firkins of butter marked "Finneau et Fils," which it was not Stageman's duty to deal with in any way, and I did not put them on his van—about an hour and a half after Stageman left the place I missed one of these firkins—this is it, and this is one of the tubs put on the van.</p>

I am a vanguard in the service of the Brighton Railway Company—I had been in the habit of going out in the van driven by Stageman about two months before 4th November—I went with Stageman in the van after it was loaded with the tubs and crocks of butter—we went to 3, Collingwood Street, Shoreditch, about 10 o'clock, when Stageman told me to hand down this tub and a firkin of butter, which he left at 3, Collingwood Street, and went across the road with a man—when we got to Dixon and Co. 's Stageman was either unwell or tipsy, and there was a noise—I saw the van unloaded, and the tubs delivered to Dixon and Co.—there were 59 tubs and 72 crocks.</p>

On 4th November, in consequence of information I received, I went with Sergeant Harvey to Collingwood Street, Shoreditch, at about 1 o'clock—it is a very low street—nothing in it hut costermongers and haddock-driers, and a lot of barrows in front of the doors—a girl of 12 or 14, standing at public-house corner, halloaed out "<hi rend="italic">Coppers</hi>!" and ran as hard as she could—I said to Harvey "We must run"—she ran into 3, Collingwood Street—I ran upstairs and Harvey after me; I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> in the door and went in and saw Hill and another man; I saw</p>

               <p>there this firkin and tub of butter beside Hill—the tub had been opened and the lid was loose on the top of it—I said "We are two police sergeants What about this butter?"—as soon as I said that I was hit by the other man and by Hill and drove through a picture, and the other man jumped out at the window and Hill ran to the stairs—I ran after him and a dog had hold of me behind—I believe the dog was under the bed—Harvey, who wag on the top of the stairs, had hold of Hill, and I had him behind by the coat—we had to throw him down, he struggled very hard—up to then neither of them had said a word—Hill then said "I am a respectable man; I live at 25, Hackney Road;" that was after asking him two or three times where he lived—I said "It does not look like a respectable man to be here buying butter;" and he said "I have bought rough stuff of him before, and I believe him to be a respectable man"—I searched him and found a cheese or a butter scoop which had a sign of grease on it—I searched the house and found some rolls of cloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) loose on the bed, and this roll of cloth was in a box under—we have tried to find Tracey, who jumped out at the window, but cannot—I went that evening to 25, Hackney Road, a grocer's and cheesemonger's shop—Harvey went with me—I found a lot of chests of tea, the greater part of them opened, and 11b., 21b., or 31b. of tea taken out of them—some were were half empty—there was some tea in boxes like meat boxes or soap boxes—I saw a bag there with tea in it and bags of sugar and loaves of sugar, and butter tubs without any heads—on the 6th Inspector Fox and I went there and he searched the place.</p>

It was only one flight of stairs that I ran up—it might be 10 or 15—you must stand on the stairs to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> in the door, there being no landing—Hill had not to pass me to get to the door—Harvey was on the stairs—there was only room for a chair and table between the bed and the fire—I had to run about three times the length of the Court between the public-house at the corner and 3, Collingwood Street—I was in the passage as soon as the girl.</p>

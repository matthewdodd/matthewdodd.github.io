            . I am a watchman belonging to the parish of New Brentford. At half after one o'clock in the morning of the third of March I found the prosecutor very much in liquor, leaning over some rails going into Brentford Butts; I saw a miller coming out of a house with a lanthorn; I asked him to help me to get him into the market-place; I put him into one of the pens where they sell pigs, and got a nail, and fastened the door that he should not fall out; when I went by the place at two o'clock I heard him snoring; afterwards I found he had got out and gone off; when I went home in the morning my wife informed me a man had been there, and charged me with taking five guineas and a half from him, and would not go out of town till he got satisfaction; I then went in search of him and found him, and asked him if he charged me with having his money; no he said, he could not charge me; he was very much obliged to me for my care of him; by his description I afterwards took the prisoner, and he voluntarily confessed that he took the money; the evidence went with me, and I found a guinea and a half hid in one place, and another man found a guinea in another place; he said he had given a guinea and half to his wife to take some things out of pawn; he said he had put the buckles down the gully hole in the town; I went to the gully hole, but could not see them; a little boy put his hand in and found one of them; it was shewn to the prosecutor and he said it was his; the prisoner said he had hid the knife in a bank, but when he went with me he could not find it; he could find the place where he hid the money fast enough.</p>

               <p>I picked up the money in the tap room where the old gentleman was drinking; Allum and I were drinking a pint of beer together; I gave him two guineas out of the four and a half, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177404130031"></xptr> we agreed to go and hide it left it should be owned.</p>

            . The prisoner and I saw Day very drunk at Brentford; he tumbled into a grocer's shop, and broke a pane of glass; the prisoner went to get him away left he should break any more windows; getting him away he tumbled into the road; we picked him up left he should be run over; he tumbled down again, and the buckles fell out of his pocket; I took them up, and put them in my pocket; being wet and cold he desired us to lead him to the Royal Oak a publick house; we did, and there we had a pint of beer or two; he took out a guinea and paid for it the prisoner called me out to the door and said here is the old man's purse, here is three guineas in it; he gave me two and kept one himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was there in the house when I picked the money up; I did not know whose money it was.</p>
               <p>Allum. When we had got the money we went into the house again and sat drinking almost all night; the next morning we hid one guinea in a bank, the other by a chimney; by the desire of the prisoner I threw the buckles down the gully hole; one of them was afterwards found; the landlord where we lodged said, keep all close and it will be right enough.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>

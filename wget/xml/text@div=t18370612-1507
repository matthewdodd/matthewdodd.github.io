                  </hi>. I am servant to Samuel Cox, who keeps the Hock of Gibraltar public-house, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green. Then is a wash-house which joins the public-house by an open passage—on the 22nd of May I locked the wash-house up at eight o'clock in the evening, and fastened the window—the rat-trap and leaden pipe were then safe—1 went there again at ten o'clock, and found the window broken open—there was a hole large enough for a man to go through, about five feet from the ground—I missed the rat-trap, and the pipe which was fixed there for the water—next morning I saw the prisoner in Church-street—my wife was with him, and had the rat-trap, which I knew, I gave him in charge.</p>

On the 28th of April the prisoner accounted with me for 5 l. 10 s., which he had received from her; there was more money owing; she owed 7 l. 10 s. in all, for several bills for fish - I had directed him to call for it, and he delivered the 5 l. 14 s. to my wife, as all the money he had received from there; I saw him pay it, and he stated that the reason he had not received it all was because the housekeeper's books were given in.</p>

            . I am housekeeper to Mr. Mills, at Potter's-bar - I pay the tradesman's bills. On the 28th of April I paid the prisoner 7 l. 14 s., which was due to Mr. Simmonds, for fish; the bill was 7 l. 14 s. 8 d.; I paid him seven sovereigns, and fourteen shillings in shilling pieces, to the best of my belief; I can positively swear that I paid him some shillings. In about a fortnight Mr. Simmons's brother called on me, and I told him what I had paid. I did not tell the prisoner that the books were gone in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have paid a great deal of money away - A. Yes, but at that time I had no other bills to pay. I asked if he could give me change out of a sovereign. To the best of my belief I paid him fourteen shilling pieces; I am positive I paid some shillings, and observed,</p>
               <p>"You will take all my silver." When I went to Enfield they said he had paid five sovereigns and a half on my account, but I had not had a half-sovereign.</p>
               <p>MR. SIMMONS. I was present when the prisoner paid five sovereigns and a half. I made the entry myself, from his directions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you make all the entries in the book yourself - A. Yes.</p>

                  </hi>. My father keeps the Apple-tree public-house in Bowling-green-street, Clerkenwell—I assist him—on 4th April the prisoner came to our house, and some other persons with him—one of his companions called for some gin—I served him—he paid me with a half-crown—I put it in the till, and gave him change—there was no other half-crown there—the prisoner then said, "This is not enough; we will have another quartern, and I will pay for that"—I served the prisoner with a second quartern, and he paid for it with a half-crown—I bit that with my teeth, and found it was bad—I went to show it to a gentleman, and when I came back, the prisoner and his companions were all gone—I had not given change for the half-crown—I then looked in the till at the other half-crown, and I found that was bad also—I went to the door, and saw the prisoner passing by an oyster-stall—I laid hold of him, and showed him the money—a policeman came up, and I gave the prisoner in charge with the two half-crowns—I am sure that the man who gave the first half-crown was in company with the prisoner—they were talking together—they did not come in the house together—I had seen the others waiting for some person to come out of the House of Correction—our house is opposite there.</p>

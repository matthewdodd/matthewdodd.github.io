            . I am a carpenter. On the 8th of February, about noon, I was coming out of my house, and heard a man had taken a pair of shoes from a child; I went in pursuit, and came up to the prisoner - I asked if he had not taken a pair of shoes from a child; he said No, that he had just come from Bow, and had seen none; I said he could not come from Bow that way. I took his hat off, and there found the shoes - I gave him to an officer.</p>

            . I am an officer. I came up, and took the prisoner; in about five minutes the mother brought the child into the public-house; there were a dozen people there - I asked the child to point out the person who took the shoes; he pointed to the prisoner immediately, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man, but he did not give me the penny"- the prisoner said he found the shoes on a bank.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he had found the shoes in a field, and put them into his hat; and had not seen the child.</p>

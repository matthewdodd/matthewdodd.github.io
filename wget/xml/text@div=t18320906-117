            . I am an officer. I went to No. 11, Rose-street, Soho, where the prisoner lodged, and while I was there, she came in; I told her she was suspected of robbing Mr. Lovegrove, at Fladong's hotel - she said I was welcome to search; I searched, and found the napkin which has the prosecutor's name and address, in full, on it- she said that had been brought there by a young man, and neglected to be sent home; I searched further, and found the mattress, bed-furniture, plates, and some other things - I then went to the pawnbroker's, and found some others; she said the mattress had been put into the dusthole by Eliza, and the bed-furniture was to make dusters of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I throw myself on the mercy of the Court; I did it through distress - I had not a penny, and my daughter was dying in a decline; I know I have done wrong.</p>
               <p>MR. LOVEGROVE. I employed her for two months; she had 1s. 6d. a day, and her food - when I had not work for her. I have got her work at another person's house; I think she has been employed five days out of seven on the average - she has been there for a whole week together.</p>

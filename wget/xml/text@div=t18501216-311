                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Green-bank, Tooley-street. I was at a raffle at the Green Dragon, in Bermondsey-street, on 4th Dec.—I know the prisoner, he was at the raffle—I left about one o'clock in the morning, on 5th Dec—I had been drinking, but nothing that would injure me; I knew what I was doing—no one left with me—I went up a gateway at the corner of Snow's-fields, not a minute's walk from the Green Dragon—I saw the prisoner pass, and another man with him, named <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> Farrell—they spoke to me first, and said, "Is that you, Connell?"—I said, "Yes"—I kept on, and they went aside me, and asked me for some beer—I told them there was no public-house open, and I had no money—one of them, I cannot say which, said, "You did not spend the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece you had a while ago?"—I was then not more than a minute's walk from where I live—<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> Downes, the prisoner, said to me, "Come to Almand's, and we will get some beer there; the house is open:" I told him it was not—he took hold of my right arm to force me to go to Almand's—I told him it was not open; if the public-house in Green-bank was open I would give them some beer—<hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> Farrell said, "I will go and see if the house is open"—he went, returned, and said it was not—I said I would go and see myself, and kept moving on till I came to my own door, and, seeing me clap my hand on the door, the prisoner <hi rend="italic">rushed</hi> both his hands in my pocket, took the money out, and threw me down—he tore my pocket; it is torn now—I put my hand into my pocket, and found I had but a sixpence in silver, and 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—my 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece was gone, it was safe at the corner of Snow's-fields—my landlady, Mrs. Conelly, came out—I was then just rising up from the ground.</p>

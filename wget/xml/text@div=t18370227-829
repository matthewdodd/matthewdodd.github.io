I employed a man, named Bolston, to clean my staircase on Monday the 20th of February—he brought the prisoner with him—I saw the prisoner leave my house at a quarter past four o'clock, with a basket on his shoulder—Bolston was not there—the next morning, at six o'clock, I found the pipe was gone—it had been fixed in the bakehouse—the next morning Bolston returned to work, but the prisoner did not—I went to Mr. Ayling's, and saw the pipe there—this is it.</p>

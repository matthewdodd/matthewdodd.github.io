                  <hi rend="largeCaps">ROBINSON LAMBERT</hi>. I keep a beer-shop at Brentford. Joseph Dawson was a boatman, and frequented my house—the prisoner is captain of a monkey-boat—Dawson belonged to the same boat—on the 12th of May they were at my house from one o'clock in the day, till evening, drinking together—Dawson got intoxicated, but not the prisoner, that I could perceive—I heard them quarrelling about eight o'clock—I went into the tap-room, and saw Dawson pull his jacket off to fight the prisoner—I told the prisoner if he would not take any notice of him I would get him to the boat—the prisoner agreed, and I did so—I persuaded Dawson to go, and he went very quietly towards the canal—I did not go with him—I saw him go out of the house, and as much as twenty yards form the house, towards the canal—the prisoner remained in the house perhaps half-an-hour—he then left, and I did not see any more off him till I heard there had been a fight—I went towards the Grand Junction Canal, where the boat was, about 300 yards from my house, and saw a policeman and others getting the deceased on the boat into the cabin—they had hold of his arms, holding him up—he was walking—when I first saw him he was just on the plank leading to the boat—I saw the prisoner not far off—I do not know whether he was in that boat or not, as there were three or four boats abreast—the deceased said to the prisoner, "I did not think you would have served me so"—I did not hear him make any reply—they took Dawson into the cabin—I saw no more of him till next morning—I saw the prisoner in an hour and a half, or so, that</p>

               <p>day, in my house, talking with some boatmen—I heard him say to some people in the tap-room that he did not think there was anything much the matter with the deceased except his being tipsy—he said that when he left our house, to fetch his horse, the deceased was standing there with his jacket off, to fight him, about half-way between the boat and the house; that he aggravated him till he kicked him—he said nothing more—the prisoner came to the stable the first thing next morning, and said he was afraid the man was hurt—he and I went into the tap-room—Dawson came in just as we got there, and complained of being kicked in the lower part of his belly—he said, "Thomas, I did not think you would have served me so"—I did not hear the prisoner make any answer—Thomas and I fetched a doctor, who came to the deceased at my house, and told me to get an order to take him to the Union—he re<lb></lb>mained at my house some time—then the prisoner said his horse was in the stable, and I could take him to the hospital, as he seemed getting worse—he said it was a very bad job, and I was to do everything I possibly could for him—I got a light spring cart, put the horse in, took him to St. George's Hospital, and left him there on the 13th, about eleven o'clock in the morning—they were often at my house together, and were always very good friends—I never knew them quarrel before—I saw the deceased about four hours after he was at the hospital—I believe he died on Saturday, the 15th.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On 12th May, at a quarter after nine o'clock, in consequence of information, I went to the Grand Junction Canal, Brentford, in Isleworth parish, and saw the deceased standing on the bridge—there were several persons with him, he was very much intoxicated—two boatmen took him to the boat; I assisted, he walked a few yards by himself, and then they led him—there was a small wound on his right cheek—an in<lb></lb>quest was held on the same person after death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. The deceased was brought to the hospital on the 13th of May—he had symptoms of inflammation of the covering membrane of the intestines; there was no external mark of vioience—I could not tell from what it proceeded, except from what he said—a kick on the lower part of his belly would be likely to produce it—he was put to bed, and the usual treatment adopted—everything was done for him—he died at half-past eleven o'clock on Saturday the 15th—a post mortem examination was made in my presence—there was acute inflammation within the abdomen, and a rupture through which some of the small intestines came—the rest of the body was perfectly healthy—I have no</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140029"></xptr>
               <p>doubt the death was cause by the inflammation of the covering of the intes<lb></lb>tines—the rupture of the intestines would be caused by considerable violence, not by inflammation—the violence must have been applied to the belly, or in that neighbourhood—that might happen without any external mark—I am confident it was not caused by disease, but was the result of external violence.</p>

                  </hi>. I was coming along the canal side about half-past eight o'clock at night, and found the deceased lying there—I went up to him he could not move, or stand upright—he appeared intoxicated—I turned him over, and stood there some time with him—a man came by who knew him—I fetched two or three men to him and left him.</p>

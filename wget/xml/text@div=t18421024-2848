                  </hi>. I am in the employ of James Houghton; the prisoner was in his employ. On the 15th of July, he was ordered to take out half a hogshead of soy, a hogshead of oil, and a barrel of tar—he was not ordered to take any white lead—on Saturday morning, Goddard reported that he had found a book which Mr. Houghton's carman was in the habit of using, and also a firkin of lead, and a tub of glue—I can swear to the lead as my master's, but not to the glue—I sent for the prisoner, and asked what busi<lb></lb>ness he had in Guildford-street, where the lead was found—he said he was requested by a person in the New Cut to convey this lead and bag of glue, for which he received 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would go with him to where they were given him—he said he did not know that he could find the place out—I pressed him further, and he said they were given him by two men in a cart—he was allowed to go on duty for that day, and discharged at night—the firkins of lead which we had were counted on the following Tuesday, and we missed one firkin and a bag of glue.</p>

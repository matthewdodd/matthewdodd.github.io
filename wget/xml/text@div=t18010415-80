             sworn. - I am a sadler, in Long-lane, Smithfield: On Thursday, the 5th of March, about nine in the morning, the prisoner at the bar came to my shop, and asked if I bought second-hand saddles; he said he had looked after a gentleman's horse, that the gentleman had sold his horse, and given him the saddle; he did not say who the gentleman was, but he said he would go and fetch it; I told him to let me see it; accordingly he went away, and brought it, he asked me 15s. for it; he said he had brought it from the Ram Inn, Smithfield; I told him I would go to the Ram Inn, and if it was all right, I would pay him for it; we sat off to go to the Ram together, till we came to the corner; he crossed over to Cow-lane, I followed him, and overtook him; I said, my friend, that is the Ram Inn over there; he said, no, he was going into Holborn; I asked him where he was going to in Holborn, he said, to the Bull Inn; I said, you had better take the saddle with you, it is not worth my while to run all over London about it; he came back with me, thinking to take the saddle again, and when we came to my shop, I told him to go in and take the saddle; we went in, and I shut the door; he said it was his property; I then sent for a constable, and the next day he was taken to Guildhall, and the saddle was advertised; on the Friday the ostler came, and said he would not undertake to swear to the saddle, but would write to the gentleman who owned it; Mr. Hartley came to town, and I shewed him the saddle, which he claimed; I have had it ever since.

Mr. Humfreys, with some Friends and Servants going after, met the Deceased coming back, (who said he was wounded) and two of the four Gentlemen making after him, with their Swords drawn; whereupon Mr. Humfreys and his Friends retreated into the House, and sent for a Surgeon to look to Williams, who found 3 Wounds is his Body, one of which was through his Small Gut. The Prisoners call'd one Witness to the Fact, who swore, That as he was passing by he saw four Gentlemen knocking at the Pales, and swearing they would go in; and that one of them snatch'd his Saw, and chopp'd 2 or 3 times upon the Pales; and then they went on the other Side of the House, and broke the Windows; which having done, they were gone away 50 yards from the House, when out came 3 Men with Sticks, who follow'd them, and cry'd stop Thief; whereupon the Gentlemen drew their Swords, and bid them keep off at their Peril; but that he did not see any Wound given, nor could be say the Prisoners were the Gentlemen; no more could any of the King's Evidence. The Reason of their being accus'd was thus: Mr. Buckland happening the next Day in Company with Mr. Justice Saintloe , told him he had been with the other three Prisoners, and that coming from Islingtons they had play'd the Devil, but that his Sword was not drawn, and he left them. Mr. Saintloe hearing afterwards of this Accident at the Spaw, related what Buckland had told him, and by that means Mr. Humfreys found them out. And one Mr. Hatton swore, That he was desir'd by Mr. Humfreys to talk with them; which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171506020005"></xptr> he did, but did not tell them the Fellow was dead, but that he was like to do well, only he hop'd they would consider him as to the Surgeon and Smart-Money; to which they answer'd, They would do any thing that became Gentlemen. This is the Substance of the Evidence as to the Fact. The Prisoners had a great many Persons of Honour and Distinction, who gave them a good Character, and the Jury brought them in <rs id="t17150602-36-verdict192" type="verdictDescription">

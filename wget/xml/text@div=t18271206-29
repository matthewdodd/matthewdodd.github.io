            . I live in Royal Hospital-row, Chelsea, and am a green grocer. I have known the prisoner three or four years as an acquaintance of my son's. On the 10th of October he called with another person, whom I do not know, to sell me some potatoes - they did not show me any sample; the prisoner asked me to give him change for a 5l. note, which he gave me - I gave him five sovereigns, and he wrote on the note of his own accord, in my presence "Nathaniel Peppiatt, Croydon;" they went away. I put the note into my purse, which I kept in my pocket till the 14th, and then gave it to James Dubois, who lives in our row, to pay to Mr. Badcock. Dubois brought it to me again on the 19th, and said it was bad. I returned it to him to keep till I found the prisoner. I told my son if he should meet him in Covent-garden market, not to mention any thing about the note, but to say I wished to see him, and next day, the 20th he came to me,(looking at the note) this is the note he gave me - I know it by the writing on it. I had not other with that writing on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You had known him some years? A. Between three and four - he was always on friendly terms with me. I do not know whether he came to my shop in a gig, for I found him there. I could not tell that he had written the word "Croyden" under his name, till I got a gentleman to read it, it was so blotted; but whatever the word was, I am sure nobody but him wrote it. I am sure there was a third word on the note - it was an elderly man who was with him; they said that the man had some potatoes in the country, and was going to have some up. I did not see the prisoner put the sovereigns into the other man's hand; he did not say he was going to establish the prisoner as an agent in town; the prisoner has collected debts, and done other things for me. I have always found him strictly honest.</p>

            . I am the last witness's son. I have known the prisoner about four years. On the 20th of October, I saw him in Covent-garden-market - he came to me and asked how I did. I told him my mother wanted to speak to him about purchasing some potatoes; he said he would be down in the course of the day; he did not ask what she wanted him about. I had seen him when he passed the note, but not since. I do not know whether he dealt in Covent-garden-market or no - he came that night.</p>

            . I am an appraiser, and live at Chelsea. On the 12th of October I received this note from Mrs. Faulkner, and marked it; this is it (looking at it) - it was afterwards returned to me, as forged; I took it back to her on the 19th; she said at first, that was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060021"></xptr>the note; I asked her by what means she knew it was not - she said Peppiatt had wrote his name on the back of it; and after minutely examining it, she found the name written in pale ink, and showed it me; I knew it was what she paid me, for I had written on it, "Mrs. Faulkener, 12th of October, J. D." On the 20th of October, in consequence of information, I accompanied Wicks, the officer, to Mrs. Faulkener's, between six and eight o'clock in the evening; I found the prisoner there, and said to him,"Do you know the note you paid Mrs. Faulkener is forged?" he said, "Is it?" I said, "Yes, from whom did you receive it?" he said, "I received it of Mr. Sully;" I said, "For what?" he said, "For some hay which I sold him;" I asked who Sully was; he said he was a gentleman living at Pimlico: I said, "Does he keep cows or horses, that he should buy hay of you?" he said, "He don't keep cows, but he keeps a horse and gig or two;" I said, "I presume Mr. Sully will have no objection to give you the money for it?" he said, "Oh, No, he will have no objection; if you will jump into my gig I will take you to the house where Sully lives;" the gig was at the door: he eventually drove me and the constable to No. 12, Trellick-terrace, Vauxhall-road; he said, "Here is where Mr. Sully lives; I will get out, and get you the money;" Wicks said, "No, you stop here; Mr. Dubois is quite capable of making the necessary inquiries;" I got out, and gave a double knock at the door, which a female opened, who turned out to be the prisoner's mother; I asked her if Mr. Sully lived there; the prisoner was near enough to hear what passed: she said, "Mr. Sully? Mr. Sully?" with a sort of hesitation; I said, "Yes, does Mr. Sully live here; do you know any thing of Mr. Sully?" she said, "He neither lives here, nor do I know any thing of him:" at that moment my hands were against the doorpost - the prisoner run betwixt my arms, and said, "Yes, Yes - No, No - here, tell Mr. so and so to come; Mr. What-do-you-call-him to come here; here is a forged note come home - for God's sake, give me five sovereigns:" his words "Yes, Yes" were in answer to her saying Sully did not live there; at that moment there was a scream or shout in the house, from two or three women or children, and they said, "Here are the traps - they are after us, by G-d." The prisoner was just within the passage - I had hold of him; he could hear what passed: I heard those words distinctly, in the parlour, the door of which was open; they were repeated half a dozen times. I said to Wicks, "We have our answer," for I was afraid of a rescue - I saw two men, one indistinctly, but the other (who was a man of colour) followed us out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you found the woman was the prisoner's mother? A. Yes, she had lived in Chelsea, not a dozen doors from my house, with her husband and family, about three years ago, and I knew her when the light came, but she opened the door without a light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Then had you known the prisoner during his father's life time? A. Yes - his father was a cow-keeper; I understand he had been dead a few months; the prisoner generally lived with him, I cannot say always; it was a female's voice that said "the traps are after us."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to detain any of the men in the house? A. The prisoner's mother caught hold of him, and attempted to pull him inside; I said, "If you don't let go, you are attemptin a rescue;" she then went into the parlour, and a man of colour came out; I did not go to any constable, to have the persons in the house secured.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been on ill terms, at any time, with the prisoner and his family? A. Upon cautious terms with the whole of them. I am an appraiser and carpenter. I was never interested, in any way, in the sale of bread; I have been living at No. 5, Hospital-row for fifteen or sixteen years; I know Wicks. When Mr. Faulkener died he was in difficulties, and, as a friend, I compounded with his creditors for the widow; I was to receive the monies for the principal creditor, and pay it to him.</p>

            . I am constable of Chelsea, and live in Royal Hospital-row. I was sent for by Mrs. Faulkener on the 20th of October; I went, and found the prisoner there; Mr. Dubois first spoke to him; I also asked him where he got the note; he told me he had taken it from Mr. Sully, in Vauxhall-road, for a load of hay, and if I would get into his gig he would take me to Sully's house; just as we were going to step into the gig; he said, "We don't want Dubois with us;" I said, "Yes, he will go with us:" we all three then got into the gig; the prisoner drove us to No. 12, Trellick-terrace, and said, "This is the house Mr. Sully lives in - I will get out and get the money;" I said, "No, let Mr. Dubois get out, and make the inquiries;" Dubois got out, knocked at the door, and said, "Does Mr. Sully live here?" the prisoner's mother, who opened the door, said,"No, he does not;" Dubois said, "Do you know such a person?" she said, "No, we don't know such a person as Mr. Sully:" the prisoner then jumped out of the gig, without saying a word to me - he ran to the door, and I after him; I caught hold of him, and prevented his going into the house; I saw Mr. Catts, a man of colour, in the passage, and two or three women and children running about the house: the prisoner seemed very much confused, and said,"Oh! Mr. So-and-so, lend me five sovereigns, for there is a bad note come home."</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that he used the words "So and so?" A. Yes - he seemed much confused, and wanted to get into the house; there was a cry of "The traps are after us, by G-d;" it appeared to be a female voice; the prisoner's mother caught hold of him, and wanted to drag him into the house; I told her he was in my custody, and should not go in; he repeated several times, "Lend me five sovereigns, do, to take this note, or to pay for the note;" I said I had nothing to do with the money, and must take him before a Magistrate; I dragged him from the door - he said,"Don't drag me along - let me go in the chaise again;" I said he could, but Dubois must drive: Dubois got up - I was going to hand the prisoner up, but Catts came out, and said, "Oh, what is this - this here little matter, can't I settle it," and as I was going to get up, he said, "Oh! d-n it, you are not going to run away with my chaise." I then took the prisoner out of the chaise, and suffered Catts to take it away, and I took the prisoner away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who is Catts? A. Not a man of very good character, I believe; I did not know him before - I have seen him since at Queen-square; he was not taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060022"></xptr>up about this.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know whether he lived there or not? A.

            . I keep the Bell and Crown public-house, Camden-town. I did not know the prisoner before the 20th of October, when he came to my house, in company with a man named Shorter, whom I knew before; they came together, and took refreshment together; Shorter wanted me to take some premises for the prisoner, for a potatoe-warehouse; Shorter asked if I wanted a load of good hay; I made a bargain for a load, but it was never delivered; they lunched there; Shorter produced a 10l. note, and paid me for what they both had; I gave Shorter 9l. 17s. 6d. in change; I gave the note to my wife, who marked it, to the best of my knowledge; I do not recollect seeing her mark it; (looking at one) this is her writing; I took another 10l. note that day, from a Mr. Grant- I received it before I took this one, I think; it was loose in my pocket, for I was very busy that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the one you received of Shorter? A. I put it down; I cannot say exactly which of the two notes it was, but I put it down on the desk, and told my wife to mark it - I gave her both at one time, to the best of my knowledge; I do not know whether she marked both: I paid them both away that afternoon, to a cheesemonger, who lives in Tottenham-court-road, in change for silver - this note was afterwards returned, as forged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot say which of the notes you took from Shorter? A. No, not to say with certainly - Shorter talked most: they came in a chaise; I think the prisoner was not in the room when Shorter paid me the note - he went out about the horse.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes.(Looking at the note uttered to Faulkener) this is forged in every respect - no part is genuine; it purports to be signed George Gaudin - there is a cashier of that name, but it is not his signature.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating, that being anxious to obtain a situation, a person named Ephraim Shorter, who represented himself as a dealer in potatoes, had promised to appoint him his agent - that Shorter represented himself to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060023"></xptr>be in some temporary difficulties, and was fearful of a writ being out against him; he wished to be called by the name of Sully - that he went with him to several places where he thought he could deal for potatoes, and that he had received the note in question from Shorter, and changed it with Mrs. Faulkener,(who knew him well) not suspecting it to be forged.</p>

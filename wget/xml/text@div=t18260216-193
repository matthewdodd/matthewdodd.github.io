            . I am the prosecutor's son. I was at home, and saw the prisoner's wife come and try to get the staple out of the coal-house door, but she could not; the prisoner then came, took it out, and took about three pecks of coals into his own house; he then took a hammer and drove the staple in again.</p>

            . I went on the morning of the 13th of February, and took the prisoner at his own house. I asked him if he had got any coals in the house; he said he had bought half a bushel of Mr. Shambrook on Saturday night, which was all he had - I then looked, and found these coals in a back place, under some hay. There was no promise or threat held out to him; but he told the Magistrate, he was very sorry for what he had done, and he hoped he would forgive him, and let him pay for them.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you see it safe - A. I saw it safe about eleven o'clock. The servant got up about six o'clock, observing the window cut, she informed me; I got up, it was light, I found the shutter had been cut with an instrument; that centre-bit fits the hole exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when this instrument was found - A. Yes; it was found at No. 4, Sandy's-row, at the house of Burkitt.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose - A. I lost the articles stated in the indictment. I was robbed to the amount of three hundred pounds, in watches and jewellery. None of the property has ever been found.</p>

            . In consequence of a warrant, I went, in company with Armstrong and Bishop, to No. 4, Sandy's-row. On searching a little small back-house, in a writing-desk on a table, I found this pocket-book, in this pocket-book is a list of articles of jewellery; I shewed it to Mr. Folkard, he said it exactly corresponded with the articles that were lost; I found that centre-bit divided in different parts of the house, as I have before described; I put it together.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a centre-bit used by carpenters - A. No; it is such a tool that I have seen found, with the only difference, the one I before saw found was a little smaller; that tool was applied to the aperture made in the shutter, it exactly fitted. There were several holes bored in Mr. Folkard's door, and this gimlet fitted them exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Folkard. Look at that pocket-book which was found in the desk - A. Here are a number of memorandums, and among them here is the statement of the articles I lost, and the sum affixed to some of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Supposing a man to have bought these articles, and to have entered them in a book, might it not be the entry of a man that purchased them - A. No doubt about that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had some lodgers in my house; I know nothing of that centre-bit whatever.</p>

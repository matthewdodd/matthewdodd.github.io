                  </hi>. I am a porter to John Warner and Sons, and live in Greenhil's-rents, West Smithfield. Between one and two o'clock in the morning of the 20th of March, I had been up with a friend at the west end of the town—I was quite sober—I met the prisoner at the corner of Smith<lb></lb>field—she wanted me to give her something to drink—I said, no, I would not—she told me to go down West-street, there was a house open-walked a little way, and said the houses were closed—she began to huddle and cuddle me, and at the same time she picked my pocket—had two half-crowns, one shilling, and one sixpence—they were first in my rights hand pocket—I took out the half-crowns, and put them into my side-pocket—I thought it would be more secure—she walked with me a few yards, and cuddled and huddled me up—she went away, and I put my hand into my pocket, and missed the money—I then seized her, and called the police—I took hold of both her wrists, and she bit my thumb—there were two young men came up, and one wanted me to Jet her go—I fancied she gave the money to him at the time they held my hands, and tried to make me let her go—I never saw my money after, and 1 told the policeman—the man staid a little way off till the policeman came—lost 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my coat-pocket, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my trowsers.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 283.) I heard a great scream<lb></lb>ing—I went to the spot—the man was gone—the prosecutor said two men had come, and he thought they had got the money—he seemed to know what he was about—he was quite sober—there was only 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. found on the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was going home about two o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and met the prosecutor—he kept <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> up against me, and said, "Will you shake hands?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Will you go and have something to drink?"—I said, I did not mind—he then said, "Will you go home with me?"—I said, "Where?"—he came to the place, and then he went away, and said, "Will you come back with me?"—I said, "No"—then he pulled all the clothes off my back—I called the police, and he called, and said he had been robbed of two half-crowns; and then he said he bad been robbed of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more.</p>

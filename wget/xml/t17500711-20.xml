            . On the 5th of last July, the Prisoner happened to come by my husband, my husband said, here is your play-fellow gone by; this was between ten and eleven o'clock in the forenoon. I had lain in about twelve or fourteen days; I desired my husband to call him back, I had not seen him some years, which he did. I desired him mightily to stay with me; he said he was going to Islington. I having sent my child to the church to be baptized that day, is the reason I can remember it so well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stay with you any time?</p>
               <p>Wolley. He stayed with me from that time till 5 o'clock next morning. He was in liquor and sat down in a chair. My husband got up and went to work, and said he would go to his mother, but whether he did or not, I can't say.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the child baptized?</p>
               <p>Wolley. At Cripplegate church; it being very ill, made me hasten to have it christened.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Wolley. I live in Golden-Lane, facing the hand and tipstaff.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Olifant. I was servant to Mrs. Wolley at that time. My mistress desired Mr. Crawford to stay with her, he stayed till the company broke up; about eleven o'clock, he, being in liquor, sat down in a chair and slept till morning, and gave me a shilling for awaking him at five o'clock.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175007110010"></xptr> I went with him that morning near Cripplegate, where he gave me a dram.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the child christened that day your mistress speaks of?</p>
               <p>Olifant. It was, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your mistress's business?</p>
               <p>Olifant. She is a fish-woman, and my master a carman; I am positive as to the day, my master would have paid me, it was on a Wednesday, my month being up that very day.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Wolley. Why did not you bring the account of this christening taken from the register of the parish?</p>
               <p>Wolley. I did not think there would have been occasion for that.</p>

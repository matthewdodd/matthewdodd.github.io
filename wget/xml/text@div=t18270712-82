I took the prisoner into custody - he at first said he had paid 9s. 6d., then that he meant to pay - some money was found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you sold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120042"></xptr>any peas? A. Not within twenty minutes of that time; he was taken in about a quarter of an hour; he had a donkey in Russell-street: he said at Bow-street that he meant to pay me, and also in the market; Green was at times employed by me as a porter. I swear he did not pay me for them.</p>

            . I am a porter, and unload Bishop's goods. I was going up to the stand; the prisoner pointed to a sack of peas, and said, "Take this up for me;" I took it on my shoulder, into Russell-street, and shot part into the hampers on the donkey and part into a sack; I did not hear Bishop call after me. Coles came up, and said the sack was to come back - I gave it to him. We returned together, and Bishop said they were not paid for; we went back, and found them in the hampers on the donkey; the prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were paid for the porterage? A. Yes, a penny; about half of them were in the hamper: those in the sack were gone.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BISHOP re-examined. I told a person to stand by the donkey, and the prisoner came to remonstrate with me for keeping the donkey - he had then got twenty or thirty regular thieves with him, and I detained him.</p>

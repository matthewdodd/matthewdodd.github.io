                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl, and live at 21, Thrall-street, Spitalfields. On Saturday night, 9th Aug., the prisoner went with me up-stairs to my room—after he had remained there some time, he wanted to go away—I refused to let him go, because he would not pay me a shilling he had agreed—he was about to leave the room—I stopped him, and he began to hit me about—he went towards the door—I put my back to it—he pulled me away, and knocked me right up against the bedstead—I then called for assistance—Johanna Driscoll came up—the prisoner said if I would come down-stairs, he had no less than two sovereigns, and he would pay me—I refused to do that, or to let him go—he up with his fist and bit Driscoll, directly she came into the room, before she had done anything, and tried to get out—he put out the candle—by the light from the window, I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and in a minute afterwards I saw Driscoll's hand bleeding; she called out that he had stabbed her in the hand—I lighted the candle again with a lucifer, and he rushed out of the room—he did not even wait to put his hat on, but took it in his hand—whilst I was lighting the candle, Driscoll had her back against the door, to keep him in; but he got out in spite of her—she had nothing in her hand—there was no bottle in the place—I did not see the prisoner's head before he left the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl, and live at 21, Thrall-street. On this night, I was standing at my door, about half-past 10 o'clock, and heard Neale halloo for assistance—I went up and forced in the door, and when I got inside, the prisoner had one hand on her throat, and the other on the door—I said, "What is the matter?"—he said nothing, but turned round and hit me in the forehead with his fist—I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him away, and took up a small tea-cup, and struck him with it—he then put his hand on the candle and quenched the light—where he took a knife from I cannot say, but when she lighted the candle again, he had a knife in his hand, and he made an offer to strike me in the face with it—I was standing with my back to the door—I saw the blade of the knife—I put up my left hand, and received a cut between the finger and thumb—he did not say anything till be went out at the door, and then he returned, and said he would take our lives—he then fan down-stairs with his bat in his hand—I went down after him, and told King, the policeman, who was standing outside—he went after the prisoner, and brought him back—the tea-cup is not here; it was broken—I only struck him once, on the forehead—the cup was not broken, or cracked before—I was taken to the hospital by a policeman, and bad my hand dressed.</p>

               <p>bleeding from the forehead—about half-a-minute after, Driscoll came up—she showed me her hand—in consequence of what she said, I ran after the prisoner, and sprang my rattle—I overtook him in Whitechapel-road, just by the Church—I told him he was accused of stabbing a young woman in the hand—he said, "I have hurt no one; I will go back with you; I only fought for my liberty"—he had been drinking, but was not drunk—when the prosecutrix was showing her wound at the station, he said, "You admitted having done it yourself; look how I am served where you struck me with the cup"—she made no answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am senior resident dresser at the London Hospital. The prosecutrix was brought there—she had an incised wound on the left hand, about two inches long, and half-an-inch deep, between the finger and thumb on the outside, the wound itself was not dangerous, but the consequences might have been so from her habits, erysipelas might have supervened—any wound that irritates certain nerves will produce locked-jaw, in particular cases—there is a popular error that a cut in that part is more likely to produce locked-jaw—I dressed the wound, and she has since been an out-patient—it was inflicted with a sharp cutting instrument, such as a knife—I think it was not likely to have been done by the edge of a cup; it is possible, but not likely—I found no particles of glass or earthenware in the wound—it was a clean incised wound, without a jag.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, stated that the women attempted to rob him, and in the scuffle the wound must have been accidentally caused.</hi>

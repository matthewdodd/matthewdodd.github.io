               <p>How came you to suspect him? - Knowing his indifferent principle; he was about my house frequently, not employed by me, but he had free access to my house to eat and drink; I took him up with one Hillman, and in Hillman's pocket was a piece of flannel found, that was locked in the box that was stolen from my premises: I got a search warrant to search Scott's house; when we went there, the property was first denied by Mrs. Scott, but Mrs. Scott said that Mr. Caseley and Mr. Hillman were in the cellar with her husband, and we found in the house all the things mentioned in the indictment, the stays and cap were thrown out of the window into a gutter, and a child's bedgown and other things were thrown out of the window into the gutter.</p>

               <p>The two watchmen confirmed the finding the things at the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Casley. My Lord, my wife lives with the prosecutor, she and him went out.</p>
               <p>Court. What, is she his servant? - No; he took her from me, she is my lawful wife, I have six or seven children by her, I have three children living now, it was unknown to me some time where they were, and yesterday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190093"></xptr> was fortnight she contrived to go out with him that I should take this property, and she would follow me with the rest as soon as she conveniently could; this is a fact, this man took my wife, and her properly was in this box, which was the stays and cap and other materials; as to the spoons, that this man says were his, before ever I knew that she cohabited with this man, she brought them to the house, six months before, and said they were her property; I disposed of them to Mr. Scott as such.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What do you say to this? - What he says concerning his wife, is doing his wife a deal of injustice, he is ruining his children, I took two of them out of Shoreditch work-house, and teach them the fear of man and the fear of God.</p>
               <p>Court. But what do you keep the wife too? - Yes; do not think that I want to distress the man of a wife; no! I took that woman as a prostituted being from the street.</p>
               <p>So you took her to keep her from prostitution? - I do my Lord.</p>
               <p>Have you any children? - No; but I keep three of this man's, as they say; supposing I do live with his wife, they ought not to rob me, if I have done wrong there is a court of justice for me; these things were always in my possession, the box was mine, the punch-ladle was given me by my uncle, the linen was for the children of my first wife.</p>
               <p>What age is this woman that lives with you? - I suppose she is about thirty.</p>
               <p>She may have more children and it may be useful to keep the linen? - It will be so.</p>
               <p>How long has this woman been with you? - About two years; this man has had free access of my house, they were always as intimate as could be, as far as the cupboard, but nothing further.</p>
               <p>And so you kept these things to supply the children this woman may bring you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I suppose you know, if you convict this poor fellow of this offence he will be hanged, and you will have no more trouble? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Let us hear no more of such a story as this; your time is too precious Gentlemen to be wasted upon such a tale as this.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, we are perfectly satisfied.</p>

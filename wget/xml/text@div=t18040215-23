               <p>- SMITH sworn. - The prisoner was my bookbinder; I was informed there was some money missing in the till; I sent for an officer, and desired the prisoner to be brought in to me; I told him if he would acknowledge the fact I would forgive him, and let him go about his business.</p>

               <p>Court. There is no evidence against the prisoner; what the prisoner said, was after Smith had said he would forgive him, if he would acknowledge the fact, if he would tell the truth; after that I cannot hear of any confession that he had made; he must be acquitted.</p>

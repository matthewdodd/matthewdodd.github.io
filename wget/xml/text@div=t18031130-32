Before they were gone out of the shop, Goddard came in, and asked for a yard of cloth, which she paid eleven pence for; when they were gone, we missed a piece of print.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the persons? - A. The man and Price went up North-street, and Goddard the other way; I followed Price, and said, my sister wanted to speak to her about the money they left on the print; she returned with me down the street, and the man went on; she then said, she would go back to her son; I said, I would go with her; we turned to the City-road, and as she was near the gutter, I looked down, and observed she kept her hand close down on her pocket-hole; I then drew back, and saw the print in her hand through her pocket-hole. I then charged her with the robbery; she dropped it to the ground; I held her fast with one hand, and picked the print up with the other; and, with assistance, took her back. My sister is not here, having lately been brought to-bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Goddard speak to the man or woman? - A. No, I did not observe her speak to either of them; I observed nothing further between them than Price and the man speak to her in the street, and she came into the shop after them about five minutes.</p>

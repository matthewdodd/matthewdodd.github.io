               <p>Q. Did you see from what place the four tea pots were taken by Ellworthy, and put in a bag by Ellworthy. - A. He told me to take them to 6 Great Cumberland street, and he gave orders that they were not to be shewn to any one till he came himself; this was about twenty minutes after nine o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What time does your shop generally shut up. - A. The windows are shut up after dark; the shop continues open till ten o'clock. I took the tea pots in a bag, agreeable to Ellworthy's directions, and delivered them to captain Morrison's servant,

             I did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. What instructions did you receive from Ellworthy at that time. - A. Ellworthy brought three tea pots and papered them up, and put them in a bag; this was in the front parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these three tea pots that were brought, three out of the four that were taken. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What directions did Ellworthy give you. - A. I was to take them to Mr. Gaddenne, Crown and Scepter court, St. James' street, about two hundred yards from my master's house.</p>

               <p>Q. I presume as Ellworthy directed you, you did. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp How long have you lived with Mr. Wirgman. - A. One year and a half the eleventh of next month.</p>
               <p>Q. And Ellworthy has lived there all the time you have lived there. - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. He was the principal manager for Mr. Wirgman to carry on his business, and you was the person that had them delivered to you by Ellworthy in the presence of the shopman. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing extraordinary in these goods being delivered to you by Ellworthy to be shewn to customers, any more than had been done before. - A. They were to be taken unknown to Mr. Wirgman.</p>
               <p>Q. So it might be in many other goods. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was done in the usual way in which other goods are delivered to you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were taken to this house in Cumberland street, you say there were four tea pots, and these four tea pots were taken from the shew glass where all the other tea pots were, and in the presence of the shopman, and when they were taken to Mrs. Mc Veigh, they were put in the parlour. - A. I put them in the parlour myself, they were to remain there till Ellworthy came back. Ellworthy told me that the other was to be returned with the three that I brought back, but Mrs. Mc Veigh was indisposed and gone to bed; that the tea pot which is in this bag had received the approbation of the company in the drawing room, but it was to remain there till the next morning, they having approved of it; if was to remain to see whether Mrs. Mc Veigh approved of it in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. It was remaining then for the approbation of the lady of the house till the next morning. - A. Yes, Ellworthy told me the tea pot was to be brought back the next day after Mrs Mc Veigh's approbation.</p>
               <p>Q. When goods are taken to be shown before an actual sale has taken place, do you know enough of the business of the shop to say whether, any entry is taken when they are left for approbation. - A. They are left for approbation; they are booked on choice, and there would be an entery made if the whole was not brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us these goods remained till the next morning for the approbation of Mrs. Mc. Veigh; would that be entered on that night, or remain till Mrs. Mc Veigh had made approbation of it. - It should be booked that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course when you got back, Ellworthy would have left the shop, it being late, and he would not return till the morning. - A. No, had he ordered it to be booked, Mr. Wirgman, or the shopman, would have entered it.</p>

               <p>Q. I understood you to say you took the three tea pots to Mr. Gaddenne. - A. Yes; the shop being shut up Ellworthy was scarfull of Mr. Wirgman's anger, he did not want him to know it; that was the reason I was to leave them at Gaddenne's I returned them the next morning to Mr. Wirgman's shop by Ellworthy's directions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Did Ellworthy live in your masters house. - A. Yes, he did not sleep in my master's house that night.</p>

            . Mr. Gurney. You are a jeweller in St. James's Street. The prisoner Ellworthy has been five years in your service as clerk. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he been entrusted to sell articles and to go out to your customers. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner Morrison first introduced to you. - A. About the 14th of November<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180061"></xptr> last, by captain Wallace of the Duke of Cumberland's regiment; they came together.</p>
               <p>Q. By what description was he introduced to you by captain Wallace. - A. As a captain of the Navy.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that introduction, did you credit the prisoner Morrison with articles of jewelry. - A. Yes; in the course of a few days to the amount of seventy pound: they were purchased at divers times.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner Ellworthy waited upon him in the course of serving him. - A. Chiefly so.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the date of the last article that you sold to him. - A. It could not be more than seven or eight days from his first introduction. At that time captain Wallace called upon me, he told me in the presence, and in the hearing of Ellworthy, that captain Morrison of the royal navy was a swindler, and he feared that the property I had sold to him was lost, but as a man of honour he found himself bound to make good any loss I sustained by him.</p>
               <p>Q. This you say Ellworthy heard. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon that give Ellworthy any orders. - A. No. He absented himself three days; upon his return he brought back the gold watch and chain I had sold to Morrison, and there might be a little ring, that reduced the seventy pound to about ten pound and sixpence; he stated that he got them from captain Morrison.</p>
               <p>Q. Did captain Morrison ever come to your shop after that. - A. Never. I told Ellworthy and all my people not to trust him.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information that you received, did you in this month go to the prisoner Morrison, and where did you find him. - A. In the lock up house, Shire lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you respecting the tea pot. - A. Yes. He told me if I would go to his house, No. 63 Great Marybone street, and ask his servant to deliver the silver tea pot to me that he had purchased of Ellworthy, he would do so, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon that go to the house that he described to you. - A. I did. I received a silver tea pot from his servant Frost; this is the tea pot, there was tea leaves in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it. - A. About ten pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Ellworthy ever apprised you of his selling that tea pot to Morrison, or to any other person. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Mc Veigh a customer of yours. - A. No, never. I have my book here, there is no entry of it being sold to Morrison or to Mrs. Mc Veigh. It was his duty to have entered it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. - I understand you to have stated that captain Morrison was first of all introduced to you by captain Wallace. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not been trusted with any property till that period. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the goods that was afterwards delivered to him on credit, was in consequence of the introduction of captain Wallace. - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards you said that captain Wallace returned, and said that captain Morrison was not that person as he expected; to what amount did you trust him. - A. To the amount of seventy pound.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that after captain Wallace had given you the information, Ellworthy was absent three days, and at the end of three days he brought back so many articles as reduced the seventy pound to ten pound; he was then absent on your business. - A. He was absent without my leave.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you have said these goods were sold to Morrison by your leave. - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as it was found out, your servant went and brought back all the goods, which he returned as soon as he could get them. - A. So, he said; it did not require three days to recover them, as they were brought back from Great Cumberland street.</p>
               <p>Q. He brought back the goods and found out the man. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He was your chief clerk. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it he was authorised to take out goods to all your customers. - A. To my customers.</p>
               <p>Q. He was authorised to sell goods to persons that came into your shop. - A. If the persons were not known, it was necessary to inform me.</p>
               <p>Q. He was your managing servant to sell for you, and to dispose of your goods, in your house, in your absence - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked about the loss of these things did not he tell you where they were. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that Mrs. Mc Veigh had them. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you he would go to Mrs. Mc Veigh. - A. No. He might have said that he would go to Cumberland street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had captain Wallace told you where he lived. - A. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that Ellworthy told you that the goods were at Great Cumberland street. - A. On the evening of the 10th of February, and I went that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the number in Great Cumberland street. - A. No. I was directed there by the Swedish ambassador, on the next morning; there I saw Mrs. Mc Veigh.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask for the articles that came there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not to be paid for them by Mrs. Mc Veigh. - A. No. She would not give them up without much difficulty. I told her I had a search warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not at that time tell her that you hoped after the marriage had taken place that you should have an order to a large amount. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you positively swear that. - A. I will sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you deny that positively. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. After Ellworthy was charged with this, did not he bring back some of the things from Great Cumberland street. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He went from your shop by himself. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And returned with them. - A. Yes. So he told me; it was in my absence.</p>
               <p>Q.When was he taken into custody. - A. Between five and six the morning after he had brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180062"></xptr> them back I went twice to the house in Great Cumberland street; the first time I saw Miss

            , then I brought a watch away, she acknowledged it to be her's, I prove it to be mine; the second time I saw the young lady, and then I saw the old lady, that was the 11th of this month. I saw her in her bed room, I desired her to give me the diamond ring which I was informed by the Swedish ambassador that she had, she told me that if I left the room I should have it.</p>

               <p>Q. Afterwards, when captain Wallace called and gave you that account, was Morrison present. - A. No, Morrison was not present.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a good deal of dealings with officer's of the army and navy. - A. Yes</p>

               <p>Q. Did not the Swedish ambassador call upon you to know if Morrison was in debt. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. He was in the spunging house. - A. Not on my suit.</p>
               <p>Q. You lodged a detainer afterwards. - A. Yes, of ten pound.</p>
               <p>Q. When you called on this young man in the lock up house, he told you where the tea pot was. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He made no difficulty. - A. He told me he had purchased it of Ellworthy, my servant.</p>
               <p>Q. And in consequence of what had happened he would tell you where it was that you might get it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This tea pot had been used, and tea leaves were in it at the time it was returned to you. - A. Yes.</p>

He has been there and drank tea there, and I have seen him at the General

               <p>Q. Your grandmother is a woman of property. - A. Yes.</p>

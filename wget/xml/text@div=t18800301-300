Shepherd's Well, near Dover. Dear Sir,—I have just heard from the City that the man whose cheque you received from me has turned out a dreadful rogue, and I will bring you the cash on Wednesday. Unfortunately, I cannot get there to<lb></lb>morrow, as I have an important engagement near Folkestone, but on Wednesday you will see me with the cash. W. W.

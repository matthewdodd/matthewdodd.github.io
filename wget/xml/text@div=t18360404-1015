                  </hi>. I am the father of this boy. On the 10th of March I was awoke about three o'clock in the morning by one of my daughters—I got out of bed to ask what she was crying for—she said the prisoner and another had gone and left her—I went down and found the street door open—I came up again, dressed myself, and missed from my breeches pocket four half-crowns and one shilling—I went out and found both my boys at the corner of Spital-square, in Bishopgate-street—I took the little one home, and gave the prisoner in charge, as he has robbed me so often—he has got a bad mother, who encourages him in it—she is in the hospital, and I will not let the children go near her—she has got property of mine, and will not give it up—she is his own mother—he had got the money in his pocket, in a tin box.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 369). On 10th February, a little before 3 a.m I was on duty in Cambridge Terrace, Woolwich, and my attention was called to the coffee-room shutters of the Cambridge Arms, which I had seen safe an hour and a half previously—I lifted the window and the shutter and the wire blind fell into the room—I jumped in and shut the shutter behind me, turned my light on, and saw the prisoner standing "to atten<lb></lb>tion" in a corner—I said "Is it a fair <hi rend="italic">cotch</hi>"—he said "I can't tell"—I could not make any one hear—I took him to the station, gave him into the sergeant's charge, went back to the house, went up to Mr. Hearn's room, and kicked the bedstead till he turned over, and came down and searched the house—I then went back and searched the prisoner, and found on him a screw which he had taken from the wire blind, several matches, and a knife, which I do not think he could have opened the window with, though it had been opened with a knife—he said "I was hard up, and I had not time to get anything before you came round."</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Cambridge Hotel, Woolwich—on 9th February I went to bed about 12.10, having; seen the potman fasten the coffee room securely and I fastened the parlour window—I was at the counter till 12.10, and no one could pass the house without my see<lb></lb>ing them—when I went to bed the house was safe—I was aroused by a policeman between 3 and 4 o'clock and found that some chips had been cut from the bar window, and it had been opened, but the entrance had been effected through the coffee-room window—I cannot swear to this screw, but there was a screw there when I went to bed, which was not there after<lb></lb>wards.</p>

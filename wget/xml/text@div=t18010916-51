             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a City officer; I know the prisoner, and I know Belasco; I saw them both in Thames-street, on the 17th of June, about five or ten minutes after twelve o'clock, as near as I can recollect; I apprehended the prisoner the next day, at his own house, in Petticoat-lane; I searched the room, but found nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you found the prisoner in a distressed condition? - A. Yes, with a child lying by him, quite naked; he had hardly any clothes to cover him.</p>

               <p>Q. You have apprehended him before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know that person, David Belasco? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when he was convicted upon that indictment? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp took an objection to the competence of the witness's testimony, which was over-ruled by the Court.</p>
               <p>David Belasco. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Look at the prisoner, and tell me if you know him? - A. Perfectly well. On the 17th of June I met with him in Thames-street, and I went with him to his apartments, in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch, and directly as we got about twenty yards up Philpot-lane, or Orange-lane, he said, Davey, come along, I have got a pocketbook; I immediately went home with him, and he opened the pocket-book; it was a black leather pocket-book, to the best of my recollection, with a strap, and a name on it on one side; it contained a parcel of letters and a bit of kerseymere, a kind of a pepper and salt colour, for a waistcoat or breeches, it was a kind of a mixture to the best of my recollection, pepper and salt, I did not take much notice what the colour was, I looked at it in a hurry; the letters were then read, and there being no fire, his wife tore the letters, and struck a light and burnt them, with the kerseymere; there was a Bank-note of 300l. and another of 500l. and a kind of a draft, I cannot say what it was, I cannot read, that was burnt, and the pocket-book likewise.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of the 500l. and the 300l.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160037"></xptr>notes? - A. He went out to sell the notes, and returned in about twenty minutes with them; his wife said, Davey, you had better go to one Mr. Farmer, in Woolpack-alley; he was not at home; his wife sent me to him, where he was, in Duke's-place, and I sold him the notes; he was to give me 400l. I am no scholar, and he counted down to me 400l. I gave the money to the prisoner, and told him it had been counted down to me 400l. but I was no scholar in reading the notes. I gave - Lazarus, the prisoner's wife, 112l. as well as I could count them; in counting that down, I reckoned I had given him upwards of 200l. or else Mr. Farmer must have cheated me of the difference; there was 30l. given by me, by the prisoner's order, to a young man of the name of Jacobs, who goes by the name of Light and Scabby Head, and the remaining part I had myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was your share? - A. I have a bad memory, and can't recollect; he then told me, he would go down to Bristol; says I, I shall go and clean myself, and you come to me, and I will go with you; and, instead of doing that, he got drunk, and I went to Bristol without him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. So you thought it sitting to cut, and run to Bristol? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say one word of this story that you have been telling us so glibly, till you were taken up and charged with this offence yourself? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You were promised, by the Lord-Mayor, that, if you would turn stag, and tell all you knew about it, you should turn evidence? - A. I don't understand about stag.</p>
               <p>Q. If you would be a witness against Lazarus, he would admit you an evidence for the Crown? - A. He did, and then I up and told all that really did pass.</p>
               <p>Q. This kerseymere that you speak of, was a pepper-and-salt colour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say you cannot read? - A. No, except it is my own Hebrew language.</p>
               <p>Q. Then be so good as tell me how you know a one from a five pound bank-note? - A. A one, two, or a five or so, I can tell; but, if it comes above that, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the person who was tried here and convicted of stealing a pocket-book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been tried in this place? - A. Twice.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you the other time? - A. I was honourably acquitted by the laws of my country; that was a long time ago, but now I have come to know better.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been taken up by different constables? - A. No oftener than I have suffered for; and I don't think it right that you should tell me of what I have suffered for; I was one year in the House of Correction for what you are speaking of.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never taken up as a rogue and vagabond? - A. That is a libel to any man.</p>
               <p>Q. You never was sent for six months to the House of Correction as a rogue and vagabond? - A. No, not for six months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long then? - A. Four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never in the New Prison? - A. Yes, that was the time I was acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. At no other time? - A. No, only when there was a game of cards playing among neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in custody, then? - A. Four days.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Stone.) Q. Was there more than one piece of cloth in your pocket-book? - A. One was buff-coloured kerseymere, and the other dark black and white mixture, what you may call a pepper-and-salt.</p>

               <p>Q. Before that conversation, were there any promises of favour made to him by Mr. Isaacs or any body else? - A. I said, remember, Lazarus, there is no one present who can have any authority to make you a promise of favour, or tempt you to speak.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Had not Lazarus been given to understand, before that, that he should be admitted an evidence against Belasco? - A. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Isaacs there before you? - A. He was there the day before. On the 19th of June last, I think, he said he was inclined to tell all he knew; I told him, if he was induced to say what he was about to say from any promise, not to speak, for no promise would be made him; he said, that himself, Belasco, and a man they call Scabby Head, went out with an intent to pick pockets, and near the Custom House they saw Mr. Stone; they followed him; the prisoner was not on the same side of the way with Stone; he was opposite to him, and saw Belasco draw the book out of his pocket; he crossed over, and Belasco said, follow me; they went to Petticoat-lane; Belasco went out with the intention to dispose of the bank-notes. I then desired that Mr. Stone, who was below, might come up; I asked him if he knew the prisoner; and the prisoner said, that is the gentleman that was robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Mr. Isaacs had been to the prisoner in the Compter the day before? - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not the Lord-Mayor's orders that the prisoner should see nobody but such persons as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160038"></xptr>you or Mr. Teague might approve? - A. Yes; Mr. Isaacs applied to me, and I mentioned it to the Lord-Mayor, who permitted him to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Isaacs was attorney for the prosecution, and the prisoner's own friends were refused? - A. I believe they were, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. His own attorney was refused? - A. I recollect Mr. Isaacs had seen him two or three times before his own attorney saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not Lazarus given to understand, at the Mansion House, that he should be admitted an evidence against Belasco? - A. Not till after I had seen him, in the presence of Mr. Teague and Mr. Isaacs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that intimation given to him before the first, second, or third, examination? - A. I cannot tell, upon my oath; I believe it was after the conversation with Mr. Isaacs.</p>
               <p>Q. And at a month's distance, he was committed to take his trial? - A. It was a long time after; it was more than a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was it not in consequence of the story that Lazarus told to you, in the Poultry Compter, that the Lord-Mayor was induced to flatter him that he should be admitted a witness?- A.It was in consequence of that conversation; the Lord-Mayor said, remember, if you are admitted an evidence, you must state the whole; you must reserve nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. And when Belasco was taken, Lazarus was committed for trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did my Lord-Mayor assign a reason why he was not admitted an evidence? - A. My Lord-Mayor said, it was because he was convinced he had told him a bundle of untruths.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>

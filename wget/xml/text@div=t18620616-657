                  </hi>. I am the wife of John King, a labourer, of 31, Charles-street, Westminster on Sunday, 13th April, I was in my room with my husband, cleaning myself and putting my things on, when the prisoner, who is my grandson, came in at the door—he had been in before, and left, and he came in again—I saw him coming across the room with something like a knife or a razor in his hand, and I knew it was murder directly—I shouted out, and he struck me across the free directly—I fell, and put the table over me, because I was afraid he would cut my throat—he cut me again across the head, and beat my head with a stick—the doctor came and stopped the blood—the bones of my head are still sore—I bled wonderful—a doctor from Parliament-street came in—I was taken to the hospital, and was these seven weeks—I had had no quarrel with my grandson, but a week or two before, when I was talking about May-day, he said that I should not be alive on May-day, but I did not take any notice of it before he threatened my life—somebody told me that he threatened my life before he tried it—he said so to his mother.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> As to my saying she would not be alive on May-day it is a gross lie, but I know she said that May-day would be a gay one. I had no intention of taking her life; if I had wished to do so I would have done it when there was nobody in the room, and I should have locked the door. I did not intend to take her life; I only intended to draw some of her blood. It is evident she is connected with the devil. There have been persons connected with the devil who have done things of witchcraft, though it is not believed in at this day. If you can prove to me that she does not work by devilish arts, I am willing to forfeit my life for her's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live with my wife at 31, Charles-street, Westminster—the prisoner is my grandson—on Sunday, 13th April, I was sitting by the fire after dinner, and the prisoner came in and warmed himself in front of me—my wife was by the window washing herself—I was not asleep, but I often go to sleep after dinner, and was sitting with my head down, when I heard a bustle, and my wife shouted out—I got up, and was knocked down by the prisoner—I did not see any more of it—I was <hi rend="italic">unsensed,</hi> and did not see what he had done—I saw no instrument in his hand—I was apparently like one half asleep—I knew he was beating with a stick, but did not know what it was, and when I got up to rescue her the prisoner left home—I saw the stick, and heard different gashes, but did not see the instrument he used—I took hold of him, held him by the hands, and called out—a man and woman came who live on the first-floor above me, and afterwards the landlord and landlady—they went and brought a policeman, who took the prisoner—they sent for a doctor, who did all he could to stop the blood, and she bled confusedly, wonderfully—two police-men took her to the hospital, and I came back again, and as I was walking by the table I saw my razor on it, which I had not used for two or three months.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and late house-surgeon at West<lb></lb>minster Hospital—on Sunday, 13th April, Mary King was brought there on a stretcher covered with blood—I immediately admitted her, and found on her face three contusions which must have been caused by some blunt instrument—on the left side was an incision extending across the cheek to past the ear, and another extending from the top of the head down to the same place—those two wounds might have been inflicted by a razor—there was a great collection of blood under the scalp—there was very great danger, in consequence of which I sent to the Magistrate to take her evidence—(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows</hi>)—"The latter part of my grandmother's evidence, about my saying she would not be alive in May, is false; she is a woman not fit to live; she has dealings with, and is connected with, the devil; I am certain of it."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Why I did shed her blood, was because she should not have that power over me which she has done with her arts; two hundred years ago I know such a woman would have been put to death without any ceremony about it. The reason I took upon me to revenge my own wrongs, was because I expected I should get very little redress from the law, because people consider themselves so much enlightened in these days that they do not believe in such a crime, but I do believe in it.</p>

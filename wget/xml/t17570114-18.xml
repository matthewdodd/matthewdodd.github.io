               <p>Margaret Price. The prisoner came to my house, on the Thursday night before New-Year's day, for some pearl ashes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married woman ?</p>
               <p>M. Price. Yes. My husband's name is Rice. My maid was making a mess of water-gruel. After the prisoner was gone the maid missed a silver spoon, that she had been using, from off the counter; where she said she had laid it. I went after the prisoner to her master's house. I told the mistress what we missed, and that I suspected her maid. She and I went up-stairs to her room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>M. Price. She was sitting, at the same time, on her bed-side. In turning up the bed we found the spoon lying on the sacking of the bedstead. It was mark'd with my husband's and my name.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say ?</p>
               <p>M. Price. She beg'd for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. Mention the words she made use of.</p>
               <p>M. Price. To tell the very words I cannot. She said she was never guilty of the like before, nor ever would be again, and beg'd we'd be merciful to her. I have heard she bore a very good character before this.</p>

            . The prisoner lived with me at the time this thing happe n'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live ?</p>
               <p>E. Frecleton. I live by Bow-Church. Mrs. Price came to me, and asked me where my girl was. I said, I believed she was gone to bed. She told me they had missed a silver spoon, which her maid had just put down out of her hand, and there was room for suspecting my girl of stealing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175701140013"></xptr> it. We went up to her. She was sitting on the side of the bed. We asked her to see her pocket. We found nothing there. Then Mrs. Price asked for the key of her box, that was standing by the bed-side. We looked, but found nothing there. Then I turn'd up her bed, and there lay the spoon; which Mrs. Price own'd. The prisoner had silver spoons, tankards and other silver things in my house in her care. She was always very honest to me. I had so good an opinion of the girl, that really I was so surprised that I could hardly tell what was said at that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I had been to fetch some sand, and when I went to dry it by the fire I found the spoon in it.</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Frecleton. How long had she lived with you ?</p>
               <p>E. Frecleton. She had lived with me but a very little time. I had a very good character with her, and she was a very good servant.</p>

               <p>Rivers Grindal. The prisoner's mother has work'd in my house, as a chairwoman, eight or ten years, whom I take to be remarkably honest; during which time I never heard any thing ill of the prisoner. She always bore the character of a sober honest girl.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Griffiths, and live at 6. Great Peter Street, Westminster—about 11 p.m., on 23rd April I was in the Rifleman public-house, Horseferry Road—Mrs. Johnson, the prisoner's mother-in-law, was there—a dispute arose between us—the prisoner was present—he pushed his mother-in-law and said "Don't talk to her the b----thing"—I turned round and asked him who he called a b----thing, and he struck me with his hat across the face—I picked up a pint pot which stood on the counter and struck him somewhere on the head, I don't know where—his head bled, but not very much—he left the house with his mother-in-law and came back with a constable—he wished to charge me with the assault, but the landlord said he could not because he had struck me first with his hat—he left the public-house with his mother-in-law and the policeman about 11.5—I left about 7 or 8 minutes to 12 o'clock—when I got outside I saw the prisoner and his mother and father-in-law standing at the end of Bull's Head Court, and I felt afraid to go down—he walked towards me, took a poker from underneath his coat and struck me with it—I fell and was insensible for a few minutes—when I recovered I was assisted to the hospital and my wound was dressed—it bled very much.</p>

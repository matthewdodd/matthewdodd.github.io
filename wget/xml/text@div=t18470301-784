               <p>prisoner was in our service for five or six years—it was his duty to at<lb></lb>tend me and my partner, at any sale which was going on—on those occa<lb></lb>sions he had a duplicate book of the catalogue of the sake that was going on, before him—I have the book here—if money were paid for an article at the end of the sale, if it were a single lot, it was the prisoner's duty to place it to the account of money—this is a printed catalogue of the day's sale—the catalogue is interleaved, and in the margin of the interleaves are the numbers corresponding with the catalogue—the first lot sold that day was to Solomon, for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the next two lots are bought in, and no account taken of them—the lot of Solomons is posted at the moment, No. 423—3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if a party whom we know attends the sale, and makes a purchase of a lot, we enter the lot to the name of the party purchasing, and then post it into the book—if he purchases more than one lot, we enter the number of articles he purchases during the day—if an individual purchases a lot which is paid for, either at the time, or directly the sale is over, that is fires carried to the account in the ledger, and then transferred from there to the money-paper—it was the pri<lb></lb>soner's duty, with respect to the money payments, to furnish what we call the money-paper—here is the money-paper for that day—to make up the money-paper the prisoner goes through the ledger, enters the names of the parties who have paid deposits, with the amount of the deposit; all the names of other persons who have paid for their goods entirely, and the total amount of the money received for single lots—this is called the money-paper.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you took the prisoner from a Mr. Ritcher? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember the name, but we received a very good character with him—the duties he had to perform are not very easy, they require attention—there is a great deal of confusion at times—I think the prisoner was given into custody about eight o'clock on Monday evening—he did not beg that he might be allowed to make out his accounts—his accounts were already balanced—he was told there was a deficiency—he did not beg that he might have an opportunity of balancing his account before I did anything—he was constantly employed, to my knowledge, to make purchases for other persons—he would not be intrusted with money to make the payments—we expect to be paid if we do not know the customers, or to have the goods on the premises—we have not credited the prisoner to any large amount—I think the most he ever owed the firm has been 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have not, in point of fact, ever placed any restriction at all upon him—there are persons who attend our rooms, who are perfectly well known—they might, if they pleased, receive goods on credit, but not without our concurrence—there are customers that the prisoner would be perfectly entitled to give credit to, and allow the articles to be removed from the place on the day of the sale—there have been articles sold there on his account—I think we owe him for that about 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I have not sent that to him since this matter—he has been a purchaser on credit as far as a coat, or anything for his personal use—he purchased a piano-forte by private contract, my partner sold it him on credit for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13 guineas—we made him debtor for the piano, and gave him him credit to the amount of 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I seat the caravan for the piano, and I believe we have it now—I have not sent it back to the prisoner—his two sisters and a friend came the day after he was apprehended, and I stated to them that this piano-forte had been obtained with the understanding that the prisoner should procure my consent before it was removed off the premises—that is what Mr. Debenham told me—I should think the prisoner's sisters are twenty or twenty-two years of age—I did not work on their fears—I told them I should send for the piano-forte it they had no objection—they said they had no objection, I was quite welcome to do it—I sent and took it—that was the day after the prisoner was in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not, since you have given this prisoner, with his twelve or thirteen years' character, into custody, found that he has debited himself with three different sums of money, which in point of fact he had not received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With two sums he has—2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I believe that was all—Mr. Robson's account was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but that was not one of them—there was not a sum for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for which he debited himself, and in point of fact made a mistake—Mr. Robson called the day after the prisoner was in custody and paid a sum of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he had debited himself with—he debited himself with 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 15th, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 11th for lot 57, and since that time I have received these two sums—I have not sent them to the prisoner—Mr. Parry</p>

               <p>is a customer of ours—I am not aware that the prisoner debited himself with 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Parry on the same day—Mr. Parry bought a lot for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 15th, that is entered as paid—we have not been paid that since that I am aware of—Mr. Milo has not paid that to my know<lb></lb>ledge—Mr. Carter paid 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a lot on the same day—that has not been paid since—it has not come through our books—I do not know that Mr. Carter did not pay that—I have not heard that—I have heard nothing of that account except that Mr. Carter called a few days ago, and said he had given the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the week before he was apprehended, to pay for this lot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. On Monday evening, 15th Feb., I was sent for to Mr. Storr's about seven o'clock—I had some com<lb></lb>munication with him in consequence of some information he had—I recom<lb></lb>mended the prisoner should be sent for, and he was—Mr. Storr said to him, "I understand you wish to say something to me"—the prisoner said yeas, he wished to beg Mr. Storr's forgiveness—I told him who I was, and what I was, and I told him Mr. Storr charged him with stealing a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he went down on his knees, and begged for mercy, he said he had done so, but he hoped Mr. Storr would forgive him—I then handed a book to him which I had in my hand, which I had been looking over previously—I stood along<lb></lb>side the prisoner, and pointed to the name of Smith—I said, "How do you account for the name of Smith not being brought out as money paid"—he said, "I know nothing of that, the only thing I have done to-day which I have not accounted for, is a person of the name pf Barnett, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he still begged of Mr. Storr for money, but he said he must give him into custody for the protection of the other servants in the house—I took him to the station—I</p>

               <p>found on him a penny and two keys—I came back and searched his desk—I found in it some duplicates, a sixpence, and a half-penny.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that the prisoner said he had stolen the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did—the Magistrate entertained a different opinion, and dismissed the case—it turned out that it was not paid till the next morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

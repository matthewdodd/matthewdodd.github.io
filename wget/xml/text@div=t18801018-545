I am Inspector of the West-Central District Post-office—on the afternoon of 13th September Mr. Loveridge came and handed me this order—I went with him to his dining-rooms, and there saw the prisoner—I asked her if she had presented that order to Mr. Loveridge; she said "I did"—I said "Do you wish him to cash it?"—she said "Yes"—I said "How do you wish to be paid?"—she said "I am not particular; half gold and half silver"—I said "There is some<lb></lb>thing wrong about this order; will you come with me to the secretary's office at the General Post-office?"—she said "I have no objection"—we then went downstairs, and in the passage she said "How dare you detain me, I have done nothing wrong?"—I said "The money order, which appears to have been tampered with, has been found in your possession, and it will be my duty to take you to the secretary's office"—she said "I shall not go"—I said "If you do not go I shall call a police constable and give you into his custody"—she still refused, but asked me if I would go to her solicitor, Mr. Gordon, of 51, Lincoln's Inn Fields, who would vouch that she was a respectable woman—I assented, and crossed down Holborn to Gate Street—as we passed along I said to her "You will understand that whatever Mr. Gordon may say it will be my duty as an officer of the Post-office to take you to the secretary's office"—she said "Will you not take Mr. Gordon's word as to my respectability?"—I said "No"—she then consented to go with me to the secretary's—I called a cab and we got in—on the way to the office she told me that the order had been sent to her by Miss Read—I asked where Miss Read lived—she said "In the High Road, Mitcham"—on arriving at the secretary's office she told me she had another money-order for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said "Who sent you that?"—she said "My washerwoman, Mrs. Connell,</p>

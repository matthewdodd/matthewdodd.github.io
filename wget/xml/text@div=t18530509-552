               <p>Monkwell-street. On 23rd April, about half past 7 o'clock, I came down to take in some milk—I received information from the milkman, and found the copper had been taken away; I had seen it safe about 7 o'clock the same morning—I and Welch, the milkman, ran, and came up with the prisoner a few minutes afterwards in Falcon-square; Welch collared him, and asked him what he had done with the copper—he said, "What copper?"—Welch said, "That copper I saw you with;" and took him up a court—I went up also, and found the copper in a bag; I took it out of the bag, and took it home—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—it belongs to Michael Edward Pane, my land-lord, and is the same that was safe in my kitchen at 7 o'clock; 1 know it by its being mended a fortnight before—it was fixed in the brickwork—I am a laundress, and had used it a day or two before—the prisoner was not more than half a dozen yards from the copper, if so much, when he was collared.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a milkman and cowkeeper, of No. 19, Silver-street. On the morning of 23rd April, about half past 7 o'clock, I went to serve milk at the prosecutrix's house—I saw the prisoner coming out of the house with the copper; I believe this one produced to be the same—I gave information to Mrs. Miller, she went down stairs, and followed me—I over-took the prisoner in Falcon-square, walking away from the passage where I afterwards found the copper, and which is no thoroughfare; it leads up by the side of a chapel—I said, "Young man, I want you"—he said, "What do you want with me?"—I said, "Where is the copper you had just now?"—he said, "I had no copper, and know nothing about it"—I said, "Come with me, and we will see"—I took him up the passage, and found the copper in a bag; it was rather flattened, and I believe it to be the same—the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of 153, Bethnal Green-road—on Wednes<lb></lb>day morning, 3d December, I was with Morley, Culliford, and Higgs, at the Vicar of Wakefield public-house; we left at half-past 1; we were all quite sober—Higgs and Morley were on in front, and had turned round the corner of North-street, while Culliford and I were in Three Colt-lane—the prisoner Haycock turned the corner and caught hold of Culliford—I went to protect him, and Archer hit me on top of my head with a stick—I called for assistance, and Morley came round the corner, and Archer hit him over the head with a stick—my head swelled up about the size of a pigeon's egg by the time I got to the station-house—Morley fell from the blow, and Higgs picked him up and sat him on a door step—I then went to see if I</p>

               <p>could see any of the others who had been to the raffle, but could not, and I came back and found Culliford following the prisoners—I went with him and they were given into custody—when the prisoners came up Haycock wanted to charge Culliford with assaulting him—Morley was brought there wounded.</p>

I am a butcher, of 1, Ann-street, Stepney—I was at the Vicar of Wakefield with the others, and left about half-past 1 in the morning—when I got to the comer of North-street, Morley and Higgs had gone on—Haycock came up and got hold of me by the collar and waistcoat, and tried to throw me, but I got away from him—he did not say a word—Bull came to my assistance, and Archer came up and gave Bull a knock on the head with a stick—Bull ran round the corner, and Morley came back to our assistance, and Archer gave him a blow on the head with the stick—I got away and followed the prisoners with Bull—I overtook them at the Lamb public-house, and they were given in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were they alone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we were four, but two of our friends had gone on, so we were only two—I was not more merry than I am now; a glass or two of sherry would not make anybody very merry—there was not a good deal of treating going on—I was not hurt, no attempt was made to rob me that I know of, but I dare say if they had the opportunity they would—that was the first time I had spoken to Bull, but I had seen him before—I had only had about two glasses of sherry and some lemonade.</p>

                  </hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you rather merry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, we were there is no mistake about that, it was rather dark—I may have given Archer a blow; I do not know whether he felt it—I remember his saying, "If you do not stand off, I will give you a blow on the head with my stick"—I knocked his hat off, and it was not found till afterwards—when I had been struck with the stick, I said, "Well, lads, I must make the best of it, and I</p>

               <p>must get home;" it was nothing but a squabble, and I was very sorry to see it put in the papers—I had never seen Culliford before that evening; he and Bull were rather the same as myself, we were inclined for the night, and no mistake about it.</p>

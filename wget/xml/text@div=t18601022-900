                  </hi>. I am a solicitor—On 6th August the prisoner came to my office in Moorgate-street—I had been employed against the prisoner for a client, and there was about 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due from the prisoner to our firm—he brought this bill and said, "I regret, Mr. Chorley, that I can't hand you cash as agreed; I am exceedingly pressed, and I shall be obliged if you will be good enough to take this and hold it, instead of the instalment which I ought to pay;" and hand me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took the bill and gave him a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Who is the acceptor?"—he said, "He is a very respectable man, a carpenter and coffee-house keeper, residing at Woolwich, near the railway-station; he accepted this bill in my presence this morning</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186010220135"></xptr>
               <p>—the bill was returned dishonoured and I communicated with the prisoner—he called on me and I told him the acceptor had called upon me, that I had shown him the bill and that he said, after minutely examining it, "I am not able to write so well as that; I am no scholar; I don't know anything about it"—the prisoner said, "That is all nonsense, it has been paid by two instalments"—I said, "That is very strange as you said it was an accommo<lb></lb>dation bill"—he said, "It is all right, it is an accommodation bill; it should have been repaid but it has been forgotten"—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>:) "August 6th, 1860; one month after date pay to my order the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for value re<lb></lb>ceived.

                  </hi>., I am waiter at Gregory's Hotel, Rupert-street. I know the prisoner—on 18th Dec. he was indebted to me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot recollect that I asked him to pay me, but he proposed to pay me—he offered me in payment a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—this is the note—I took it from the prisoner to Mr. Gregory, the proprietor—the prisoner said he had received some money, and now he should be able to pay me, and he took this note out of his pocket book—I took it to Mr. Gregory, who gave me the full change—the prisoner said, "I will give you 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. now; I am going into the country, and on my return I will pay you the remainder"—this was on a Thursday; and on the following Tuesday, in consequence of information, I went with a constable to a public house in the Haymarket—I did not find the prisoner there—I went to Regent-street, and saw him walking along the street—I tapped him on the shoulder, and said, "Mr. Winsor?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "The note you gave me was forged"—he said he did not know it, but if I would give him a little time he had no doubt he should be able to find the person who gave it him, and he would make it all right—I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When I saw you on the evening of the 18th, what did I say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That you had got some money, and should be able to pay me, but you had no change—I said, "I can get change"—you walked into the smoking room, and gave me the note—I was not away longer than while I walked to the proprietor to get change—it might be five minutes—I did not say before the Magistrate that it was twenty minutes before I returned—Mr.</p>

               <p>Gregory put your name on the note there and then—I had no other notes about me at that time—I did not take any money that day for horses that I had backed—I am positive this is the note you gave me—I do not think I had taken another note that day.</p>

I went with Brom-hall to a house in the Haymarket—I waited outside while he went in, and the prisoner walked out at the other door, and went down the Haymarket—I afterwards saw Bromhall go to the prisoner, and I took him in charge—the prisoner said if he would give him time, he should find the person he got it from—when at the station, he said he got it from a man of the name of Mitchelmore—we asked him where he lived—he said he did not know—he said he could not describe him; he had no doubt he could find him.</p>

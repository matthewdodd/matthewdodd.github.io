                  </hi>. I am a zinc-worker in my father's employ at 40, Blackheath Road—the prisoners were in his service up to January 2nd, and Champ had been in his service 12 years—it was their duty to arrive there at 7 a.m.—the key of the metal warehouse is kept in the front shop, and the prisoners had no business there in the morning—there is a workshop as well, and the prisoners had business there—the metal is taken from the front shop, and given to them in the back shop for the purpose of working it—neither of them had any business with the key of the metal warehouse—I live there, and on 2nd January I came down at 6.30 a.m. and hid myself—I saw Lane come in at the back premises and go to the workshop as usual—he then went to the house, took the key from a nail, met Champ at the front shop door, spoke to him, and then they entered the warehouse next door, and I saw Champ leave with a roll of zinc on his shoulder, and go towards Deptford—I had given notice to the police over-night; they watched them, and I gave Lane in charge—the prisoners were taken before a Magistrate, and committed for trial—my father received this letter on January 7th in my presence; it is in Lane's writing.</p>

               <p>there before 7, but the lad Davis came at 6.30—the prisoners often went into the front shop by my orders, but never without—zinc could not be obtained without the key of the warehouse—I also gave Davis in custody, but the charge was dismissed—he had not taken the shutters down, nor was he preparing to do so—we open at daylight, but it was not daylight at 7 o'clock—Davis had opened the door from inside, and <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> the doors to, and returned to his work at the back, and then the prisoners went in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was not Davis's duty to open that door from the inside; it was a departure from his duty—when he had opened it Lane came into the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of the last witness—on the morning of January 2nd I was in the back parlour washing, and saw Lane in the front shop—he had no right there—the door had then been opened, but I cannot gay by whom—I saw Lane walk towards the key and walk back to it, and then Champ came to the door and left, and Lane returned and seemed to hang the keys up again, and returned to the workshop—they afterwards went out into George Street, where I saw Champ go into the Clarendon public-house and the metal standing outside in a corner; he came out, put it on his shoulder, and carried it away—Fox stopped him, and I returned home.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was about 7.15 when I saw Lane in the shop—I was with my brother—I first saw Champ about a quarter of a mile from my house—the whole distance is from half to three-quarters of a mile—Fox was meeting Champ when he stopped him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor—I employed the two prisoners—they had no business in the front shop at 6.45 a.m., nor with the key of the metal warehouse—this zinc is mine—I gave them no authority to take it—to the best of my belief this letter is in Lane's writing—I received it on 7th January—I had communicated with the police prior to January 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My orders were so strict that the prisoners would have reason to believe that I should blame them for going into the shop at that time, and especially if they took the key and went to the warehouse—there were 7 tons of metal in the front shop, without their going into the ware-house for any. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "H.M. Prison, Clerkenwell. To Mr. F. W. Banks. Dear Sir,—I write to you these few lines praying you to be lenient towards me and Jim, for our sin is not so bad as I have been told you think it is. Of course, what Nixon or others might have to answer for we cannot say, Sir. I hope you will not press the charge against us, if only on account of our wives and poor children. I was in hopes, and still are, of working for you for many years to come. I am very sorry, and humbly pray you to be lenient towards us and give us a fresh start, and then I do not think you would ever have cause to regret being lenient to two who are now as miserable as it is possible for them to be.

                  </hi>. I am a detective attached to the Criminal Investigation Department—on 2nd January, in consequence of instructions, just before 7 a.m., I placed myself in the police-court opposite Messrs. Banks's premises, watching, and at 7.15 I saw Champ go to the front door of the shop, and then to the door leading to the warehouse; I then saw him leave the yard with a roll of zinc over his shoulder—I followed him over Deptford Bridge through Mill Lane into Friendly Street; when he turned the corner I was close behind him, because it was not light, and as I turned he was resting—I had another man</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903030034"></xptr>
               <p>with me—Champ went into George Street and Nelson Street—he then stopped a minute or two, went on again, and had three or four rests—he then put the zinc down outside the Clarendon public-house, went in, and came out again in three or four minutes, took up the zinc, and when he had got a little way down George Street I stopped him, and said "What are you going to do with that?"—he said "What is that to do with you?"—I said "I suppose you know I am a policeman?"—he said "I don't care if you are"—I said "What are you going to with it?"—he said "Take it back to Mr. Banks, where I brought it from"—I said "Oh, why did you bring it away?"—he said "That is my business"—I said "Yes, and it is my business as well now"—he said "Well, I brought it to decide a wager to see how quick I could carry it there and back again"—I said "It does not appear so, as you have had a great number of rests on the road; I shall take you to the police-station now"—I took his there and he was charged—Lane had then been brought in by another constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was formerly employed in the police as a warrant officer—I have had considerable experience—I was within six or seven yards of Champ as I turned the corner—I did not see Mr. John Banks there; I saw him when I arrived at the station, but not during the whole of my course—I took Champ because he did not go where I expected he would—he had to pass the police-court—it was a very heavy load, about 1 cwt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I suppose young Mr. Banks went another way—I did not know him until after I got to the station—it was not light, and I can't say whether he was there or not.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you know it was Austin's apartments? - A. He was sent for from work in the neighbourhood, and he came to these apartments; he was pretent when his box was searched, but nothing particular was found in it, except some combs, and some soap of my own manufacturing.</p>

               <p>Q.How recently had you seen the prisoner Austin upon your premises? - A. A few days before I gave her warning, he came in and asked for Mary; I told him she was up stairs in the kitchen, and he went up.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM CHAPMAN sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Public-office, Hatton-garden: on Friday, the 22d of May, the prosecutor applied to our office for a search warrant, to search the apartments of Austin, No. 69. Cow-cross, where I found in a box, four pieces of soap, and a number of other thing, which the prosecutor cannot swear to. (Produces the soap.)</p>
               <p>LEVI OBURN sworn. - I went with Chapman to the apartments of Austin, Austin produced a key to open the box; then Chapman searched the box, and found these things; I then went with Austin over to Lambeth, where we took the prisoner Denham; then the took us to her lodgings, and we searched her, but I found nothing upon her,</p>
               <p>JOHN READ sworn. - I am an officer; in consequence of a warrant, I went to search Denham's box; but found nothing; we than got a warrant to search Austin's box; there I found these two ivory combs, (producing them) after that, we went with Austin, and apprehended Denham, over the water; I searched her, and in her pocket I found a gold bracelet buckle, and a gold soap.(The property was identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Denham's defence. Mr. Dewdney neither allows victuals enough, nor any thing else in the house, to supply a servant; I never made away with any thing in my life; I have been obliged to buy victuals for myself, and likewise for his youngest son, about thirteen years of age; young Mr. Dewdney gave me the combs; the apprentice has frequently brought soap up to wash his hands, and knowing Mr. Dewdney would not suffer them to use it in the kitchen, I have frequently bought soap, and I thought I had a right to them in return; their general character is, that of scarcity and starving, he has had three or four servants in a month; Mr. Dewdney has a son, that has a great deal of company, and takes things away unknown to Mr. Dewdney.</p>
               <p>Austin's defence. I went to see this young woman on Sunday, and I stopped to tea; she said she was coming away the next day; and as I was coming away, she gave me a little bag to take care of, till the next day; I had no thought to ask what was in it; and about five days after that; I was taken up.</p>

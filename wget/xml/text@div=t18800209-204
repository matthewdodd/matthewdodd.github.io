                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant G.</hi>) About 8 p.m. on 30th January I Saw the prisoner coming from a public-house in Old Street with two other lade—the prisoner went down Wilderness Row by himself and stopped in front of the wall letter-box about a minute—I was 20 or 30 yards off—he walked away and came back a minute—I was 20 or 30 yards off—he went on for six or seven minutes—he want to another public-house at the corner of Old Street—I saw him touch the letter-box, and when he left it I saw him join another boy about 12 yards from the box—they speared to be speaking—the prisoner appeared to have an open letter in his hand, and I saw some fragments of paper fall between the two boys—they than went to Aldersgate Street, and I picked up these pieces of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I have stuck on paper—I then saw a third boy join them, and they walked to Fore Street—the other boys went away, and the prisoner stood for a short time at the corner and then went up to the pillar letter box at the corner of Fore Street, and he touched the aperture—I ran and caught him by the arm, and said, "What did you put in the letter box?"—he said, "Nothing, I was simply reading the notice"—I found on him, some matches and this postcard (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it had on it a sticky substance and was addressed to Mr. Hasloe—he said, "I picked it up just outside the Foresters' Hall," which is about six yards from the wall letter box in Wilderness Row—I went with Elveston and examined the box there, and Found two matches at the bottom of the box just outside, which corresponded With the matches I found on the prisoner—I also found more fragments of the letters I have produced—I then went to the pillar box and examined it</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was walking up and down waiting for a friend, and a fellow who was along with me went to the letter box and took out one. I said, "You are a fool if you do that; you might take out 150 letters and get nothing for it." He said, "Never mind," and asked me to read it. I read it, and he tore it up. The postcard he dropped outside Foresters' Hall, and I intended posting it in the pillar box in Fore Street, when I was caught hold of.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the public-house—I saw five half-crowns one shilling, and a sixpence, in the prosecutor's hand—the prisoner then came in, and said a friend wanted to see the prosecutor—he took us into a private house—we there got drinking and tossing—the prosecutor laid his head on the table, and went to sleep—the prisoner came and sat on the left side of him, and put his hand across into his brace pocket, and when he took it out it was closed—I cannot say what he took out, but I know that before the prosecutor went to sleep he had put a half-crown, a fourpenny-piece, and some halfpence, into his pocket—I did not say anything till I got outside the door—directly I got out I told the prosecutor—he felt in his pocket, and his money was gone—he went for a policeman, but could not see one—I got one from the station—there were five or six other persons in the room when we first went in.</p>

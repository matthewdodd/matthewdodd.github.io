On the 7th of January, about half-past nine o'clock at night, I was opposite St. Peter's-alley, in Gracechurch-street; Lewis came to me, and asked me to go down an alley with her, leading into the market; I refused - I crossed the road, she came with me, and then a tall woman came up, and asked me to go down <placeName id="t18220220-42-crimeloc228">St. Peter's alley</placeName>

I was quite sober - Lewis followed her directly; when I got to Cornhill, I missed my watch. A gentleman passed while they were with me, but did not stop - I know my watch was safe when I was in the alley; I ran to find them but they were gone. On Thursday, I saw them together, in Gracechurch-street, between nine and ten o'clock at night; I said nothing to them, but went home - I watched there on Friday night, about the same time, and saw them. I went home again, without speaking to them; I wished to speak to my father about it first, and that is why I did not call the watchman. I saw my father on Sunday; and they were taken on the Monday night - I had two constables with me. I saw my watch, on the Thursday afterwards, in pawn; nothing improper passed between us.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoners on Monday evening, the 14th in Bishopsgate-street, in company. The prosecutor swore to Lewis, and said he believed Brown to be the other - I found nothing on them; Lewis said, it was a pity she should suffer alone, and that Brown was with her. I found the duplicate of the watch at Brown's lodging, No. 72, Rose-street, Bethnal-green; Lewis said, in her presence, that they were her lodgings.</p>

            , for concealing his effects, at his last examination, he having been a bankrupt; and to be sure a more serious case, your Lordship knows very well, cannot come before a Court and Jury; such a man certainly deserves to suffer a capital punishment: but a circumstance has happened since the finding this bill, which is, that a very material witness is dead, whose evidence cannot be supplied by any other person; it would therefore be indecent in me, to keep up this case; to go through the whole of the remaining evidence, when, at the latter end, I shall be told, that a circumstance is wanting, which is absolutely necessary to be proved, and that the Jury must acquit the prisoner; therefore, instead of taking up the time of your Lordship and the Jury, I produce no evidence.</p>

My Lord, I wish, and desire the favour of this Court to hear me a few words; I am a man that has been most generally ill treated: they have taken the advantage of me, because they judge I am an ignorant and an illiterate man; these are people that have been acquainted with the quirks of the law, and have had some scholastical education, brought up under the name of Mr. Crossly: I have witnesses, now present, of their making their braggs; and about a fortnight ago, says he, I cannot support this action I have against him no way; but not withstanding that, he never can get out of the bowels of a goal.</p>
               <p>Court. If any facts had been stated, that might have been any imputation on you, and you was on your defence, it would be my duty to hear any thing you could say, but not now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Mr. Evans, I did not chuse, nor was I instructed, to throw imputations on you, but I tell you now, that you are in extreme good luck, that the witness is dead.</p>

               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. COMMON SERJEANT.</p>
               <p>Mr. Penton. My Lord, after having prosecuted this unfortunate man, your Lordship may perhaps think it singular that I wish to recommend him to his Majesty's mercy; I am induced to do this from circumstances that I own weigh with me, and I have no doubt will weigh with your Lordship; the candour with which the prisoner has behaved ever since he was apprehended, and the manner in which he has stood forth to do all he could to restore that property he had taken, is something more than the general conduct of a criminal in his situation; in the first place, it is necessary for me to say, that when first he went to the office, he was induced to make the confession he did, and he was then told the consequences very properly by the magistrate; he then was asked, whether he would make the confession; he did so; and, in short, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120019"></xptr>stood in a manner convicted, from the testimony of some of the pawnbrokers; but yet, from the backwardness of others, it would have been absolutely impossible for me to have regained a considerable part of my property, had it not been for the confession of the prisoner; and I look upon him, in some degree, to have brought before the public, criminals equally guilty with himself; and in so doing he has made full compensation: what he could do, he has done; and therefore, although he is unfortunate, I flatter myself it may be his first offence; at the same time I flatter myself that he has not been so great a criminal as he appears in this Court: It is for that reason, and for that reason only, that I am to move your Lordship, that what I have stated may be laid as favourably as possible before his Majesty.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Penton, you may depend upon it this case will be reported fairly and candidly by the learned Recorder (who is not here at present), and that your recommendation will make a part of that report; what effect it will have on his Majesty, it is not for me to say: I, for one, after what you have said, can have no objection to your recommendation.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, the jury wish to join with Mr. Penton as far as they can with propriety.</p>
               <p>Court. Pawnbrokers, I see there is a list of no less than seventeen of you here; I am very glad, for your sakes and characters, that you have stood forth, in the manner you have done, to produce the property; it was not necessary to go into all that quantity of things, but you know very well it is your duty to deliver them all up; and I trust (I say it publickly before the learned counsel, who conducted this prosecution, as he does every other, very ably) that those pawnbrokers who have endeavoured to screen a man from justice, will have justice done them in their turn; and be assured, whenever men of their description come into this Court, and act improperly, the Court will take proper notice of them; because they know they have an opportunity of screening many thieves, and they know also that they have an opportunity of being of great service to the publick; and when they do so, the publick will be obliged to them; when they do otherwise, the Court will hold a tight hand over them; and therefore you must deliver the goods you have to Mr. Penton's servants.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Call Mr. Priestman. - My name is Priestman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I do not ask you a question, as I want nothing from you. - I am not ashamed of my conduct; I have done nothing amiss.</p>

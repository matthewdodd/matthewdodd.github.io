                  </hi>. I live in King-street, Long-acre, and am a furniture-broker—the prisoner was in my employ—he was in the habit of selling tables and other things for me at times—it was his duty to deliver up the money to me or my wife—he sold a table for 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he only gave me 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said he sold it for that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Milwood, of 13, Charlton Street, Fitzroy Square—on 15th May, about 12 o'clock at night, there was a knock at my door, and I recognized the prisoner's voice, who occupied the third floor back—he was insulting a woman, a customer of ours—I opened the door and he pushed her, called her very bad names, and told her to go in—my husband told him he would not have a customer of his insulted, the prisoner turned on my husband and wished him to come into the street to fight; he said he did not wish to strike an old man, but after a great many insults my husband did strike him—the prisoner then said, "I will set fire to the whole lot in the house"—his wife and son persuaded him to go to his room—he was very drunk—about 3 o'clock in the morning I was aroused by his wife calling to him from the top floor to put out the fire—he was in the yard—my room was full of smoke, and smelt strongly of fire—he made a rattling of pails in the yard and said, "I am trying to put it out"—I opened the bedroom door and saw three lodgers coming down stairs, they told me to get out of the place as it was on fire—the fire was in the back yard, in a closet adjoining the dust hole, which is made of wood—there were empty wooden boxes in it, and shavings, rags, paper, and wood—the dust hole is outside the house, but joins it against the brick wall of the house—the wooden door of the dust hole touches the window sill of the cellar where there are paraffin cans—it is a general shop, we sell almost everything—there was very little in the paraffin cans, we had drained them; there were also butter tubs, soda tubs, and shavings, in the cellar close to the window—my husband and the other men lodgers went down and put the fire out—about 11 o'clock in the morning the prisoner got up, he began abusing me and my husband—he gave me messages which he wished me to give to my husband—I told him to take them himself—I said "You are not a man to go and try to set fire to the place last night," he said "Yes, I did it with a candle, and I will do it again."</p>

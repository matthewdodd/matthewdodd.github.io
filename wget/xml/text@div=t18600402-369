                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. David Lonsda le, a linen-draper, at 29, Aldgate—on 29th February between 4 and 5 in the afternoon the prisoner came into the shop—she asked to look at some dresses—they were shown to her at the dress-counter—she afterwards requested to look at some silks, and they were brought to her—she was taken from the dress counter to the silk counter—I was at the silk counter—I was near enough to see what she was doing—I was serving a customer at the same time; and in the course of serving at the counter, I saw the prisoner take a dress—she seemed to ask for anything but what she was shown—if she was shown some particu<lb></lb>lar style, it was not exactly what she wanted; she wanted something else—I heard all that passed—Eldridge was attending to her—from what I had seen I paid attention to what was going on, and I saw her take one dress from off the counter and slip it into her lap—it was a green silk dress—it is here—Aldridge then went to another witness, Handley, who was also watching her—he was standing in the centre of the shop, behind, as it were, a pile of dresses—on the two conversing together, I saw the prisoner take</p>

               <p>these three dresses from her lap, it appeared to me; I was on the other side of the counter—I could not see her lap—she gave' them a jerk on to the counter—instead of going on to the counter, two I think went on to the floor—I picked them up and put them on to the counter, and they we're then in a crumpled state—she said, "These have dropped down"—the dresses would be shown to her half way open, in the position I picked them up—she was dressed, as she is now, with a cloak and bonnet—this is the dress (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) that I saw her take from the counter—I saw it go, it slipped down—I did not see her hand drawing it, it could not have slipped—the counter is wider than the silk—it was lying flat on the counter—it was pulled down right off the counter—I did not see who pulled it—I did not see her fingers—it was pulled off rather quickly—I don't know anything of that purse or bag, it is not our property—the whole of these silks are worth 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they are the property of Mr. Lonsdale—we sent for an officer—she was first aaked her name, and she said, "My name Sir, my name Sir—is—is—Elizabeth Cooper"—she was then asked where she lived; she hesitated, and at last said, "In the Curtain-road."</p>

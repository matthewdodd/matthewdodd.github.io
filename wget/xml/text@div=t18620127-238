                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 472). On Wednesday, 8th January, I was with Betts in Queen-street, near the prosecutor's warehouse, and saw Wilkinson two or three yards from their door, and Johnson at the corner of Cloak-lane, about ten yards from the door—I had previously seen them walking together—I passed them and walked on—they were looking about them in every direction—we passed down about thirty yards—we were in plain clothes, and we then turned round and saw that Johnson had disappeared—we crossed to the west side of Queen-street, and saw Wilkinson standing outside the warehouse door, and immediately afterwards Johnson came out of the warehouse with a case in his arms, which appeared heavy—Wilkinson turned his back—Johnson put the case on Wilkinson's back—we then crossed over Queen-street—Johnson turned his head and saw us, and took it off Wilkinson's shoulder, put it on the pavement, walked two or three yards, and then they ran off as fast as they could—I pursued them, and took Wilkinson—I told him I took him for stealing a case of goods out of a warehouse in Cloak-lane—he said, "It was not I who stole it; it was the other man; he asked me to carry it for him"—this is the case, and this is a portion of the starch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was filled with these packages.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 461). I was with Henderson on 8th January, walking down Queen-street, and saw Johnson standing at the corner of Cloak-lane, two or three yards from the prosecutor's warehouse door—Wilkinson was close by—they were both looking anxiously about them in every direction—we afterwards returned, looked down Cloak-lane, and saw Wilkinson standing in the same position by the warehouse door—in about half a minute Johnson brought this case out in his arms and put it on Wilkinson's back—we walked towards them—Johnson turned his head and appeared to see us—he took the box off Wilkinson's back and set it down, walked two or three yards and then commenced running—I followed Johnson but could not catch him, being obstructed by the car<lb></lb>riages, but I apprehended him on the Monday morning following, in Ratcliff-highway, at half-past 1, and charged him with stealing a case of starch from Messrs. Wotherspoon's warehouse—he said that I had made a mistake that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Robert Wotherspoon and another, wholesale confectioners—I cannot swear to this case being ours, but it is similar to those we had on the premises on 8th January, and which contain starch—the prisoners had no authority to take a case like that from the warehouse that day.</p>

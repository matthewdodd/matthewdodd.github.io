                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—I lived at 5, Adam and Eve Place, St. Pancras Road—on the night of 26th August, about 8 o'clock, I came home with my mother—the prisoner came in about a minute after—he said to my mother "What do you do here?" (he had said that he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230060"></xptr>
               <p>would not allow her there)—she said "I am going to stop to protect my child, as I hear you were going to cut her throat again this morning"—he said "You don't stay here, none of the b—crew of you, "and he turned us all out into the court, my mother and me, and the three children, his daughter and my two sons—I quarrelled with him—I may have said I was not going to leave my home—he struck me slightly in the mouth, in the court outside the door—I said "Let me go in and get my shawl"—I went into the house, and went towards the mantelshelf to get some lucifers to get a light—my back was towards the door, and in an instant he came behind me—he never spoke a word, but he flung his left arm around my head, and with the right tore at my throat; I did not know it was cut till the next morning—I put my hand to my throat and found the blood pouring out—I gave one long scream and rushed to the door, and fell either on the mat, or against some one, insensible—I said to my next neighbour, Fanny Atkins, "Fanny, he has done it"—I did not know my throat was cut; I knew it was torn with something—I knew I was injured, but I did not know it was cut till I was told next morning in the hospital—I came to when I was on the stretcher, and my husband was standing by the side of me outside my door, and I charged him with doing it, and he made no reply—he took up a knife, and would have cut my throat at breakfast-time that morning, but I flew out to a neighbour's, and he dropped the knife behind him, and said "You b—cow, you are not worth being hung for; I will do it quieter than that"—my mother came in a few minutes after, and I told her of it, and that was the reason she made the observation she did at night—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my husband's razor—I have no wish to hurt him, but he has assaulted me so many times I want protection—there is no truth whatever in the suggestion that I did the injury to my throat myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been married to the prisoner three years—I was a widow; his daughter is thirteen years of age—I think she was examined at the Police Court; I was very ill, I forget—my eldest son was examined; only one son saw anything—one is nine and the other thirteen years—it was a few minutes after 9 o'clock when I came in with my mother—my husband has been six years in the employment of Messrs. Lea—Mr. Smart, one of the partners, is here to-day—he was bail for him when I locked him, up before, two years ago, when he cut my head to pieces pretty well with a chair—I never attempted to commit suicide—I swear that; six years ago I was taken to the workhouse by a policeman, who found me wandering fifty yards from the water; it was four days after a bad confinement, and I was very low, and could not tell where I lived—the prisoner had always been very kind to my mother before this, and my father too—this was the first time he complained of my mother's presence—he did not complain that she was addicted to drinking—he has given her drink and me too, and then knocked me about for having it—he has not complained that she induced me to drink, and that he could keep nothing in the house from the pawn shop—I know the Duke of York public-house, at the corner of Felix Street, Somers Town—I did not six weeks ago, in the presence of Charles Harden, there take a penknife from my pocket, cut my linger, and smear the blood over my face and on the door, and say I would have my revenge of my husband, and say that he had done it—it is false—Harden did not say to me "Oh, you wicked woman!"—my husband's friends did not get him out of the window when I went to charge him—about six or seven months ago one</p>

               <p>Saturday night, I went there after my husband for my weekly money; and because he should not give me any, his mates got him out of the taproom window—about a month before this happened, I was not with my husband in the taproom of the Duke of York, when he gave me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he never gave me that sum since we have been married—I did not seize him by the shirt front, and demand 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more from him, and shake him violently; nor did the landlord turn me out; it is entirely false—he has not used that house for the last five months—we were turned out of the Adam and Eve because he was quarrelling and I took his part—that was about six or eight weeks previous to this, the day of Doggett's Coat and Badge; we were quarrelling, and were both turned out—I have mentioned before to-day what occurred At breakfast time—I mentioned it at the Police Court; not the whole of it—I said he had attempted my life before, and he had been charged before at that Court for attempting my life—no one was present at breakfast when he took up the knife—he was sober, I think, or nearly so—it was about 8 o'clock—at 9 o'clock, when my mother said she was going to stop to protect me, there was my husband and the three children present—the quarrelling did not last three minutes; it did not take ten minutes or a quarter of an hour altogether, the turning us out, hitting me in the mouth, my going in, and him doing it—I did not say to Fanny Atkins "Fanny, I have done it"—I said "He has done it"—I did not see the prisoner smoking a pipe:—I have not read over my deposition before coming here, or had it read to me—my husband has sent me to pawn things when he has spent his money—he has complained of my pawning things, not for drink—he has not done so in the presence of the children—I know David Dewling; he is my husband's mate—I never used a penknife to myself in his presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital—the prosecutrix was brought there on the morning of the 27th August—she was pale and weak, and apparently suffering from great loss of blood—I examined her throat, and found four wounds, which had been sewn up—in my opinion only one of those had been dangerous—I could not say one way or the other as to their being self-inflicted—they were in such a position that they might have been self-inflicted, or another person might have inflicted them if it was done from behind—I heard the description which the woman gave of the way in which they were inflicted—they might have been inflicted in that way—she is still under my charge—she is yet weak.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Ashby Street, and am the prosecutrix's mother—on the morning of 26th August she made a complaint to me, and in the evening I went with her to her house—I went into the house—my daughter was there, and the prisoner; not the boys, or the girl—the prisoner said, with an oath, that I had no business there; "Out you go, all the b——crew of you"—I said "I have business here; I have come here to protect my daughter, as I heard this morning that you held a knife before her throat, going to cut her throat"—that was what she told me—I did not stop but a very little while there—I bade my daughter "Good night," and said I should see her in the morning, and I went away—I left my daughter and him in the house—she said "Go home, mother; never mud"—I did not see him do anything to her.</p>

I was waterman at the Duke of York, Phoenix Street, Sowers Town—I know Mrs. Radley well—I remember her taking a pen-knife out of her pocket outside the Duke of York; she deliberately cut her finger, and besmeared her face all over with blood, and the door of the tap-room, and she said "I will have my revenge upon him"—Dewling was present at the time—I said "Oh! you wicked woman"—she tried to <hi rend="italic">force</hi> her way into the taproom, and she was told that Radley had got out of the</p>

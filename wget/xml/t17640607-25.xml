            , On the 11th of May, about 6 in the morning, I was going to my work through <placeName id="t17640607-25-crimeloc140">Black-boy-alley</placeName>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Pentycross. I live in Fetter-lane, and was going to Cow-Cross; the man laid hold on my right arm, and asked me for my money: I said it was very trifling: he said, You have some. I put my hand into my pocket, and took out 9 s. in silver; he took it, and a blue silk handkerchief from my neck; and the woman took five-pence halfpenny out of my left-hand pocket; that was what I had in change out of a six-pence for a dram, as I came along. He took a Portugal piece of copper out, and looked at it, and gave it me again. The prisoner is much like that woman; then the man put me in an alley on the right hand side, and bid me stay there till he came to me. I turned round to make water, and there came a lusty fat woman; she asked me what I did there? I said I had been robbed; then she turned herself away, and I went away to my brother's; and what became of them I do not know; I never saw the man since.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Pentycross. I was speaking of this at two or three houses in Cow-Cross, describing the woman; the people said they knew her, and the watchman told me where she was, at a house in Long-lane, West-Smithfield. I went to that house that day week, and there the prisoner was: there were two or three men: I challenged her about so and so, and she fell a crying.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say she is the woman upon your oath?</p>
               <p>Pentycross. I believe it to be the woman; I will not swear she is.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you charge her with?</p>
               <p>Pentycross. With having a hand in robbing me in Black-boy-alley; and she desired Edwards might be apprehended; and said, he threatened to beat her and use her ill, in case she did not assist in the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you where Edwards lived?</p>
               <p>Pentycross. No, she did not; there was a man brought to me of that name, but I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know her name?</p>
               <p>Pentycross. The watchman told me she went by the name of 
               <persName id="t17640607-25-person236">

            , and before the alderman she said that was her name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Pentycross. No.</p>

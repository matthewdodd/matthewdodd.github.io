               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Is the property yours? A. Part of it - I have to make good one of the watches - I am a widow - the prisoner first lived with me four months before Christmas - that was the first time - her trunks were in the house in August - she went to service after a little but she only came now and then, and slept a night, at first she was out of a situation - after going to service she came again.</p>

               <p>MRS. WILLIAMSON. These things belong to me, and the shawl and scarf - they were all in the same drawer, and missed that night - the things all together are worth about Â£10 - I had not seen the prisoner in the house that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed was your house secure? - A. It was - it was not broken into at all - I distinctly heard the door opened - I had gone out on a message next door, for a minute, about ten o'clock, and left the door unguarded for a moment - I was not out of the house two minutes - I left the door open until I returned; and when I went to bed the house was quite secure - my daughter fastened it.</p>

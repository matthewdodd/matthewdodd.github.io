               <p>JOHN SHANNON. I came from Limerick, in lreland, and work for the Corporation of the Trinity-house. - I have known the prisoner almost ever since he was born. Last Saturday night three weeks I went into the <placeName id="t18310217-209-crimeloc1234">Rose and Crown, at Wapping</placeName>

            , that is making a row, and using my wife so?" he made no answer; he stooped down, as I thought, for a stone, and cut me either with a knife or razor between the calf of my leg and my ancle, at the back of my leg; I might have touched him, but never struck him, nor did I go towards him in a menacing manner, nor had I touched him roughly - I had not touched him before I was cut; we never had any words since we were born - I know of no ill-will on his part towards me; when I found I was cut I went home, and was carried from there to the doctor's - I was afterwards carried to the London-hospital, and have been brought from there this morning; I am still lame - I cannot stand on my leg.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say you went home immediately you were cut? A. I do - I never struck the prisoner at all; he did not call Murder! I saw nobody come to his assistance - I saw him laying down on the ground, about ten minutes after he struck me; I had come out, and gone along the wall to give him in charge - he might have called for assistance before I came up; I was not on the top of him - I was tried at Hick's-hall about nine years ago for a common assault; I saw Maloney in the street - he and Flannigan took me to the doctor's; they did not rescue the prisoner from me - I was not on him, nor beating him; Flannigan was three or four perches off when this occurred.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE SHANNON. I am the prosecutor's wife. He came home on this Saturday night - he was not in liquor; he sent me out for some supper, and when I got down I and a young Irish woman, named Mrs. Angledon, an acquaintance of the prisoner's, had some words within three or four doors of my house; she made an offer to hit me, and when she made that offer she fell - I did not strike at her; the prisoner then came up to me, hit me in the breast, and while I was down that woman's husband came and gave me a kick - I hallooed out Murder! I had not seen that woman for some weeks before; when they heat me and I fell, my cloak went over my face, and I did not see what happened to my husband, nor hear him say any thing - when I got up I went up stairs to my children, who were crying; whether my husband was hurt then I cannot tell - I heard no noise in the street; my boy came up in about five minutes, and said his father had been hurt - when I came down stairs the second time my husband was taken to Dr. Benson's; I went there, and he was taken to the London-hospital the same night by Maloney and John Flannigan, in a truck.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you up stairs before you came down? A. About ten minutes - I did not see the prisoner then, I saw my husband; I had had part of two pints of beer between me, my husband, and another man and his wife, at the Dolphin, about nine o'clock - I was not at the Rose and Crown; my children were in bed, except the infant which I had in my arms - my husband had no row that night, to my knowledge; he came straight from the pay-table - I swear I heard of no row between him and a man named Russel, outside the Rose and Crown; I went to the Dolphin with him about eight o'clock - we staid there an hour or an hour and a half; no spirits were drank - I never struck Mrs. Angledon, nor touched her; I never saw my husband outside the Rose and Crown that night - I know he had been there, for he is paid there.</p>

            . I live at Wapping.

            , that has struck my wife?" and with that the prisoner stooped down and cut Shannon Shannon had been in the street three or four minutes before the prisoner came up; I did not see Mrs. Shannon - Shannon was only going on home; we were walking down the street - we had walked four or five perches; he had told me if he met the prisoner he would give him in charge - I was examined at the office; what I said was read over to me before I signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say there "I found the prisoner and a man named Shannon struggling together, and I went to Shannon's assistance?" A. Yes, they were struggling; when they met he went and took him, and they had a struggle - I had been walking with Shannon for three or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170118"></xptr>four minutes before; they did not meet together for two or three minutes; I saw a clasp-knife in the prisoner's hands when he came up - it was open; he was coming up against Shannon - whether they had been together before I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Shannon struggling with any body when you first saw him? A. Not when I met him, but when Barrett met him they were struggling together for about a minute, holding one another; Shannon had hold of the prisoner somewhere about his breast, and the prisoner held him somewhere about his waistband, but where I cannot say - Shannon thought to lay hold of him to keep him for the Police - the prisoner struggled away and cut him; they struggled about a minute before he cut him - I took the prosecutor home; Maloney took him to the doctor's, and I went back to give charge of Barrett - he ran away after cutting the prosecutor; I ran after him, tried to take him, and he cut me - I upset him; I told the Magistrate Maloney helped to take him home and to the doctor's; I do not know whether that was taken down - I had had no words with the prisoner; I had not been to his father's that night to challenge him to fight a boy named Russell - I know Russell; he had not quarrelled with the prisoner at the Rose and Crown that night in my presence; I had been at his father's that night, but did not say the prisoner should fight Russell for a sovereign, and if Russell did not beat him I would beat him well - I went there with the Police to give him in charge; I did not go before - I never said any thing of the kind; I had been drinking at the Rose and Crown that night - it is our house of call; I was there three of four hours - Barrett was there part of the time; I do not know whether Russell was there, but it is our house of call - he left about half-past nine; I cannot tell whether Shannon went with me - I was sober; he was not in my company, but might be in the room - we work in a different craft; he might leave sooner or later - I was not there when the Police were called in; I never heard of it; I was not at the Dolphin.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say you saw the knife in his hand when first you saw him coming towards Shannon? A. Yes, and it was open; he had a small bit of bread in his hand, as I understand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not what you said to the Magistrate "I wanted to part them both asunder, Shannon called out that his leg was cut, I turned over to the prisoner to lay hold of him, and with that I saw a knife in his hand?" A. Yes; directly he came up I saw it in his hand - I only saw one knife in his hand that night; he came back with the very knife I saw in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say with another knife? A. Yes, the Police have got that; I saw but one knife - I know where the prisoner's father lives, but do not know the name of the court; he was coming from his own home when he met Shannon; I did not see Mrs. Shannon in the street - it was about half-past ten o'clock, as far as I understand.</p>

            . It was nearly twelve o'clock when my husband was cut - I think it was before twelve, because the shops were open; he had been up stairs for above an hour or more before this happened - the shops are shut at near twelve o'clock; my husband went home a little after ten - he sent me out in about an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>JOHN SHANNON. This happened between eleven and twelve o'clock, as near as I can say, but I cannot say exactly, for we have no clock - I cannot say whether it was before twelve.</p>
               <p>JOHN FLANNIGAN. The prisoner was apprehended about twelve or one o'clock - I went to his father's house with the Police; it was about an hour after this happened, as near as I can tell.</p>
               <p>SARAH LOW re-examined. I saw the prisoner sharpen a knife between twelve and one o'clock - I was three quarters of an hour at my window, and it struck one soon after I shut it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Your deposition states that soon after you opened your window the clock struck one? A. That is a mistake - I gave my evidence that it was between twelve and one o'clock; I saw him sharpen a knife on the step of a door; my deposition was not read over to me - I said that between twelve and one o'clock I heard a disturbance, and opened my window; I cannot tell who made the disturbance - the prisoner was one of them; I saw him with his father and mother - two Policemen were trying to take him home; he went home with them to his father's, and came out again five minutes after the Policemen left - he came up the alley, and I saw him sharpen the knife on a step three doors off; it was a moon-light - I was up two pairs of stairs, and cannot say whether he was in liquor - he went up the alley, on the green bank, and I heard a cry of Murder! three times; I believe the green bank is where Shannon was struck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What office did you give your deposition at? A. The Thames Police; the Magistrate was present, but I signed it in a little room - the clerk was there; he did not read it over to me - I was sworn.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you heard the clock strike twelve? A. Yes - I was then folding up some work, and was about five minutes before I went to my bed-room, and in ten or fifteen minutes after I went up, I heard the noise, and opened the window; I was making my bed.</p>

Our watch-house is on the green bank - Shannon was brought there between twelve and one o'clock, (nearer one,) by Flannigan, his wife, and two or three more; he was wounded then - I had seen the prisoner about twelve, and endeavoured with his father and mother to prevail on him to go home; Robson, another Policeman, was with me - I took him part of the way down the court, and sent the other Policeman home with him; whether he went out afterwards I do not know - he was not drunk, but rather the worse for liquor; Robson had taken a clasp-knife from him; when Shannon was brought in he was cut just below the calf of the left leg; Shannon's house looks on to the green bank - I went and took the prisoner in charge about one o'clock, or near one, and took a table-knife out of his hand - I did not perceive any marks of blood on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you take him? A. On the first floor of his father's house - he had some bread<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170119"></xptr>in one hand, and the knife in the other; the knife might be in his hand for the purpose of eating his supper.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. About a quarter-past twelve o'clock in the morning of the 30th of January, I saw the prisoner, and persuaded him to go home - his mother was there, and his father might be there, but I did not see him; he had no knife in his hand then - he was a little in liquor, but not drunk; I saw him home, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards I saw him going along about half double, into a green-grocer's shop; I could not conceive what made him go in that way - I had no reason to suppose any mischief had been done to Shannon before I saw him home the first time; when I saw him going into the green-grocer's, the landlord shoved him out of the shop - as he came up he held the knife up to me, and said, "This is the knife," holding it out to me - it was a pocket-knife; I took it out of his hand - I did not see any blood on it; I put it into my pocket, and said, "Come away home;" he used a vulgar expression, and said, "The b - r was going to murder me, but I have murdered him;" I took him about half-way home again, and in about ten minutes three of my brother officers came up with Flannigan- I took them to the prisoner's house, and took him; I cannot tell at what time Shannon received his injury - the prisoner was apprehended about five minutes past one o'clock.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I should think that it must be a quarter or twenty minutes before one o'clock when Shannon met with this accident - I sent a party of men to disperse a party who were kicking up a row, soon after twelve; I was not present when Shannon was wounded - I saw Barrett come out of Anchor and Hope-alley, swearing murder, but what he meant I do not know; Shannon was brought to the station rather before one - I sent him to the doctor's instantly; I cannot say how long before he had been wounded; I had seen the prisoner twenty minutes or half an hour before that; about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before Shannon was brought in, I saw the prisoner coming out of the passage where he lives, with a knife in his hand - he appeared in a passion, and used the word Murder! with an oath.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the row you saw at the Rose and Crown? A. Very near to it; there were ten or fifteen persons there the first time I saw them - that was twenty minutes or half an hour before Shannon was brought in.</p>

             re-examined. As soon as Shannon met with the injury, he was taken home, and in about ten minutes I took him to the station - he was not taken to the doctor's first.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My father sent me out for half a gallon of beer for supper; a gentleman gave me a shilling to get it - I had a piece of bread and meat in my hand; I met Shannon, Flannigan, and a man named Wilkes at the top of the alley - they said, "Here comes the b - r," and ran after me; I ran along - I came back, and caught hold of a post; they caught hold of me; I got away - they caught me, put me against a door, and threw me down; Flannigan jumped on me, also Shannon and Wilkes - I called Murder! they tried to choke me; I still called Murder! Cotter came - my belly was burst I thought; Maloney came, and after Cotter opened his door, I crept into his house on my hands and face - I got just by the door; Flannigan and Shannon pulled me out by the legs, with my face and hands on the ground, into the middle of the road.</p>

            . I keep a green-grocer's shop. On the night in question I heard a row in the street; I heard the prisoner call out to me for protection before I saw him - I went as far as the door, and saw him; Flannigan came up, caught hold of him by the throat, and threw him down right facing my door; he made an attempt to get up, and Flannigan kicked him on the hip - I went and caught hold of Flannigan; another man came up named Quirk (I think) and made an attempt to kick him, but whether he hit or missed I do not know, and the third man who came up was Shannon; he laid over him, and I having hold of Flannigan, my hat fell off; a man named Maloney, who had been in my shop, came over to me, and lifted Shannon off the prisoner - what the prisoner might have done to Shannon I cannot tell - I said, "Barrett, come into my house;" he said, "My belly is broken, I cannot go" - this was between twelve and one o'clock.</p>

            . On the night this happened I was just outside Cutter's door - Barrett ran up the footpath along the street as hard as he could, and asked Cotter to let him search his place; a man named Flannigan came up, and caught him by the collar; he jostled him down, made a hit at him when he was down, and I believe a kick too - Quirk came up, and made a kick at him while he was down; Shannon came up in a little time; I saved the prisoner as well as I could - I turned back on Shannon, and stopped him from meddling with him; I afterwards found Shannon had received a hurt on his leg - there was no appearance of his being wounded when I first saw him - I assisted in taking him to the doctor's about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you help to take Shannon home? A. I took him on my back from the watch-house to the doctor's - I have no reason to suppose he was hurt till after he followed the prisoner to Cotter's; he was about three perches behind the others - I did not notice that he was lame.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have noticed if he was lame at that time? A. I dare say I might - he could hardly walk when at the watch-house.</p>

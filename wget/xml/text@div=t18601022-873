                  </hi>. I live in the Old-road, Enfield, with my mother—it is my house—on Sunday night, 30th October, I went to bed about 10 o'clock—I looked round and everything was fast—I sleep on the ground floor and my mother up stairs—in the middle of the night I was awoke about 3 o'clock—I heard a noise at the foot of my bed; some one trampling about—I said, "Mother, is that you?"—no one answered me, and I thought it was the cat—I laid a little longer—I afterwards got up, and found the middle door and the back door open—I missed several articles—my work-box was lying close to the door, and there was a place open where the tiles had been taken off—the tiles come low down—the place would admit a youth through—I went up stairs, and missed two coats, two pairs of trousers, two waist<lb></lb>coats, and other things out of a box—a handkerchief, a shirt, and a pair of braces were gone—part of them were mine and part were Mr. Patten's—I saw them safe on Sunday morning, about 9 o'clock; the box was then closed but not locked—part of these are my son's—this is his shirt, trousers, and other things; they are all mine except this waistcoat and shirt—this is my work-box; it was left in the garden—it had been opened—there was nothing of value in it.</p>

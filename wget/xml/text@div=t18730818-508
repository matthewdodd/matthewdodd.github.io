                  </hi>. I live at 57, Northampton Street, Clerkenwell—on Sunday, 27th July, about 1. 45, I and the deceased and Gregory took a pair<lb></lb>oared boat from May's Yard, Hammersmith, and went down the river towards Putney—it was a pair-oared outrigged gig—I have been in those boats before; it is a very narrow boat, with iron rullocks extending from each side, for two to row and one to steer; there is room for a coxswain, and each of the two men has an oar—we went down the river about 100 yards past the soap works; I was steering—the soap works is not quite half a mile from the bridge; the tide was running down—Vint was rowing stroke, and Gregory bow; we were on the Surrey shore, about 20 yards from the bank—when we had got about 100 yards below the soap works, we were met by a steamer—we passed that steamer, and turned our head to the swell of the steamer—I told the rowers to lay their oars on the water, which they did, and they remained still—we had just commenced to paddle again, when we were met by another steamer; that was between 80 and 100 yards from the first—we <hi rend="italic">done</hi> the same as we <hi rend="italic">done</hi> when the first steamer passed us, but the swell was so great that it seemed impossible for the boat to live in it—I have not the least idea of the speed at which either of the steamers were going; the last boat seemed to be going faster than the first—I said to Gregory, "Look out, we shall have to swim for it" and he jumped overboard, and Vint jumped after him almost directly—the water came over on each side into the boat, and seemed to swallow the boat—it was the only boat just at that particular spot; there was one nearer shore, and when I was swamped I turned round and saw them with their boat in their hands; they had been swamped and had got ashore—our boat filled, but I stopped in it; it would not sink with my weight—it was 3 feet below the surface of the river—I was kneeling in the boat, she was out of sight in the part where I was kneeling; the bow end—we looked round for Vint, but could not see him—we were picked up by a skiff—I have been in the habit of going on the river for four or five years—I belonged to a club four years—the steamboat did not slacken speed when it was passing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't know what distance the first steamer was that passed us; it had passed 50 or 100 yards, I should think, before the other came up; not more than 100 yards—we ceased rowing and laid on before the accident—we turned our head towards the Crab Tree; not direct across the river, but in a slanting direction; that would take the swell at right angles, in the direction of the surf—I did not hear a man call out "Don't, if you can't swim," when Gregory said "Jump overboard"—I do not know Morrell—I did not see a man in a boat close by us—there were a good many boats on the river—we might have been more than 12 or 13 yards from the shore, going down with the tide—our boat filled with water, with my weight the stern went down 3 feet; the bows were out of the water—I was picked up—I did not see Gregory picked up—I did not hear Morrell say to Gregory "The accident was entirely owing to your own fault"—I saw a four-oared boat across the water—I did not see a pair-oar coming up the river—I did not know that this was a Kew steamer; I did not know what steamer it was.</p>

The swell was unusual, it seemed very great—I don't know that I ever noticed any greater—there was very little water in the river and one steamer coming up behind the other; I account for it so—they both came in the same direction towards our boat—we put her head to the first swell and rode over it, then the second steamer came along and we did the same, but the boat could not live in it; it doubled right on to the boat and broke right over it—I should say our boat was 5 or 6 inches out of the water—I could not tell for certain—there are safer and larger boats than that on the river; ours was a very narrow-boat, they go very fast.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sign writer, and live at 17, Graham Street, City Road—I was with Bull and Vint in this boat on Sunday, 27th July—I did not notice the first steamer that passed us a great deal, I had my back to her, rowing; I did as our coxswain ordered, laid on—when the second steamer came by I did the same, but the swell from the second steamer swamped us—I have been accustomed to the river these six years—I belong to two rowing clubs, the river was very shallow, almost down tide—I could not judge of the speed at which the steamer was going that swamped us, I did not see the least alteration in its speed—when I found the water come to my waist, I thought we had better swim; a boat like that would go from under us if it sank, and we should have had to swim—I had to kneel in the water, it was up to my waist, and I got into the water and swam—I believe the deceased did the same as I did, but I was the first to go, and of course I could not see—I daresay the gunwale of our boat was 8 inches out of the water—I have been in the same boat before, at least there are three of the same build, and I have been in one of the three, I can't say it was the same boat—the swell from the second steamer was such as I have never seen before—I saw one other boat swamped oh the same shore as us, and the skiff that picked me up had to go ashore to bale her out before we could start rowing—the boat that was swamped at the same time as us was a pair oar, something of the same description, but I don't think quite so light—I can't say how near it was to us when it was swamped, I only saw it empty and the water being baled out—the skiff that picked me up was a safer boat than ours—I daresay it would hold five persons, an ordinary pleasure skiff. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. I account for there being more swell than usual by the water being very shallow, and the two steamers were closer together than usual—I had been out in shallow water before, but the two steamers being so close together, the one swell counteracted the other and so caused the rough water.</p>

I am a warehouseman, and live in Marshall Street, Golden Square—on Sunday morning, 27th July, I was on the river between Putney and Hammersmith, rowing up in a small boat, an out-rigged gig, a sculling boat for holding one person—shortly before I reached the Crab Tree, I observed two steamers coming up, following me; I was close in the Surrey shore, rowing up, keeping out of the tide; the two steamers passed me at rather a rapid pace, and when they had passed, the water was very rough indeed, rougher than I had ever seen it before—I had much difficulty in preventing myself being swamped, I hardly know how I did, I pulled across the tide somehow—I took a quantity of water into my boat, but not sufficient to sink me—I have been accustomed to go on the river for these eight years—I did not notice whether the second steamer was much more crowded than the first—I pulled close into the Middlesex shore opposite the</p>

               <p>Crab Tree—I then looked towards the part from which I had just come, and I saw the deceased and his two companions in a small two-pair outrigged gig, in this very rough water, and saw the water pouring in over the side—I heard Gregory say in rather a loud tone of voice, "We shall have to swim for it"—I shouted out to them, "Can you all swim, "I received no answer, and I judged that they could, but I palled towards them as fast as I could, on account of the rough state of the water—it may have been a minute before I reached them, Gregory had then reached the shore—Bell remained in the boat, which was under the water, and the deceased was drowned—I could not attempt to save him, because I could not see him; I only saw his hat floating on the water, I noticed that the steamers were going fast, too fast for the crowded state of the river; I don't know that I can give you an idea of the pace, it may have been about six or seven miles an hour, I don't think it was faster; it was not full speed, because the water was dead low, and they cannot go at full speed at dead low water—I have no doubt it must have been what they call half speed, the space between the two steamboats was over 50 yards and less than 100, I should say—I saw two or three boats on the Surrey side emptying the water out caused by the two steamers—I saw two skiffs emptying water—I could not judge how many passengers there were on board the steamer.</p>

I am a blacksmith, of 18, Chancery Street, Ham<lb></lb>mersmith—on this Sunday I was in a pair-oared gig, between Putney Bridge and Hammersmith—I am not used to the river—the deceased's boat was following me—I saw the two steamboats, there was about twelve of their own lengths between them—as I passed the second steamer she eased, and a small boat on the opposite side had some boys in it, bathing—the deceased's boat followed me down—I saw the swell come over her, and both men jumped up in the boat, and Mr. Vint said "The best thing we can do is to jump overboard"—I said "Don't jump overboard if you can't swim"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180111"></xptr>
               <p>—they jumped overboard, and the deceased never rose again—I picked Gregory out of the water, and rowed him ashore; the man who was steering was still in the boat.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came the water in the boat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say, but it was full of water, and the coxswain was sitting in it—they continued rowing when <hi rend="italic">Citizen E</hi> came up, but I lay on my oars—I did not take any notice of the steamers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had another man and my little boy in my boat—the boat was not swamped by a wave from the steamer at first—I was thirty or forty yards off—the gig which was swamped was five or six inches out of the water, she was heavily loaded—her head was not towards the wave, but pointed across, and the water washed over the side, they then jumped up, frightened, which rocked the boat—I did not see the other boat swamped, or see a number of people baling their boats out after the steamer had passed.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been twenty-one years in the employ of the Citizen Steamboat Company—on 27th July I was engineer of <hi rend="italic">Citizen E</hi>, and the prisoner was captain—the journey from Chelsea to Kew was begun about 11 o'clock—the speed never exceeds half-speed during the whole journey—going easy is about 111<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2 revolutions of the paddles a minute—the paddles are 8 feet diameter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Half-speed is about 23 revolutions, and whole speed 46; easy is going as slow as you possibly can without stopping the engine—I never heard of anybody being drowned, or of boats being swamped by us before.</p>

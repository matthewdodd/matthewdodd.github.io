                  </hi>. I keep the Bald—faced Stag, at Finchley. On the 21st of May, I missed a copper boiler from a shed in the yard at the back of my house—I had seen it safe in the course of that morning—the prisoner Powell was in my employ at the time as a labourer, and had been so for about two months—I suspected him and taxed him with having stolen it—he denied it for some time—I did not say it would be better or worse for him to confess—a man was there who had been at work in the same shed, and he said to Powell, "I will not stand by and allow innocent people to be charged with what they have not done; it is no use, Powell, for you to deny stealing it, you did steal it, and sold it half an hour ago, for half a crown"—Powell then said, "Well, I have stolen it, Sir, and I sold it for half a crown"—I sent for the patrol and gave him into custody—he then described the man to whom he had sold it—I took one of the patrols <hi rend="italic">with</hi> me, and went to the <hi rend="italic">prisoner Burton's house</hi> at Holloway—I saw Win there, and asked if he had been to Finchley—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he had been to my house—he said no, he had not—he persisted in saying so for some time, but at last acknowledged that he had been, and said he had bought the copper boiler of a man who had a cast in his eye, for half a crown—I then gave him into custody, and found the copper boiler in his back parlour—it was then damaged and defaced—there were two large holes cut in the side, and the brass cock was broken off it—it was not in that state when I missed it, but I am sure it was mine—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I am not aware whether the prisoners knew each other—Burton's house is two or three miles from mine.</p>

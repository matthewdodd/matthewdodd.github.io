               <p>WILLIAM SCUDDER. I am a bricklayer employed under the London Dock company, I was employed with the prisoner in repairing a house belonging to them in <placeName id="t18111204-18-crimeloc98">Old Gravel Lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you on the day laid in the indictment see the prisoner. - A. Yes, about half after six in the evening, it was dark, then he was in Old Gravel Lane with a piece of timber I have now here in his arms, I knew the piece of timber by seeing him take it up from the house that we were repairing for the London Dock company, it laid outside of the house in the street. After he had taken the timber he walked away in the middle of the road, I walked after him, and when he came to the top of Charles Court I asked him what he intended to do with the piece of wood, he said he had seen it lay about the building, it was useless, he said he was going to sell it for beer, I told him to carry it back, it was useful, he did, and laid it down at the place where he had taken it from, and then he was apprehended. The man was in liquor, he did not seem to know what he was doing of.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I went, and there found the goods mentioned in the indictment: the bolts and two parcels of scutcheons have my mark upon them; I have no doubt but they are our property: we did not miss them: we trade in the wholesale and retail way.

            . I am an ironmonger in the Strand; the prisoner brought some scutcheons to my shop, about three weeks ago, and asked me if I would buy them: I asked him if he made them: he said, Yes: I asked him where he lived; he did not seem willing to tell me: he took them up, and said, You don't seem willing to buy, and went out; I went out, and said, Stay, let me talk a little with you: I got him into the shop,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100003"></xptr> and shut the door; then he said he had them of a man in the Strand to sell for him: I asked him where that man was to be found; he said, in Westminster: I sent there, but no such man was to be found. I took him before Justice Keniston; there he was searched, and the rest of the goods were found upon him. He said he had the bolts of his brother in the country, that made them. I sent the mark upon the bolts to several ironmongers, but found no owner. The prisoner told me he worked with Mr. Hill in Pannier Alley; I sent to him, who said he traded with Mr. Martin in Foster-lane, and he thought they might belong to him: the next morning he brought Mr. Martin, who owned them.</p>

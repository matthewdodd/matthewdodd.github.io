I had a good character with her from Mrs. Barton, whom she had lived with. When the prisoner had been with me about ten or eleven days, I missed some of my property, a piece of lace. Some days afterwards, in the night, I heard a noise. I rang the bell; she came and said, she heard somebody over head, getting in at the trap-door. We had the watchman in. She had been up the ladder, and in coming down she fell; she seemed very much hurt. I sent for a surgeon; he attended her four days, and she kept her bed; and after a few days, she got up early in the morning, ran away, and left the door of the house open. In about a fortnight after, she sent me a letter; desiring her wages, and her box. I should have paid her her wages, if she had come herself. In about three weeks, I learned she lived with Mrs. Barton. I went to Mrs. Barton's, and a servant that lives with me now. The prisoner opened the door to me; she appeared to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160078"></xptr> agitated, and Mrs. Barton hearing me, called me up stairs. I went up stairs to Mrs. Barton. I observed a cap and handkerchief of mine on the prisoner. I charged her with taking them; she replied, she wondered at my taking the liberty of coming after her. I told Mrs. Barton, in the presence of the prisoner, that I suspected her of taking my things. Mrs. Barton said, she had seen several things about the girl, that she suspected did not belong to her. Mrs. Barton went into an adjoining room, and brought out some caps and handkerchiefs that had been made out of my dress. I knew the muslin. I went into the room where Mrs. Barton went, and out of a drawer, I took out a shirt; it was one that I had given to my sister. I asked the prisoner, whether she would give me up the other things, before I sent for an officer. She denied that she knew any thing about it. An officer was sent for; he made a search in my presence. The prisoner wished to go up stairs; he followed her. I did not go up stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of information, you went to a house at Paddington - A. I did. I there found a dress, which I missed, cut up into caps and handkerchiefs. I am certain they were mine.</p>

I told her, I must see what it was; it turned out to be ten duplicates, a two pound note, a one pound note, and four-three shilling pieces. I took the duplicates from her, and the money, and two keys, from her pocket. She said, one of the keys belonged to a box she had in Homer-street, Paddington. I took her to Bow-street office the next day. I went to the different pawnbrokers along with Mrs. Richardson, and then to Paddington; there I found the box locked.

                  </hi> I am a silversmith and pawnbroker, in southampton-street, in the parish of Camberwell—it is my dwelling-house—I have two houses, which are adjoining—there is an internal communication from one to the other—I re<lb></lb>side in one with my family—the other is my shop, and some of my servants sleep there. On Monday, 13th March, a little after twelve o'clock, I was in my private house—in consequence of what had taken place in the neighbourhood, I had fastened up the doors and shutters of my shop and private house—the shutters were fastened with iron bars—at about twenty minutes after twelve I heard a noise of a mob coming down the street—I left the shop all secured and bolted, and I went to the window of the dwelling-house—I was standing there with my wife, and the first thing I heard was the breaking of the fan<lb></lb>light over the shop door—as they went past, I heard several say, "Let us make a smash, we will go in here"—I could not identify one of the mob, I was so excited—the mob left the street, to go up Abbot-street, and I went out at the back of my house, to go to the Peckham police-station—I heard something as I was going along—I did not return till the mob had left—I was absent perhaps an hour—when I came back I found the shutters and iron bars of the door broken—they could not force the lock and bolts, but the centre of the door was cut out—several pannels of the shop shutters had been cut out, and the iron hooping had been cut through—the window was all smashed—I went into the shop, and found the inside frames of the window completely chopped to pieces—the window was in a very disordered state, scarcely anything left in it—there had been a good deal of property in the window, as usual, when I shut up the shutters—I missed nearly the whole of the property from the window—it consisted of pencil-cases, thimbles, wedding<lb></lb>rings, I should think twenty-three or twenty-five watches, jewellery of all description, brooches, and mathematical instruments—rhe drawers under the counter were full of jewellery, plate, rings, and watches, and other things— —those drawers were not entirely cleared, but mostly so—the top drawer had been full where the watches were kept—from 150 to 200 watches had been taken out of the drawer, besides what were taken from the window—the whole of the cash had been taken from the till, amounting to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> and a quantity of clothes were also gone—I should think the amount of my loss was about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> I live at Camberwell. I was in Southampton-street on Monday, 13th March—I saw the mob come to Mr. Grey's—I saw George Payne attack the door with a railing, and he cried, "Hurrah for Liberty!"—when he cried that, the rest of the mob came up—I struggled out of the crowd—they began to break the door with hammers, and large rails, and other things—when the door had been broken in, I did not ate any persons gong into the shop, but I saw them coming out—I saw Snead come out—he was getting over the pieces of the door that were left at the bottom part, and holding by the blind that was hanging by she side of the door—while the per<lb></lb>sons were going in and coming out, I saw watches thrown into the street over the heads of the people, as if they were thrown amongst the mob—there was no one else I could identify besides Payne and Snead—Snead had a small paper parcel in his hand, I cannot say what it contained—I should not have noticed him, but he was so much higher than the others.</p>

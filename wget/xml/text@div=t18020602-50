             sworn. - I am a watchmaker in the Strand (produces a watch); I bought this watch of the prisoner, at Mr. Ashman's, on the 1st of May, for two guineas and a half, and the interest; I hung it in the window about a fortnight; it had the names of Desboies and Wheeler; I thought it was a watch deserving of my name; and, having other business with Mr. Upjohn, I left it with him, to have the name changed; the same number continued upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever done any thing in this line of altering names before? - A. No; but it is not unusual in the trade.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifton. Q. The prisoner was introduced to you by a Capt. Innes, of the 42d? - A. Yes; he said it belonged to a Lieutenant Smith, of the Leicestershire Militia.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was at your house several times after this transaction? - A. Yes; I told Capt. Innes the watch was improperly come by.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner plenty of opportunity to have got away, after he was made acquainted with it? - A. Yes.(The watch was identified by Mr. Wheeler.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. One evening, between eight and nine o'clock, I met Lieutenant Smith in the Strand, whom I formerly knew in the Leicestershire Militia; I was quartered with him at Tinmouth; I had this watch from him; after I had parted with it to Mr. Campbell, I heard it had been stolen, and surrendered myself.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

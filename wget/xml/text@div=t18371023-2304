                  </hi>. I am a haberdasher, and live in Church-line, Whitechapel. I saw the prisoner at my shop on the 7th of September, with another man—he asked for a pair of stockings—I asked what sort he hesitated—I showed him some, and he bought a pair that came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—he then offered a good sovereign, and while I was giving him the change, he asked for a half-sovereign—I gave him a half-sovereign, and took any 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I put the money down to him—he counted it—he then put the money before me, and said he thought the price of the stockings was a shilling—I told him I had some at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pair, and turned to get them—while that was doing, he said, "You need not trouble yourself, I won't have any but those I have seen"—(while my back was turned, he had tie means of touching the money)—upon that, I turned to the counter again the money was there—I took it up after he pushed it to me—when I gave him back his sovereign, he quitted the shop—I noticed the half-sovereign before I gave it him—it was one of George the Third's reign, I am quit confident, because I had only taken it two hours before—after he left the shop, I took up the coin he had left, and went to put it with some sovereigns and then discovered it was bad, and not the same I had given him—I kept it in my possession till I gave it to the policeman, William Argent—I saw the prisoner on that night week at the Spitalfields' station—I am quit sure he is the same man—there was another man with him when he came, who had spectacles on, and I think he squinted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprenticed to James Sequeira a chemist in whitechapel. On the night of the 7th of September, about ten o'clock, the prisoner came with another man, for something to rub his thumb with it appeared to be sprained—I gave him a liniment, which came to 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a sovereign—I gave him the change all in silver—he asked me for a half-sovereign—I did not give it him, as I had none—he seemed to recollect himself, and said he had a half-sovereign, and threw one down on the counter, and took up the sovereign—I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and went over the road for change for a shilling, as I had no halfpence—I kept the half sovereign in my pocket—I gave him the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—as soon as he was gone put the half-sovereign into the scale, and found it bad—I gave it to Mr. Se<lb></lb>queira an hour afterwards.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 126.) On the 8th of September I received information from Mr. Hartshorn and Mr. Goddard—on the 14th I was with Barker in Shoreditch, and saw the prisoner and three more—we followed them down to Church-street—they stopped, and looked at a shoemaker's shop, where there were twelve or fourteen men—I thought the prisoner was the man that I wanted—Barker took him, and I took soother of them—I received this half-sovereign from Hartshorn, and this from Sequeira—I have kept them separate.</p>

                  </hi>, I am inspector of coin to Her Majesty's Mint, and have been so nearly twenty years. This coin which was given to Hartshorn is a pit sixpence, of George the Fourth's reign—the obverse side is the same mall respects as a half-sovereign—the reverse side has been altered—the garter has been burnished out, and therefore, to a common observer, it has all the appearance of a half-sovereign—the other one is in all respects the same, only of a different date.</p>

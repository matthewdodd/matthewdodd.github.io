On the morning of the 20th of August he came to my room with the prisoner Cole and a man named Norman—they called me out of my room—I went down, and they asked me up into Doughty's room to have a glass of ale—I went and had about two glasses—while I was drinking, Doughty left the room for about ten minutes, leaving Cole and Norman in the room with me, and I believe Doughty's wife—Doughty came back, and I returned to my room about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after he came back—I was not absent more than half an hour altogether—I had left nobody in my room—I left the door on the latch—it is on the first floor—when I got back, as soon as I opened the door, I missed my silver watch with a German silver guard-chain, and a common key—I had left it hanging on a nail where I generally do—Doughty bad been in my room several times, and had been there the morning before—the watch then hung on the same nail—any body in the room could see it—Cole lives in King-street, about thirty or forty doors from me—he was never in my room—Doughty did not come into my room when he called me—he was down below—I saw the watch again on the 16th of September, and the chain, in the possesion of a person named Statham, in the Waterloo-road—the maker's name is Williams, No. 3937.</p>

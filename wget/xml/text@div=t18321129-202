            . The prisoner was in my husband's employ; I placed a brooch in my back room, where the prisoner slept, and a gold pin, on the 18th of October - I missed them the next morning; I found the pin in the prisoner's bed; the brooch I could not find - the prisoner said he had not seen it; it belonged to Richard Clay - it had been repaired by a jeweller, and sent to me.</p>

             (Police-serjeant K 25). I saw the prisoner on the night of the 25th of October - I watched him to a house in Turner-street, Ratcliff-highway; I went and searched him - I found on him the duplicate of the brooch; I asked where he got it - he said he found it a week before, but in going to the station he said he found it in some saw-dust at his master's; when he got to the station he told the inspector he found it in the cellar - he said he did not return because his master made so much bother.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They take in several lodgers, and I used to get duplicates from the sailors, by giving them gin for them; Mrs. Leatherdale said she did not know whether she left it on the table or on my bed - they might have fallen on the floor; I found it in some saw-dust.</p>

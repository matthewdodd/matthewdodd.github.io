                  </hi>. I am a member of the bar, and reside in Alfred-place, Thurlow-square—on Monday, 5th August, I was at the Pimlico terminus for the purpose of proceeding on the Croydon line, between 9 and 10 in the morning—I had with me a portmanteau <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were no porters there, and I took it in my hand—I arrived there before the pigeou-hole, at which the tickets are taken, was opened, and I placed my portmanteau on the bench, and walked up and down until the place was opened—whilst I was walking up and down I observed that an elderly person came and sat down on the bench, leaning with his back against my portmanteau, and I observed that once or twice, as I walked up and down, he appeared to be watching me, and he moved as if to see whether I was coming to take the portmanteau, evidently endeavouring to ascertain whether I was the owner of it—when the pigeon-hole was opened 1 wept and got my ticket, and then turned towards the door to see if any friends of mine were going by the train—on turning back I went to the bench and found that my portmanteau was gone—I then went on to the platform and communicated with some porter or policeman—I told him what had oc<lb></lb>curred, and a search was made about the station, and in a short time the witness, Mrs. Healy, came up to me and made a statement—my portmanteau contained a dress coat and other things—I was going to the Croydon Assizes—it was not looked—my initials were on it—I see them now—they have been painted out but have made their appearance since—it cost me 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to renew the things I lost—these collars have my name on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Rutland-terrace, Pimlico—on Monday morning, 5th August, I was at the Victoria station—I saw a portmanteau there, and I saw an old gentleman—I was sitting on the corner of the bench, opposite where they take the tickets for the Crystal Palace, and the old gentleman was on my left-hand aide, on the same Beat—it was outside the waiting-room—I saw him take up the portmanteau and walk out as if he was going to the train—it was a portmanteau very like this—it was about a quarter to 11 o'clock, I think, as nearly as I can recollect—the prisoner was the old gentleman I saw take the portmanteau—I am sure of him—I made a communication to the porter when the owner of the portmanteau came up and made inquiries, and described what I had seen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter at the South Eastern Railway, London-bridge—I remember a gentleman coming to that station with a black leather bag about the middle of August—I did not remember the day when I was at the police-court, but it was on the 12th August—I put it down in a book at home—the gentleman gave me a carpet bag to look after while he went round the corner, and when he returned the bag was gone, and this one was put in its place—I tried to find an owner for it—I went to every carriage in the train, first, second, and third class, and looked underneath the seats, but could not see any bag corresponding with the one that was lost—I took this bag to the station-master, and then to the lost property office—I could not say that I saw the prisoner at the station that day—I have seen him there two or three times, but I cannot be sure when it was.</p>

I was at the Shakespeare Hotel that day at ten minutes past 10 o'clock.

He did so, and I came back and paid him; as he has left I have it not in my power to prove this, or I could have proved that by no possibility could I have been at the station at the time stated. I stayed at the hotel from ten minutes past 10 until about ten minutes pact 11, and never went from there. I was extremely lame at the time, and when I came out he assisted me out of the cab into the hotel He could also depose to my general infirmity since April.</p>

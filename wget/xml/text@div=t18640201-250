                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—the prosecutrix was brought there on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> January with an incised wound from the back of the left wrist, to the middle of the front of the wrist, about half-way round the arm—it divided the whole of the tissues down to the bone, including one of the arteries of the fore-arm, from which she lost a large quantity of blood—it was a severe wound—she was in the hospital about a week, and was made an out-patient at her own request, or she would have been kept longer—she is still an out-patient—this knife would be likely to cause the wound—it would be impossible to produce it by striking the knife against the hand—it must have been a cut.</p>

               <p>that, from its depth, and from its going half-way round the arm, it must have been done with a sweep of the knife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When I met this young woman, I was homeward bound. I was paid off that day. I got into a cab, and told the man to drive to my address. I was not in a fit state to say whether she got inside or outside, but when I got out, I went into her house. I went to cut a bit of tobacco to put in my pipe, when the cabman asked me who would pay him. I said, if he drove me where I told him, I would pay him. The prosecutrix and the servant collared me, and knocked me down; they felt my money in my inside pocket and could not get it, so they cut the pocket clean through (<hi rend="italic">Showing it to the Jury</hi>). The cabman <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "Have you got the sugar?" and then went off. She cut her hand in trying to take the knife from me. I told her I was willing to take her to a doctor, and did so, but he would have nothing to do with it; and when I got outside, she gave me in charge. I lost 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. The cabman went away without being paid, when he got my "sugar." I have been in the Crimea, and fought for my country. I had been paid off the same day from the <hi rend="italic">Clyde</hi>, belonging to Messrs. Smith. I was a seaman and sail maker on board.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know that of your own knowledge? - A. I heard so; there was a very large dog that we left in the house; he was out of the house then; not seeing the dog, I immediately pulled the door to, and desired her to fetch the watchman; when the watchman came, I begged his lantern, and I found my bed-room had been entered by some person, and a pair of kerseymere breeches, a pair of pantaloons, a metal watch, and a toilenet waistcoat, had been taking from a large trunk in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the trunk locked? - A. No; I heard nothing of the things till about ten days; I was passing Golden-lane, and saw the kerseymere breeches in the shop of a salesman, his name is Parr; I gave him a deposit, and desired him to put them by; I went to a Magistrate, and traced them to the prisoner; on the same day she was apprehended; she denied having any knowledge of it; she said she never had them.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure this happened on the 15th day of April, on a Sunday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any violence used in order to get into your room? - A. The bed-room door was never fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any violence used to the house? - A. Yes, the door must have been opened by a pick-lock key.</p>
               <p>Q. That was more likely to be used by a man than by a woman? - A. I should think so myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any of these articles till about ten days after? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner's house? - A. In Wentworth-street, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know she is a married woman? - A. I think she said she was before the Magistrate, and that she lived with her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a person of the name of Abrahams, a witness, a Jew? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taken up for this? - A. He was, on the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was through the intelligence of this Jew you apprehended the prisoner - he was taken up first? - A. No, Parr first, then Abrahams, and then the prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: I produce a pair of breeches; there was nothing else found charged to Parr.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the officer that apprehended the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she live? - A. In Wentworth-street, Spitalfields; I apprehended Abrahams first.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a Jew? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a married woman? - A. I have heard so; I understood that she lived with her husband, it is a private house; there appeared to be some lodgers in the house; there were four women and a man in the room; when I took her, I asked her whether that was her husband, and she said, no.</p>
               <p>LAZARUS ABRAHAMS sworn. - Q. Look at these breeches, (the breeches handed to him,) did you at any time receive these breeches from any body? - A. Yes, from Mrs. Patrick, the prisoner at the bar; I have dealt with her about three months; I received them of her on a Monday, I cannot recollect the day of the month; I bought them of her in her house; she sent an old man to my house; I have bought things of her before I bought those of her; I gave her nine shillings for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that what they are worth? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell - you shall tell? - A. They are worth ten shillings, or half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. You will swear that? - A. Yes, it is all a fancy; they are second hand, and the linings are dirty; they have been wore once.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear they are worth no more than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160008"></xptr>half a guinea? - A. I cannot swear it, it is all a fancy.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the stuff cost? - A. No; I bought them of her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Perhaps, on recollection, you may remember that this woman is a married woman? - A. I did not enquire for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that she lived with her husband? - A. I heard it up the court, I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you got these breeches in your possession? - A. I bought them on Monday, and on Thursday I sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you bought them, did you ask whose breeches they were? - A. I never enquired that.</p>
               <p>Court. You would be much more like an honest man if you did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you say any thing about these breeches till you were taken up - did you go to any Magistrate, or to any Police-officer, to give any information - you gave no information till you were taken up yourself? - A. I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Vickery.) Q. Was there not something the matter with the woman when she was examined? - A. There was a scalded leg.</p>
               <p>- LEVI sworn. - Q. What do you know of this matter: On Monday morning, the 16th of April, I was coming through Wentworth-street, and saw Lazarus Abrahams come out of Mrs. Patrick's house; I cannot prove any more than what he told you.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot hear that; I cannot believe him; a man that buys a new pair of breeches for nine shillings; I have a great scruple about believing him.</p>

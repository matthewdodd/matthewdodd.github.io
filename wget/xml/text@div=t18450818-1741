                  </hi>. I live in Bloomsbury-street, and am a seaman. On the night of the 19th of Aug., I met Fleming about twelve o'clock—I went to a house with her in Princes-court, near Covent-garden—I gave her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—by-and-by she denied having received 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said I only gave her half-a-crown—she wanted some more money, and I would not give her any—I had had nothing to do with her—I was quite sober—I wanted to get out—she prevented me, and called, "Mary"—the prisoner Levy came up and asked what was the matter—I told her how it was, and she in<lb></lb>sisted upon my giving a sovereign to Fleming, and wanted some money for herself—I would not give anything to either of them—Simmonds then came up, and they threatened to scratch my face, and tear my clothes—they swore they would do it, and tear all the skin off my face—Simmonds then took up a pair of snuffers, and said she would dig them into my brains—out, I gave Fleming a sovereign, but before that Fleming and Simmonds had struck me with their fists, and Levy had scratched my face—I gave Fleming the sovereign after they struck me—I then tried to get out—Simmonds prevented me, and said I must give her some money too—I said, "What for?"—she said I had torn her frock—I had never touched it—I had bad no struggle—the door was fastened, but I do not think it was locked with a key—I could have unbolted it, but then they would have scratched my face—I was not in fear of ray life—it was from fear of some injury being done me which induced me to give</p>

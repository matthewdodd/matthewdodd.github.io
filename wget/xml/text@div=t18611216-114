                  </hi>. I am ten years old, and live with my father at 10, White's-court—on a Saturday at the end of August Mrs. Shaddock, who I work for, sent me out to receive 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I was to take home to her—I met the prisoner, who told me there were some thieves on London-bridge—that was the way I was going—he took me down Bush-lane, asked me for the money, and said that he would wrap it up; he wrapped it up in paper, and when I got home there was only threepence—last Saturday week he came up to me again on London-bridge, and said that there were two boys coming over the bridge who had knocked down another boy and stolen half a crown—he then said, "Not boys, but men"—I said, "Yes, and you robbed me of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>"—he ran across the road behind a cart—I told a gentleman, and a police<lb></lb>man took the prisoner in custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 522). I was on duty on London-bridge, received information, and took the prisoner—the last witness said, "That man stole 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of me some weeks ago"—I said, "Are you sure he is the man?"—he said, "I am, and my brother knows him as well as me"—I said, "Where is your brother?"—he said, "In Vine-street, Bermondsey"—I took the prisoner there, and the brother said, "Yes, that is the mail," before the last witness had communicated anything to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisonr's Defence.</hi> I was going towards Camberwell-gate to see if I could see an apprentice who was working over there, and in getting out of the way of a drunken man, 1 knocked against this boy, who said, "You are the man who robbed me of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." I never accosted him or spoke to him at all. I said, "You must be mistaken. I saw a person I knew, on the other side of the road in a cart, so I went across to him, and the boy came to me with a policeman and gave me in charge; the inspector said at the station that most likely there would be another charge against me. The girl said that I had light hair and grey whiskers, and was about thirty-six years of age. On the Monday I was placed between several policemen all much taller than me, and all had hats on, and they picked me out at once. About the time this" boy speaks of, I was confined to my bed with a swelling of my thigh, which is not thoroughly cured yet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Golden Anchor, Great Saffron-hill—I know the prisoner by sight—I have known him about three months, I think—on Monday evening, 26th December last, he came to my house about 6 o'clock; it might have been a few minutes before 6—I and my wife were in the bar, very busy—the prisoner made some remark to her—I don't think she took any notice, and it passed on—I did not hear what he said, but he made some allusion towards myself; he said he could kill any such six Englishmen like me—I took no notice of that—I never spoke to the man in my life until after the occurrence took place—he stayed there some few minutes, and left—there were five or six others with him, all of them foreigners—they remained when he left—about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after that, I saw a foreigner of the name of Gregorio, or some such name—he was speaking Italian, and all of a sudden I saw his arm go up, and he struck me just by the side of the mouth with his fist—there were three or four other people there—this was at a little side-box leading from the taproom into the bar—it was not inside the taproom—I was in the bar at the time, on the side leading to the taproom—there were several foreigners in the taproom, I believe—there is a door from the taproom and a small passage into the bagatelle-room—there are two steps and a small passage between—there was no disturbance in the taproom till Gregorio struck me—after he struck me I was about to get over the bar to him, and he went into the taproom among the others—some of the customers in another compartment rushed round the bar and caught hold of me, and I was dragged into the bar-parlour, or as far as the door, on that occasion; I was about going into the taproom, but I was prevented, and pushed into the bar-parlour by several of the customers—I then went as far as the door and looked out, and saw Richard Fawell, 425, A—when I went out, I saw some of the Italians rushing out</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186501300004"></xptr>
               <p>of the house—I went out to look for a policeman, and Fawell came in with me—he went into the taproom, and then several of them got hold of me and pushed me into the bar-parlour, and there held me—I saw no more till the prisoner was dragged out of the bagatelle-room—I saw him being brought from the bagatelle-room in custody of the police—I saw Michael Harrington, the deceased, brought outside into the bar-parlour—I heard that he had been stabbed, and I raised his clothes, or his shirt rather, which was all he had on at that time, except his trousers, and saw his bowels protruding—I did not observe what sort of a wound it was at the time—he was taken by the constable to the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I observe you say that when the prisoner came in on 26th December, he said something to your wife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he did as he passed; we were very busy—I did not hear what he said—I believe my wife is somewhere about the Court—it was to me he spoke about killing the English—I was within a foot of him, and he turned direct towards me and spoke—he said, "I could kill six any such Englishmen like you"—I am satisfied that is correct—I do not make the slightest mistake about it—I have always been certain that those were the exact words he made use of—I have been examined three or four times, I suppose, or two or three; I can't say—I was examined before the Magistrate on the first occasion, and afterwards before the Coroner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will read to you what you said before. "He said they would settle me, and that he could settle any six Englishmen like me;" do you observe that you said "settle" there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might have made the mistake in the con<lb></lb>fusion—I should think it is to the same effect—I should think now that the word "settle" was used—he might have used the word "settle"—I should take it to mean the same if used towards me, and I think you would too—he might have said either "settle" or "kill," I could not swear to it—he then went away—there were a number of Italians in the taproom at that time—I did not go in to see how many there were, but I should think from what I did see there were a dozen or fifteen—you can go into the bagatelle-room through the taproom, and there is another way—there is a door from the taproom into the bagatelle-room—I should think the size of the bagatelle-room is about twenty feet by twelve—there were chairs in it and a bagatelle-board in the corner, and a table on which refreshments are put for the people who are there—I told you there were about twelve or fifteen in the taproom; it would hold about as many again—there were about a dozen in the bagatelle-room, I should think, all English—there were no Italians in the bagatelle-room—I can't say whether other Italians came in with the prisoner—at the time the prisoner made use of the expression to me, the Italians were distributed about the room; they go in and out of the taproom very freely—I daresay they had gone in—there were only Italians in the taproom, no English at all to my knowledge—I did not go in to see—I can't say how long the Italians had been there—the prisoner went out about 6, I suppose—there had been some dancing in the house before that, being Christmas-time, in the taproom—I had seen the prisoner about three times previous to this—I can't say whether he had been dancing or not—the dancing was not going on between 5 and 6, before 5; I think it might have been between 4 and 5—there was nothing after 5; I would not be certain to a few minutes—I mentioned the name of Gregorio, not Rigorio; I thought you said "Rigorio"—I did not understand that was the man you meant for certain, because there are so many names alike—he struck me—I have learnt his name is Gregorio; I did not know the man's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186501300005"></xptr>
               <p>name till afterwards—I have said before to-day that he struck me; I said so at the Police-court before the Magistrate—I am sure of that—I signed my depositions, and they were read over to me—I have been in the police-force—I did say that Gregorio struck me; I swear that—I was examined before the Coroner also. (<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated that Gregorio was excited, but did not state that he was struck by Gregorio.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is what you said before the Coroner; you introduce the name of Gregorio, and say he was very excited, but you don't say one word of his having struck you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not say anything about him till I heard his name—I did not know his name till the following morning—very likely I mentioned his name before the Coroner; I did not go before the Coroner for a week after it occurred; I had plenty of time to learn his name then—Gregorio said something about my striking an Italian, or something of that sort—I can scarcely understand what they say—I understood the prisoner—he can speak as good English as I can; better English than he can Italian—I could not say distinctly what it was Gregorio said—he was muttering; he is an excitable fellow—I saw his arm go up; lie was then standing in front of me—I was in the bar; he was on the other side of the bar—it was his left arm I saw go up, and then it was he struck me in the month—he then rushed into the taproom, and I saw no more of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the Golden Anchor—on 26th December, I was engaged serving in the bagatelle-room—I went into the bar for a pipe—the entrance into the bar is at the end of the bagatelle-room—the door which leads from the taproom is at the side of the bagatelle-room—there is also another way into the bar through the taproom—I passed through the taproom to get to the door at first, before I went for the pipe—as I passed through the taproom I saw a great many Italians all together; among others was the prisoner—he was there by the door of the taproom—one of the other Italians named John spoke to me as I went out—the prisoner might have heard what John said; I can't say whether he heard it or not—in consequence of what John said, I went back into the bagatelle-room—when I got there, I made a statement to the English<lb></lb>men there—no one went and tried to shut the door then—I was asked for a pipe, and I went into the bar by the bagatelle-room door—there were no Italians in the bagatelle-room then—I got the pipe and brought it back into the bagatelle-room—when I got back I saw one of them knocking Mrs. King down—she was at the door at that moment, in the doorway going to the taproom—there were not several people together then—Seraphini, the prisoner, was leading the way in; he was first—I told him I did not want any row here—as I got up to the door, the prisoner stabbed me in the right side—I saw the knife—I don't know what sort of a knife it was—I did not see the handle; I only saw the blade of it—I had known Seraphini before; I have known him for the last four or five years—when he stabbed me, I hit him in the head with a stick, a broom-handle—he ran at me again after I hit him in the head, with the knife still in his hand—I was then just inside</p>

               <p>the bagatelle-room door—I heard one of them say, "Here is one in the room; look out, here is one in the room"—Mrs. King was behind the door then—Boon after, I turned round and saw Seraphim on the top of Harrington—there was no other Italian besides the prisoner in the room at that time, that I saw—I rushed on Seraphini, caught him by the collar, and then lost my senses—I am still a patient at the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you ever said before to-day that there was no other Italian in the bagatelle-room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I said there was no other in the room at the Clerkenwell Police-court—I was asked the question there—the Magistrate asked me if there was any other in the bagatelle-room, and I said, "No"—my depositions were read over to me before I signed them—I believe the Magistrate asked me the question—since I was examined before the Magistrate nobody has asked me—I have not been asked about it—I had been in the bagatelle-room before I saw this happen—I had left the bagatelle-room to go through the bar for a pipe—a great many of them were in the bagatelle-room when I left it; English, not Italians; there was Harrington and another man of the name of Pikey, with one or two Irishmen—there were no Italians—there were Italians in the taproom; as near as I can judge, between twelve and fourteen—the taproom-door was open; the bagatelle-room door was not—the door from the bagatelle-room to the taproom was open; I passed through, but they would not let me go quite through—a man told me to go back, a man they call John, an Italian-struck the prisoner with a broom-handle—I brought it up to protect myself—there was a blind-roller there and a copper-stick, I believe—there were two blind-rollers, I believe—they were in the bagatelle-room—I brought them up about ten minutes before that, from down stairs, in the kitchen—I brought them into the bagatelle room, because one or two in the room said, "If they come in here, we will protect ourselves, "when I told them there was going to be a row—I can't say who it was who said that—the expression was not, "Bring us up as many sticks as you can"—they said, "We won't go out, we will wait here; if they break in on us, we will protect ourselves"—then, afterwards, one of them said, "How nice we should look; if they come in here with knives; what are we to do, we have only got our hands?"—they then asked me if I would have sticks ready to protect themselves if they came out, and I brought these up to them—there were two blind-rollers, a copper-stick, and a broom-handle I brought up; I believe that was all—there were not more, that I am aware of; I don't know, I did it all in a flurry at the time—I was in the bagatelle-room at the time I laid the broom-handle over the prisoner's head—after I brought the broom-handle up it was lying in the bagatelle-room; I put it down on the form—I don't know whether any of the sticks were broken; mine was not, that I am aware of—I don't know whether the prisoner's head was cut and bleeding—I hit him in the head—I did not see any other man's head cut—I was at the bagatelle-room door at the time he struck me with the knife—he was in the passage, coming from the taproom—he was nearer to the bagatelle-room than the taproom; he was right in the bagatelle-room door—the passage is about two feet wide, just about a little wider than this witness-box—as many as liked could come through, if they followed one another—I was nearer the bagatelle-room door than he was, because I was at the door—I was not looking into the bagatelle-room; I was looking at him coming, looking towards the taproom—when I saw Mrs. King knocked down, I was coming into the bagatelle-room with the pipe—it was not in the taproom that she was knocked down, it was in the passage—</p>

(<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>); I struck him on the head, you will find the mark now—I did not see him till he came into the bagatelle-room—the door was shut upon him immediately, he being the only Italian in the room—he was the first man that entered the room, and the door was shut immediately—there was no other Italian in the room at that time—as soon as he came in at the door he made a thrust at Harrington, he being nearest the door—it was not a straight-forward thrust, but a sort of side blow—that was the first thing I saw him do—Harrington fell—the prisoner then made his way towards the door to get out, but Ban<lb></lb>nister was standing in the way, and of course he was taking his own part, punching him—he was standing at the door, so that Seraphini should not go out; Seraphini struck him, and he was knocked down, and rolled under the bagatelle-board—I saw blood coming from Ban<lb></lb>nister's hand; I don't know whether it was his right or left band—I struck the prisoner on the head with a piece of wood, and he fell to the ground on the top of Harrington.</p>

               <p>—I did not go to the Three Tuns; I did not ask permission to search it, nor did anybody—I spoke to a female at the bottom of the stairs, and said, "Which is your parlour?"—she put her hand in this way, and I walked up stairs—Wells was not with me, I sent for him after I had left the house—I saw several foreigners in front of the bar when I came down, and whether I or one of the others sent for him I do not know, therefore I shall not say—the other man who was shown to me was close to the public-house I did not say that there was a man upstairs who I looked at, but did not take—I looked at the foreigners up in the room—when I sent for Mr. Wells it was not to look at one of those who were in the Three Tons—I dare say it was done through me or one of the other officers—I had never spoken to Mr. Wells but once in my life; it was to look at the foreigners in front of the bar, but I do not think I spoke to Mr. Wells—the party I saw who did not coincide was standing near the public-house; I said that he was not the man—I cannot say who the man was who called ray attention to him; he was a policeman, and I believe of the C division, I had get him there special—I looked at the man he pointed out—I did not examine him well; I could see he did not answer the description, knowing that those people have left the country, I did not further search—I cannot remember the description of the four men now, but I could then so as to say that that was not one of them—the description had reference to a man with a dark moustache, that was the description, I believe of two of them.</p>

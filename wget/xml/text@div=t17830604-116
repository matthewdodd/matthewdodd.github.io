             came up to me, collared me, and clapped his bayonet against my breast, and told me to deliver my money, the other prisoner was in company with him, I knew nothing of them before, it was between nine and ten, the moon did not shine out clear, the prisoner Liddell took the money out of my pocket, 3 s. 6 d. in silver, and 4 d. half-penny.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you say positively that these are the two men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did they take in robbing you? - About two or three minutes, I had never seen them before, I met four men going after them, they said, they had been robbed by the two men, I said, they had robbed me too, we went after them, and the two young men pursued one, and took him at the five mile stone, the other was taken the next morning.</p>
               <p>How long was that after you was robbed? - Two hours.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you see them? - I saw one of them, Rogers, in about two hours after I was robbed, at the publick house; he was the man that was in company; Liddell was taken the next morning; Rogers told where he was, and Hawkes went and took him, I knew him to be the person directly.</p>
               <p>ALDRIDGE HAWKES sworn.</p>
               <p>My brother was robbed the 9th of May, he came to our house and said, he was robbed, and desired me immediately to follow him, and at the White Lyon, at Edgware, we heard they had robbed a waggoner: I took Rogers just by the five mile slab, between the four and five mile stone; I found upon him four silk handkerchiefs, a night cap, a pair of gloves, 4 s. 6 d. and 4 d. half-penny, the silk handkerchief he pulled out of his breeches, and this man swore to it, the prosecutor swore to one of the shillings.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What do you know the silk handkerchief by? - There is a snag at one corner, it is tore; there was one of the shillings that I put into my mouth and tried it, and there is the dot, I scratched it with my teeth.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long have you had that shilling to be acquainted with it so? - I received it that day, I took particular notice of it, I thought it was not a good one.</p>
               <p>Court. (Looking at the shilling). This appears to be a good shilling. Rogers informed us where Liddell was to be found; he said, he was very sorry, he should rob a soldier, that was my brother, that was in the Oxfordshire militia; and Liddell cried and said, it was the first time, he had ever been out: he did not acknowledge robbing the prosecutor, he did my brother.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Marines at Woolwich—on 13th August last, about 12 o'clock at night, I was in Martyr's-passage, Woolwich, when two men attacked me, knocked me down, and dragged me into the passage of a house and took my two medals from me—the prisoner is one of the men—I identified him at the Woolwich station—I know he is the man—he assisted in taking the medals from me; one was a Crimean medal with two bars, and the other a Turkish medal, with no bar.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He struck me first on that occasion. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, No, I did not; I thought they were skylarking at first—I had nothing else about me worth taking.</p>

                  </hi>.

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 145). On 24th December, I saw the prisoner on Market-hill, Woolwich, followed him, and took him into custody—I told him he was charged with being concerned with stealing a medal, and also assaulting a Marine—he said he knew nothing about it, and wanted to get away—he said he had not been to Woolwich for nine months, and he would bring his father and mother to prove it—I had a description of him before, and had been in search of him for several weeks—it is quite a common practice at Woolwich for men of the criminal class to take medals from Marines, and then sell them back to them again.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On 13th August, I think it was, I was going through Woolwich, and met this man who was convicted, and went and had some beer with him and his brother; there was a row, and I went out into the court. Lumber came out, and they said something to him, and he struck me, then a man named Murphy came up and took the medals and gave them to a girl there, who went away with them; next day, I went to my uncles, and stayed two months; I came back to Woolwich to fetch my little sister to London, and the policeman took me on that day; I always bore a good character at Woolwich, and I expected a gentleman from the "Canterbury" to give me a character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman of 18, Little Windmill Street—on 28th November, about 11.30 I was in an omnibus—there were other passengers when I got in, mostly females—the prisoner and another man got in at the Minories and sat opposite me—they conversed together—the omnibus pulled up at the Royal Exchange and all the passengers rose to get out—as. Wilcox was going out he placed his hands across the door and said to the conductor "Are you going to Putney?"—the two prisoners were before me and I was behind Cooper who said "I want to go to Putney"—the inside of the omnibus was dark, because the door was thrown open and thrown back—as Cooper did not move I pushed him rather roughly, saying, "Go on mate"—I then felt a sudden pull at my waistcoat, looked down and saw my gold watch in Cooper's hand—the chain still held; it went in at one button hole and out at another—I called out "Police! he has got my watch"—he attempted to get out by slipping his hand under Wilcox's arm and then Wilcox lowered his arm to prevent my following—we all three fell into the road and Wilcox dropped the watch and tried to escape—it then hung by the chain.</p>

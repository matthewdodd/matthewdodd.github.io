               <p>Burroughs. He had been there about eight days; the next morning the landlord and I went out to look for the prisoner; the landlord catched him at Charing-cross; the prisoner had the cherry-derry in his pocket, and he owned to the taking of it at first being charged with it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sexton. The boy at the bar had done something that I did not like, I turned him away; when the soldier came home, he told me he had lost the silk and stuff he had bought to make a waistcoat; I went to the house, where I had a character of the boy; he was not there; then I went to the intelligence office at Charing-cross; there he was offering himself for a place; I saw the stuff stick out of his pocket; he begged I would not take any notice of it, and said, he never was guilty of the like before; I brought him before Sir

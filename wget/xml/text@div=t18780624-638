                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Jones, of 3, Hope Gardens, a bricklayer's labourer—on Sturday night, 8th June, about 12.20, I was returning from my work—I went into a public-house in the Five Dials—I had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my hand, which I had been paid for my work—I had given my boy a penny, and a man twopence for some tobacco—the prisoner was in the public-house—he asked me for a pot of beer, I refused—he went out first, and when I came outside the door he knocked me down—a young man held me while the prisoner took the money out of my hand, and ran away—I afterwards found him in the same public-house—on Whit Monday night my little boy saw him, and came and told me—my boy was with me when I was robbed—I got a constable, and gave the prisoner in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was in the public-house drinking. This woman knows me very well. I asked her to stand a pot of beer. In coming out she struck me in the eye, and the man that owns this cap came up and struck her. They stumbled on the ground together. I picked the cap up, not knowing that he had taken any money, and on the Monday night I went to the house to give him his cap, when I was given in charge.</p>

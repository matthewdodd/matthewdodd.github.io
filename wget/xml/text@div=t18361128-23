                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. John Waithman, linen-draper, of Bridge-street. The prisoner came to the shop with two other females, at about half-past five o'clock on the evening of the 18th of November, and requested to look at some low-priced shawls—I said we had nothing very low—the prisoner, with the other two, replied, that they would give about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I think that was one that escaped—I showed them two or three, and observed that the other two, while my back was turned, had get a shawl in such a position, that it hid the prisoner from</p>

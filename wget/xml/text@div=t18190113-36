On Saturday fortnight, about half-past seven o'clock at night, the prisoner accosted me at Temple-bar, said he was in distress, had nothing to eat, or anywhere to lay his head. I told him I had no money, and could give him none. I went into a shop in Fleet-street, and on coming out he accosted me as before; I gave him five-pence or seven-pence, and as I passed down Fleet-street I was surprised to find him following me, he repeated the same tale, and said he was sure I could give him more money; he kept following me, and pushing his arms against me. I could not get rid of him, and asked him for what I was to give him money? he said gentlemen had given him money when he asked, and I could if I liked - and he dare say I could; and that a quaker gave him 14 s. a few nights before. He kept elbowing me, standing in my way, and repeating this story. I became alarmed. He said he certainly must and would have money - that I must give him what I had, and meet him next day in St. Paul's church-yard, and bring him a 1 l. note. I gave him 4 s. 6 d., and promised to meet him there at ten o'clock the following day. I was taken very ill, and confined to my bed for three or four days. It was my intention to have given information to the Lord Mayor, with a description of his person. I came to town on the 8th of June, from the Hackney-road, and called on my solicitor at the Royal Exchange, he not being at home, I went down Cheapside to buy some things, the prisoner came up to me, and said I was the very person he had been looking for, that he would have money, and would follow me to hell, but what he would have money. I told him I had several places to call at. He continued following me, pushing and elbowing me, and threatening me in the same manner. I then went into a public-house, opposite the Mansion-house, to find an officer, but none was to be found; he still kept following me, and said I had got a watch, and he would have it. I said I had got no watch, but I had got the duplicate of one. He asked if it was a valuable one - I said it was. He said that would do for him, and I gave it to him; he then said he would not leave me until I could procure some money. I then went to my solicitors', Messrs. Draper and Bird, Exchange Chambers - he remained on the stairs. I sent for an officer, who took him, and found the duplicate upon him.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. He accused you of nothing - A. No. I parted with the money under the impression of fear.</p>
               <p>Q. What fear - A. That he would charge me with an abominable offence - he hinted at it.</p>

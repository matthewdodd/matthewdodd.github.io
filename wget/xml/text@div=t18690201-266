I am barman at the Pied Horse, Chiswell Street—on 6th January, about 7.30 p.m., I served Wilson with a half-pint of porter, and he tendered me a bad sixpence—I bent it, gave it back to him and asked him if he had any more like it—he said no, he received it from a gentleman for holding two horses—I took the beer back, and he walked away—Daniel Wilson, who was at the bar, left directly and brought him back, asking me to detain him while he brought two more <hi rend="italic">pals</hi>; he went out and brought a sergeant, a policeman, and Partridge, and a woman—I saw Partridge had something in his mouth; the policeman seized him by the throat, and they scuffled on the floor for five minutes.</p>

I am an engineer, of 21, Cecil Court, St. Martin's Lane—on. 6th January I was in the Pied Horse, and saw Wilson there, he called for a half-pint of beer, and tendered a sixpence—I followed him out, he went about thirty yards and then stopped, and looked back and crossed the road, still watching the public-house he had Dome out of—he then walked rather smartly and I followed him, he stopped at the corner of Finsbury Place North, and Chiswell Street, where he joined Partridge, and a woman, who has been discharged—they conversed together, crossed the road, and went about forty yards down Finsbury Place North, where Wilson left the others and went to the Ship public-house, and called for a half-pint of beer—I stood at the door—directly he called for the beer he turned and faced the door, which was wide open, as it had been recently painted; directly he saw me he pretended to pick up a piece of paper to get a light—I went in and said, "I want you"—he said, It is the same sixpence as I just gave you"—I took it out of his hand; it was straight and had never been defaced—it was bad—I gave it to the constable, and took the prisoner to the Pied Horse, and requested the landlord to detain him—I went after the others, saw a sergeant, and with his assistance took Partridge and the woman, who were looking into the Ship for Wilson—I was present when</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 25, King Street, Snow Hill—on the evening of 25th April, I was at the corner of Great Windmill Street, and was going into a public—house, when the prisoner, who was leaving the public-house hustled me—I said "I beg pardon, allow me to pass"—he said "It is rather crowded here"—I said "Yes"—he took one step out of the public-house, and put one hand like this, I said "It is gone" and he held up his finger—I said "All right old fellow I am after you," and I followed him close up behind and caught him in the middle of the road and gave him in charge—my watch was only attached to a ribbon, but he took it off the bow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was cross-examined at the police—court and said that did not see or feel him take the watch, the compartment was rather crowded—I am a stranger to that neighbourhood—there were from three to five females in the compartment, people were not trying to get in and out at the same time—there were three of us, two friends and myself—there was no one trying to come out but the prisoner—he was going away between a walk and a run—I told the inspector that I did not see him take it, he asked me when I last had it safe and I said "Just before entering the house"—I am sure it was not five minutes—I had been taking a quiet walk and had had one glass to drink—I might say I am a teetotaller, I never signed the pledge—I never lost sight of the prisoner, the watch was not found on him—I had not been to see people coming out of the Argyll rooms.</p>

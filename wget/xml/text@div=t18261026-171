On the 19th of October, the prisoner and Jarman came into my shop, about four o'clock in the evening, and asked for one of my lodgers, who was called down - a tray of gold seals was on the counter, near to where he stood - he took up one and said, "This is a pretty seal, it is glass;" Jarman said, "No, it is a pebble;" the prisoner took up another - I did not move from my seat; they left soon after - and at eight o'clock, when I went to put away the seals, I missed three, if not more, one of which has a yellow stone; I had seen it in the prisoner's hand.</p>

            . I went with the prisoner, and when we came out he showed me three seals, which he said were his own; two were small, and appeared to be guinea-gold - one had a yellow stone, and was similar to what I saw in the tray; I did not then suppose he had stolen them. I heard of the robbery next day, and now believe it was her seal - I gave her information.</p>

            , the priest. I saw his first wife here about an hour ago - I have been in London two years. When I first saw her in town, she was going up with the Queen's address, one day. I saw them together several times, she lived in Grub-street - the prisoner lived near her I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the marriage ceremony performed - A. I saw them go into the priest's house, and saw them on their knees, and the clergyman in his robes, saying some words. I waited till it was all over, and saw them come away - I saw them married; the prisoner is the man and Smith is the woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What are you - I keep a green-stall in Fuller's-rents - I live in Spread Eagle-court, Gray's Inn-lane. My father farmed some land in Ireland, and lived at Castle Harland. There is a church and chapel there - I am a Catholic. Smith lived about a mile from the priest's, and the prisoner two miles from him - the marriage was about seven or eight o'clock in the evening. I lived near Riley's and knew them both as neighbours. I went in and saw the marriage, the same as another - it was not private, the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you get for coming here - A. Nothing. I saw them married by the laws of God and man, and that is all I know. Mrs. Elliott told me to come here, she never lived with me, nor in the same house. She told me he was living with another woman. Riley, the priest, lived in the town of Crushyfahan (he is dead) the wedding was at the prisoner's father's, about a mile from the priest's. The priest had a robe on, the same as they generally wear - there was a cross on it - about twenty people were present. I believe Smith's father is dead - they do not have marriage lines in Ireland, that I know of. They signed all their names in a book, and the priest wrote his - the service was in English. I saw them lawfully married, according to the laws of God and man.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you to say that - A. Nobody. I was under no criminal charge before I left Ireland - I was never charged with forgery.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Is there the least reason for saying you were ever charged with any crime - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the marriage being in the afternoon - A. Eating and drinking - they went from the priest's to Smith's father's, and there kept the wedding.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said they were married at the priest's, and then at her father's house - A. They were married at the priest's - they went from the father's to be married.</p>
               <p>(Here the witness, by desire of MR. ANDREWS, was re-sworn, with the book open, and stated all he had before said was true.)</p>

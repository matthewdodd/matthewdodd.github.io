             at his house, either in November or December, then last past; meaning November or December, 1783; this fact is denied: the assignment of perjury is, that Mr. Rawbone did not prepare the bill of sale; that the money was not paid by notes;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120100"></xptr> nor any consideration paid for the same, nor was it executed at his house in November or December, 1783: this fact being sworn by Mr. Rawbone, when the bankrupt came to his last examination, the whole truth came out; it then appeared that Mr. Rawbone first of all applied to the bankrupt, and endeavoured to serve him as an attorney and broker, and had sold his effects, and Tatler on that acknowledged that so far from any bill of sale having been given, in the manner or at the time he had sworn; that this man came and over persuaded him in the King's-bench, to sign this bill of sale, but that no consideration was given for it: You see the perjury is very short. the question is whether the bill of sale so produced by this man, was true or not: the commission was issued the 9th of January, 1784; Tatler was declared a bankrupt the 21st of January, 1784, and afterwards Rawbone came to be admitted a creditor: This prosecution is carried on very properly by the assignees of that bankrupt; you are witnesses to the gross frauds that are frequently committed under commissions of bankruptcy, and it is high time that should be done, and that men who are daring enough to come and prove that which never existed, should be brought before a Court of Justice; and if this case is proved as I have stated it, I am sure you will think it your duty to find the defendant guilty by your verdict.</p>

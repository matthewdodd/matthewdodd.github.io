               <p>Q. Did the prisoner play? - A. The landlord said he would take one hand with him, if he would walk out of the house afterwards; the prisoner agreed, and pulled out a two-pound note, and so did Davis; they were both given to Copers; a squabble took place, and Davis wanted his note back.</p>
               <p>Q. The landlord desired him to go off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What Davis asked for, was his own two-pound note? - A. Yes; Mr. Davis desired him to walk out, and the prisoner said, I will not for you nor any b - r in the town; Copers said, I will back you for fifty pounds, or a hundred; the prisoner struck the landlord on the face, and after he had beat the landlord he robbed me of two one-pound notes; the landlord came up again; then the prisoner asked for the two-pound; Mr. Copers pulled out a one-pound note, which was Mr. Davis's; I do not know whether Mr. Copers gave the two one-pound notes to the prisoner, or not; he asked me for it; I said I have only got a one-pound note, which I laid down on the table; I said, that is not the note; Mr. Davis said, no; the prisoner at the bar put his hand over to the one-pound note, and tore it in half, and put it in his breeches pocket; I said, do not rob me; yes, he said, you b - r, I will rob you, and you shall not take it again; I begged him to give it me; he called me a d - d b - r, and struck me over the face; I struck the prisoner, and knocked him on the floor, and when he came to me again, I knocked him down again; then they said, if I was a man, I should give him room; I knocked him down again; after that he acknowledged that he had robbed me of two one-pound notes; he said, Mr. Armstrong, I beg you will not take the law of me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he say he had robbed you? - A. He spoke the same words that I have said myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Give us the same words over again? - A. He said, Mr. Armstrong, I acknowledge I have robbed you of two one-pound notes, I will give them to you, and ten pounds to-morrow, I have none about me now.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it for robbing you, or striking you? - A. I take it, for robbing me; the prisoner wished to leave off, as he had the worst of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Copers say any thing then? - A. He said they were school-fellows, and he would give me ten pounds, or twenty pounds, if I would not take the law of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by at the time? - A.He was.</p>

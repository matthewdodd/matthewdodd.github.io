               <p>RICHARD WILLETTS. I am a warehouseman, I live with Messrs. Darby and Hilton in Lime-street. On the 17th of July I was standing in Red Lion-street, I heard the cry of watch, I saw two men running towards me, the prisoner was one; I followed him across Whitechapel into Essex-street, he got under a gateway, stooped down, and when I came up to him he jumped up, made a blow at me, and then ran on and came to another gate, there he stooped down again; I saw him gather some mud; he put something under the gate, he came up again and made a blow at me; I brought him back and delivered him to the patrol.</p>

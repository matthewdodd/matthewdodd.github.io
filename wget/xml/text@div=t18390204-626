                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, and live in Leigh-street, Bur<lb></lb>ton-crescent. On the 7th of January the prisoner came to my shop for a pot of bear's-grease—she gave me a bad half-crown—I went to my neigh<lb></lb>bour's, and got change—when I came back the prisoner was waiting at my door for the change, and I gave it her—I had left the half-crown at my neighbour's—we were both deceived, and thought it was good—my neighbour sent his man back directly to fetch me—I went in a minute, and got the half-crown back from my neighbour, and locked it up—the next night the prisoner came again for a sixpenny bottle of rose-oil—she said, "My young ladies did not like that bear's grease you gave me last night"—when I served her the oil, she gave a half-crown—I put my hand into my pocket, pretending I had not got change, I bolted and locked the door, and called, "Thief, thief, police!"—the neighbours and the police-man came running—I gave the two half-crowns to the policeman.</p>

On last Sunday week, about ten o'clock, I was cleaning my master's boots and shoes. I let the prisoners in; they called for some beer. I put my bundle of clothes on the dresser, on the right hand side of the tap-room, the coat, waistcoat, handkerchief, and a cork-screw. Mrs. Wiseman would not let them have any beer. She was angry with me for letting them in. I persuaded Saunders to go out, because it was church-time. Couzens went out, and then Saunders went out. In about ten minutes time I missed my clothes. In the evening I met my grandmother: she told me, there was a coat sold at the Coach and Horses, in James-street, Kensington. I saw it again in the evening; the coat is here.</p>

            . I am a labouring man. On the 31st of May, I was at the Coach and Horses public-house. Couzens came in with the coat on. He asked if any body would buy the coat. He asked eight shillings for it. He being in liquor, I told him, I would give half-a-guinea. I gave him five shillings, and was to give him five shillings and sixpence the Wednesday night following.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in company with Couzens - A. Saunders. Couzens said, we have got a waistcoat between us. He took it out of Saunder's cap. I did not buy the waistcoat. The coat I gave into the landlady's hands; and, while I was drinking part of a pot of porter, the prosecutor's grandmother came in. I told her, the coat was to be seen in the bar, if any body owned it.</p>
               <p>- I am an officer of Kensington parish. I took the prisoners into custody. I found some of the articles in Couzen's possession. This cork-screw was in his pocket; this waistcoat in his cap, on the side of his bed, and the handkerchief under his pillow. This coat I found in the bar.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are all mine.</p>
               <p>Couzon's Defence. On the 31st of May we had been drinking at the Dun Cow. We went down the town, and went into the Artichoke. We called for some beer; they would not serve us with any. The prosecutor let me out of the house. A young man that was with us brought the bundle away with him. He said, he would give us this bundle. I instantly wore the things to the Dun Cow public-house. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010062"></xptr> then came down to my quarters. I had no money. Shears told me he would buy the coat. The waistcoat I put in my hat.</p>
               <p>Saunder's Defence. I was at the Dun Cow, where my quarters is. After that, we went into Kensington to get something to eat. We called into the Artichoke public-house. I saw no person take the bundle away. I did not know of it until the afternoon.</p>

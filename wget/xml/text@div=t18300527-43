The prisoner and a person with her, hired my lodging on the 14th of October - the prisoner took two parlours ready furnished at 9l. 5s. per quarter; she gave up one room on the 23rd of March - she then kept on one room, and continued to sleep there occasionally, and occasionally I believe at her mother's; she sent the key on the 30th of April, but I had not seen her from the 13th of April till she was at the office - she owed for rent, 1l. 18s. borrowed money, and some articles - I had missed a picture, which I had asked her for - she sent back with the key a drinking-glass, a sheet, a tablecloth, a tea-spoon, and a small waiter; I have seen other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270023"></xptr>articles since, but a decanter, a tumbler, and wine-glass have not been found.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner six months - I took the key of the lodging, and some of the articles of furniture back to the prosecutrix; the prisoner gave me the duplicates.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know a person named James? A. Yes; these are the things which I had pawned for Mrs. James, and the prisoner gave the duplicates; James was with the prisoner when she took the lodging - I heard a gentleman say he would send to Warwickshire to find James; the prosecutrix refused to appear against James - I do not know whether the prisoner was an apprentice; her mother lives at Chelsea; I know nothing of the picture; I did not pawn that - James lived in the same house with Banks and the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was that before she was taken? A. Three weeks I believe - I had pawned a great many things for Mrs. James; the pawnbroker knew me; I took the tea things up to the prisoner the night after James left the lodging, and she told me to take one of the spoons; she did not then know these, but that they were all there - James was much older than the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective police officer—on the 8th June, about half-past ten in the morning, from some information, I went to 4, Charles Street, Hatton Garden—it is a small bonnet shop—I was in plain clothes—the prisoner arrived there about a quarter to eleven—he went into the bonnet shop, in front of the counter—almost immediately afterwards I saw Gardiner, the postman, in the street, not a minute afterwards: I saw him go into the shop and deliver a packet of letters to the prisoner—the prisoner took them—I saw the postman also hand him a smaller packet—I then saw the prisoner write upon some papers—the postman came out, and the prisoner then retired to the back of the shop—I followed him imme<lb></lb>diately,</p>

               <p>accompanied by Sergeant Beard—the prisoner was at the back of a little screen, and the large packet of letters was then undone—it was tied round with string—Beard asked him if his name was Canton—he said, "No"—Beard said, "Then why did you sign your name 'H. Canton?'" He said, "Because I had Mr. Canton's authority to do so"—upon that I told the prisoner that I suspected he had forged stamps about him, and that I should take him into custody—he said nothing—I then took him to the station and took charge of all the letters, eighty-five in number—when I got to the station I opened them—I produce them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 25, Southampton Row, Russell Square—I have made handwriting my study for several years, and am constantly employed in that occupation—I have looked at the three receipts signed "H. Canton"—I have before me the promissory note signed by Alker, and a printed form, signed "H. Canton"—I have compared them, and have no doubt that is in the same handwriting as the three receipts—I have confined my examination to the signatures, but I have no doubt, looking casually, that the body of the promissory note is in the same handwriting—it bears the same character—I speak with confidence to the "H. Canton"—I have not examined the envelope addressed "H. Canton, 9, St. Thomas's Road"—I will not say without examination whether that is in the same handwriting, I do not see that it is—the filling up, "H. Canton," in each of these promissory notes contained in these three letters is, I have no doubt, in the same handwriting—the signature, "H. Canton," at the bottom of those letters, is also decidedly in the same writing, not the name in the body of the letters—I cannot say that the signature to the letters to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186608130025"></xptr>
               <p>Alker is in the same writing, the signature of H. Canton to these other two registered letters, Nos. 451 and 456, is in the same writing—here is a third, which I believe not to be in the same writing—these nine letters and the filling up of the nine promissory notes contained in them are in the same writing, the same as that to the receipts—I have no doubt whatever about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many of the signatures, "H.

Canton."</p>

                  </hi>. I live in John's-place, Lant-street, and am constable to the Society for preventing Cruelty to Animals—I stationed myself in Mr. Rook's the undertaker's shop, which is nearly opposite the prosecutor's, and about a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning, on the 28th of January, I saw the prisoner Nathan—he walked backwards and forwards near the prosecutor's shop, before the shop was opened—he then crossed, and went over again near the shop, Ware came to the door, and gave him a nod, and he then went into the shop—he was in about half a minute—he then came out with a bag—he twisted it and put it on his arm—I took him with it, and asked him what he had got there—he said, "Old clothes"—I said, "I think you have got some hats here"—he said, "Only some old hats"—he took out an old silk hat, and put a handkerchief over these two hats, which were in paper—I said. "What have you here?"—he said, "One</p>

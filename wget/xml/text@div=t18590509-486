The prisoner was a clerk in my employment for about fourteen months—there was a fur cape left in my office by a client of mine about April—I searched for it on 29th April, and could not find it—the next day the prisoner came and I asked him where the cape was—he said he thought that my client's son, Robert Lacy, had taken it—I put myself in communication with the police; and I told the prisoner it was no use his denying it, that he had taken the cape, I felt certain that he had—he still denied it—I said that it was no use denying it, and he then gave me the pawn-ticket, and said he had pawned it—I gave him in custody—this is the cape.</p>

               <p>Court to King. If you have taken any money from this woman, for less than its nominal value, you are guilty of a felony; therefore, you are not bound to answer any questions that are put to you that may criminate yourself? - I never had any but this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Do you know the prisoner? - Yes, for some time; I met her last Saturday, she asked me if I would go with her to pass off some bad money, which I refused to do; then she asked me if I would buy some, I then took two guineas-worth; I shewed them to a friend of mine, and he advised me to take them to Mr. Clarke. I bought some of her, and gave her ten shillings and sixpence for them, they are in this paper.</p>
               <p>How much is there in that? - Seven shillings and nineteen sixpences. Mr. Clarke advised me to take half a guinea's-worth, when he would send somebody to take her in possession; I did so, and the woman was taken into custody, this is the same woman.</p>

               <p>I took the prisoner on Sunday the 23d instant, we waited some time, and went to the Rose and Crown, just at the back of the Fountain, at Shoreditch; I met the prisoner, I did not know her, but I rather suspected she was the person we were going after, I stopped her, and we took her to the Fountain, and in the little back parlour I said we must search you; I saw she wanted to conceal something, I pulled this little bag out of her left hand, in which there was eight shillings and sixteen bad sixpences; I put my hand into her right hand pocket, and there I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260151"></xptr> found two bad shillings; I marked them, as being taken in a separate place, I kept them in a separate place ever since; I believed them all to be bad; but I am not a sufficient judge.</p>

               <p>Did you ever see King and the prisoner together? - After she was taken, I went to the public-house and fetched him.</p>

               <p>Court. How do you know them? - By their thickness and heaviness, I have no doubt of their being bad.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no witnesses but myself; the prosecutor came to me, and said he must pawn his coat for 3 s. for he had been out of work seven months. He came to me the next day; and said, what do you say now? I said, I will say nothing of the matter; he said then, he must go some where else. I never saw him but once after, then I met him in the street, and he is a false man, I never saw his money in my life, he owes me three shillings now, which I lent him.</p>

I am sure he said his brother William. I had known the prisoner at this time about a month, by his living in the neighbourhood; he said his brother's surname was Sowerby. I gave him the change - he said his brother worked at Mr. Calow's, Blackfriars-road, a dyer's. (Looks at the note). This is the note I received of him. I wrote "W. Sowerby, Mr. Calow, Blackfriars-road;" and underneath, "Mr. Sowerby, 26, West-street, D. P." He lived at No. 26, West-street. I had served him with beer there, it is just by my house. He took the beer and gin away, and referred me to next door, No. 25, for the pot as his house was at that time shut up. I kept the note in my house a fortnight, and then paid it to my brewers; it was returned to me by them. I had not seen the prisoner from the time he paid it me. I believe he brought the pot back himself, almost immediately, but I did not see him until I saw him at Marlborough-street. I knew his brother by his coming for things - they both lived together.</p>

Whiting, is not his hand writing - the note uttered to Staples, is forged in all respects, nor is it the signature of H. Whiting; there is a person of that name, but he is not authorized to sign 5 l. notes; the other is also forged in every respect, and is signed W. R. West, there is such a cashier authorized to sign notes, The three notes appear to me to be impressed from the same plate, and the names Whiting, appears to be written by the same hand, and that of West, I think is the same writing as the other two.</p>

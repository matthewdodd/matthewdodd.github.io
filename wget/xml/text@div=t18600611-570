                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Lewis, Cowan and Co. soap makers of Barnes, Surrey—Eddingt on has been in the habit of selling bones to me for the last four years—Bromley has been in my employ at various times, and had been taken into my employ within three or four days of this first transaction, 4th April—we have employed Carney some years; I believe he and Bromley are brothers-in-law—from something which took place on 5th April, I watched from the roof of the building—it is large building with a slate roof; you can see from the roof to the ground—it is about twenty feet high—the carts which delivered bones were brought to deliver them at the weighing-machine below which I could see from the roof—I commanded a view of the whole—I was watching, on 5th April, between 5 and 6 in the afternoon, when Eddington came with a cart of bones—Carney and a man named Biggs were weighing them—Biggs is a man who was in our employment, and left some weeks afterwards, and I have not heard of him since—he did not give us notioe to leave, nor did we give him notice—I do not know where he is; he left four or five days previous to 27th April—Mr. Parsons, the foreman, was also there—Carney and Biggs had to lift the bones on to the weighing-machine, and remove them after they had been weighed into baskets—Carney called out the weight to Mr. Payne, who en<lb></lb>tered it in a book; Eddington also checked the weight—on the whole of the bones being weighed and delivered, Eddington and Payne compare the weight, and on their agreeing Mr. White the cashier pays—Mr. Payne gives an order, either a leaf of his book, or a counterpart, which he tears out—that is Mr. White's authority to pay Eddington; it is a Voucher upon which the money is received—Eddington in this instance made his memorandum on the side of the building, where there was a piece of iron, with chalk—four baskets are employed—the cart is drawn within the building, conveniently near to the weighing-machine—two baskets are put on to the scale-board, and while they are being weighed, two others are being filled—it was the duty of Bromley and Carney to carry away the baskets of bones from the weighing-machine—on this occasion I observed that one basket was removed from the scale-board to the heap when two should have been removed—instead of moving the second they left it on the machine, and another full basket was put on—before the first basket was removed its weight was called out and booked—another full basket was then added to it, and that was weighed again, as if two baskets had been put on, so that the weight of one basket was called out twice—I saw that done five times, so that we were charged with five baskets</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186006110102"></xptr>
               <p>more than we received—the weight of two baskets on the scale was called out on each occasion, and put down against me—after I had seen two baskets done that way, I called Mr. White, our cashier, on to the roof, and he came and saw the remaining three—the next occasion was the 13th, when I was in the same position, and saw the same process carried on—Eddington came with a load of bones about the same time—Carney and Biggs were at work, and I think Payne helped them, as he was anxious to get away—he had not helped before—I only saw one basket weighed a second time on that occasion—Biggs was receiving the baskets—on the 20th, Biggs, Carney, Eddington, and Payne were there—I saw one basket left on a second time, and when Mr. Payne came to check the weight, he said, "This basket has been weighed before, I remember it quite well"—the man said, "No, it has not"—but Payne quite was certain, and caused the basket to be removed, so that on that occasion we were not defrauded at all—on the 27th I went to the same spot—the three prisoners were present—Eddington came with his cart about the usual time—I saw that two baskets were left on, as on the previous occasion, the only difference in the process being this, that Mr. Payne stood here, and the basket was there—Bromley came to take the second basket; he put it so, and brought a new basket and put it so, and then took two marrow-bones, from one, and put them to the other, so as to disturb the top, and we were defrauded on that occasion of two baskets of bones—Eddington was assisting filling the baskets—he was standing by, and could see on each occasion what was occurring; he must have known it—he had a different number of baskets—he should have had two empty baskets, or two full ones, but he only parted with one full basket—the custom is to fill two at a time—it was Bromley that moved the baskets in that way—on the baskets being removed, they were taken to a distant heap—these were marrow-bones, and each basket was worth about 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they are supposed to hold a hundred<lb></lb>weight, but they hold rather more—on the last occasion I came down from the roof, and as Eddington drove away with Bromley and several more, I went after them with Sergeant Smith, and came up with them at public-house about 200 yards off—I said, "There is something wrong in your bones, Mr. Eddington, and I wish you to come back"—he came, and we re-weighed the bones in his presence—I had put his bones into a distinct heap by themselves, to re-weigh them; all the marrow-bones that had been delivered—we found 2cwt. 27lbs. short—he said, "There is evidently some mistake; have any been taken up stairs?" Mr. Payne said, "No"—I went up stairs, merely to meet the remark, and there were none there—we had taken care previously that there should be no more bones in the place but what he brought—another customer was bringing in some bones at the time—we caused those to be re weighed also, in Eddington's presence, and found that there was no excess, but some few pounds deficient—those were marrow-bones—I then gave Eddington in custody.</p>

               <p>what was going on down below—I saw Eddington unloading his cart assisted by Carney, Biggs, and Payne—Eddington was sorting the bones from the cart, and Carney and Biggs were placing them on the scale—after weighing one of the baskets of marrow-bones was left on the scale and weighed a second time when another had been brought and put to it, and the weight called out again—Mr. Payne was standing at the tail of the cart—Eddington checked it with him—we paid for the weight that had been called that day—on 5th April I was called by Mr. Phineas Cowan, went on to the roof, watched with him, and saw the same men and the same thing go on as before—Mr. Cowan had been on the roof some little time—I saw three baskets weighed twice over—Eddington was assisting in filling them, and Payne was checking the weight as it was called out, and talking to Eddington at the tail of the cart—on the 27th I had had some money marked for the purpose of paying Eddington, as was previously arranged—he came there again, and after he had gone with his team I went to him and requested him to lend me what money he had—he left me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about three-quarters of an hour after they had finished loading, he brought a voucher from Mr. Payne for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for me to pay; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I paid him seven sove<lb></lb>reigns, one half-sovereign, six half-crowns, six shillings, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and a penny-piece—they were all marked except the penny—some of that money was afterwards brought to me by Lockyer and Smith, and I recognised it.</p>

               <p>bones over twice"—I do not remember that he made any remark to that, but the basket was taken away without being re-weighed—on the 27th I was, there when Eddington came with his cart of bones—Carney and Bromley were also there—we weighed the bones as usual, and I saw that the weights, were correct—some waste bones were weighed that day—they are weighed in the same baskets—when a basket of waste is put on it is called waste, and I look to see whether it is waste, or whether it is marrow—they are very, different in appearance, and in price—one is 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the other is 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Eddington was sorting his bones and keeping tally on what we call a frying pan—on the whole being weighed, I gave the counterpart of this voucher—he then left with it and took it up to Mr. White—a short time afterwards Eddington was brought back by a police-sergeant, and Mr. Cowan said be wanted the bones re-weighed—every basket of Eddington's was shot in one place—I assisted in re-weighing them—there were 20 cwt. 3 qrs. 23 lbs.; and on re-weighing there were only 18 cwt. 2 qrs. 24lbs., making a difference, of 2 cwt. 27lbs.—I waa there from the time of Eddington's leaving and being brought back—no bones were taken away, they were in precisely the state when he came back as when he left—when he saw the difference he said he supposed there must be some mistake—he was there when they Were weighed and when they were re-weighed—he said, "Have any been taken up stairs?"—Mr. Cowan said "No, but we will go up and see," and there were no bones in the place but these, and some belonging to a man named Clare, which were unloading.</p>

I am a detective officer—I apprehended Carney on 22d April—I told him the charge; he said nothing—I asked him what money he had got, and he produced 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in shillings, three half-crowns, two fourpenny pieces, and twopence In copper—I asked him next morning where he got it, he said, "I picked it up by the side of Mr. Eddington's cart," and that Mr. Cowan had given him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and Mr. Eddington 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for unloading the the cart—I afterwards showed that money to Mr. White—this (<hi rend="italic">prodwuced</hi>) is it.</p>

On the evening of 27th, I went to a public-house, saw Eddington and told him that there was something wrong in the weight of the bones, and he must come back with me—Bromley was in Eddington's cart, and I told him that he must come back also—they went back and I saw the bones re-weighed—I told Eddington that I was a police-sergeant and must take him into custody for being concerned with Carney and Bromley in conspiring to defraud Mr. Cowan—he said, "Evidently there is a mistake," and went back and looked to where he had chalked down the bones that had been re-weighed—I asked him if he had given either Carney or Bromley any money—he said, "Yes, he had given Carney six<lb></lb>pence and some half-pence"—we went up into the counting-house of the factory and I searched Eddington there, and found two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>-notes, six sovereigns, a half-sovereign, three half crowns, and four shillings on him.</p>

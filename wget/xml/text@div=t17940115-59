               <p>I am the watchman; going my round about ten in the evening, it was the fifth of January, going up into Duke's Court, at the Marquis of Granby's, in the Hambury, Westminster, I saw the prisoner come without his hat down the court.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that from Mr. Needham's? A considerable distance? - A considerable distance, upwards of a quarter of a mile. Going up to call the hour, I see something lay in a corner between the houses of number 1, and number 2, in Duke's Court; I went and put my stick to it and stirred it, the prisoner-followed me up and said to me, what is that watchman? I said I think it is a soldier's knapsack, I put my hand to pull at my rattle to take it and spring it with my right hand and I took hold of him with my left, and told him he was my prisoner, and I sprung the rattle for further assistance, and the prisoner made but small. resistance, but I secured him till two patroles came to my assistance; I found nothing there on him, because the fowls were laying in the corner and he followed me up.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the fowls in? - In nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him with the fowls in his hand? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him put the fowls in the corner? - No, him following me up gave me a suspicion.</p>

            Then who put them there, you don't know; and your only ground of suspicion of the prisoner was, he happened to be near where the fowls were? - Yes. I secured him, and put him in the watch-house, taking him to the watch-house they found some blood on his clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the fowls dead? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. How had they been killed? - Their necks seemed to have been pulled off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any blood about him? - Yes, we made search of him to find if he had any thing in his pockets, which the constable that is here, found a padlock with some keys. I did not search him, the constable did that took the padlock in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the padlock taken out of his pocket or from him? - Yes, from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the padlock and keys? - I did not take them into my custody, the constable did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said I made but small resistance, I would be glad to know what resistance I made? - Yes, he made resistance, and shoved me off to disentangle himself from me, and asked me the reason for what I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to ask him if I chose to make my escape whether I could or could not? - Yes, I was past the place having no suspicion of any thing laying there; but I thought I might see some girls of the town there, for which reason the prisoner followed me back, or otherwise I could not have took him.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to know whether he has mentioned that he did not think me guilty of the crime or not? - I said that possible the man may be innocent, for what I know.</p>

I made answer and said, I see him on Sunday; I told him I was extremely sorry for the young fellow especially on account of his family, says I, as you are a father of children I am sure paternal care and tenderness would exempt you from prosecuting a young man that perhaps is not guilty of the charge that you alledge; says he, it is not me that prosecutes, it is the watchman, on account of the forty pounds, that he thinks would bear his weight, and particularly there was not myself alone there that heard it, there was the landlady of the house and two or three respectable people that were in the place.</p>
               <p>Needham. I did not say so, I asked him if he had seen his acquaintance? and he mentioned about his having children, and I said I did not want to hurt the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that the watchman prosecuted him for the forty pounds? - That I did not say any thing about, because it was an out house, that part is not true.</p>

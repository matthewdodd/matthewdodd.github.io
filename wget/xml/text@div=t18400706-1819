                  </hi>. I am the son of Timothy Stafford, a watch<lb></lb>maker, of Bridge-place, City-road. On the 23rd of June, between seven and eight o'clock, in the morning, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for a gold watch-key, which was in the window—he came round the counter, and pointed it out—he moved the velvet, then made another move, and said he had made up his mind to have a metal key—he paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for one, and went out—I had noticed his making a move when he pointed to a gold key, near the end of the window, and then I saw his hand half in and half out of his pocket—he was looking at the window where a silver watch hung—it was the only silver one there—some hours after he had left I missed it—I had seen it safe half-an-hour before he came in—nobody but my father had been in the shop, from the time the prisoner left till I missed it—last Monday week I saw him in the street—(I had seen him frequently before this)—I went up to him—he ran away—I called "Stop thief," and he said he would kill me if I did not hold my noise—my father afterwards joined me in pursuit of him, and he was se<lb></lb>cured—he said he did not know our shop, and denied having been there—I am certain it was him—I did not notice the watch while he was in the shop—he looked towards where I had hung it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Emsbury, of Hill-street. On 8th Feb. the deceased, John Dean, came to live in the same house that I lived in—I heard a child crying that evening, and heard the rumbling of chairs and tables—soon afterwards the deceased came down<lb></lb>stairs—he was called back by his wife—he went out—his hand was loosely tied up—I saw them on the Monday following—they appeared on good terms.—I saw her on the Tuesday and Wednesday, and asked her how her hus<lb></lb>band was—she said he was very ill, his hand was very bad, there was strong inflammation—she told me he was beating the child which was cry<lb></lb>ing, and she had a fork in her hand getting her supper, and she aimed the fork, but whether she aimed it at him or not she did not know, but she did it for the protection of her child, and it went into his lefthand—on Saturday, the 16th, I saw the deceased; he appeared very bad—they left the house that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin Edward Denham, of 1, Hill-street, St. Luke's. On 8th Feb., the prisoner and her husband came to reside in that house—on that evening, between ten and twelve o'clock, I was on the stairs, and heard the deceased say he would show his father his hand—the prisoner said she would show the child's head where he had been beating it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the East London Dispensary. On 12th Feb. I was called to the deceased, and found a punctured wound about an inch below the joint of the forefinger of the lefthand—there was a great deal of inflammation extending up the arm, and a great deal of low fever with constitutional disturbance, delirium, and a very weak pulse—he died on the Sunday following, eight days after it happened—the wound was the primary cause, but the low fever was the immediate cause of death—a fork would produce the wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called on by the parish authorities of Shoreditch to make a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the body of John Dean, on 24th Feb.—I found an abscess on the back of the lefthand, which had been opened, the inflammation from which had spread up the left arm—the body generally was healthy—the brain and lungs were somewhat congested—putting aside the puncture of the finger, I saw nothing directly to account for death—I consider it resulted from low fever, resulting from the inflammatory symptoms from the punctured wound in a nervous temperament.</p>

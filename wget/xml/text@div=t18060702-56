               <p>Q.(to prosecutrix) How came you to take this man without a character. - A.

               <p>Q.(to Macbride) Now young woman you got up at seven o'clock in the morning, you found the door open, you looked in the parlour and found the things were gone. - A. Yes, when I went down I found the adjoining room open, I went down into the kitchen, and the kitchen window was open, I went up stairs and alarmed the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you find at home. - A.All the family, the lady and gentlemen were in bed, and Mr. Reynolds the other gentleman, he was in bed, the servant came down at the same time with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she lay in the same room with you. - A. No, in the next room to me, I heard her get up and come down.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that the kitchen window was fastened that night. - A. I am sure it was fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing any person in the house to have taken this property, and to have gone out of the door, it would have been unnecessary to have opened the kitchen window. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any appearance of the window being broke. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sash up. - A. I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Then for what you know it may have been up. - A. It may.</p>
               <p>Q. On any persons coming in at that window they might have shut the sash after them though they did not put the shutters up, I suppose you are a hard working girl, you generally sleep the night through. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore any body coming up the stairs, they might have gone down again without your knowing it. - A. They might.</p>
               <p>One of the jury. Were the shutters on the outside or within. - A. The shutters were on the inside fastened with a bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then a person on the outside could not have opened these shutters. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any appearance of any body coming in at the window. - A. No, the window shutter was open enough to give light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body examine the window. - A. I do not think they did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your lordship, in the first place my taking the name of Preston, was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020041"></xptr>not in any way to commit any fraud, but merely from embarrassed circumstances; I solemnly declare that when I went out I pulled to the street door after me, I went out of town not with any view of defrauding the prosecutrix, neither did I know any thing of it at the time; I knew not of the robbery till such times I was accused by the prosecutrix, I had no other intent than to pay the lady for the lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutrix) Did not he pay for the lodging. - A. No, I received half a crown earnest when he took the lodging, the lodging was eleven shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The lady said I might pay it monthly, I was expecting remittances, I actually did send her a letter, saying I was obliged to go out of town, and that I meant to send her the money</p>
               <p>One of the jury. What led you to discover him in prison. - A. In consequence of information I received he was in prison for an offence he had committed two years ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I hope the honourable court will not suffer this to prejudice my case, I was in there for debt; there was a gentleman called there that morning; when I came down stairs I found the door had been unbolted, and that somebody had been out.</p>

            . Mr. Reynolds, the gentleman that I said before was our lodger, intended that morning to go by the Bath coach at three o'clock; this man undertook to call him, which he did, he came down stairs to speak to his friend, he told me that he only bolted the door, he was too ill to go to Bath, he returned to bed again; he is a man of fortune and of great respectability.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q.(to the servant.) Whether I have not called you up several times to go to your sweetheart. - A. He has called me when I wanted to get up at six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. She is a married woman, therefore it is not likely.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. From my embarrassed circumstances it has not been in my power to have brought forward witnesses to my character; my reason for stopping away was I was every moment expecting to be arrested, I went to Gravesend, I was ashamed to send to any body to let them know the situation I was in; during all the time I was in that house, the house was totally free and open for me; if so be I had a bad intent, why go out in that manner, I might have gone when they had been out to the play, as the house was totally open.</p>

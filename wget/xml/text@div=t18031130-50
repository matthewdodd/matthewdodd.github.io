               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her before the 3d of November? - A. Not that I know of. On the 3d of November she came to my shop between one and two o'clock in the day; when she came in, she asked for a yard and a quarter of edging; when I opened the box, the first piece at the top of the box I shewed her; she said it was for a baby's cap she wanted it, and that was not the right sort; I went on, and shewed her some more; I desired her to lay that by, and she would look over them, and see if there were any she liked better; I shewed her another, and so on, till I looked partly over the whole box; upon putting them back into the box, she laid hold of a broad card of lace, and behind the broad card I saw her drop two cards of lace into her lap as she sat by the side of the counter; when I had seen her do that, I put my lace all up except these two cards of lace; when she had concealed it, she said, I will have a yard and a quarter of that, pointing to that which I at first shewed her; I then put all the lace away into the box except this card; I cut her a yard and a quarter; a man came to the door begging, and she pretended to put her hand to her pocket to give him a halfpenny, and concealed the lace; she got up, she said she had no change, and asked me what the edging would come to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her put it in her pocket? - A. Yes, I saw the edging, and she put it in her pocket; she laid three shillings and sixpence down, and I gave her three-pence in change; she then went to the door, and gave the man a halfpenny, or some halfpence; I made up her parcel, and gave it her, and then she went out of the threshold of the door into the street; I went round the corner as quick as I could to follow her; I told her she had got a couple of cards of my lace, taking hold of her at the same time; I brought her back, and when she came in, I gave a signal for assistance, by knocking my foot upon the shop-floor; my wife and daughter came up; my daughter, who is here, saw her drop them; I did not see them myself; my daughter shewed them me when she picked them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your daughter pick them up from the same side of the counter that you stood to serve her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say you saw her slip two cards of lace into her lap behind the broad card, are you perfectly clear of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you stand on the same side the counter at the time you were serving her that she was? - A. She was on one side of the counter, and I on the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. And the property when it was found, was found on the other side where you had been standing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many things on the counter at the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were serving in the shop? - A. Only myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a good deal of lace in the box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sold any lace of the same quality that you have been describing off the same card? - A. Not that day.</p>
               <p>Q. But before? - A. Yes, it might be a month or two months before.</p>
               <p>Q. You got possession of this lace again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sell any more of it afterwards? - A. Not any of the lace that was stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are quite sure of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had this lace? - A. Some months.</p>
               <p>Q. A year perhaps? - A. No, one card I think I have not had above three months, and the other six or seven.</p>
               <p>Q. What would you give for them? - A. One I gave one shilling and sixpence a yard for; I had one from the maker, and the other was part of a bankrupt's stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many yards there are? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You never sold any of it afterwards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor shewed it for sale to any body? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am daughter to the last witness: On the 3d of November my father knocked against the shop floor; I ran up before my mother; the prisoner was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father had hold of her? - A. No, he stood close by her; I ran behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go at your father's bidding? - A. No, I went of myself; I went behind the counter, and saw two cards of lace lying on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you found them was where your father usually stood to serve the goods? - A. Yes; I picked them up, and shewed them to my father; the prisoner said, my father had thrown them there; my father said, these were the cards which she had taken; that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You found the cards of lace on the side on which your father usually stands? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether they had fell there or not you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mother came up afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your mother say, she believed they had fell from the counter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180311300027"></xptr>Court. Q. (To Gander.) Did she go out of the shop? - A. She had got off the threshold; I took hold of her arm, and desired her to come in, which she did; I was then behind her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if she put her hand in her pocket you must have seen her? - A. In my flurry I did not see her; there is a counter on the right and another on the left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe her throw any thing over the counter, or use any action that looked like throwing any thing over the counter? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. She was in your sight the whole time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think the lace is worth to you? - A. The one that I bought of the bankrupt's stock is worth two pounds five shillings; the other about sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for these nine yards yourself? - A. It is worth five shillings a yard; I cannot say how much I gave for it; I bought it with other different patterns.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. He said before the Magistrate that he had shewed some of this lace for sale after I was taken up, and the Justice told him he should not have shewn it.</p>
               <p>Gander. I never had such a question put to me; I never did say so.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. On which side did you see her put the lace into her pocket? - A. On the left side.</p>
               <p>Q. And the lace was found behind the right hand counter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

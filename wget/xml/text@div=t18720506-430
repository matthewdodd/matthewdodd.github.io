I am clerk to Mr. Clifton, and live at Romford—I produce a presentment of a Jury summoned from the body of the county in August, 1860—I also produce the schedule of lands benefited by the Commission, dated 10th August, 1860—those lands are rateable to the Commission—there is a plan referred to in the schedule—an application was made to the Court by the defendant by letter—this is it. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 28th December, 1869, from the defendant to Mr. Clifton, forwarding a plan of a proposed wharfage to be made by him at the Bow Bridge Saw Mills, explaining its nature, and requesting that the necessary application be made to the Commissioners to enable him to carry it out.</hi>) That application was made to the Commissioners—I am referring to the minute-book of the Commis<lb></lb>sioners—it is not written by me—it is merely to refresh my memory—I can speak without it—the application was made at the next Court, on 22nd April, 1870—it is mentioned in this book—the Court made an order on that application, which is contained in this order-book. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "That Joseph Willmott forthwith remove the brick wall from, and reinstate the common sewer, and forthwith remove the piling from the river wall, the same having been placed there without the knowledge or consent of the Court of Sewers; and that he also make a proper thoroughfare for the Marsh bailiff and his assistants.") I believe notice was given to the defen<lb></lb>dant of that order—the facts were again brought before the Commissioners on 28th October—this is the entry: "That Joseph Willmott remove the timber and other impediments on the river wall, and make proper thoroughfare for the Marsh bailiff and his assistants"—There is a further order in the following April—the Courts are generally held half-yearly—there is a report in the minute-book of 3rd March, 1871: "Major Seward and Mr. G. L. Howard having made their report and presented a trespass on the river wall and common sewer, it was proposed by Mr. Howard, seconded by Rev. A. Hill, That instructions be given to Carter, the Marsh bailiff, to remove the obstruction, the work to be carried out under the supervision of the Commissioners' surveyor; 'whereupon the above propo<lb></lb>sition was put to the meeting and carried unanimously"—then the order of 21st April, 1871, is: "That Joseph Willmott remove the obstructions from</p>

Mr. Howard is a Magistrate—I believe I was present on 16th February when Mr. Willmott was before the Magis<lb></lb>trate on this charge—Mr. Howard did not sit on the bench—I won't be positive that Mr. Seward was there that day—the Rev. Mr. Hill is a clergy<lb></lb>man in an adjoining parish—he has no property near the place that I am aware of—Mr. Nathaniel Beardmore was the surveyor to the Commissioners on 3rd March, 1871—there are two Mr. Beardmores—the elder one was the surveyor to the Commissioners, and is the person referred to in the order of 3rd March—I believe he is also surveyor to the River Lea trustees—I cannot tell you whether Mr. Howard was present on each occasion, the 22nd April, 28th October, and 21st April—he was frequently at the Court—the names appear in the order-book. (<hi rend="italic">The order-book being referred to, Mr. Howard's name appeared on 22nd April and 28th October, 1870, but not 21st April, 1871.</hi>) I am not aware of any trace in the minute-book of any answer to Mr. Willmott's letter of 28th December, 1869—I have not the plan referred to in that letter—I believe it was returned, with the line of wharfing as allowed by the Court marked upon it—I saw it before the Com<lb></lb>missioners, with the alternative lines that Mr. Beardmore had marked—I can't say that I saw it again—I cannot refer to any notice being taken by direction of the Commissioners in reply to the application of 28th December, 1869. (<hi rend="italic">Upon reference to the minute-book, it appeared that on 27th February, 1870, no business was transacted, there being no quorum; and on 11th April the defendant appeared personally, pursuant to a summons against him for committing a trespass on the Millmeads Common Sewer, when Mr. Benton applied on his behalf for permission to erect a wharf, etc., on the river wall; but as it appeared that he had already commenced the work, the application was ordered to stand over till the next Commission, Mr. Benton, in the meantime, undertaking that nothing further should be done. On 22nd April, 1870, "it was resolved to grant permission for the work to be carried out, provided Mr. Willmott adopted the line of wharfing recommended by the surveyor, tinted red, the work to be done under his superintendence, all costs being borne by the applicant".</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer, carrying on business at 30, Great George Street, Westminster—I am surveyor of the Commissioners of Sewers for the Havering level—I recollect generally a presentment by a jury of the lands benefited by the Commission—I have all the plans here—I know the place well—the land occupied by the defendant is shown in this plan, No. 96 in High-meads level—it abuts on the river wall, which abuts on a branch of the Lea—I was present at the Court of 11th April, 1870 when Mr. Willmott's application was made—he sent in a plan—I think the Court referred it to me, and I afterwards made the red line referred to in a subsequent order; that line cut off a considerable portion of what he proposed to do with his wharf, I should think 6 ft.; his projected 6 ft. further out into the river; they were all on the old conservancy wall; although it is called a wall, it is not a vertical wall, it is a bank—his plan would tend considerably to narrow the water way at a place where there is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187205060059"></xptr>
               <p>an angle on the opposite side; but the main reason for the Commissioners to be careful of it was that this river has a drain from the lands coming into it, and any obstructions into the river passed the water back into that sewer—in my judgment, the plan as proposed by him would have been a mischief to the river wall and to the drainage of the marsh generally—the two things are mixed up—permission was given in the way described; he was to be allowed to do it, but in my line, not in his—on 27th January I accompanied Major Seward and Mr. Howard to inspect the grievance—I found that the wharfing had been completed in his fashion instead of the other line; there was a sewer at the back which, was the common sewer, and he had taken possession of half that sewer and built a wall there as a boundary to his premises, and in the other half he had put a pipe, and it was partially filled up, I think; there had been an interference with the common sewer, which is a wide ditch and rather a useful one, because in times of flood it stores the water, and prevents its going over the lands—I think the effect of what he had done was to increase the risk of floods there, but at the same time, subject to the Commissioners' orders, an apparatus, was put in—I did not consent to it as it was done; in fact, it was taking the sewer off his land and putting it on other people's, as it were—the piles of the wharf were not advanced in front of the river wall at the foot, they were at the top; the line was 10 ft. out, I think, and it should have been 4 ft.; it was 6 ft. too far out—in the state in which he had left it, it was not possible for the marsh bailiff to examine the river wall properly; it was all covered with timber and bricks and everything; in fact, there was no passage there at all; he had erected a crane, and I think piles were driven in, and so on, to erect an apparatus for unloading—I was unwell at the time of the assault, and sent my son—afterwards, on 1st June, I had an interview with Mr. Willmott, with the marsh bailiff and Mr. Howard—there was a good deal of conversation about this line, and how little we could take away of the wharf, so as not to destroy good work; but it has never been done to my satisfaction to this day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I have been surveyor to the Havering Sewers Commissioners since April, 1860, but I have knows this place a good deal longer than that—I was engineer to the Lea trustees, and I am now consulting engineer, I don't take an active part—I am a salaried officer of the Lea Conservancy Board—I ceased to be the ordinary engineer about the beginning of last year, and a resident engineer was appointed, Mr. Forbes—it must have been before the end of 1869 that Mr. Willmott took his lease of the land where the wharf was erected—I should think I saw him before a single pile was driven in—I daresay I represented myself to him as the engineer to the Lea Conservancy: I told him he had got to write to two parties and that the Commissioners of the Level preferred having the Lea Conservancy approve of the frontage—he was to write to both—this letter which has been read is evidently written by Mr. Willmott—I did not give him the draft of the letter he was to send, I only advised him to make the application—in April, 1870, the Court recommended that I should have a meeting with the parties; the wharf was not made in April, it was in Pro<lb></lb>gress; there have been so many acts and meetings about it; I met Mr. Will<lb></lb>mott and his solicitor, or some gentleman acting for him—the piles were not all driven in before the latter end of April; some piles were driven, and if they had acceded to our plan then there would have been nothing to undo—this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) looks like the place, I find the projection of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187205060060"></xptr>
               <p>the bank marked 10 ft. 6 in., the indentation shown here opposite the lime works is like that of the ordnance map of 1869, or nearly so, as far as this extends—this photograph (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) appears to me to represent the wharf correctly; it shows the foot of the conservancy wall, some has been cut away and some left; it is well within the exposed ground, it is on the wall, your piling is driven into the conservancy wall, it is the river wall—Mr. Willmott complained that the water from the open ditch percolated through to his sawpits; my impression is that the complaint was that he had put his boiler too low, and at flood time the water swelled up into the boiler—I don't know that I discussed with him whether he should put 12 in. or 9 in. pipes into the ditch; there very likely was a talk about that when he began to build the wall in the ditch, and I very likely said that 9 in. pipes were not big enough; we certainly should not have allowed less than 12 in.; I think he did afterwards put in 12 in. pipes, but not by my consent, because I pro<lb></lb>tested that the whole thing was done entirely without our consent, I had no right to allow such a thing—the wall and the ditch are two different things—I am not aware that the adjoining owner, who alone could be affected by the open ditch, consented to what Mr. Willmott did, and was anxious himself to put it up—I don't know who the adjoining owner is: a tenant of his, Mr. Barber, said he did not object to it, but I have no right to listen to the tenant—I don't know that the owner consented; I don't know that Mr. Barber did; he said he did not mind it, or something of that kind—the ditch is a public sewer, it brings water from above as well as from the two places occupied by Mr. Willmott and Mr. Barber—I certainly am not aware that that ditch has been stopped up for years; the very reverse, it has been open; I have ascertained that as a fact—I did not say that it has had communication with other grounds than Barber's and Willmott's; I think it goes along Mr. Barber's, and I think there are other grounds above Mr. Willmott's, but irrespective of that, it has to take off in flood time water that affects other people above: it is not tidal water, it is dammed up by the tide when it rises—I don't say that the tide rises up to Willmott's wall; it is not above a lock, so as to be unaffected by the tide, it is under high water and it is affected by the tide, and if the trap is left open the tide does go in, but not as flowing: I mean in the cut where the wharf is, it is all tidal, and it is an excessively troublesome thing; if that wharf had any trifling hole in it at any time the tide would go over the land—I have at times seen the water so low that the old piling was seen at the bottom of the river—I should say those old piles were from 2 to 5 feet beyond the new piling, but that is down below, it is not a high erection like this, it was done for a different thing—we wanted it 6 ft. instead of 6 ft. 10 in., and I think there had been a little compromise even then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Since this alleged interference was committed, in April, 1871, have you not, acting for the Commissioners, agreed that by rounding off the wharf, and putting 12 in. pipes into the ditch, you would be satisfied? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think so, by taking the ordinary 30 ft. length, taking off 4 ft. instead of 6 ft.; but that was a conversation, I think, in June last year—it is not within my cognizance that it was put in writing, and that the Commissioners wanted 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for costs, and Mr. Willmott only wanted to pay 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am not aware of that fact—we had a very great deal of discussion—I was most anxious to settle it amicably, and I thought it was settled at that time.</p>

               <p>and I coaxed and tried particularly—there was to be a plate put on the ditch that we might have the power of opening or removing the ditch at any time, for I felt myself, as an engineer, rather at fault whether the ditch should be closed at all on account of the flood—I don't know why the negotiation went off, for the interview came quite to an amicable end, and I thought we should never hear of the matter again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were the surveyor directed to supervise what the marsh bailiff did when he went on the land forcibly to destroy the wall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was—I never went on 19th April, I was too unwell to go, but I gave strict directions, both to the marsh bailiff and to my son—I was there by deputy, my son went for me—I think Mr. Willmott afterwards gave the marsh bailiff access, perhaps you had better ask him—I know I was myself very much obstructed by the piles and bricks and mass of things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There were piles of bricks put on the wall, and a crane and pieces of timber—I could not get through very often—I was willing to allow a certain width of surface coming clown on the river wall, but not so much as he has put—the thing I thought would be right to allow would come further in shore, so that we could get to examine and repair the bottom of the wall; but the great thing was to get a line that would admit of the water going off when in flood, because the lands suffer very much then—the narrowing of that part of the river tends to throw up the water, because the wharfing takes up a space in the river, although it makes what is left stronger—besides being a surveyor, I have been an engineer, man and boy, for forty-five years, almost—in my judgment this was an impedi<lb></lb>ment to the free passage of the water for sewage purposes—the other matter in the ditch was also certainly an impediment, but the Com<lb></lb>missioners are bound to suit circumstances, and they allow certain things—they endeavour as well as they can to accommodate individuals in dis<lb></lb>charging their duties, so long as they do not let them obstruct—the wharf has not been removed, and things remain as they were—then has never been any other wharf except this that the defendant has erected in that part.</p>

I am Marsh bailiff of the Commissioners, and was so at the time these entries were made, in 1870 and 1871—I recollect the presentment of the Marsh Jury on 22nd April, 1870—three trespasses of the defendant were brought before the Marsh Jury, the wharf, the obstruc<lb></lb>tion to inspection by the officers, and the building of the wall in the sewer—I can't say whether I served the order made by the Commissioners upon that, I have served a good many, but I can't say upon what date I served one—I remember the survey by the Commissioners and the engineer in January last, and I remember the order to remove being made on the 3rd of March—I served a notice, and in consequence of the order not being obeyed I went on 19th April to the defendant's premises where this wharf is—I went about 8 o'clock in the morning, and worked till noon—the men who were with me then went away to dinner, on their return a general melee ensued—I had seven men with me—a force of some twenty or thirty persons came and objected to our going on the premises; the defendant was there; he ordered his men to keep us at bay, not to allow us to enter on the premises—they had in their hands such things as you would find in a timber-yard, little bits of timber—I went in and spoke to the defendant, and he told me that he should not allow the men to come on—he knew I was the marsh bailiff, we had had several conversations, I did not attempt</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187205060064"></xptr>
               <p>to get my men on; threats were used to the men when they attempted to enter; perhaps that continued a quarter of an hour; the threats were "D—you, you shan't come in"—that was all I heard on that occasion—after a while I took my men away—we went by land that day; next day, the 20th we went again, by a barge, about 8 o'clock or from that to 9 o'clock in the morning—I went in obedience to the order to remove the wharf—we fastened our barge to the timbers of the wharf the time occupied in doing so gave the defendant sufficient time to collect this same mob that we had met the day previous, and a few more added to their numbers; they had things in their hands, one had a handspike which he put within an inch of my nose—the defendant was on the wharf, directing the operations—he said to the man with the handspike "Knock him down," and it was upon that that the man put it at my head—this continued for some few minutes, during which time Mr. Willmott ordered the people to fetch hammers and chisels, and they attempted to cut our fastenings from the wharf, and then I thought it was time to retire, and I gave orders to go away—I could not enumerate the whole of the threats—I think I have already used one, "Knock his d—head off"—in consequence of this opposition I could not do what I was sent to do; nor was I able to inspect the wall; the timber had been piled on the footway of the wall—on 21st April I reported to the Court what had happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can't tell what tools we took with us on the 19th—we carried such things as were necessary to remove a wharf, an axe, a saw, chisels, spades, I don't know how many more, crow bars most likely—we dug out the earth at the corner of the wharf, we worked till noon—we removed the ground, and the planking at the back of the ground, so that it was brought into the condition represented in this photograph (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) we worked from 8 o'clock till 12, or thereabouts—I think I called at the police-station in the morning and asked for assistance—they did not go with me, the policeman came on the ground possibly after we had been there an hour, and looked on for another hour and then went away—we then went to dinner, and when we came back Mr. Willmott said we should not go upon his property; he let me in, but would not let my men in—I don't know how many men he had there, beyond a dozen certainly—I don't remember that there was any policeman there then—next day I took with me one or two more men than the day before—we did not begin to cut away the wharf—I have mentioned about the handspike before to-day—properly built, the wharf would strengthen the bank of the river; it does not now, in as much as the filling in is of a loose nature, and the tide would leak through the wall—I say that the work is not properly done; if it was properly done it would be a positive protection to the bank; the loose portion is at the point where my men were disturbing the wharf—what they did has not loosened the protection of the bank—I say that the putting up of this wharf has facilitated the incursion of the water, in as much as the water would follow the passage of the ties driven through it—the land behind is very nearly as high as the wharf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Narrowing the water way in the way this is done would, in flood seasons, prevent the water escaping so freely.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go to this wall that is built across the sewer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and pulled part of it down on the morning of the 19th—it ran along the sewer so as to divide it into two parts, not across it—we were prevented</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187205060065"></xptr>
               <p>from pulling the remainder down by the interference of the defendant and his men—12 in. pipes have been put in there, parallel with the wall.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went, on the morning of the 19th, you walked freely on to the place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We did—we have had keys of the gates since the defendant has had occupation—I have never been denied access—ties have been run from the front line of the bank to the rear—I say a wharf is an improvement, but I don't say that these ties pat through this in an improvement to the bank, on the contrary; a wharf well built is an im<lb></lb>provement.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that the indictment cold not be sustained, inasmuch as the Commissioners of Sewers had exercised an authority which they did not lawfully possess. The Act of 1868 (31 &amp; 32 Vict. e. 154, which created, the Lea Conservancy Board, had defined their boundaries in section 3. The locus in quo was dearly within the jurisdiction of that body, and they had given no notice to the defendant, or taken any proceedings. Whether the Commissioners of Sewers ever had any powers on or over the bank of the Lea or not, the Con<lb></lb>servancy Act of 1868 had repealed all those powers, and vested them in the Con<lb></lb>servancy Board, who had made bye-laws for the purpose, He further submitted that, even if that Act did not repeal the former Acts, there was an express exemption of the water in question from the jurisdiction of the Commissioners of Sewers by their own General Act</hi>, 3 &amp; 4 <hi rend="italic">Will. IV.</hi>, <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 22, <hi rend="italic">s</hi> 10. <hi rend="italic">With re<lb></lb>gard to the ditch, he contended that it was not a common sewer within the proper meaning of that term, but a watercourse. There was, therefore, no authority in the marsh bailiff to go upon what was private property, and to resisting him the defendant had committed no offence.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DENMAN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">contended that the jurisdiction of the Commissioners of Sewers was not ousted by the Lea Conservancy Act; no statutes were held to repeat other statutes unless they were inconsistent with each other, and it perfectly consistent that each of these bodies might have jurisdiction for their own particular purposes, the Sewers Commissioners over the walls and banks of the river, and the Lea Conservancy over the water. As to the ditch, the term "sewer" was not intended to apply to a place through which sewage passed, but to any channel which carried away the flood water. The Commissioners had a dear authority under the statute to prostrate any obstruction, and to take any necessary steps for that purpose; and in resisting, the defendant was liable under this indictment.</hi>

                  </hi>: <hi rend="italic">I am dearly of opinion that there is no ouster of the jurisdiction of these Commissioners. The objects of the two bodies are entirely deferent; the object of the Conservators is to maintain and improve the navigation of a navigable river, the object of the Commissioners of Sewers, is to maintain the drainage of the district; and unless there is an absolute inconsistency between the two statutes under which they are acting, the two map be construed together, each body discharging under them their own peculiar functions. In this case the Commissioners of Sewers had authority to interfere with a wharf and wall which interrupted and disturbed the efficiency of the rivulet as an open drain to carry off the water. I am, therefore, clearly of opinion that the Commissioners of Sewers have jurisdiction over the locus in quo, and in the exercise of their proper authority they were proceeding to do what they were obstructed in doing. Whether the erection of the wharf was an improvement or not, or whether the Commissioners exercised a right judgment or not, has nothing to do with the question; it is a misdemeanour at common law to obstruct persons having proper authority to remove.</hi>

The facts were all one way; and the case resolved itself into a question of law, which could be settled in the Court of Queen's Bench.</hi>

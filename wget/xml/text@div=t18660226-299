I am the prisoner's wife; he is a shoemaker—we live in a room at No. 10, Quaker-street, Spitalfields—a man named Tuck lives in the same room—on the 15th February, I and the prisoner went out together in the morning, and came back about 4 o'clock—I had had some words with him during the day, and the quarrel was continued when we got home—Tuck was in the room at the time—I had been in some public-houses with my husband—we had been drinking a little, but I was not the worse for liquor—he said he would do for me some of these days, and he then attacked me with a knife, which he got from the seat where he used to sit at work—I did not see that he had it in his hand at the time—he had not resumed his work—he took hold of me and forced me to the ground, and my head went betwixt the bed and the iron stove—he put the knife to my throat, and I put my hand up to save myself, and received a stab in the hand—before that, I had received a slight stab in my throat—I had a slight scratch on my chin, which has got better—the other wounds have not proved dangerous—Tuck went for a constable—I have been married to the prisoner about four years—we have no children alive—nothing of this sort has ever occurred before—he is a sober husband—I am sober, and do not get into scrapes at public-houses—the origin of this was, we had a few words in the street, because I spoke to my mother—they have tried to part us several times.</p>

I occupy the same room as the prisoner and his wife—on 15th February, I was at home at about 4 o'clock, when they came in—they were wrangling, and that continued for some time, when all at once he laid hold of her by her clothes, and pulled her down—I did not think he meant anything serious until I saw blood coming from her throat—I called to the neighbours to go for a constable—they said they could not, and I told them to remain there while I went for one—I went as quickly as I could, and brought one—the prisoner did not seem to be worse for liquor than usual—I have always seen him before in sober circumstances—I picked up the knife, and as soon as I did so he said, "That's my knife; that's what I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it with"—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. The cause of the quarrel was this: I gave her some money to go and get dinner with, and instead of doing so, she went with her mother to a public-house and spent the money in drink. She came to me then, and told me she had got the dinner ready; I went home expecting to have it, and found none. We began quarrelling, and my seat got knocked over with the tools; I did not pull her down; I had the knife in my hand, and had not the least idea of doing it. Twelve months to<lb></lb>day, our child died; it was two years and eight months old, and I had to carry it back<lb></lb>wards</p>

               <p>and forwards to my work, four miles every day, before we came up to London; then my wife went away with a shopmate of mine, a wooden<lb></lb>legged man, and went to live with him—after that she went to live with another man; then she went to live with the witness Tuck. I happened to meet her, and she promised to go on better, and came down into the country to live with me again, and went on very well till Christmas, when she came up again.</p>

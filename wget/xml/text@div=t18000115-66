               <p>- LAMBERT sworn. - I am son of the last witness: There were a great quantity of kegs hanging up outside the door; the prisoner coming by, took up one of them and went away with it, and went as far as Mincing-lane with it; I did not see him take it, but I saw him with it upon his shoulder in Mincing-lane, I was in pursuit of him; I had been informed that he had taken one of the kegs; I asked him where he was going with it; he said he did not know where he was going; he begged my pardon, and said he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be in liquor? - A. I thought rather so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he appear to know what he was about at all? - A. No; I sent for a constable, and our lad carried the keg back to our house, I was with him at the time; the constable has got it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe you know Mr. Church? - A. Yes.</p>

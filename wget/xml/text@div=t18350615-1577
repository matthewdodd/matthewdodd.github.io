                  </hi>. I live in Nelson-street, Camberwell. On Saturday, the 23rd of May, about half-past one o'clock, I was going home from my pay table—I work at Wapping—I was going down Nelson-street—within six or seven doors of my own lodging, I saw two men standing between me and the footway, which is very narrow—I went out in the road to pass them—one of them jumped across and collared me—the prisoners are the two men I saw, I am pefectly sure—I am a little short-sighted—Mills stepped across to me, collared me, and pulled me into the footway where the other man was—he asked me, who I was—I said, "A friend"—I had a bundle under my arm, and a crown-piece in my right-hand pocket, and sixpence in copper—I had half-a-sovereign in my left-hand waistcoat pocket, sewed up by itself—Mills asked me whether I was English or Irish—I said, "Irish"—he said, "B—t the Irish, I don't like them"—he told me then to give him a shilling and he would let me go—I told him I had no shilling about me, no more I had; and as I would not give him the shilling—I was facing him, he turned my face away, came behind me, and gave me a blow with his fist on the <hi rend="italic">pole</hi> of the head, and sent me reeling into the road—I was striving to get up, and when I got my senses I cried out "Murder," for I was out of my senses, when he knocked me at first—he knocked me out of my senses—when I cried "Murder," he ran and knocked me down again, gave me two or three <hi rend="italic">pelts</hi>, and said if I spoke another word out of my lips, I should be murdered on the spot—I do not know what the other man did while I was down; but when I got up they were both standing together over me—I told them I would not speak a word at all if they would let me go with my life—I did not care what they did, so that they let me go with my life—they then let me go—I lost a bundle—I do not know whether they took it or not—I lost it when they knocked me down at first—they remained on the spot a little after I got up, and I ran away towards my lodgings—when I had run a little bit from them, I put my hand in my pocket, and my crown-piece and some of the coppers were gone—to the best of my knowledge I heard them feeling in my pocket, but I do not know whether they took any thing out, but I lost the crown-piece, threepence in copper, and the things that were in the bundle—the halfpence and crown were loose in my pocket—they might have tumbled out—I ran away directly I got up—I did not stop to look for my bundle.</p>

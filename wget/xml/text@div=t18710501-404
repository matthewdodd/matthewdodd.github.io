I am the wife of Joseph Hadley Riddell, an engineer, of 155, Cheapside—about 3.30 on Wednesday after<lb></lb>noon, 19th April, I was walking down the Poultry—the prisoner jostled me on my left-hand side—he then came in front of me, so as to block the path completely—suddenly he ran under the horses' heads across the Poultry—I put my hand in my pocket, and found my purse was gone—I had had it safe within a minute before—I ran after the prisoner—a police<lb></lb>officer spoke to me, and asked if I had lost anything—I told him, and I saw him go up Cheapside after the prisoner—there was about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cheques, in the</p>

               <p>purse, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, a railway ticket, and some memorandums—I gave a description of the man to the inspector at the station, and I afterwards picked him out, when he was placed amongst a number of others—I said at first I believed he was the man, but I should not like to swear to him; I did not see him in a good light, when I saw him in a good light I knew him, and said he was the man.</p>

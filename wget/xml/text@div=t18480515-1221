I took it in, put it down, and told them to execute it; I did not wish to take any of the goods away; Mr. Foster was not in; the youth who served me said he would send for him; I said it was not neces<lb></lb>sary, as the goods were not wanted; he said he would rather send for him; I waited till he came, and he said he remembered something about a similar order before; he sent for a policeman, and gave me in custody; my family are highly respectable, and are acquainted with several gentlemen of high standing; Mr. Anderton, the Common Councilman, said he would be here.</p>

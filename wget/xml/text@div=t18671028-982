               <p>list I was in Waterloo Street, Limehouse, about ten minutes past two; I noticed William Grigg passing to and fro, he then walked to a public-house, give three gentle knocks with his knuckle, and said something through the door which I could not understand—after waiting about two minutes he walked to the rear of the house—I followed him and heard a noise apparently of a side gate opening—when I reached the spot I saw four other men get over the wooden fence at the rear of the house—William Grigg was the nearest, and I took hold of him—the others turned round and said it was all right, and immediately one struck me a blow over my eye—I could not see which it was—they all then ran away, and I followed them for about 150 yards, when I ran Dorsett into the hands of K 330—I was within a few yards of him at the time he was stopped—I then returned to the prosecutor's premises and examined, the back gate, and found a panel had been forced out and an entrance made by removing the bolts—I awoke the prosecutor and went with him into the house—a poker was lying on the sofa, which was broken, and which, as well as the walls, showed that it had been used—the landlord afterwards found a knife—I examined Dorsett and found some matches upon him—the light was clear enough about this time, as all four of the men were near a street lamp—one of the men who came out of the house is not in custody.</p>

Q.</hi> Have you no doubt as to the identity of the prisoners? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; George Grigg was about two yards off me when I noticed him—there was nothing between us—I have not said I could not be certain as to him—I have known him the last two or three years—he had a cap on with a peak to it—the other brother had a low-crowned cap—a "wide-awake"—I had not my bull's-eye, and the only light was the gas-lamp.</p>

            . I am patrol of St. John, Hackney. On the 29th of May, about one o'clock in the morning, I was on duty at the White Lion public-house, Hackneywick, with Brewer, and saw the prisoner in the road, leading a horse by an halter. I asked where he was going with it? he said he was going to turn it into a grass field just by. I asked if it was his own? he said No, that it belonged to his master. I asked who his master was; he said

            , a farmer, who lived close by the Three Colts public-house, at Old Ford. I asked how he came to be out at so unseasonable an hour; he said he had been to town after a load of dung, and was late home. I asked how long he had been in Marsh's service - he said for six months, and that he lodged in his master's house. I took him into custody, and Brewer brought the horse to the watch-house. I inquired, but could find no Mr. Marsh.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Could I be taking the horse anywhere but to grass in that road - A. I do not know - Sutton saw the same horse that morning, and owned it.</p>
               <p>JOHN SUTTON. This horse is mine - my son had turned it out in a field at Old Ford the night before. I was not at home. I found it at Hackney watch-house, about ten o'clock next morning. Reading was present. I have had it four months - it is a grey gelding, and worth 5 l. My son was with me. I am sure it is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it in an inclosed field - A. No, an open place; it is possible that it might have strayed.</p>

            , junior. I put this horse in the field, at the Three Colts public-house, Old Ford, at seven o'clock on Friday evening. I went there again at five in the morning, and missed it. There were other horses there, one of which was my father's; the one missing was a grey one. There is no gate to the field. I went to the watch-house and found it there, and knew it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you leave a halter on it in the field - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>JOHN GARVA. I was constable of the night. The prisoner and gelding were brought to me about one o'clock in the morning. Sutton and his son saw it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Old Ford-lane, and saw the horse straying with the halter on its neck. I was going to take it into the field to grass. I could take it nowhere but to the field, for there is no road to lead any where else.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character</p>

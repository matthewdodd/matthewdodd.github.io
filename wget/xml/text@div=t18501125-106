                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old, and live in North-street, Manchester-square. I was living with a surgeon in the Haymarket. On the evening of 28th Sept. I was in the Bayswater road, about half-past ten o'clock, with my brother, James Atcheson, and Richard Denny—we were walking slowly down the road, towards Notting-hill—we walked by the railing of Hyde-park—we passed the two prisoners, who were standing still—two or three minutes after we passed, Richard Denny stopped to light his pipe—the two prisoners came rushing up, and Smith snatched the pipe from his mouth—Denny pushed him off and asked what he did that for—before we passed them, we had seen the two prisoners walking arm-in-arm, and pushing one another about, as if they were tipsy—that was on the Bayswater-road—after Smith had snatched at Denny's pipe, the policeman came and separated us—we crossed over and walked a little way—we then crossed over again towards Kensington-gardens—we overtook the two prisoners again in four or five minutes—we did not see them till we got very near them—Cody then said, "Now then, you b——rs, us two will fight you"—Denny said no, he would fight the little one, meaning Smith—Smith then ran and hit Denny in the mouth—there was no other blow given—the policeman came and separated us again—we crossed over, and walked slowly up Albion-street—when we got opposite the mews in Albion-street, the two prisoners rushed out of the mews—they said, "There is the b——r that wants to fight"—on that Smith came over and struck Denny in the mouth, and Cody knocked him down—Smith began to kick him on the face and ribs—I ran up and said, "You coward, to kick him like that when he is down"—he said if I did not go off he would serve me the same—my brother and Ateheson went up the street, and Cody was following them up—my brother is younger than I am—I was left alone with Denny—Smith ran towards the others—Denny was lying senseless—I tried to lift him up, but could not—both the prisoners came running back, and as they came across the road I heard Smith say, "Now I will stab half the b—rs"—they came up where I was assisting Denny, and Cody gave me a blow across the eyes—I directly put up my hands before my eyes, and then directly I felt a hard blow in my groin—I felt a shooting pain, and in less than half a minute I felt the blood running down my legs—I cried out that I was stabbed—I reached a step of a door and sat down—I felt faint—a gentleman came to me, and I was carried to Mr. Morgan's surgery in Albion-place—I had my wound dressed, and I was carried in a cab to the Middlesex Hospital—I had no knife in my hand during that evening—I did not see a knife with either of our party.</p>

               <p>he said, "Come on: who is the next one"—I thought he was going to strike James Batchelor—Smith did not say who had the knife—Denny was at that time lying on the ground—Atcheson came down the road, and called for somebody to come and pick him up—I picked him up, and set him against the railings—he could not get up, he was insensible and bleeding from the mouth—I called the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant, and live in St. John's-terrace. Between ten and eleven o'clock on the night of 28th Sept. I was going home—I heard a disturbance and went down Albion-street—as I approached the group I heard the words, "There are four of you b——rs, come on, I can fight you all"—after that I heard Edward Batchelor cry out, "I am stabbed"—I crossed over and picked him up—as I was taking him away Smith came to me and said, "It is the one on the ground (meaning Denny) who has a knife, and he has cut my finger"—he showed me his finger, and there was a little blood on it—I cannot say which hand it was—Edward Batchelor was bleeding very much, I took him to the doctor's.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital. On the night of 28th Sept. Edward Batchelor was brought there—he was faint with collapse and loss of blood—I found a punctured wound in the left groin, as if done with a pointed instrument—there was no hemorrhage from it at the time—it had bled a good deal—I did not try the depth of it for fear of bringing on bleeding again—it was in a highly dangerous situation—I judged it to be a deep wound from the swelling around it—it was not a mere surface wound—I should say it required considerable force to penetrate the clothes and cause such a wound—from the appearance of it externally I should say it had been inflicted by a pointed instrument—a pointed penknife would have done it—it was a small wound, perhaps the eighth of an inch in length, just what a pen-knife would do—a large clasp-knife would have made a much larger wound—it had not been done by a clasp-knife—there was no appearance of a triangular wound—it was such a wound as you would expect from a penknife—it was almost immediately over the main artery of the limb.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Crispin-street, Spitalfields. On Thursday afternoon, 8th September, I was at the terminus of the Blackwall-railway with my sister-in-law, Elizabeth Williams—I got two tickets; paid for them, and replaced my purse, which was a small pocket-book, in my pocket—it contained 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there were a great many persons about—not more than a minute afterwards I felt a hand in my pocket, and saw the prisoner taking his hand away—he was not a yard from the bar where I paid my money—he was by my side when I paid—I saw my purse in his hand and saw him run away with it—I ran after him and cried out—he ran into a water-closet—an officer named Summerfield ran into the water-closet, and I ran back and culled my sister in-law—the policeman and my sister-in-law and I, went in and found the prisoner in the water-closet—the whole thing took not more than five minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you ever seen the prisoner before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—when I called out that I had lost my purse several persons ran, but I did not know them—they came round me, as they do in London—I kept the boy in the water-closet—I lost sight of him for a minute when I ran after my sister-in-law, but she had only gone a little way up the stairs—I saw a policeman in about a minute—we all three went into this place together, and I pointed the prisoner out—there were no more boys there, but there were several gentlemen—I said, "That is the boy."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 533).

                  </hi>. I am a tea-dealer, and live in King William-street, City. The prisoner was a shopman in my service for about seven weeks—in consequence of some suspicions I had, on Saturday the 22nd of June, I sent the witness Meek with a half-sovereign, a crown, and two half-crowns, all marked, to make a purchase at my shop—I examined the till about five minutes after the witness went, and found the two half-crowns and five shilling piece, but no half-sovereign—I sent for a policeman, and called on the prisoner to take the money he had out of his pocket—he produced the marked half-sovereign, and I think a sovereign, and some silver, but I am not quite certain—the officer searched his box, and found 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he took possession of.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday morning, the 22nd of June, at twenty minutes before nine o'clock, went to the prosecutor's shop, at his request—he had previously supplied me with a half-sovereign, a five shilling piece, and two half-crowns—he marked them in my presence—I bought 4lb. weight of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. tea, and paid for it all the money he gave me.</p>

I went to the prosecutor's shop, and saw the prisoner behind the counter—Mr. Hewitt said he suspected his young man had been robbing him—I called him into the counting-house, and requested him to produce what he had in his pocket—he immediately pulled out his money, which consisted of two half-sovereigns, and 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw the till—there was a crown-piece and two half-crowns marked, and several shillings, but no gold—there was about ten or twelve shillings besides the half-crowns—I found 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his box.</p>

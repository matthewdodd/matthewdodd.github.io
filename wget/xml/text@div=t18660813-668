                  </hi>. On 3rd July last I saw prisoner in my house—My wife served him with some gin—it came to 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave a half-crown in payment—she said, "This is bad"—I said I was sure it was—the prisoner said he had been working underground, and had just been paid—I let him have it back—they paid for the beer by subscription and immediately went away—a short time afterwards I went to the till—there was about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the till; five of the shillings were bad—I put them on one side and gave them to the policeman—Mr. Payne came in the evening—I am in the habit of clearing the till every hour—it all depends on business—on that afternoon I didn't clear it for an hour or more—I had given in<lb></lb>structions to my little boy not to change any money larger than a shilling.</p>

I am a grocer—on 3rd July I was at the "Lord Clyde" public-house and saw the little boy there—I told him I could give him change for half-a-crown instead of his calling for his mother to give him change—he gave me the half-crown and I gave him the change—I put the half-crown in my pocket—I had not any other half-crown there—on the same evening I went to the "Lord Clyde" between 10 and 11—I had still got the half-crown in my pocket—I had 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, but no other half-crown—I never saw the half-crown till I took it out at the "Lord Clyde"—it was a bad one—I marked it—I gave it to the policeman—I took the half-crown from the little boy—I didn't see it laid down by the prisoner.</p>

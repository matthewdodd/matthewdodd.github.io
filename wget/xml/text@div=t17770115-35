               <p>I am a surgeon to then Middlesex Hospital.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any thing of this Weaver being brought in there? - He was brought in on the night of Christmas-day; he had received two wounds, one in the thigh, the other on the right-side; I examined them both particularly that night and the following day, but I could not perceive that the wound had penetrated into the cavity of the chest, and the wound of the thigh was very insignificant; I examined the wound of the side most particularly, but could not by any means perceive that it had penetrated into the cavity of the chest.</p>
               <p>The man died in the hospital, he was there eleven days? - Thirteen days.</p>
               <p>What was the cause of his death? - I imagine from the sever he took after he came into the hospital.</p>
               <p>Did you sever proceed from the wound? - I don't believe it did.</p>
               <p>Then you don't conceive that the wound was the cause of his death? - I don't.</p>
               <p>Did you attend to open the body before the coroner? - Yes; he was three days in the hospital in a very good way, on the fourth day he was seized with a fever, from which time he was under the care of a physician; I found he had such a disease upon him as would have killed him soon if he had not come into the hospital.</p>
               <p>What disease was that? - A disease in his lungs; the lungs had a great adhesion and a vast quantity of matter in them; I opened him the next day after he died.</p>
               <p>What do you believe was the cause of his death? - A sever, and an inflammation of his lungs.</p>
               <p>The matter in the lungs collected there you think was the cause of the sever? - I do.</p>
               <p>COURT. The sever is called the hospital sever, is it not? - No, I don't take it to be the hospital sever; but that sever would have come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177701150034"></xptr> on without that; his liver was very much diseased too.</p>
               <p>Then in your judgment upon your oath, neither of the wounds were the cause of his death? - No.</p>
               <p>From the Jury. Was there any other surgeon that examined the body besides you? - Two other gentlemen were present.</p>
               <p>Were they of the same opinion? - Exactly.</p>

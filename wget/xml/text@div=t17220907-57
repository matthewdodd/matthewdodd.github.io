Two other Soldiers depos'd, that the Deceas'd said he thought his Heart was beat into his Throat; he spit Blood an Hour after, and often said he believed that blow would be his death; and if it was, he'd lay his death to the prisoner. - Sparrier, and - rightly depos'd, that they were exercising at the same time, but saw no blow given: That the prisoner lifted up his Piece, and made an offer to strike, but did not. Harris, the Surgeon, depos'd, that he dy'd of a Fever, attended with a Vomiting and Looseness, which proceeded from Cold, it being a very common Distemper in the Camp. That there was no sign of a Bruise outwardly, and when he opened the Body, no extravasated Blood; that all the internal Parts were clean, without the least Symptoms of any hurt received from a blow. Several Officers gave the prisoner the Character of being very humane, hardly ever known to be in a Passion, and abuse Men; but was remarkable for his lenity and even Temper.

               <p>HENRY GILLARD. I was at Dumpling Island, on the coast of Labradore, in North America, splitting fishBurnslow, Henley, and Pearse, the deceased, were there. The prisoner called Pearse a great eater. Pearse collared him, gave him a shove, and told him if he did not leave off calling him names, he would give him a hiding. We had knives to cure the fish with. Pearse left the prisoner, who still kept calling him a great eater. Pearse took up the stick (about the size of my finger), and gave the prisoner three or four blows across the shoulder, they did not appear to be very hard. The prisoner said, "If you do that again, I will run you through." Pearse again struck him across the shoulder with the same stick; the prisoner took the knife off the table, and stuck it into his left breast. Pearse said, "Cut away! cut away! I shall die - He has stabbed me!" He fell on his back. We carried him to the house - He died in twenty minutes. The knife was what we used in cutting fish; this is it-(producing it).</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (written). We had been wrangling together - He called me a great eater, knocked me down, and struck me. He came behind me, without my seeing him, and unfortunately received the knife in his body; he said I had killed him. I ran away and hid myself. I have been used cruelly there. I have been heavily ironed, and nearly starved.</p>

I told him I had never done anything, and never saw him to my knowledge, He said, "You have touched my p-v-t-s," and he would follow me home if I did not give him some money, for there were two men behind who could swear the same. I was frightened, and did not know what to do. I was so frightened at being charged with such a thing, I said, "What must you have?" he said' "How much have you got?" I said would 5 s. do for him - he said No; I asked if 10 s. would do: he said, No, he must have 15 s., "For" said he "that is a trifle - I had 10 l. the other night, from a gentleman, for the same thing;" I gave him 15 s., and he ran away. On the 18th he came to my house with Adams - (I suppose he must have followed me home) - they had a pint of beer, my man waited upon them; they went out, and as Adams went out he left a note on the bar, saying,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Jones, there is a letter for you;" this is it (looking at it) - I saw Adams put it down there; he went out directly. Dovey was just before him, and must have heard what he said - they were going out close together. I read the letter -(read.)</p>
               <p>"SIR, - I write these few lines to you, to inform you that the money as you gave me on Wednesday night I bought some clothes with - and yesterday my landlord came to me for rent, after I had spent what you gave me. I shall be obliged to you if you will send me 2 l. 16 s. 6 d., to pay the rent I owe; and then I say and swear I never will send, nor come to you any more. This person that has brought this letter, is the person that saw you feel my privates that night, at Fairburn's, but if you send the money he will not mention it. If you cannot send that sum, send as much as you can to pay my rent, and I will never trouble you no more, so help my God."</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones, Welch Harp, St. Paul's.</p>
               <p>HUGH JONES (in continuation.) I went to the door on reading the letter, and saw both the prisoners lurking about outside the door - on my coming out I asked Dovey what he wanted here (Adams was walking about on the other side - I cannot say whether he heard;) Dovey said he must have some more money, for what I had given him was nothing - that he had 10 l. from a gentleman before, for the same thing. He said he must have what he mentioned in the letter; I said I had not got so much with me, neither would I do it; he said then he must have a sovereign, or else there was an officer a little way off, who would come and take me up directly - Adams was at that time perhaps ten yards off, walking about. I did not know what to do - I was frightened, and had not an opportunity of getting an officer, and I gave him a sovereign; Adams was still walking backwards and forwards, and passed us once or twice. When I gave Dovey the sovereign they went away together. On the 20th Dovey came into my house; I was out - I came in and found him there, and in the evening, after I lighted the glass, he went out, and called to me; I went out to him; he said he wanted some more money - I said I would have no more of his nonsense - he went away. I went to St. Paul's church-yard for an officer, but he was gone before I returned. I had not said I was going for an officer; I only said I would stand no more of his nonsense, and would give him no more. He came to my house next day - I went out privately for an officer, who took him in my house, and took him to Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you kept a public-house? A. I have been in that house five years all but three months. I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170028"></xptr>been a publican seven years. I kept a house at Billingsgate, and before that I lived with Mr. Price, at a wholesale linen warehouse, in Old Change, for six years. I have been fifteen years in London, and was never in a court of justice, except being summoned here as a juryman. My house is not far from the Broadway. I never saw Dovey before in my life. He ran away towards St. Paul's when I gave him the 15 s. he ran a few yards. I did not look after him, but suppose he must have turned and followed me home. This was about eight o'clock. There were people about, and shops open, and I believe the watch was set.</p>
               <p>Q. And you said nothing to any one while this man was threatening you with this charge? A. I was not in a public place then, for I went down over the bridge to avoid his seeing me home. He spoke to me several times. The first time was as I was going down the Broadway. I went down St. Andrew's-hill, and Earl-street, and over the bridge. He followed close to me all the way repeating his demand; and there were two more men behind, as he said; a good many people were walking about; but I cannot say whether I saw the two men or not, as I did not know them. I went as far as the Obelisk and Union-street, Borough. I gave him the money in Union-street, and came home over Blackfriars-bridge. He ran away as soon as I gave him the money.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you gave him the money in the Broadway, and he ran towards St. Paul's? A. He ran towards St. Paul's from Union-street. He attacked me in the Broadway.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a crowd was there at Fairburn's? A. I saw a good many people there, but did not see Dovey there to my knowledge. I had got to the corner of Shoemaker-row, when he spoke to me - I did not know what to do at the time. I told my wife and the officer of it. I told my wife of it on the night of the 20th, when I went for the officer - I did not tell her before, for she was in trouble, having just buried our little boy. I went to Peter's-hill for the officer - he is a patrol. I never told any body of it before that. The letter, which Adams left on the bar, was wafered. Dovey said, at Guildhall, that Adams wrote it. There were several people in my taproom when I received the letter. I did not ask them to go out with me. I parted with my money through fear of their bringing an officer to take me up - if they charged me with this, I could not prove my innocence.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know they were to be there again on the second day? A. I did not know when he was coming; but he said he would come again, for that was not enough for him - There was no appointment for me to meet him.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Were you not in a state of agitation at the time? A. Yes: I told my wife of it two days after, we had lost our child more than a month before.</p>

            . I am chief clerk at Guildhall. The prisoners were brought before the Alderman on the 21st of January. I took down what passed - neither threat or promise was held out to them. (Reads.)</p>
               <p>Friday, 21st January, before Mr. Alderman Ansley. Dovey stated, that he lived at No. 2, New Pye-street, Westminster, and has worked for Deakin &amp; Co., of Ludgate-hill, ironmongers, seven months ago - is now out of work - has no employment at present. Adams has worked with him there. "A stranger told me, this person was addicted to putting his hands to person's p - v - ts. I never received a farthing from him but 15 s." (He was remanded till next day, 22d, when Adams appeared at the Justice-room, and was identified by Jones. He came forward, and gave this statement.) (Reads,) "I went into the Broadway, and met Jones with a basket - he is in the habit of going out with a basket, and touching people's p - v - ts. He has served me so. I was a light porter at Deakin &amp; Co.'s, seven or eight months ago, at the time Dovey was there. Dovey gave me 1 s. 6 d. out of the first money, and 5 s. out of the second. He said he would write Jones a note - I saw him write it - and he gave it to me to deliver. I was with him at Jones's, and I gave him the note. I knew he wanted to borrow money of him."</p>
               <p>MR. BERESFORD, (in continuation.) Dovey was present, and heard Adams's statement, and said nothing to it. I think something was said about Dovey having sent for him. Jones seemed very much agitated and alarmed. Read and Herdsfield were present. Read took Adams into custody, by the Alderman's direction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many examinations had taken place before you saw Adams? A. Only one, which was the day before, he was in the Justice-room. Jones had described such a person, and said he should know him. He only talked of Dovey and another man, who, he said, he should know; and when he came into the room, next day, he said he did know him.</p>
               <p>Q. When Adams said Dovey wrote the letter, did not Adams say he could neither read nor write? A. No: I heard nothing of the sort. He did not deny any part of the statement. Dovey had an attorney at the second examination, who cautioned him, and he kept himself quiet.</p>

            . I am patrol of Castle Baynard Ward. On Thursday, the 20th of January, soon after five o'clock in the evening, Jones came to me. He seemed very much agitated, and did not know how to act. I went with him to his house, and Dovey was then gone. Next day, about twelve o'clock, Jones fetched me again. I went to his house, and apprehended Dovey. Jones came into the parlour, and gave him into my charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you known Jones? A. Four or five years. He did not know where I lived. I left him my address on Thursday evening. He had fetched me from duty in St. Paul's Church-yard.</p>
               <p>DOVEY'S Defence. I am quite innocent. I could have had a character from Messrs. Eve and Deakin, where I left seven months ago, and since that have worked at the Surrey Theatre, but it being so disgraceful a charge I did not let my friends know of it. The prosecutor made me nearly tipsy when I met him by Fairburn's - he took me into a public-house, and gave me liquor, told me to say nothing to any one, and gave me 15 s. I gave Adams what money I owed him.</p>


               <p>ADAMS'S Defence. I was in distress. Dovey owed me the money which he gave me. I can neither read nor write, and do not know what was in the letter. He asked me to take it to Jones, and I did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. John Mason, a hay-dealer of Bushy; on 14th Nov. he sent me to London with a load of hay, to sell. I went to Charing Cross—I saw the prisoner there—I had not known him before; he asked if I would sell the hay, and what I wanted for it—I told him three guineas; he said that was too much—I said, "Well, then, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a shilling for myself?"—he said, "Well, I will have it"—I said, "I hope you are not going to take me far?"—he said, "No, only just over the water"—I Said, "There is another thing; I must not go home without the money, my master gave me orders not to go home without it"—he said, "Do you think I mean to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you out of the money?"—he said he would buy it—he said, "Let us go over and have a glass of gin;" and asked me if I had any halfpence,—I said, "No, only a few, but I have a sixpence"—he said, "You may as well let me have that till the hay is sold, and then I will give it you back again"—I was to have the money as soon as the hay was unloaded—he took me to a butcher's shop at Walworth, where he talked about selling it—ten of the trusses were taken in there, by order of Mr. Williams, the butcher—he bought the hay of the prisoner—the prisoner told me to stop there—no one carried it in—we put the cart up, and put the hay in the loft—he bought a quarter of a load, but there was one truss more put in by mistake, and there was one truss he did not like; it was put down and we put another one up—the prisoner went to get the money, and I was to stop round the corner—the prisoner came back and offered me five shillings—he said, "You had better take that to bind the bargain"—I said, "I cannot take that, I must have it all"—a cowman came along and bought the remainder of the hay of the prisoner, not of me—I do not know what he was to give for it—we went down to his house—I do not know where he lived—I am no scholar—when we got there he helped to take out the remainder of the hay—I asked for the money—the prisoner said he could not pay me—we came along, a little way from the place—there was one man with him; he gave the man a half-sovereign, what change the man gave him I do not know—the prisoner then said I must stop in town all night; he put the horse up, and said he would pay the expense; he said he had to take 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Friday morning and he would pay my money and the expenses—I was forced to stop, for I could not go away without the money—I followed him very closely—he said, "I wish you would go home."</p>

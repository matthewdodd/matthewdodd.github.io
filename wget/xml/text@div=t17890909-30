            ; our private mark is upon it, E. E. and E. S. I know them to be my master's hand-writing; I did not enquire whether such a piece was missing, when I returned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I believe this woman had dealt at your shop, several times before? - She had.</p>
               <p>After she was in custody, there was an application made to her, to give up her keys, was not there? - I believe there was, I do not know to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that she did give up her keys, in order that any search, that was necessary, might be made, as to the goods and duplicates, that might lead to a discovery? - Yes, I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Then she did? - I believe she did, as I heard my master say, deliver the keys of her apartments.</p>
               <p>There was a search made; in consequence of that search, there was a petticoat and some other things taken? - There was a petticoat taken, and brought to our house.</p>
               <p>That coat was taken on suspicion that it was your master's property, and stolen from him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was returned to her afterwards? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that it appeared to be regularly bought and paid for? - There was a remnant of cotton -</p>
               <p>Answer the question; I am confining myself to the petticoat? - I do not know; the remnant of cotton she never bought at our shop.</p>
               <p>Is that other shopman here? - He is not here.</p>
               <p>She bought some things, and did not pay for them? - I heard her say, I will be in again directly and pay for what I have looked out, make out the bill of parcels; she always went out, before she paid for all she bought, she left some money.</p>
               <p>Then Hopkins the shop-man, was doing with her, exactly in the way he was accustomed to do? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not observe every article she looked out? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell what passed between them? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this woman must be acquitted; she is in conversation with a man, bargaining and dealing with him, from whom it is possible, she had the goods; and this very cotton might be in that very bill, and on credit; and nobody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090033"></xptr>can prove the transaction between them, but the very man who dealt with her, and whom the prosecutor has not brought, to give an account before you.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was ignorant that Hopkins did serve her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I met him at a wine-merchant's. Witness. No, I met him in the street, and went into three public houses; there was a young woman who went off with another man - I did not tell him to take my watch to Mr. Martin, and get a few shillings for drink; I did not say if he had redeemed it like a man on the Tuesday night this would not have happened.</p>

            . On Sunday morning, the 8th of August, the prisoner and three or four more came to my house in Berwick-street; I had known him before - they called for two pots of half-and-half; I took them in, and they called for two more - I carried them in, and said I should like my reckoning settled; they looked at one another, and the prisoner said, "You need not make much noise about it, I will leave my watch with you, for my master did not pay me on Saturday night - you must let me have 10s. more on it, and take the 2s. for your reckoning" - I heard of the prosecutor's loss on the Monday morning; I sent for him, and he described the watch, and offered to pay 6s. if I would lose the other 6s.; I said I would not - he then went to Marlborough-street - he stated that he did not know whether he had given the prisoner the watch, or whether he had stolen it.</p>

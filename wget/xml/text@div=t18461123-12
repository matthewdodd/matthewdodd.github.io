                  </hi>. My brother William is a painter, and lives at Carlisle-street, Lisson-grove. On the 6th of Nov., a little after seven o'clock at night, I was in the parlour behind the shop, and saw William Norris come into the shop, and shut the door—the prisoner was coming round the counter with the bowl in his hand—I came into the shop and asked what brought him there—he put it down on the floor—I found the till drawn out, and the bowl taken from it—I had seen it safe in the till five minutes before, and the money in it, and some half-crowns—I sent for a constable.</p>

I was in my son's shop in Richmond-street, at a little after seven o'clock, and received information, which made me go over to Burge's shop—I shut the door after me, and saw the prisoner come from behind the counter—I laid hold of him—he had no shoes on his feet, and could not make a noise—I saw Burge take up the bowl with the money in it—I did not see the bowl in the prisoner's hand myself, she had a better view of him than I had—I asked the prisoner what he wanted behind the counter—he said he came for a penny loaf—he had a halfpenny in his hand.</p>

I noticed a crowd at the shop, found the prisoner there, and took him in charge—I asked him what brought him there—he said he wanted to buy a roll—he had no shoes on—I asked when he had worn his shoes—he said in the morning—his stockings were perfectly dry—there were five half-crowns, two shillings, a sixpence, two fourpenny-pieces, and a counterfeit half-crown in the bowl—at the station a knock came to the door, and a pair of boots were brought, which were put on the prisoner—when going before the Magistrate, he kicked me several times, and tried to escape.</p>

On a Sunday morning, a little after two o'clock, 1 awoke, and found her standing in my bed-room (I do not recollect the date); my husband was in bed with me. When I went up to bed that night I put my pocket under my pillow; there was a purse in it containing eleven sovereigns and 3l. worth of silver, there was also a sovereign and 24s. in silver, loose in my pocket, and 21/2d. in copper, and a small knife, belonging to my little boy; the bed-room would not lock, but I shut it, and put a chair against it - I did not hear her come into the room; she awoke me by screaming and hallooing that thieves were in the house; my husband said, "Halloo, open the window;" she said, "I can't, I can't;" I answered, "You open the window;" he did so, and called Thieves and Watch! I do not know what prevented her opening it, if she had liked; she said they had stripped her room; my husband went down stairs; the watchmen came in; the prisoner still remained in the room; the watchmen said, "Here is a bundle;" I saw my husband on the stairs with the watchmen, and a bundle wrapped in a shawl, which the prisoner has now got on; the prisoner still remained in the room - she said, that two men had come into her room with black crape over their faces, and come to her bed, litted her head up and took her pocket from under her head, with 2l. in money in it; she said they opened the door, which awoke her, lifted the pillow up, to lift her head easy, and drew the pocket out with the other hand - I then looked for my pocket, which was gone - I then went to the stair-foot and hallooed to the watchman, to tell them I was not worth a farthing, I had lost all, and she kept saying, "I have lost my all, I have lost my all" - she said she saw them go to my press-bedstead, which stood in her room, and open it, and take a counterpane out, a pair of blankets, and all the things which were there; the other things in the bedstead were hers - she said they went to her box and stripped it, and drank nearly a pint of rum in the room, and ale bread and cheese - they had a dark lantern which they put backwards and forwards over her eyes, to see if she was asleep; that she heard the kitchen-door slam after they went down stairs; and as soon as she heard that she came into our room, as she thought she was then safe. After this I went down stairs into the kitchen, leaving her on the top of the stairs, and on the kitchen-table was the bundle which I had seen before; she came down to the kitchen, I said, "These things are all mine," and she said, "Yes, they are;" there was a pair of blankets and a gown of mine, a bit of stuff which I had given her to make a child's frock, and some Irish which had been given her to make shirts; the blankets had been in the bedstead; the counterpane, which had been in the bedstead, was not there. A little after six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050018"></xptr>o'clock a pocket was brought to me - it was nearly daylight then - I saw Brown, the watchman, find it in the back-yard, between the wall and an old box; the prisoner had said she wished the watchmen to look about, as they might find something; the pocket was the one which had been taken from under my head; the purse was not in it then - the loose sovereign, 24s. 51/2d., and the little knife were still in it, but the purse and eleven sovereigns were gone. I saw my husband find an empty purse afterwards near the same place - she said that was hers.</p>

            . I am husband of the last witness. I did not hear the prisoner come into the room; she awoke me, by making a noise, and saying thieves were in the house - I found her standing by our bed side; I called the watchman, who came; I met him on the top of the stairs, with a bundle. I found the kitchen window open; it is a sash window, with an inside shutter, which puts up and down on hinges, so as to form an ironing board - it was still on the hinges - it was down, laying on two chairs; the bolts which fasten it inside were undone - I saw that it was bolted when I went to bed. I could find no marks of violence, as if any one had broken in; I looked both outside and in - this was on Sunday, the 4th of March; the prisoner continued to lodge with us till the Friday night, and then left, as my wife gave her notice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had she lodged with you? A. Three months; she had the use of the kitchen. It was between two and three o'clock when I found the shutter down - I do not always look to see that it is fastened, but am sure I looked that night, and the night before. Her father took her away on the Friday, to her brother's house, next door. She awoke me to tell me the house was robbed.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the alarm about ten minutes after two o'clock, and went to Alloway's - the back kitchen window was about three parts open; there is a small gate which leads round the house to that window; the other watchman, Brown, got in at that window, and let me in at the door; I immediately discovered the bundle laying at the bottom of the stairs - Mr. Alloway opened it afterwards, and claimed the contents, which I have here. The prisoner went up into her own room with me - I found a large box there, open, and asked her if any thing had been in it; she said it was full of her clothes, but every thing was taken out; she told me about their taking her pocket from under her head. I examined the kitchen window well, inside and out, with my lantern, before I left the house - there were no marks of violence whatever, either on the windows or door. I produce the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you present when the purse was found? A. Yes; it was about four feet from the kitchen window, behind an old wooden box.</p>

            . I live at No. 10, Essex-street, Hoxton Old-town. The prisoner came to our house on Monday morning, the 5th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock, and brought a counterpane - she asked if I knew where there was a washer-woman, who would do some washing for her; I said the washer-woman next door had left, but as my wife was washing, perhaps she would wash what she wanted; she produced a gown and counterpane, and gave them to my wife. The officer, Hanley, got them from my house; I saw them delivered to him on the Sunday following, and am sure they are what she brought.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who did she leave them with? - A. With me and my wife; I can swear to them by a mark on the counterpane, which I observed - it is done with thread - there are many washer-women in the neighbourhood. I did not know the prisoner nor the prosecutor before; I should not have taken them but she said she was coming to live in the neighbourhood, and I thought it might induce her to deal at my shop - my wife does not take in washing.</p>

            . I took the gown to the office, and gave it up to the prisoner's father - here is the mark on the counterpane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you unfold it, to look at the mark, when she brought? A. No, but I saw it half an hour afterwards, and can swear this is the same she brought - it had not been out of my wife's possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any others of that size in your house? A. No, nor any like it.</p>
               <p>MRS. ALLOWAY. This is the counterpane which I lost from the bedstead in her room; I know the flannels by the darn, as they were moth eaten, and the prisoner had darned them for me; the pocket is mine. The things found in the bundle are all mine.</p>
               <p>JAMES HANLEY re-examined. I first went to this house on Tuesday, the 6th of March, and examined it very closely, but could find no mark of violence, or of any person having got in or out. I saw the prisoner that day, and told her, in her brother's presence, that either she had robbed Alloway, or Alloway was privy to her being robbed, for there were no external marks about the house; she told me, that about two o'clock on Sunday morning, her room door opened, and two men entered, as Mrs. Alloway has stated, and that she saw them take a white counterpane - she gave exactly the same account to me that Mrs. Alloway has stated. I took it down in writing, and have it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050019"></xptr>here. I went to Alloway's house again on the Friday following, and saw the prisoner - I asked her to produce to me what money she had in her pocket; she produced a sovereign, wrapped up in brown paper; I asked her to account how she became possessed of it - she hesitated very much, and at last said she had sold some things to a person in Rosemary-lane - I asked who it was - she said she thought she should know the person again - then she said she had sold them to some gentleman; I asked who the gentleman was - she appeared so much agitated that my brother officer objected to my questioning her further; I declined, and nothing more passed then. I apprehended her on Sunday night, the 11th of March, in a court in William-street, Harper-street, New Kent-road, at her sister's; I asked if she had any objection to say where the property was; this was before I told her I should take her into custody (I did not say it would be better or worse for her if she told - I make her no threat nor promise whatever) - she said she was very sorry for what she had done - that I should find the counterpane and her gown at a chandler's shop, in Essex-street, Hoxton - she did not know the person's name, and I should find the flannels at a mangler's, in Margaret-street, Hackney-fields - I found them there the same night; I asked her if the sovereign which I found in her possession on Friday, was part of the money she had taken from under Mrs. Alloway's pillow - she said it was. I was about an hour with her - she appeared very ill, and begged I would not take her into custody; I said I was compelled to do it - she stated that she let the kitchen window down before she took the pocket - that she had 8l. from Mrs. Alloway's pocket; I asked her what became of the rest of the money, and after some time she stated what she had done with it - her sister, her brother-in-law, and Mrs. Alloway were in the room all the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long did you stay on the Friday? A. Perhaps half an hour or three quarters - she also appeared very ill on the Sunday - I was there near an hour, and she got better. I was endeavouring to discover the property. None of the persons in the room either threatened or promised her. I believe, towards the end, her sister said the prosecutor was a very poor man, and she should do what she could to restore his property; he said nothing to induce her to confess. I remember she said she had told Mr. Goupel what had become of the property - one of her relations directed me to her sister's house. - The prosecutor said he suspected she was over in the Kent-road.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my case to the mercy of the Court.</p>

               <p>Q. What was it the prisoner carried? - Thirty-six check shirts and two bundles of trowsers, there were more trowsers besides them, two dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him put them on this truck? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever happen to see them afterwards on the truck that day? - I went along with the truck as far as Ludgate-hill, and then they went round St. Paul's, I went round the left hand, and they went round the right hand, till there I followed the truck.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see them on the truck? - Yes, I saw the quantity, but they were covered over.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with this truck afterwards? - It was to go to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner the man that was to carry them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go with him? - 'Till we came to St. Paul's, he turned on the right hand, and I turned to the left, and they went into Red Lion-court, Watling-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it he and you parted? - At St. Paul's; he went on the right hand as I went on the left; it is usual to go that way, and that was the way we generally made use of.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did the man go one way and you another? - Because the truck would not go that way; I went strait on the City, through Cheapside to go to the warehouse, and instead of their coming that way they went down Watling-street, to Red Lion-court.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see your goods again? - Yes, some.</p>
               <p>Q. Which did you see first, the prisoner or the goods? - A gentleman took in what was left in Red Lion-court for safety; I saw them in Red Lion-court I believe the same night; the gentleman sent word to the workhouse.</p>

               <p>I am a broker, Red Lion-court; I saw a truck there on Monday last, about nine o'clock in the morning; there was a lad with it, I looked on him to be stupid or an ideot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiry of this lad? - I asked him several times where he came from? I could get no answer, but from the workhouse; I sent for the beadle of Cordwainers ward, and he said as it was a parish matter he would not have any thing to do with it; so I took the goods into my warehouse, and sent him home with a note in his pocket. In the afternoon of the same day Mrs. Bramham brought me the note; I delivered the things to Mrs. Bramham and another, two or three days afterwards.</p>

               <p>Court to Robinson. He speaks as if he had been ill, does he speak commonly so? - He was taken with a stroke of the palsy some years ago, but he can speak better if he pleases.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he know what he is about? - He well knows what he is about, he is quite intelligent.</p>

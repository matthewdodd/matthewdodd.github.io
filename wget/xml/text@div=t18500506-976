I have a business in London, but I reside at Hampstead—the prisoner was in my service—we keep fowls, and we had missed eggs for several days—I mentioned to the prisoner about it—I said there were so many eggs in the nest, and asked him how many he brought in—he said, "Four"—I said it was said there were six there—he then said he brought in five—I said, "I do not like to suspect any one, perhaps you will allow me to see your box," which he consented to do, and there were seven eggs in the box—I asked him how he came by them—he said they were his own—a silver teaspoon was found in his box; it is mine—he has in other respects been a very good servant—with the exception of this I have no fault to find.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I bought the eggs; I did not know the spoon was there; when I unlocked the box my master wished me to take all my things out, which I did; if I had known the spoon had been there I would not have kept it there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service—I had the care of the plate—I missed the spoon on 20th March—I mentioned it to the prisoner—he said he knew nothing of it—the spoon could not have got in the dust-hole by any accident—the slops went in the pig-trough, not in the dust—I asked him to try and find the spoon—he had never borrowed it—we have no other spoons in common use but these.</p>

                  </hi> I am a laundress, and live at 32, Boston Street, Hack<lb></lb>ney Road—on 1st June I had a basket of linen lying on the table, about a yard from the window—I was awoke about a quarter-past three and saw a man's body inside the parlour window, partly on the table, with his hand reaching across to my silk jacket; the prisoner is the man—I rubbed my eyes to get the sleep out of them, and said, "Dear me, what are you doing?" and he vanished—I missed the clothes, they were safe when I went to bed at two o'clock and the window was fastened.</p>

On the morning of 1st June I was on duty in Gossett Street, Bethnal Green, about half-past three, and saw the prisoner carrying a bundle; it was about a mile and a half from the Park—I stopped him and asked what he had got there—he said, "Clean linen"—I asked where he got it from—he made no answer to that, but said he was going to take it home—I took him to the station and found the bundle contained these things.</p>

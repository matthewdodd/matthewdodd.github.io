            . I am a surgeon, and live in Hanover-street, Hanover-square - on Thursday, 11th July, I was sent for to attend the prisoner about eleven o'clock in the morning - I attended at No. 30, <placeName id="t18340102-55-crimeloc304">Bruton-mews, Berkley-square</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it at all unusual for a woman to be involuntarily delivered; I mean delivered when they have not even known the fact themselves? A.I cannot think that they could not know the fact.</p>
               <p>Q.Suppose her to have these pains of labour with a first child; would not those pains to an uninformed person be like a disposition to discharge foeces? A.Undoubtedly so - I am informed there is no water-closet in the Mews.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It is a common thing, I believe, for persons to go to a place for a certain purpose, and be delivered? A. It is not at all uncommon - I believe she is about eighteen years old - she was in a very weak state.</p>

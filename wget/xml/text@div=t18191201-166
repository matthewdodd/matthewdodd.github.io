            . I am a coach lace weaver. I have known the prisoner from the 19th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed by Maidment in any transaction with him - 
               <persName id="t18191201-166-person1675">A. </persName>
            Yes, to buy half a score of bad shillings of him. I first saw him on the 19th of November, and appointed to meet him on the 22d.</p>
               <p>Q. Previous to meeting him that day, did you see the Furzemans - A. Yes, they searched me, and gave me a half crown, one shilling, two sixpences, three penny-pieces, and six halfpence; I had no other money - this was about nine o'clock in the morning. I was to meet the prisoner at the bottom of George-street about nine o'clock. I went about half-past nine o'clock, and met him standing on the crossing - both the Furzemans were there. He said he had kept me late - I said Yes. He said,</p>
               <p>"Are you ready for me?" I said Yes, and we walked up George-street. When we had got about three parts up the street, he asked me for the money? I gave him the money that they gave me, and he gave me 20 s. wrapped in a piece of paper. We walked up the street a little way, and I gave a signal to the officers that I had got them - they came up to us.

            . I am a constable. I had a communication with the last witness. On the 22d of November I gave him a half crown, a shilling, two sixpences, and 6 d. in copper, which I had marked - he had no other money; the account he has given is correct. I seized him, and told my brother to seize the prisoner by both hands. I found twenty counterfeit shillings in Williams's pocket, wrapped up seperate, having a piece of paper between every 5 s. I found no other money on him. I then searched the prisoner, and found the money I had marked and given to Williams on him, also 1 s. 6 d. and 2 1/2 d. mixed together, but not marked.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You gave him the money on purpose to make the purchase - A. I did, my Lord.</p>

Yes; she had; I took them out with me on the Sunday, and on the Monday I put on the same coat, but did not miss them till the Tuesday; I then went up and examined, and was very much alarmed, and related the loss of them to every body in the house; I told her, she must have seen them, for they were in my coat pocket; and, she said, she had seen them, and had them in her hand; she was the only maid-servant we had; we had a man-servant; she did not assign the reason why she went to my pocket; but she would not then give an account of what she had done with them; I have never had any of them again; one of them has since come into the Bank; the pockets were found upon her; she consetsed, before the Alderman, that she had taken them away.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, after this woman was committed for stealing the notes that are charged in this indictment, did you not go to her friends for the purpose of making up this matter, and receiving the difference of your loss? - A. I went to them.</p>

               <p>Q. Then, upon your oath, did you not go to the prisoner's friends for the purpose of recovering your loss? - A. I told them, I thought, as honest people, if they knew any thing, they ought to make a discovery.</p>
               <p>Q. That was after you had been before the Magistrate, and the woman committed? - A. I don't know that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that it was not? - A. It is a month or two ago.</p>
               <p>Q. That it would be better for them if it was made up upon the payment of a sum of money? - A. No such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then tell those honest men what you did go for? - A. I went to endeavour to find out my property; I left not stone unturned to recover my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after this poor woman was committed, did you not go to her friends and offer to lose 10l. if you could recover the remaining part of your property? - A. I don't recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Remember, this poor woman's liberty, and, perhaps, life, is at stake? - A. I recollect saying, if the property was restored, if it was 10l. short, I should be glad to have it.</p>

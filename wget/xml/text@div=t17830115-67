             stopped the prisoner a few yards up Bull-head-court, Newgate-street, in the ward of Cripplegate; I collared him, and asked him what he had got under his arm, he said, some sugar which was given him, but he did not know by whom, and he said, he gave four shillings for it.</p>

               <p>I am in partnership with Mr. Alderman Turner, in the sugar refining business, the prisoner at the bar was a <rs id="t17830115-67-deflabel377" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Court. Did you lose about that time any sugar? - I cannot say the quantity, we cannot miss such a quantity as this; the prisoner was a servant to Alderman Turner, he lodged and boarded in the house, and his business did not call him up before seven or eight.</p>

I live in Clare-street, Clare-market, and am pro<lb></lb>prietor of the Fountain public-house—Amos has been repeatedly in my em<lb></lb>ploy—on the 6th of June, he came to my house to alter some gas fittings I then had something for him to do in the cellar—he took a basket down in the cellar—he saw what was to be done, and went to work—I went about my business—some time after I came over the trap-door which leads to the cellar, and heard two voices in the cellar—I went down and found Brown there, whom I had previously forbidden to come to my house—Amos was there, and he was then perfectly sober—they came up and down repeatedly out of the cellar—Brown afterwards came up with a basket, and Amos remained below—I went down and found Amos quite intoxicated—we got him carried up to the tap-room, and when the house was about to be closed I missed this pipe and cocks—they had been down in the cellar, except a small gas fitting which was found on Brown—he carried the basket—Amos was in the cellar.</p>

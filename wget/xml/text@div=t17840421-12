               <p>Court. Did he stand in any posture that was in the act of receiving it? - He stood in the act of receiving it; when I came up to them, Bean stepped down to me, and asked me the way to Charterhouse Square.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you mean stepped down to you? - He walked off the steps, he was upon the steps before the door; then the other that had the tray dropped it down the area; then my companion catched hold of Bean, and said to me, these are thieves; I said, so they are, let us pursue them; Bean got from him, and Burridge jumped over the bars and run away; I and Logar pursued them.</p>
               <p>How soon did you take them? - We took them between fifty and sixty yards off.</p>
               <p>Did you lose sight of them? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body else there? - Yes, three men stood at a distance.</p>
               <p>Did they assist you? - No, they ran away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Council for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Was it quite light, Sir? - It was not dark, nor was it quite light, I could see at a great distance.</p>
               <p>Had he hold of the rails? - No.</p>
               <p>He was in the street then? - Yes, up against the door.</p>
               <p>You did not see him do any thing whatever? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Or receive any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>When these prisoners were taken, were they taken running or standing still? - When they found they were pursued close they stood still.</p>
               <p>They were standing still? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was nobody but you and your friend? - No.</p>

               <p>Did not a tall gentleman interfere for them? - He said, they should be taken and examined.</p>
               <p>Then there was some doubt even upon your own story at that time, whether they were the real identical people or no? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you ever lose sight of the men? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure upon your oath that they were the men? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q.What do you know your apron by? A. By its general appearance, the strings being worn out, and several holes in it; it is a different shape to those generally worn - it is made to cover the breast; there is nothing particular in those nails that I know of - the house was not left open; the backdoor of the kitchen was partly blocked up, but a person might climb over.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner on Sunday, the 16th of November, coming across the fields, with one of these bundles under his arm, about half-past three o'clock; I spoke to the watchman, and he said, "Let him be:" we saw him go and cover it over, and then go away; we then went, and found these three papers of nails, screws, and hinges; we saw the prisoner come there the next morning, about half-past nine o'clock - I had seen him before, and am sure he is the boy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you employed on the premises? A. Yes; and assist the watchman on a Sunday; I only saw him with one bundle - he was coming from the place from which the nails were taken - he put them in the end of the field.</p>

No; I was some distance from him; the next day, about half-past nine o'clock, he came to the same place with a large bag, I suppose to take the property away; we did not stop him on Sunday, because we did not know that he had any thing of consequence.</p>

            . I am a constable of Kensington. I had occasion to go to the Holland Arms public-house, on Sunday, the 29th of June, about eleven o'clock in the morning; I found the prisoner there, and took him into custody- I told him it was on suspicion of stealing a horse from Bedfordshire, and I asked if he did not sell a horse ten days back to Mr. Wilkinson; he said Yes; I then asked where he got that horse. which was then in the stable; he made no answer; I took him and the horse - the ostler told me, in the presence of the prisoner, that he had come there with this horse that morning - it was the ostler who had fetched me- I took him into the public-house, and searched him; I kept the horse in my possession till the 15th of August, when I found who it belonged to; when Mr. George appeared at the office, the horse was given up to him by the Magistrate's order.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When had you this conversation with the hostler? A. On the 29th of June; the hostler said, "This is the horse he sent here by a little chimneysweep boy, and he gave him a penny for it;" I knew the prisoner before, and he knew me perfectly well as a neighbour - I suppose he knew me to be an officer; I leave no doubt of it - he worked for Mr. Cobbet, in his garden.</p>

            . I am ostler at the Holland Arms, Kensington; I know the prisoner. On Sunday, the 29th of June, he sent this horse to our house by a little boy; I did not think it was to come to our stable - I thought the little boy had made a mistake. and I hitched the horse on the outside; in about a quarter of an hour the prisoner came into the stable - I went up with him, and unlocked the stable door, and he brought the horse into the stable - this was before he said anything to me about the horse; the boy was then gone - I asked him if it was his horse; he said Yes; the horse was then put into the stable, and I went to the public-house and fetched a pint of half-andhalf, I called Richard Toy. our watchman, out, and told him to go for the officer - the officer came, and took the prisoner: I do not know where the prisoner lives - he had been at our house before; the last time I had seen him before the 29th was on the 20th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been acquainted with the prisoner before? A. Yes - I had known him better than two years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is he? A. When I first knew him he was at home with his father, and sold fruit in Covent-garden; I do not know where he has lived for the last two years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was going up towards their house on the 20th; Culley was drinking with some men, and he asked me if I would toss with him for some beer - I said No, I did not want any such thing; I was not inclined to toss for it - he then ordered me to take the horse up into the stable: then he asked if I would give 2l. for it, and then Wilkinson came up.</p>
               <p>COURT. You are now tried about George's horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 60, Upper Garden Street, Westminster—in May, 1865,1 lived at 72, Lupus Street, Pimlico, where I let lodgings, and in that month I became possessed of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in Consols—in July, 1866, the three prisoners came to my house for apart<lb></lb>ments—I took them in for one night—the next day they said they wanted to stay a week, and agreed to pay 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—they continued with me some time, but they only paid me one week's rent—afterwards I received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account—after they had been with me a short time the male pri<lb></lb>soner said that his daughter was coming into a deal of money, and that if I would let them stay they would pay me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—they spoke to me several times about coming into this property—first of all it was about 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and afterwards they said it was 7000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that it was left by Lord de Fisca, a Frenchman, who died in Paris, and made a will in favour of their daughter of 7000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—it was house property in France, and some at Madras—Mrs. and Miss. Hasted told me that; the father was not present—I think they had been with me then three or four montbt—at first I advanced them a few shillings to pay for stamps and seals for documents with reference to this property—they said they were docu<lb></lb>ments that came from Paris, and had to be seen by solicitors here some time about February, 1866—I cannot remember the date exactly—the pri<lb></lb>soner Emily told me that through my kindness to her she would make a deed to allow me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I said I did not require anything but what they owed me, but they forced it upon me, and wished me to write to that effect, that I was perfectly satisfied with 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. A year—she told me afterwards that it was prepared and taken to the Bank of England with other deeds; that it was made by Lord Wigan and the Lord Chancellor; that Lord Wigan was a judge; and that the Lord Chancellor's name was Lord Cranworth; and Emily told me that Lady de Fisca was trying to disprove the will of Lord de Fisca; that Lady de Fisca had already employed solicitors in Paris; and that she (<hi rend="italic">Emily</hi>) had employed solicitors in Paris against Lady de Fisca; and that they sent documents here to be settled in this country under Lord Wigan, who was to see that they were right and to sign and seal them with the Lord Chancellor—about 9th May, 1866, Emily asked me for I think 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for the stamping and sealing of these documents—her mother was present; in fact, her mother almost always asked me for the money—at that time I had advanced them near upon 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and with what I after<lb></lb>wards advanced them amounted to 365<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sold out the whole of my 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bit by bit at about 86—I did not tell them I was selling out—Susan Hasted has told me that there would be plenty of money to pay every<lb></lb>thing, and that they could not hinder her daughter from having it—they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186704080060"></xptr>
               <p>only paid me one week's rent, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but at the end of the year they made out a bill of what they owed me for rent, at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week from 1st August, and it amounted to 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Emily has told me that she used to go to the Lord Chancellor's Chambers at Hounslow—they all three left my house on 8th October, 1866—before they left they asked me to lend them some more money, but I told them I had not got any—in December I went to the Chancery Record Office and searched the public books with the clerk—we went as far back as five years, but could not find any entry about Lord or Lady de Fisca, nor anything like Hasted—I also went to the Bank of England and searched in the Will and Probate Department, but could not find anything about a deed in my favour—at various times Emily has asked me to write letters to Lord Wigan, and she promised to allow me so much per cent.—I wrote several letters, and addressed them to Lord Wigan, and she said she was going to take them to him—I think sometimes I was to have as much as 20 per cent., and sometimes less—at last I said it was absurd writing so many letters, but she said there was so much money in the Bank at Paris and it must be disposed of, and I must write them, and I did write them—I know Mrs. Anu Lifford—her husband is an upholsterer—on 7th January she went with me to Newland Street, Kensington—we found Mrs. Hasted and her daughter lodging there—I asked Mrs. Hasted if they had heard anything from the Lord Chancellor—she said, no, and I must wait until they had letters from the Lord Chancellor—I asked Emily why she did not stir them up—she said she could not do that, and that I must wait—I asked her once to go with me to see them—she said, no, she could not go, as they might be offended—I said, "Why should they be offended? if they are Lords, people have a right to go and inquire after their rights"—she said I was to go to the Court of Common Pleas, in Chancery Lane.</p>

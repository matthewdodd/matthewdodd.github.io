                  </hi>. I am a sorter in the Eastern District Post Office—I live at 8, Drum Yard, Whitechapel—I have been in the office about thirteen months—the prisoner was also in the office, and had been there about eight months—he left at the end of June, I believe—when he was in the office he lodged at my father's house for about three weeks, and slept in the same room with mo—when he left the office I believe he went to Saffron Waldron, and another boy, Robert Alabaster came to his lodgings—after the prisoner had gone to Saffron Waldron, I saw him again on the 29th July in Turner Street, Commercial Road—I was going to the Bethnal Green Office with the 6.30 p.m. mail bag from the Eastern District Office—the prisoner said, "I have been waiting for the boy that is going to the Bethnal Green Office"—that was me—he said, "I wish I could get a bundle of letters, of course it is no use asking you, but I will tell you how to do it, take out your pocket handkerchief and drop it on the bundle, and put them in your pocket"—I replied, "Certainly not, I would not do such a thing"—I asked him what he had got the <hi rend="italic">sack</hi> from Saffron Waldron for, and he would not tell me—he said he had got no money, and I asked him if he was coming back to the District Office some of the boys might lend him two or three halfpence—he said, "It is no use going there"—he went on with me as far as the Bethnal Green Office, and then left me—on the Saturday, I made a communication to the inspector—I met the prisoner on the 5th August in High Street, Whitechapel, between 1 and 2 o'clock—he was talking, to Alabaster at that time—I asked him how ho was, and he said, "All right," he said he had got no work—I never saw him again until he was in custody—when he said, he wished he could get a bundle of letters, he also said, "A pound or thirty shillings would do me through next week"—that was after he mentioned about the pocket handkerchief.</p>

I am a sorter in the Eastern District Post Office—I live with Davis—I have been a sorter about thirteen months—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in the office and he left about the end of June—I saw him at Davis' home on the Monday following the Saturday that he left—Miller, another sorter was there—he is now committed for trial for stealing letters—he was in the same office—I saw the prisoner again on the 28th July between 8 and 9 at night—I was down in the kitchen at supper time and Bensusan came down and gave me a message and I went out and saw the prisoner—there were two other sorters with him when I went up—we spoke together for a little while, and when I was coming away he pulled me on one side by the sleeve and wanted to know whether I would do him a favour—I said it would depend upon what it was—he said "Don't you think you could manage to get me a bundle of letters"—I said I would have nothing to do with anything of the sort—he said "It is very easily done, unbutton your tunic, and when you see nobody looking put a bundle of letters in your pocket and wipe you nose to take off suspicion, and don't keep them longer than you can help in the office, go out in the yard and place them on the parapet on the top of the closet, and let me know when you will be likely to have them, and you can hand them to me"—I said I would have nothing to do with it—our tunics have a pocket just inside—the prisoner said he thought he should try and get back into the service and he should only want to be in about three weeks as he should have sufficient by that time—I saw him again in August in Johnson's dining rooms, High Street, White<lb></lb>chapel—I was having my dinner, and some one tapped me on the shoulder—I looked round and saw the prisoner—after dinner we came out together along High Street, and he told me had not any work, and asked me again to get him a bundle of letters, and he said "I have asked Davis and that fool is no good"—he told me had no work and nothing to keep him, and he said he had not got much of a chance of getting a place, because he had not got a good reference from Saffron Waldron, as he was dismissed—he said one bundle would be sufficient to keep him till he got another place—then we met Davis and I left him.</p>

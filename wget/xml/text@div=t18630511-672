               <p>Soho-square, and saw the prisoner with six or seven others—I was surprised and insulted all at once, and then they assaulted me—I cannot say that I saw the prisoner do anything—they surrounded me, and afterwards knocked me down by a blow on my eye, and then snatched my watch from me and broke the chain—while on the ground I was kicked several times, and beaten with some iron thing which they had on their knuckles—I called, "Police," and they ran away—I saw the prisoner arrested, but I cannot tell that he did anything—I have not seen my watch since—it was silver, and had two keys to it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my chain—the prisoner tried to strike me, but there were too many together, and I cannot say that he did, as there was not time enough before the policeman was called—I could see nobody when I was on the ground, because I very nearly lost my senses—there was a lamp near, which threw a light on the men—the prisoner was taken on the spot.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Through an interpreter</hi>). I was with Milando on 23rd April, at the corner of Dean-street, Soho—we were insulted by six or seven individuals, and then they began to assault us, and attacked us with irons on their hands—I saw the prisoner among them, but did not see him take any part in the assault—he was there at the beginning—I did not see him do anything, or hear him speak.</p>

I was with the last two wit<lb></lb>nesses—some people, among whom was the prisoner, insulted us, and then assaulted us—the prisoner took no part in the assault, but he was insinuating the others to do it—he said, "Go on, go on"—I understand English better than I can speak it—one of them knocked me on the head behind and knocked me down, and gave me a blow on my breast and tried to take my chain, but I sent him backwards with a kick—the prisoner was only two. steps off when Milando was attacked—I called "Police," and they ran away—the prisoner followed the others—the policeman followed him more than the others and took him—I never lost sight of him.</p>

I can speak English—I live at 10, Church-street—on the morning in question I heard a noise, opened my window, and saw a man down on the ground, and four or five people over him, kicking and beating him—I said, "Oh, you cowards to strike a man on the floor," and they ran away—my mistress recognised the man as Milando, and I then went down—the prisoner is one of those who ran away—I called out "Stop thief,' and kept my eye on him all the time, and saw him stopped by the police.</p>

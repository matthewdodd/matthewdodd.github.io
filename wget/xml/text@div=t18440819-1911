                  </hi>. I live at Bedfont. On the 3rd of Aug. I had some clothes to sell—the prisoner came, and took up a jacket—after he had tried it on I said, "Either say you will have the jacket or let me have the money"—he said he would by and bye; the weather was rough, and he had to go and cover the bricks—in about an hour and half he came back again, and said he had put the jacket down with the rest of the clothes—I said, "No you have not, and if you don't give me the money or the jacket I shall call an officer"—I saw one coming, and made towards him—as he was drawing near, the pri<lb></lb>soner made off.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 182.) On Saturday night, the 3rd of August, I went to the prisoner's house, and inquired for him—his wife said he was not at home, and was not coming home that night—I said I knew he was, and at last he came to the window up stairs—he said he would give me the jacket out, and have no more bother about it—I told him he must come down stairs, and I took him into custody—he said he had bought the jacket.</p>

I put them in the looking-glass drawer in the room. The prisoner was in the room; she saw where I put them, and she went out with me, and she returned first. I did not go to that drawer again until the next morning, about half after nine o'clock. The servant was in the room at the time that I missed it. The prisoner was called; I told her what had happened; she said she knew nothing at all of it. I sent for an officer; his name is Kennedy.</p>

            . I live at No. 8, in Monmouth-street, City-road. I went with Mrs. Freeman to get an officer, and then I went with the officer to Mrs. Freeman's house. The prisoner was charged with this; she said that she had three three-shilling pieces given to her. She said that she had not taken any thing from Mrs. Freeman. Mrs. Freeman, she, and I, went into her bed-room; she unlaced her stays, and took a paper from her bosom. She gave me the paper that came from her stays.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in custody on the 10th of August; after the prisoner denied the charge I told her I must search her, as I had got the charge; she said that she had no pockets; she said she had three three-shillings pieces in her hand; she said she had no other money about her or in her bed-room. She put the three three-shilling pieces into my hand; she said she got them of a friend that slept with her the last night; I laid them on the bed. She denied having any more money; Mrs. Wilson insisted upon her being searched and stripped naked. I stepped out of the room; I heard Wilson exclaim, here is the money. She gave me a paper; I went into the room and asked the prisoner was this money found upon you; she said it was, but it was not Mrs. Freeman's. I produce the one-pound note, two dollars, and three three-shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is my note, I know it by a small bit being torn out of it, and it being dated July 14th and one of the three-shilling pieces is marked with a T. I had observed that before.</p>

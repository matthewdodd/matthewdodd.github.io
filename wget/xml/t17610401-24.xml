            . On the 30th of March the prisoner at the bar brought this watch, and wanted to borrow a guinea and half upon it. (producing one.)</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Fell. I am a pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Was you in company with the prisoner in a house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Fell. I asked her whose watch it was; she said it belonged to her husband, and that his name was Stamps, a soldier in one of the hospitals. I said I must keep it till I see the man. I took her to Mr. Fielding, and he committed her to the Roundhouse, and sent down to the hospital, and the man said the watch was none of his. Then the prisoner said she had it from a man that she was in company with the night before, and that she found it on the bed. I advertized it twice, and the prosecutor came and own'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Was you sober, or fuddled?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was quite sober: I was with a friend of mine, and he went to see an acquaintance of his; so we went together.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I live with Mr. Weldern, a carpenter, in St. James's-street.</p>

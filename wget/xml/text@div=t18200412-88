We let one room to a person named Langhall. On the 11th of March, the carpet and rug were on the front parlour floor, the muslin was in a box in the same room, not locked. The blanket and sheet were in the bed-room, the back room on the first floor. My brother, W. Purshouse, lives with me. His coat, waistcoat, and trowsers, were locked in a box in that room. I employed the prisoner daily to work for me. I am a milliner, and she had access to every part of my house. She came to me on the 1st of February, and continued till the 11th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss the articles - A. On Saturday night, the 11th of March, about half-past eight o'clock. I left her in charge of the house while I went to Holborn. the lodger was ill in bed at the time, being near her confinement. I left nobody else in the house except two, small children. I returned before half-past nine o'clock, and she was gone, and my eldest child, who was six years old, was sitting up crying. I did not expect the prisoner to go. I went into the front parlour, and missed the property stated in the indictment, which was there when I left. I was in my brother's room before I went out, his box was then locked. I found it broken open. I did not see her again till the Wednesday following, when I met her by accident. I secured her and sent for an officer. I have seen the carpet, rug, muslin, and sheet since - they were worth 52 s. I knew my brother's things were in his box. I have not seen them since. When I took her she asked me to have mercy on her, and said, without either promises or threats, that she sold the coat, waistcoat, and trowsers, to a Jew for 25 s., in Fishmonger-alley. She lived in Francis-court, Berkley-street.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in King-street, Goswell-street. On Saturday evening, the 11th of March, about nine o'clock, the prisoner came and knocked at the door, and brought a carpet, rug, and blanket, said She was glad I was at home, for she had told my wife, on Tuesday before, that I was to go to buy some goods in Belvedere-place, for the person could not wait, and she had brought something. She represented that she were selling them for her mistress, and asked 15 s. for them. I gave her 14 s. I am positive she is the person - the constable took them away on the Wednesday evening.</p>

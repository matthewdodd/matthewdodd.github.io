Mr. Wilson came to me and told me, the prisoner and he had got a mare which he gave seventeen guineas for at Doncaster, in Yorkshire, which was to be sold that day at Aldridge's repository; he said I might if I chose purchase the mare, and not let it be sold for nothing, at the repository, as horses went then; and the prisoner gave me an order for Aldridge to deliver me the mare on paying his debt, and I was to give him two guineas more. I was bound over to prosecute Aldridge as well as the prisoner. I came back and told him I liked the horse and would give him the two guineas. He gave me half a guinea that day. I paid Mr. Aldridge for the mare three pounds eight shillings and three-pence, and stopped the sale of it, but did not take the mare away till the next day. When I went to fetch the mare, he said the man had been there, who said the mare was his property. I said then give me my money again, I had rather have nothing to do with it. He said, no, the man said it was his, but he had sold it to this gentleman.</p>

               <p>What time did he say he had had her? - He did not say how long, but that he had rode her all the way from Yorkshire.</p>

               <p>Did he take upon himself and appear to you as the real owner? - Yes, and that he had the power to dispose of her as his own. I gave him half a guinea in part of the purchase; I was to bring the other guinea and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060029"></xptr> half to the

               <p>I had been under examinations in Bow-street. Clipson came with another man; they said they would recommend to me an attorney, Mr. Wilson. They told me they understood I had a mare at Mr. Aldridge's; they thought I might want money in the situation I was; that they would lead me any more money one the mare, if I would put it into their care for me. I told them there was a mare at Aldridge's, which I had borrowed three guineas on to pay a debt. I said if they would pay the money and take care of the mare for me, I should be obliged to them. They said they would, and asked me what I wanted. I desired them to give me half a guinea. They said they would, and gave me half a guinea, and said they would give me a guinea and an half more in the afternoon. I understand Clipson lives by going to persons in distress and doing things of this kind.</p>
               <p>To Clipson. He says Wilson first applied to him and told him he understood he had the mare at Aldridge's? - It was impossible Wilson, or I, or the attorney could know any thing of that till he was taken. Wilson was backwards with the prisoner. They came and said he had the mare to sell.</p>
               <p>From the conversation which passed did you understand that Wilson knew of the mare being at Aldridge's before he came there? - He knew nothing of it till he went in; they came out and told me of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg the character of Clipson may be enquired into, whether he has not been detected in such things before. He wished to swindle me out of this mare.</p>

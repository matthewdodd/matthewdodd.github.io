            . I am carter to Samuel Cowley and Henry Hewetson. On the 15th of September I was bringing five bales of sheeting from Hoare's wharf to our warehouse, in Cateaton-street; I met the prisoner on the wharf, whom I had known some years - he had been a carter to Mr. Evans - he is now <rs id="t18260914-395-deflabel2216" type="occupation">patrol of St. Botolph, Aldgate</rs>

I had never said that previous to my going to the Cooper's Arms, he had seen me double it up, and put the lock-chain over it; he must have seen it when he raised himself up - he was near the cloth, and could get it; I went to his house that night - I found his wife at the gin-shop; I went with the officer and found the prisoner on his beat - he denied it to the officer - but when I went up to him, he said, if I went home with him, he would give it to me; I found it there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the officer tell him he had stolen it? A. No; he said, "There has been a waggon robbed - do you know any thing about it?" I did not say. I would give him something to make an apron; I did not think any thing about his putting his hand and foot on the waggon. We drank the beer, and came up as far as Butcher-row, and had some rum; I did not ask the prisoner to hold the whip while I went up Morgan's-rents; I left the whip inside, and he brought it out, but I did not desire him.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I received information from the witness, at a quarter before ten o'clock, and went to the prisoner on his beat, in Nightingale-lane, with Beaman - I went up to the prisoner, and said, "Bates - you are charged with stealing a piece of linen out of a waggon to day;" he said he had not; I then stepped five or six yards back, and Beaman went up, and said."Bates"- I did not hear more, but when they had been in conversation about a minute Bates said, in a louder voice, "Yes, I did take it out of the waggon - if you come home with me you shall have it;" we all three went to his house, and, after searching a few minutes, we found this linen on the floor, at the foot of the stairs, in the lower room - the prisoner took it up. I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you went up did not you charge him with stealing it? A. Yes - the carman knew what he was about - I think he was sober.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector K</hi>). On the night of the 5th De<lb></lb>cember, a few minutes after twelve o'clock, I went to the prisoner's house, 3, Queen's Terrace, Commercial Road, Rotherhithe—I had been to a large fire at Bow Common, and was called from there by Smith, and rode with the salvage corps men on their waggon—when I arrived I found Sherman in the shop—there is a window in the shop door, the shutter of which was driven in, so that there was a large aperture in the door, and the door was found partly open—there were bolts on both sides, and it was still bolted on the back or hinge side, and the socket of the bolt was strained or bent—the shop was full of smoke, and there was a little fire flickering round the gas pendant at the ceiling—some crinolines were hung about the shop suspended to strings—the firemen were at that moment extinguishing a fire under the counter the further end from the shop door, trampling and kicking it—it consisted of paper, a portion of an umbrella, burnt, and the remains of some children's stays, and rags—the fire under the counter was nine feet distant from the fire round the pendant, taking a vertical line, and the face of the counter would prevent any fire falling under it; you have to go round it or over it to look under—there was no fire between the two I have described—I then went upstairs and found a fire on the floor in the front room and firemen extinguishing it—it corresponded with the fire about the pendant downstairs, only that it was larger on the upper side; it was about fifteen inches square, while that underneath was about nine inches by five—the gas pendant was fixed to the rafters of the ceiling—the burner was three feet four inches from the ceiling—the hole imme<lb></lb>diately over the gas pendant was about fifteen inches square and was com<lb></lb>pletely destroyed—the whole of that room was on fire; it was charred all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701070042"></xptr>
               <p>round—there were two beds in that room about two feet from the square hole and within reach of the flames—I then went to the back room and found the paper all stripped down, from the ceiling downwards, and hang<lb></lb>ing in festoons across the door about breast high; it had come clean away from the wall, and the part which had been pasted over the door hung across it; it was as if the paste had been damp, it had come away so easily—before I could get into the room I had to divide the paper by a stroke of my hand, as I could not get in walking upright—I then looked under the bed—there was no fire in that room that I observed, but one of the flooring boards was raised about three-eighths of an inch above the level of the others—this is the board (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I examined it again next day, and found it charred on the under side; it smelt strongly of paraffin, which was on the under side, and the edges of the boards on each side were saturated with paraffin—I saw this rubbish (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) taken from immediately under the board; it was tried there and then, and it burnt as an inflammable oil would burn, though it is ordinary plaster—it still smells strongly—a piece of shaving was also lighted and it burnt—I found the ceiling underneath that place stained with oil to the extent of thirty inches by eighteen—I got a fireman to push a long screwdriver through at that spot, and had a portion of the ceiling cut away with an axe, and have a portion of it here—it smells strongly of paraffin—a piece of it was ignited at the police-court by the Magistrate's order, and it burnt with a clear flame, as gas or oil would burn—I examined the plaister round the gas pendant in front of the shop, and it was in a similar state for about forty-one inches by fifteen (the first place was where the gas pipe goes through to the back of the shop)—I found that that burnt clearly also—the fanlight was obscured by a large piece of board, fastened by two screws at either end, which would prevent the flare of the flame being seen from the street—on the floor of the front kitchen I found some sawdust and small chips of wood, showing that somebody had been at work—I have applied them to the board which was taken down from the fanlight and they correspond—a door was missing from the coal cellar, and I found that it was part of it which was over the fanlight—I found the whole of the door—it had been recently sawn, and I found a saw and sawdust on the cloth of the kitchen table—the fireman handed me, in the parlour on the night of the fire, a bottle of paraffin containing nearly a pint, and I found a paper in a box on the sideboard. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHARLES YOUNG</hi>, <hi rend="italic">solicitor, here proved the service of a notice upon the prisoner, and also upon his solicitort to produce his policy of insurance.</hi>) I read the paper to the inspector of the fire brigade, and the superinten-deut of the salvage corps, and then put it back into the same box—I made a search for it afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a member of the salvage corps which is attached to the insurance office—I saw Inspector Griffin take a paper from a box on the premises and return it to the box—a few hours after that I saw it in the prisoner's hands, he read some portion of it to me, and I never saw it afterwards—I was left in possession.</p>

It was headed "Liverpool, London, and Globe Insurance," and purported to be the insurance of Frederick Bicknell, on his furniture and effects and cooper's tools; but there was a clause that they were not to be used on the premises—the house was stated to be 3, Queen's Terrace, and that it was in trust for his wife, a stay and crinoline manufacturer—the policy was stamped—there was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the furniture and effects, and I think 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the stock in trade, 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the shop fittings and fixtures, and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on cooper's tools, the whole making 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 23rd October was one date, and another was 9th November—I produce a list of the effects in the various rooms, made by a constable and myself, he wrote it while I called them over—those are all the goods which were on the premises—on the night of the fire I saw the prisoner at his house about twenty minutes past one o'clock with his wife, two children, a little servant girl, and two men—he gained access to-the house by the back door—I know that, because I was at the front door, and he did not pass in that way—the salvage corps man called me, and I found the prisoner in the back parlour—I said to him, "Are you the proprietor of this place?"—he said, "I am; this is a mysterious matter; can you account for it? it is a bad job"—I said, "It is to be hoped you are insured?"—he said, "I have been to an office, but it is so recently that I am not sure they will pay me"—I said, "If you have paid your premium and got your receipt and policy they will pay you"—he said, "If they do not I am a ruined man"—we walked about the premises, and there was a good deal of conversation as to where his family should sleep that night—next day I went to the docks with Mr. Rees, who began to ask the prisoner questions—I said, "You had better stop, I am going to apprehend him; I am not allowed to ask him questions, and you cannot do it"—Mr. Rees said, "You are insured in our office; do you mean to make any claim?"—he said, "Of course I must be recompensed" or "compensated for my loss"—I then took him in a cab to Arbour Square Sta<lb></lb>tion and charged him—I found a paraffin lamp, on the night of the fire, stand<lb></lb>ing on the mantelpiece, the chimney was unattached and lay behind the lamp; the fireman raised it and said, "This lamp is empty"—the brass part of the burner was hanging aside loose—these are termed crinolines (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but they are not; the waist is sewn together—these three are entirely saturated.</p>

               <p>had been thrown before I arrived—I do not know how many, but only on the first floor rooms, which were a little wet—the shop was perfectly dry—they had broken two bars from the landing window where there is a cistern, and they had two buckets—these crinolines are <hi rend="italic">dummies</hi>, such as tradesmen hang about—the gas meter is under a framework for goods to be exposed upon, in front of the shop under the window, and the pipe is laid from that—it ascends and runs between the ceiling and the flooring to where the pendant is, and afterwards to where the second batch of paraffin was—the gas pipe was melted—there had been a good deal of fire in the front room when I arrived—the flame had spread through the whole of that room—the fire under the counter was nineteen or twenty feet from the meter—ten persons may have arrived before me—I mean to say that I read the paper so carefully as to tell you the contents—the fire was wholly extinguished then, but I stopped to see the proprietor come home, to judge what I should do—I have used the words "a paper which appeared to be a policy of insurance," because I was not allowed to say that it was a policy, but I know what a policy of insurance is, because I am insured myself—the prisoner came home at twenty minutes to one, and remained about half an hour—he sent his wife away first, and there was a tall gentleman named Strannick; he left the house I think before me—there was a great deal of conversation, and he said he was determined on going to the inspectors of the fire brigade, and they should find him a lodging—I had not drawn his attention to the policy, but I asked him if he was insured—he left saying that he would see the super-intendant, and I left just afterwards—Mr. East came down in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and after a conversation with him I determined to apprehend the prisoner—I found him at his work—he is a foreman cooper at St. Katherine's Docks—his family had gone to 101, East Street, their servant's house—I had a constable to watch them there—I do not know what became of the prisoner—I had a constable to watch him also—he told me that he should go to the fire brigade station, Wellclose Square, and I found that he did so—I have been close upon twenty-one years in the police, and have been to every fire in the district—flame will not often go round corners, but it will follow a gas escape—I have had my attention drawn to many fires, the cause of which was never discovered, and some were very suspicious ones—fires frequently arise from trifling matters—the paraffin lamp on the back parlour mantelpiece, did not appear to have been overturned, there was no paraffin about, nor was the lamp or the glass broken—the shop goes into both rooms, and there is a room built out beyond, which is used as a sitting-room—there were no candles or matches in the shop, they could not have been burnt there unless they were under the counter—this fanlight would shut the view of the flames out from the street, but that would not apply to the fire on the first floor—I saw that on my arrival, and the windows were cracking and flying—the fire originated in two places, lighted within a minute of each other—I should imagine that the fire upstairs was lighted first, a person would not light the downstairs first and go up afterwards, for fear he should not escape.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the salvage corps, and have been attached to the fire brigade nearly nine years—on the 5th of December I was at the fire on Row Common, and from information I re<lb></lb>ceived I went to the prisoner's house about twenty minutes to twelve—the first floor was burning fiercely about the ceiling of the shop, and the floo<lb></lb>ring of the room over it—I managed to put it out, and then returned to the shop and saw a second fire under the counter, twelve or fourteen feet from the level of where the fire was burning on the ceiling—it was a quantity of rubbish and waste paper, and some cuttings like these, used in their busi<lb></lb>ness—I saw some crinolines hanging up, to which paraffin or something of that description had been applied—as no water was to be had, I stamped out the fire under the counter, and kicked it about the place—next morning I saw that the ceiling not only in the front but in the back room was stained, showing that oil or grease of some kind had been used, and a board in the back room was half an inch above the level of the ordinary flooring, showing that it had been lifted up and not properly placed back again—I saw that something had been thrown under it, and each side of the board was marked with oil; if the oil had been placed in while the board laid there the board would have been smothered with it as well—I took out some rubbish, applied a light to it, and it burnt as brightly as a candle, or more so, and so did the plaster ceiling underneath, which I tried a piece of—a piece of paper steeped in paraffin could not burn much fiercer—the fanlight over the door was blocked up—I saw some wood and sawdust in the kitchen corresponding with the wood over the fanlight—there is no doubt that the fire in the ceiling originated in the flooring over the ceiling, but not from the gas, and my impression is that it began between the flooring and the ceiling of the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant warehousckeeper in St. Katherine's Docks, and have been in their employ eleven or twelve years—I am twenty-seven years old—I have known the prisoner almost the whole time, but was not in the habit of going to his house till seven months ago</p>

               <p>—I called there on the night of the fire about twenty minutes to seven to pay a bill for a pair of stays made by his wife, which the girl Margaret had brought to my house a few days previously—his family had left, the girl Lizzy was there, and the prisoner was asleep in the back parlour—I knew he was not well and did not wake him, but sat in the parlour till he awoke—I then offered him the money for the stays, but he said that he would not take it, he never interfered in the business—he was going upstairs to change his clothes, and said, "Do not remain there by yourself, come up with me," and he went into a bedroom over the shop—I went into the room with him and remained while he changed a portion of his clothes, we went down together; he had a lamp which he had taken up with him, but I cannot say whether it was brought down—we went into the back parlour, and he finished dressing himself there—the shop was not closed then, he did not shut up till about nine—he shut it up himself—I saw the girl Stevens there, she brought some ale and steak, I ate a portion of it, he was too ill to eat any, and the girl Stevens ate some—she loft at about half-past nine, and we left about ten—the prisoner shut the shop up—the house was closed, he put up the shutters about nine, but did not close up then, he closed up directly the girl left—when he bolted the door he said, "I do not think it is safe to leave the house like that, it is not secure," and that he had got a board which he had prepared some time before, which was too long, and he would go down in the kitchen and saw an inch off—I did not see him saw it, I did not go down with him, but he brought it up and I held it while he fastened it up over the fanlight—it was done that night because he said that he did not think it was safe to leave the fanlight, as there were many bad characters in front of the house, and the house had not been left empty before—we went out at the back entrance—he was perfectly sober—I saw no ladder, nor any paraffin oil on the floor—the shop seemed secure—he left one gas burner burning in the shop, I cannot say how many burners were alight, but all the burners were not alight, he turned down some, but not all—those which were not turned out were full on I think—I did not see the time, but I should think it was ten or a quarter past, I am sure it was not later—we went into the Commercial Road near Whitechapel Church, and through Aldgate, Leadenhall Street, Cheapside, and Holborn, to Weston's—they had left Weston's, and the prisoner asked a gentleman if they were all out; he said that there might be a few gentlemen left—the prisoner said that most likely he should see his wife at the Exchange waiting for a bus—we went to the Exchange and saw them there at a few minutes after twelve o'clock; I returned with them and went into the house, which was in the possession of the police and the firemen, but the fire was out—from the time I left the house with the prisoner, between ten and a quarter past, till we returned with his wife neither he or I went back to the house.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701070052"></xptr>
               <p>—there was a pair of steps in the shop—I did not know that he cut up a door—I had not been down in the kitchen—he did not go upstairs again after the girl left—I remained in the back parlour—I could not see the staircase from there, but I could hear if he went upstairs ordi<lb></lb>narily—when we went out at the back door he locked it after us and took the key with him—I did not notice anybody as we went out—we did not go into the York Road, but into the Commercial Road—the back door is about ten yards from the Commercial Road—it opens into the York Road, or else we could not leave the house—you get from York Road into the Commercial Road—I saw some crinolines hanging about the shop—I did not notice the ceiling—I went upstairs, because the prisoner said, "Do not stop there by yourself, come up with me"—he changed his clothes soon after I went there—I noticed nothing about the flooring at that time, and I think I should have noticed if it had been raised, because I walked to the window and looked out into the street—I think I can say that the floor was not damaged—he only went up once—I should not like to swear that he did not bring the lamp down with him and blow it out—I am almost positive he blew it out, but I do not remember it—he did not continue to burn it, because there was gas—I do not know where I saw it last, but I think it very probable he brought it down and blew it out—I do not remember whether he took any light when he went down to saw the wood; he must have had the lamp—I cannot remember whether he brought the lamp back when we were screwing the wood up—I have been joint security for him, and a borrower as well, at Aldgate—he was joint security for me when I bor<lb></lb>rowed 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there about three months ago—it is nearly two years ago that I was joint security for him—he renewed it again—it was for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was lent to me when he was security—after the fire I went to business and remained there all day—I did not hear of the prisoner being taken till after four o'clock that day—all the next day I remained at business, and on Friday I went to business in the morning and was taken ill at two o'clock, and obliged to go into one of the waterclosets—I remained there till about half-past three or four o'clock—my illness was the rupture of a blood vessel—I remained in the watercloset on the premises an hour and a half—I vomited blood before I got to the closet—no one came while I was there—besides the vomiting, there were some sores on my arm—I did not show the inspector and the doctor marks and cuts on my arm; I have-a sore place here, and another here—one is a chilblain and the other a boil—I did not afterwards show a wound on my upper arm—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my knife, I have never seen it before—I did not notice it in the closet—on my oath I had not this knife in the closet at the time I was there—I do not see an S on it—I had a doctor previous to seeing the police inspector—I did not write and tell the doctor I had cut my arm by a tin case, I said by a box of fruit—I showed him the sore and told him about my vomiting blood—I did not cut my arm in two or three places in the closet, and it was not from that that the blood came in the closet—I went home after I got out of the closet, and remained at home all day and the next day, but I went up to Mr. Lewis's, at Ely Pluce, the prisoner's attorney, on Monday—I was well enough to do that—I was very bad, but it was necessary, and I went—after that I went back home—I went back to work last Monday week—I did not give Mr. Lewis an <hi rend="italic">anecdote</hi> of what took place—I did not go to the police-court.</p>

               <p>unfortunately the whole family suffer from the complaint—I lost a sister six months ago from decline—the doctor's name is Clark—I actually vomited blood that day—there is no truth in the suggestion of my cutting my arm—on the Thursday, the day after the fire, I went to work as usual, and the prisoner was there—I heard after business that he was apprehended—I was going to leave, with the intention of going to the police-court, and had got as far as I could get, when I was taken with that feeling in my throat, and was so ill in the closet that I was obliged to remain—the doctor saw me next day—I have lived at 2, Wellesley Street, Stepney, four years—I heard of the prisoner's remand and went to Mr. Lewis on Monday, and what was done was under his directions—the prisoner's brother was with Mrs. Bickneli when we met her at the Royal Exchange—the prisoner's house is in Ratcliff, it is a long way from there to Weston's—he and I walked to Weston's—I can say that from the time he and I came down stairs together, before the girl left, he never went up stairs again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Clifton, who is clerk to the Justices of the Petty Sessions. On 4th Aug. I took notes of the depo<lb></lb>sitions of Dickinson and Toll against Godfrey Booker, who was charged with stealing 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the property of Dickinson—Dickinson was sworn, and said, "I am a private in the 19th regiment—last Saturday night I was at Leyton, at the King's Head—I saw the prisoner there—I had five sove<lb></lb>reigns rolled up in a piece of paper, which was in a leather pouch—when I went to bed I hung ray coat over the bed post—the prisoner slept in the next room to me—in the course of the night the prisoner came into my room, and got into the same bed with me—about 6 o'clock yesterday morning I awoke, and saw the prisoner putting his shoes on, and in his hand he had a roll of brown paper, which, I believe, contained my money, and which he put into his pocket—I got up, and examined the pouch, and the money was gone—I dressed, and followed the prisoner, who was moving fast—I followed him to Kingsland—I saw him go into four shops, and sub<lb></lb>sequently into a private house, No. 2, Arundel-cottages, Kingsland—at this time a policeman came up, who went to the house, and I gave the prisoner into custody—I received the five sovereigns from my commanding officer on Saturday—I did not see a policeman in coming from Leyton till I got to Kingsland."</p>

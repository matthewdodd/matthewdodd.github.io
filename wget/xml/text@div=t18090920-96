On Saturday the 15th of July, about half-past nine in the morning, the prisoner came to me at my brother's, No. 6, Smith's buildings, Aldgate, he said to me you are a pretty fellow to keep stables, as you do not attend to them, there has been a gentleman two hours at your stable to look at this mare, I replied I have not been away from the stable five minutes, I am sure it is no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. Only the night before I had the key of my brother's stable, I went back to the stable with him, the mare was safe then, then he told me there was a gentleman in Brick lane wanted to see her. I went with him, and the gentleman did not want to buy, he only wanted her for four days, the prisoner was driving the mare in a chaise at the time, as the gentleman wanted to see her in harness, I told the gentleman my brother would not let the mare, and told Rogers to take her out of harness, and bring her home to the stable; when I went back, I stopped some minutes, the prisoner did not come with the mare.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave him in possession of the mare - A. I did not think but that the man was honest enough to bring back the mare to the stable himself. I waited ten minutes in the stable, I went into Whitechapel, I saw the prisoner with the mare, I said Rogers you bring back the mare directly, he replied, I will, I am only going to speak to a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you bring back the mare yourself - A. It was wrong of me I did not, I saw the mare three days after in the possession of

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Kipps, of Henry-place, Longlane. On 3rd of June, about 9 o'clock at night, I was at Oxford Arms-passage, Warwick-lane, Newgate-street—the prisoner came up to me, and said, did I want her—I said, "No"—she said, "You are wanted down here"—I said, "Who wants me?"—she said, "You go"—I said, "No," and she seized me with her left arm round my neck, and I felt a scratch at the side of my neck—she then threw a quantity of pepper in my face, out of her hand—I then saw her change a razor from her left into her right hand, she cuddled me in tome way with her arms, and I felt the sharp edge of the razor passed all over my throat—I had a shawl and a handkerchief tight round my neck, which were both cut through, but my throat was not cut—it was just scratched, but did not bleed—I think the mark is gone now, but I was cut across the breast—the skin was cut through—it bled a little, but very trifling—I put my hands up with the intention of seizing her arm, and my fingers went across the edge of the razor, and it cut all my fingers, two of them very severely—the top of one of them was very nearly cut off—the prisoner's hands were seized, and I went to the hospital, and had my fingers dressed—my shawl is not here.</p>

Mrs. Pike—there is no Mr. Pike—there were some jealous feelings in my mind as regards my husband's conduct with the prisoner, but the jealousy rested more with my husband than with her—I was more vexed with him from what had been transacted before than I was with her—this was on Monday—I had not been in company with the father and mother of the prisoner on the previous Sunday evening—I went to her father's house on the Monday afternoon—I did not meet the prisoner on the Sunday evening, and have angry conversation with her, but we watched her, and saw her meet my husband—I am certain of that—I was a little beyond Christ Church-passage, and saw the prisoner come there, my husband came from the opposite side of the street—they met in the middle of the road, but directly he saw his mother and me he ran away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you came up with the prisoner had not you and your mother angry conversation with her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We called her a <hi rend="italic">bunter</hi>, for knowing that he was a married man and had four-children—she did not say it was not her fault, but was altogether my husband's fault; she denied it altogether—she did not deny having any improper intimacy with my husband, and say it was him who had followed her; she did not say she had seen him at all that evening—I did not tell her I should like to stab her, I never thought of such a thing; nor did my mother say so—I did not go to the father and mother of the prisoner the next morning; I saw her mother next day, I did not tell</p>

               <p>her her daughter would be soon in Newgate; I said, "I am very sorry to understand that your daughter carries a knife about, but you may depend upon it, that if I saw the knife, I should lock her up"—I had no angry words with the prisoner on this evening before she cut me with the razor; nothing further passed than what 1 have said.</p>

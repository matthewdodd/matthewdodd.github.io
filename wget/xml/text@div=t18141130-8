I lost my gown on Saturday night in this month; I cannot exactly say the day of the month; I lost it out of my bedroom in the two pair of stairs; I missed it about ten o'clock at night; when I went up to bed the sash window was open, and the looking glass was thrown down and broken. I had been up in my room about an hour before; when I left the room the window was shut, and the gown in my box; and when I went up at ten o'clock the gown was gone, and the box was open. I then locked the room door, and brought the key down stairs, and put it in the bar; and when I went up to bed, I took the key with me; and on unlocking the door, and going in the room, I found the window open; it was shut down an hour before, when I left the room. When I saw the window open, I looked about the room; I found the blanket taken off the bed, and hanging half way out of the window; I looked out of the window, and saw the ladder right up against the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any repairs doing at your master's house - A. Yes, they were white washing the staircase, and the ladder was in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. When you locked the door and come down stairs, was it dark? Was the day gone - A Yes, it was about nine o'clock. When I had been in my room before, I took a candle and looked out of my window; I saw a man laying under the ladder in our yard; I went down into the yard, and saw my gown in the yard.</p>

            . I keep the public house; it is in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea. When my servant went up stairs, I was in the bar. It was on Saturday November 12th; she went up stairs between eight and nine to carry her gown up, after it was dark some time; when she came down the key was brought into the bar to me; she went again between tween ten and eleven. I sent her up to bed; in about two minutes she came down again; she came to me; she said somebody had robbed the room; then I went directly into the yard, where I saw the prisoner laying in the yard, under the ladder, on his back, with the gown under his arm, without a hat on. I lifted him up and took this gown from him, and took him into custody. I asked him how he came in the yard; he made me no answer; there was nobody with him as I saw. I got some man to take him to the guardhouse.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300009"></xptr>There was a ladder in my yard; my house was under repair; I had not seen him in the house that night. This is the same gown, I took it from him myself.</p>
               <p>ANN M'INTIRE. I am sure it is my gown. He was laying down in the yard with this gown under his arm.</p>
               <p>- CLARK. I am a constable. I took the prisoner to the guard-room; the gown was given into my charge; I produce it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was quartered in the house twice before. I being in liquor, I met with this in the yard. I slept in the yard an hour, I dare say.</p>

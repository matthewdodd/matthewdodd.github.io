On 29th May, the prisoner came to my house—she asked for apartments for her nephew—it was about 12 o'clock—side said he would come and look at them himself, in the evening—she came again in the evening and said he would not be able to come then, because he was going to the illuminations, and he would come the next day—she came again the next day, and said she would wait till his aunt came to see the apartment—I left her and went out, as I had an engagement—I left her in the front room—I left in the second floor front room my mother's watch and chain, and gold eye glasses—I went out and left her—I am quite sure it is her.</p>

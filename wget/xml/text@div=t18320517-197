I went to the gentleman's house; he said the sixpence was bad - I had but 5d. more out of my wages; I worked that day at Mr. Johnson's - I was not satisfied to lose the sixpence; as I sounded it on the pavement a constable or man came up, and asked if I picked it up - I said No, but it had been refused; he said he should he glad of one hundred of them - I then went to this house to try it.</p>

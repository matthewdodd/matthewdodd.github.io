                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant.</hi>) On Saturday evening, the 26th of Aug., I was on duty at the station in Church-passage, Spitalfields—the prisoner came and asked for two officers named Trew and Bircham, and said he had been waiting for them all day, that Trew had been making an ap<lb></lb>pointment with him to no purpose—I said, "For what purpose?"—he said he had got the man with counterfeit coin—I asked where the man was—he said, "He is now in Elder-street, and has got three pieces about him, which is quite sufficient to obtain his conviction"—he said, "You must do by me as Trew has done"—I said, "What is that?"—he said, "Bring me to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house, and let me go again"—I said, "What occasion is there to bring you to the station if every thing is correct?"—he said, "If I am not brought to the station-house, his friends will say that I have sold him"—I then said, "I don't like this; this is something like entrapping him, don't you call it so?"—he said, "Oh, if you don't like to do it, there are others that will, for I know more about these cases than you do"—I then told him to wait for a few moments—I went out, and when I came back he was gone—about twenty minutes afterwards Nicholls was brought in in custody of Martin and Jackson, two policemen, charged with having three shillings in his possession—sus<lb></lb>pecting him to be the boy the prisoner had alluded to, I gave the policemen instructions to fetch the prisoner—they brought him—I told him I should de<lb></lb>tain him—he said, "I hope not, for you know what I have done"—I then entered the charge against the prisoner and Nicholls—while doing so I heard a scuffle, and saw two officers struggling with the prisoner, who had his hand to his mouth—I heard something rattle against his teeth like pieces of coin, and saw him swallow something—he afterwards asked for some water—Ni<lb></lb>cholls was crying very bitterly, and said to the prisoner, "You know you gave me the money, and told me to wait in Elder-street"—the prisoner made no answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I was seventeen years of age last month—I am a bricklayer, and live at No. 2, Baker's-court, Half Moon-street, Bishopsgate. I am sometimes in the habit of going to the Green Dragon, Bishopsgate-street—on Saturday night, the 26th of Aug., I was there for about a quarter of an hour—the prisoner came in, and sat on the tap-room table—two men came in—he asked them to stand a pint of beer, which they did—I went into the skittle-ground—the prisoner followed me, and asked me to take a walk—I said I did not mind—he took me up to Elder-street, and said, "There is three shillings, put them in your pocket till I come back"—I put them into my pocket—I afterwards looked at them, and found they were bad—I waited about a quarter of an hour, and then went back to the Green Dragon—in about ten minutes the prisoner came in, and said, "Come out and buy some tobacco"—I said, "I shan't, the money is bad"—he said, "Nonsense"—I went out—he took me to Union-street, and two officers came over to me—they took the three shillings out of my waistcoat pocket which the prisoner had given me, and took me into custody—they took me to the station, and afterwards brought the prisoner there too.</p>

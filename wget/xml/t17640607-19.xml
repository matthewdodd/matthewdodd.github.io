            . I am apprentice to Mr. Cuthbert; I was sent to the Bolt and Tun for a box that came out of the country, directed to Mr. Cuthbert: the box was delivered to me by the book-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. It was some time in April last; I do not know the exact time: I was bringing it along Fleet-street; I set it down to rest myself: a woman asked

             to help me up with it on my head (that woman was not the prisoner); he helped me up with it, and followed me: he asked me what was in it, and several other questions. He told me he would give me a spell; so in St. Paul's Church-yard I let him carry it: he turned into Pater-noster-row, and gave me the slip, and got off with it.</p>

            . On the 21st of April in the morning, the prisoner came into my house, in Plough-street, Goodman's-fields; he asked for a coat that lay in his name: I brought it down; he had brought it several times before. He pulled off his coat and waistcoat; he left them with me for ten shillings, and put on what he had pledged before. This being a Saturday, I said, Jacob, I thought you Jews would not touch money on your sabbath. He answered, As to money and a pretty girl, they may be touched at any time.</p>
               <p>Sharp, the owner, living in the country, and not appearing, the property of the coat and waistcoat could not be proved.</p>

On the 29th of October, on coming home, my young man gave me some information, and about two or three o'clock the prisoner came in; the young man was serving her, I sent him away, and attended to her myself. She was looking at cloaks; no other customer was there. I took a piece of lawn, and laid it on the counter, turned away for a moment, and on turning again the lawn was gone, and from her actions I suspected she had it. She bargained for the cloak, and paid 2 s. 6 d. on it in part of 11 s., and had it put away for her; she went out; I followed and took her about fifty yards off, brought her back, and when she got into the shop, I saw her put her hand into her pocket. I said,</p>
               <p>"Do not take it out, you need not throw it down, I know what you have got," I thought I heard something fall behind the counter, and as I took her into the back room, I found the lawn, which was not there when I went after her. I gave her in charge.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Benstead. While he served the prisoner, I attended to another customer five or six yards from her. I saw the lawn on the counter. I stooped to pick up some paper, and as I rose, my master was gone up the shop, and I saw the prisoner take something off the counter, and put it into her pocket. I could not distinguish what it was. I walked up the shop, missed the lawn, and told my master; and on reaching the 2 s. 6 d. to pay for the cloak, she dropped something, stooped, and picked it up. I could not see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040046"></xptr>what it was; she went out; my master followed her and brought her back; the lawn was not then on the floor, for I had just passed the place. My master took her into the parlour, and left her with me while he fetched an officer; she begged hard of me to let her go, saying, it was her first offence, and liquor had got into her head; she did not appear intoxicated. I have heard she is a widow, and has a large family.</p>

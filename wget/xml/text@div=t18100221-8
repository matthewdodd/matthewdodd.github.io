            . I am a constable. On the 27th of January I went to Mrs. Henderson's, she was in the parlour, she told me that she had missed some china.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Henderson. Have you any thing to say against the prisoner. - A. Yes, she robbed me of china, six coffee cups and six saucers, a pair of silk stockings, and a pair of sheets, five yards of India muslin, and a great many articles that is not in the indictment; part of the china she had hid in the garden, and part of them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210008"></xptr>were on the kitchen dresser covered over with a shawl; she fetched them out of the garden herself; the silk stockings I found in a work basket of hers, hanging up in the kitchen; the sheets I found at No. 14, Southampton-place, Camden Town.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to look for them there. - A. She asked my errand boy to carry them there, I went there; she was in confinement then.</p>
               <p>Q. You have nobody here that knows that she ordered them to be carried there. - A. No; I found the India muslin concealed between the sacking of her bed, and the bed; it was new muslin; I did not miss it until I found it; I had seen it about a week before, I kept it locked up in a trunk in the two pair of stairs bed-room. The china had never been used, I kept it in a store closet. The whole of the articles are worth forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell when they were taken - A. No, they might have been taken at different times.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, called six witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

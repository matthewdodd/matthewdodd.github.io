                  </hi>. I am a starch manufacturer, and live at Hercules<lb></lb>Hall, Hercules-buildings, Lambeth. On the morning of 16th Jan., between three and four o'clock, I was awoke by my wife—I opened the bed-room windows and looked down—I saw two men standing at the window below, in the act of raising it—I shouted "Police!"and the men made off across the garden—it was moonlight, and I observed the figures of the men, which corresponded with the prisoners—the room had been used once or twice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a comedian, and live in Hercules-buildings. On this morning I heard a scream from the back of my house, which faces Mr. Brooks'—I ran down-stairs and up a gateway—I sprung a rattle, which brought Wells down—I then saw a man making his way from the back of Mr. Brooks' house, and taking a direction towards the window of a house which is building, to make his way to the road as I suppose—I ran round the gateway, and a constable inside the hoarding had got Simpson in custody—about three-quarters of an hour afterwards I saw Kerrison brought out of the cellar.</p>

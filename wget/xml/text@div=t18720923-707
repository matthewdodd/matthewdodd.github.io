                  </hi>. I live at 27, Charles Street, Hatton Garden, and am a barman out of place—on 23rd September, at 10.30 a. m., I saw the prisoners together—I had seen them once or twice before—I stopped with them at a public-house till 12 o'clock, and then we went for a walk till 4 in the afternoon—we then went into a public-house and had some ale, and then to a coffee-shop and had some tea, all three together—we remained there about half-an-hour, and then went back to the Lion, where we remained about half-an-hour, and then went to the Pilgrim—we left there at 9 or 9.30—I had paid during the day as long as the money lasted—Bott said "We are getting into rough company; you had better take your watch and chain off, and put it in your coat pocket"—I did so, and put it in the inside breast pocket of my coat—we then went into the Boyson Road, where Bott gave me a push and pushed me on to Parker, who fell down on the</p>

               <p>step—I fell on him, and Bott fell on me—Parker then put one handover my mouth, so that I could not call out, and with the other took my watch and chain, out of my pocket—I am sure it was Parker who took the watch, because I felt his hand go across my chest and into my pocket—they got up, and both ran down Red Lion Passage, and I followed them—I missed my watch and chain the moment they had gone—I lost sight of them, and gave information to the police—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not <hi rend="italic">jolly</hi>—I knew what I was doing as well as I do now—we were all <hi rend="italic">jolly</hi> and good-natured together until I lost my watch—we were not particularly sober—the shoving me down seemed to be intentional for the watch to be taken—we had been laughing and <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> each other all day long—I am certain Parker took the watch—I heard him call out something, as they started off running—I saw him the next night before he was taken in custody—I saw Bott on Wednesday evening, but did not give him in custody in consequence of instructions from Ranger—I did not tell the Magistrate that the first time, but I did the second—I pointed Bott out to Ranger, and he said "Let him be till we can get the other one; we are always sure of him, but the other one will take his <hi rend="italic">hook</hi> if we take this one"—I saw him a quarter of a mile from the place, I should think, standing in the open street, talking to some one—I was talking to Ranger this morning, just before I came in—he spoke to me about the case, but not about my evidence.</p>

I am a brush maker of 37, Stanley Street, Batter-sea—the prisoner is my son—on Thursday night, 29th July, I went to bed about 10 o'clock—the prisoner always slept in the same bed with me, and we both undressed together that night—I had a few shillings in a purse in my trousers' pocket, and I put my trousers under my pillow—I had some other property between the bed and the mattrass, which the prisoner knew nothing about—I remember nothing more till I was in the hospital—the prisoner had in the room one suit of black clothes, and a black cloth jacket and waistcoat, and corduroy trousers—the black clothes were the best, but he wore them on week-days usually—when we went to bed this poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), was, I believe, in the fire-place, and this knife, either on the table or in the table drawer in the same room—this razor is mine, it was on the right hand sideboard closed when we went to bed, and the strop with it—I don't know what money the prisoner had that night, but it would be under 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had been to Southend with him the week before, and we stopped at Gravesend every night—there was no quarrel between us before we went to bed, we very seldom quarrelled—I did not lock the bedroom door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—on 30th July, I was fetched to 33, Stanley Street, about 4.45—I went into the first floor front room and found the prosecutor lying on the bed with his head to the foot apparently insensible—his face and chest were covered with blood, and his face was very much swollen—one pillow was saturated with blood, another-pillow was on the ground between the bed and the window, also saturated with blood—there was a knife on the ground, this poker was on a chair on the other side of the bed, near the door; both of them were covered with blood, and there was hair on the poker as well—I afterwards saw a case of two razors on a chair, near the fireplace—there was a table and a couch in the room—I did not examine the razors, but they did not appear to have been used—I did not open them—I found two contused wounds on Drake's right temple and an incised wound on his forehead—the contused wounds could be produced by a poker, and the incised wounds by a knife—his right eye was reduced to a state of pulp, either from pressure or from the end of the poker striking it; it is entirely destroyed—there were three smaller incised wounds on his face; his lower jaw was very much swollen from a severe blow, and blood was oozing from his mouth—one tooth was lying loose in his mouth, and there were two or three teeth about the bed—he had a deep incised wound on his abdomen, below the naval, dividing the skin, and the fatty muscles—the small bone of his right arm was fractured, and there was concussion of the brain from the effects of the blows—he was still losing much blood—I dressed his wounds and then tried to rouse him—all the wounds could be produced by these weapons—it is nearly always the case that persons labouring under concussion of the brain, know nothing about it at the time—I saw the prosecutor's trousers on the couch and noticed blood on the braces which were attached—from the fact of his remembering nothing about it the inference would be that the poker was</p>

               <p>used on his head first and concussion caused, he would then be paralyzed for the time, and the other wounds would be made without resistance—when the concussion passed off the loss of blood would tend to produce sensibility, and he might get out of bed and go to the door and make a noise, but as the blood continued to flow he would become insensible again, and there would be syncope from loss of blood—none of the wounds were dangerous to life individually, but collectively they were.</p>

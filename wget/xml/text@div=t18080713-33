               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, he lodged in my house better than two months before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you keep your watch - A. In the bed room where we sleep; the watch was not locked up, but the money was.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the situation of the window - A. I suppose ten or eleven feet from the ground; there is only one window in that room; the roof of the washhouse runs up sloping about two foot and a half from the window, and there are two beds in the room; the room is too small for two bedsteads; the children's bed is on the floor under the window.</p>

               <p>Q. Then any person getting in that window, must they pass over the bed - A. Yes. My watch was in one of the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your watch - A. On the 30th of May. Before I missed the watch I had him taken; the watch was missed at the time I went up to Queen square with him; I had missed a good many halfpence and penny pieces out of the drawer. On the 30th of May I saw the mark of a man's shoe on the bed quilt, I thought it appeared to be his size. Finding all the copper gone, I went down stairs and took him by the collar and took his shoe off; I compared it with the mark on the bed quilt, I found it corresponded with the mark on the quilt.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130026"></xptr>Q. This washhouse or shed, where was that - A. That was in the back yard belonging to the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any difficulty in getting up that shed to the window - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body belonging to the house might get into the yard - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner sleep at home - A. Generally, for the first month or six weeks he did, and after that he seldom slept at home. I have seen the watch since.</p>
               <p>MRS. HARDEN. Q. You are the wife of the last witness - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner lodged, we understand, with your husband and you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at any time in May at any part of the house with him alone - A. Yes, about a week before he was taken up I was in the tap room with him; he went out, I did not see which way he went; I heard a noise in the bed room almost immediately after he went; I thought I heard somebody walking in the room; I went up stairs; finding the door locked and my husband had got the key, I went into the yard, I could see nobody. In a few minutes afterwards the young man came in from the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of the bed room that day - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the marks on the bed - A. On the 30th of May I saw three of the drawers open; I looked round, I saw somebody had been in at the window; a great many halfpence and penny pieces were taken out of the drawer. I saw the foot mark on the bed. I immediately called my husband up; the window was a little way open.</p>

On Thursday the 26th of May, between three and four o'clock, this watch I took in pledge for two guineas; I believe it was the prisoner, I am not certain; he was dressed in a light coloured drab coat, with a whip in his hand; he had got on a drab coat when I saw him afterwards, of the same kind, it was pawned in the name of

About four o'clock in the afternoon I was putting a clean shirt on; I heard a cry out that the prosecutor had lost some halfpence; I came down, the gentleman pulled my shoe off, he put it to the quilt; he came out for an officer; he told me to go out of the way; I told him I should not go out of the way.

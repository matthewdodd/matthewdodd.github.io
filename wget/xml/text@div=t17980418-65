               <p>Q. When had you first any transaction with him respecting advancing money upon securities? The witness referred to a book.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When were those memorandums made? - A.As they happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180060"></xptr>Mr. Giles. You may refresh your memory with them then.</p>
               <p>On the 21st of March, 1796, he applied to me to sell my stock, and hold Scrip-receipts for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to have the use of the money which the stock produced? - A. The prisoner or his principal; and he deposited Scrip-receipts with me to the amount of 300l.</p>
               <p>Q. How many receipts did he deposit? - A. I do not know whether it was two or three receipts, but there was to the amount of 300l. exactly. The next application was the 18th of February, 1797; I advanced him 2240l. in money, he deposited for that, Scrip-receipts to the amount of 4600l. On the 16th of May, he applied to me again, to sell 1000l. of my Consols; I agreed to it, for which I received 1000l. in Scrip-receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and see if that is the receipt you then received? - A. This is the very one, it is marked.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it in the same plight that it is now? - A. He brought me a receipt with only one payment upon it; I cannot say exactly whether it was that receipt or another; then I opened the receipt, it was folded up; I said, Mr. Reeves, here is only one payment upon this, I should have one paid in full; he accordingly said, oh, so it is; I will get one paid in full, or, I will make it paid in full, I do not know which was-the expression exactly, but it was to that purport.</p>
               <p>Q. This was at the Bank? - A. Yes, in the Three per Cent. office. He then left me, and went, as I thought, to make the payment. In about an hour, he returned, and gave me that very receipt exactly as it is now, and said, there, Mr. Parry, there is one paid in full.</p>
               <p>Q. In what character did he apply to you to make these advances? - A. As a broker, and he appeared to go to his principal always.</p>
               <p>Q. What transaction had you with him afterwards? - A. On the 17th or 18th of July, or thereabouts, I gave him 2000l. Loyalty Loan to sell for me; he told me the same day, he had sold them for 615l. money, and for that money he gave me 1200l. in Scrip-receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. Go on to the time when you received a memorandum of him, state when, and upon what occasion? (shewing him a paper) - A. About the 21st of October, 1797, as near as I can guess, I received this from Mr. Reeves.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand-writing is that paper? - A. I believe it to be the prisoner's hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with his hand-writing? - A. Yes; I have seen him write, and I believe that to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>(It is read.)</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of his giving you this memorandum? - A. It was an agreement, as he told me, between him and his principal.</p>
               <p>Q. What are these 30l. and 15l. mentioned in the memorandum? - A. That was a continuation from different settlement days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make any application to the prisoner for the re-payment of this money, and the delivering up the securities? - A. I applied to him to put them into my name as stock.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the Scrip-receipts to be turned into stock? - A. Yes. He said, I will go and hear what they have to say, meaning, as I supposed, his principals; when he came back again, he used to say, you may as well let it go on for a time, you have got Government security in your hands, and therefore you need not be uneasy about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did permit it to go on? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing occur, and what, to raise any suspicion that this security was not what you believed it to be? - A. Something excited my suspicion, in consequence of which I enquired at the Bank, and found the securities were not what I expected.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. If I understand you right, the first time you saw the receipt it was with one payment? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was returned afterwards, but you do not take upon yourself to swear it was the same that he had given you before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have employed the prisoner to act as a broker for you, in jobbing of Scrip-receipts and stock? - A. I never employed him to buy any but 2000l. Loyalty-loan.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that the Scrip-receipts are marketable in their different stages? - A. I have heard so from the prisoner, never from any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, that when the payments are made up full upon the Scrip-receipts that they are full as marketable as stock, and are marketable even when the Stocks are shut? - A. I took this as such from the prisoner, but never made any enquiry of anybody else.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you understood from Mr. Reeves, or from anybody else, that you could convert the Scrip-receipts into stock? - A. I never made any enquiry about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, from having the possession of Scrip-receipts, that you could convert them into stock at any time? - A. Had they been good, I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Reeves ever induce you, or say any thing to prevent your converting them into stock, during the time you had them? - A. He said, I might as well keep them according to the agreement; his agreement tied me from it.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have done so, and broke your agreement? - A.I might have broke it immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that signature Mr. Johnson's writing? - A. I am satisfied it is not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I observe that you have told us that the first payment is made upon that, and that that first payment is genuine? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your recollection sufficient to say so, or do you derive your knowledge from any other source? - A. I derive my knowledge from a comparison with the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the book here? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do these Scrip-receipts, before the payments are fully made up, pass in the market? - A. They are negociable.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean by that, they are negociable after the first payment? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, when the payments are fully made up, I should suppose, they are more negociable than at first, because the security is better? - A. They may be kept in that state, but it so happens, that they are mostly converted into stock.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your experience in such transactions, it may, and does happen, that receipts, with payments partly made up, are convertable into stock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When they are made up, and the stock is shut, are they not marketable, not withstanding the stock is shut? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in point of fact, they are better security, are they not, during the time the stock is shut, than so much stock? - A. The security at that time could not be given in stock when the books are shut; therefore, if receipts of this kind had been made into stock, prior to their shutting, there would have been no opportunity of negociating that stock.</p>
               <p>Q.Then, in fact, when the payments are fully made up, and a person has the possession of them, during the time the stock is shut up, it is more convenient to those persons who with to job? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. If the time had elapsed, and the payments were not made up, they would not have been negociable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Have any instances come within your knowledge, where the Act of Parliament forfeits the payment, that they have come into the Alley, and are marketable? - A.Those omissions do sometimes happen, but I did not, myself, know of any being negociated in that state.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not the Bank themselves advance money upon it? - A. Yes, they do.</p>
               <p>Q. And what security have they? - A.They take the receipts as a collateral security.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the Bank keep them after the payments are made? - A. There have been instances of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. And after they remain with the Bank, have they been issued out again, and returned to the parties, upon paying the installments? - A.They are always returned to the parties depositing them.</p>
               <p>Q. They may go back again floating into the market? - A. They may.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Do not the Bank regularly make the payments when the installment-day comes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, what the gentleman calls getting back floating into the market, is not in blank, but with the payments filled in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes, when there has been an accidental omission, they have been permitted to make it after the day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where it has been made out to be a clear omission? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know an instance in your life, of five different installments being permitted to be made up, after the whole ought to have been made up? - A. Such a thing might have happened before the time of the report being made to the Treasury of the defaulters; but after that, there are no such<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180062"></xptr>payments, certainly, for any part, or the whole would have been taken.</p>
               <p>Q.Supposing the last to be paid the 26th of October, might the drawer of it have gone and received a year's dividend? - A. He could have received his year's dividend on the 5th of January, 1797.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, supposing it converted into stock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When these receipts are paid up in full, is it not optional for the persons who pay them up, to keep them out as long as they please? - A. I know no limitation.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they not very often in circulation for a twelvemonth, or two years, after the whole of the payments are made up, before they are made stock of? - A. I believe it may have happened so.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I need hardly ask you whether, if the first payment is genuine, that does not give credit to the paper, and to the payments made? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JOHNSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. Q. You were one of the entering clerks of the Bank in the year 1797? - A. I was; I am now one of the cashiers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. As entering clerk of the Bank, do you give security for your situation? - A. All the Bank clerks give security.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. Q. Look at the name of Johnson signed to the second receipt of that paper, and tell me if it is your hand-writing? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know to what extent the circulation of Scrip-receipts, in the market, extends-nearly as much as Banknotes? - A. It depends upon the quantity in the market; there are a great number of them circulated in the market.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know Mr. Mullens's handwriting? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is the signature to that his handwriting? - A. I think not; it appears to me not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I propose to ask Mr. Mullens whether it is his signature; he was rejected upon the former trial; I only offer him that the Jury may see we keep nothing back; if he is objected to we shall not call him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I certainly object to him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. Q. Did you, after Mr. Reeves was in custody, go to his house, with any of the Bow-street officers, and search it? - A. I did; and found these Scrip receipts in a bureau. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the amount of them is? - A.Something more than 28 or 29000l. all of them have the first payments only made up genuine, the rest are all blank.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. (To Aslee.) Q.Look at these Scrip-receipts? - A. They are all genuine, and are receipts for the first payment only.</p>
               <p>Tomlinson. I found them in October 1797.</p>
               <p>Q. Then those payments, which were not made, were all forfeited? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. KAYE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I attended on the 30th of October, 1797, when Mr. Reeves was examined upon the subject of those receipts that had been passed to Mr. Parry, there were two receipts produced, the one stated in this indictment, and another, I pressed him very much to know from whom he had received them; his answer was, he did not know, he had got no entry, or account of it; he stated his having paid a continuation interest to Mr. Parry, from the November preceding, up to October, about eleven months, amounting to from twenty to thirty per cent. according to the different settlements that had been made.</p>
               <p>Q.Did that statement, that he had paid a continuation interest, lead you to put any question to him? - A. I said, you being a clerk in the Bank, and a Stock-broker, must know, that in 1797, you could have carried these Scrip-receipts and paid them into the Bank as stock, at any hour; he said, he knew that; I said, and that you would then have been entitled to have received a year's dividend upon them; he said, yes; I then said, what could be your inducement to pay from twenty to thirty per cent continuation interest, when you could have turned these receipts into stock, and sold them for the money you borrowed, and you would have had a year's interest in addition; he said, he had no inducement, and seemed very much agitated; I repeated it several times, half-a-dozen times, I suppose, and he repeated four or five times the same answers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You pressed him very strongly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hold out any inducement to him to say what he did? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any threat? - A. No.(The receept is read).</p>

               <p>"Entered W. Johnson."</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. My Lord, It seems to me that there is an objection in this case, which must be fatal to it. Your Lordships observe this is an Act, the title of which is, for raising a sum of seven million and a half by way of Annuities, and it states that that Act passed the legislature on the 14th of May, 1796. Now it appears upon the face of this instrument, that the only date there is to be found, is the 26th of April, 1796. It seems to me, my Lord, that that is a payment made before the passing of the Act of Parliament, which creates a punishment upon any person who shall be found guilty of forging an instrument of this sort, and therefore cannot be a felony and forgery by this Act of Parliament. Neither the indictment, nor the instrument itself, bears any other date than the 26th of April, your Lordship will therefore be bound to see, whether, in this case, you can have reference to this Act of Parliament upon which the indictment is founded.</p>

               <p>My Lords, your Lordships would probably ask me why I presume the 26th of April was the date as appropriate to the second payment, or the third payment, or any other payment, stated upon the instrument itself. It is not for me to contend, that your Lordship is bound down by the 26th of April, but it seems to me, that it is quite sufficient for me to contend, that if there be no date upon the face of the thing, as applicable to any of the receipts, so stated upon that paper-writing, your Lordships will not presume a date against the prisoner at the bar, unless you feel yourselves bound so to do.</p>
               <p>Lord Kenyon. This is for uttering, now the uttering was long since that day in May.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I was aware your Lordship would see that. But does your Lordship think you can go out of the record itself, and out of the thing itself, as it is stated upon the paper-writing, and let in parole-testimony to explain that writing; or is not your Lordship of opinion, that it must appear distinctly upon the face of the writing itself, and cannot derive any assistance from any parole testimony which may be given upon the occasion. With respect to Forgeries, I apprehend, wherever a date is stated upon the record, and the instrument is stated to be forged, it is for my learned friend to shew that that forgery was committed upon the day stated in the indictment, and in the instrument itself. I trust, that in this case, if there is in any date appearing upon it, your Lordship will have resort to that date, and will not feel inclined to be assisted by any evidence of a parole nature.(Mr. Raine said a few words on the same side.)</p>
               <p>Lord Kenyon. If an indictment states an instrument of any date, the instrument produced must correspond with it; but there can be no doubt that a forgery may be committed upon an instrument which has no date, and if it appears that this was uttered after the time of the passing of the Act, does not that do away the objection? - I see nothing at all in the objection.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.(To Aslee) Prior to the date of the Act, were there not receipts for the Loan of seven millions and a half issued by the Bank - cannot the whole of the payments be made at one time? - A.Certainly they can. But in that case, the mode of giving the receipt is different. Supposing any gentleman had come between the day of the deposit and the 26th of May to make a payment in full, the lower parts would have been scratched through, and the whole amount then paid would have been written.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. To make it agreeable to the Act? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. I humbly crave leave to say a few words. My Lord, I have known Mr. Parry a considerable time, and transacted a great deal of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180064"></xptr>business for him. My Lord, the receipts that I gave Mr. Parry I took in the common course of business from the Stock Exchange; I will bring gentlemen from the Stock Exchange, to shew that Scrip-receipts are taken without taking any notice of them. Mr. Parry attended almost every day for a twelve-month before this took place; he always found me in business; I was not a day from the Bank, and if I had been guilty of the crime of forgery, or of uttering, knowing to be forged, is it possible for you, my Lord, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, to suppose that I should have continued in my situation at the Bank? I hope, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, before you give a verdict, before you consign a fellow creature to the grave, I hope you will pause well, and consider, before you find me guilty of such a crime. There is no proof of any thing of the kind; and, if I had been guilty, is it possible to suppose, I should have been found attending my business, even to the very minute that I was apprehended? These receipts go as current as Bank-notes at the Stock Exchange. Mr. Parry was attending there himself every day, and knew as much of the business as I did myself. I now throw myself upon the mercy of your Lordship and the Jury, humbly craving that, through God Almighty's power, I shall receive a verdict of not guilty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.(To Mr. Kaye.) I believe Mr. Reeves was, in point of fact, sent for to the Bank, and came when he was sent for? - A. He came with the person who went for him.</p>

             sworn. - I am a stock broker.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the traffic of Scrip in the market? - A.Perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q.How long have you been a broker? - A. Between thirty and forty years.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the business of purchasing Scrip in the market, and selling it, requires a great deal of expedition? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is the office open? - A. From ten o'clock till half past three.</p>
               <p>Q. Every thing that is done, is done in a very great hurry and confusion? - A. Yes, very much so indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think a person might keep a regular account of the Scrip he bought or sold on a particular day? - A. I do not. I mix them all together, take them to the banker's, and there deposit them, without taking any account of the numbers.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Reeves? - A.Seven or eight years; I remember him when he was a clerk in the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character for honesty? - A. I never heard any thing against his character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You do not take the numbers so that you know that you have No. 3, from such a one, and No.6, from such a one? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, you keep no account at all? - A. I take an account of the thousands, but not of the numbers.</p>
               <p>Q. So that if you had bought of me, upon any given day, 1000l. or 10,000l. Scrip, you would have been able to say, I bought 10,000l. of Mr. Garrow on Monday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, whether it was No. 6, No.7, or No.8, you could not tell; but the amount, and who you bought it of, you would know? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, you sometimes borrow money, and borrow stock, upon the deposit of Scrip - do you ever do that? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have any difficulty, in that case, to name your principal? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.Suppose I say, Mr. Johnson, be so good as borrow me 10,000l. upon these Scrip-receipts; you go to your banker, deposit them, and get 10,000l. a month; afterwards, if the banker wanted to know who your principal was, you could tell him? - A. I should tell him he had no business with it.</p>
               <p>Q. But suppose he did say so; supposing, for the end of public justice, it was necessary that you should, you would have no difficulty in knowing who your principle was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your books would tell it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Are these transactions conducted with any degree of hurry and bustle? - A. A wonderful deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, perhaps, it is not easy to keep a regular account of such transactions? - A. I think it impossible</p>
               <p>Q. Are they easy negociable securities? - A. Perfectly easy.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe they are negociable when the Stocks are shut? - A.They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, they are a more marketable commodity than the transfer of stock? - A. Certainly; because we cannot get stock when the Stocks are shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever known any error creep into these transactions, in consequence of hurry and bustle? - A. I have, sometimes, bought Scrip where I had bought four papers, and only three have appeared.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these receipts negociable when all the payments are made up? - A. They are.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Do jobbers keep books? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Possibly those books contain an account of purchases and sales? - A. In my book I take an account of the transactions.</p>
               <p>Q. If you buy, you record that; if you sell, you record that? - A. If it is for a future day I put the sum and the name.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had bought 10,000l. stock, could you not have told the next day who you had it of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it to be a common thing to keep Scrip-receipts, upon which the full payments have been made, floating in the market? - A. It is very frequently the case.</p>
               <p>Q. For many months? - A. I have never kept them so long.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever kept them so long as to lose a great deal of money by not having a dividend? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you possibly suppose an inducement for any man to do that if the receipt is genuine? - A. I cannot.</p>

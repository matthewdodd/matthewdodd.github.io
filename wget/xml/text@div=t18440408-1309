                  </hi>. I live at Thames Bank, Westminster. In July I had a bone and cart to dispose of—the prisoner came and asked if I had got it to sell—I said I had—he said he was sent by his master, a wine-merchant, in the Mile-end-road, he wanted a horse, cart, and harness—I drove it that way—he ordered me to pull up, and said if I would drive down there he thought his master would buy it—I said if he thought his master would give a fair value for it I would drive it there—I agreed to give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if his master bought it—I went to No. 9, Percival-buildings—his master was not in—he said he would fetch him from the wine-vaults—presently a young gentleman, who I supposed to be his master, came up—it turned out to be Edward Proc<lb></lb>ter—he said, "You are the gentleman that has got the' horse and cart to dis-pose of?"—he looked at it, and we agreed for twelve guineas—I expected to receive money and nothing else—neither bill nor money were mentioned—when we were at the stable he said, "If you will walk up to my residence I will settle with you"—I made several objections, because he wanted me to take a bill—the bargain was for guineas—I took the bill after some persua<lb></lb>sion—I sold the cart for this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the money was never paid—the horse and cart was all I got my living by—I should never have on any terms accepted the bill but for the representation of his master being a wine-merchant and a gentleman.</p>

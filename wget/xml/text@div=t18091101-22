On Saturday the 14th of October I received information which led me to secrete myself and watch on Sunday morning the 15th between nine and ten, I saw him unlock the door and enter the warehouse, he remained there about six minutes he then came out double locked the door as he found it; opened the street door very cautiously and shut it softly; I communicated what I had seen to my partner, and on the following morning which was the Monday, I locked my partner in this warehouse, I saw him secrete himself, I remained on the stairs as before, and saw him enter, my partner will tell you that he stole velvit that morning, I saw him come out after being there about six minutes, he went out of the street door in a cautious way. I immediately opened the warehouse door my partner told me he had stolen about five or six yards of velveteen; which he put in his breeches; we suffered him to escape with this also; on the next morning I saw him enter the warehouse in the same cautionary way, my partner being situated under the table as before, he came out after being there about five minutes I lost no time, opened the door and asked my partner what he had taken, he said boot legs and straps, I immediately opened the street door and pursued him, I collared him, and said your hour is come at last, and delivered him up to Mr. Atkins, the officer who was waiting with his brother in the neighbourhood, we took him to a public house, and searched him, found the boot legs, and some canvas, in his breeches, and the back straps in his coat pocket, and some candles, which he took out of the accounting house, in his other pocket.</p>

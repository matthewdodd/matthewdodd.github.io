At half-past six o'clock on the night of the 9th of September I locked them all up safe; and at half-past nine the same night a Policeman spoke to me, and I went to the corner house, in Henry-street - the Policeman unlocked the door, and we went in; I found eight squares of glass taken out of the back door, and some out of the sashes in the back parlour; the lines were cut, the sashes taken out of the frames, and the glass cut out, and laid on the sideboard; we found the prisoner in the cellar- the property was worth about 4l. 10s.; it belonged to

On the 9th of September I and my brother officer were on duty,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180077"></xptr>at half-past nine o'clock, at Bromley; we saw a light in this shop; we went, looked in, and saw the prisoner standing in the shop; we went round the house, and then told White - we went, and found the glass as he describes, and the prisoner in the cellar - there was nothing on him but a knife, which had been cutting wet putty - there was putty on it.</p>

             (Police-constable K 68.) I found the knife on the prisoner, and this chisel we found at the cellar entry, where the persons came out to make their escape - there were two persons there - one made his escape, and the prisoner was coming out; I went up to him, and told him if he came out I would split his head - he then went back into the cellar, and pretended to be drunk; this glass was taken out of the next house; the knife was in his pocket, with some fresh putty on it.</p>

             sworn. - I went to the Savoy for a pint of beer, and while I was waiting for it, I saw a soldier under the gateway, and these two girls crying; I asked what was the matter, they told me, the soldier had taken this shawl; I asked him, if he had got the girl's shawl, to give it her, he made no answer, but took to his heels, and ran into the watch-box; I stood about four yards off, and saw him pull the shawl out of his jacket, and give it to the watchman, and he put it in his left hand pocket; I said to the watchman, the soldier has robbed the two girls of their shawl: he cried, blood and hounds, and brought him up to the gateway, and searched him; there was nothing found upon him. The soldier then beat the two girls violently with his jacket, which he had in his hand; I said to the watchman, you have got the shawl in your pocket, remember; and he up with his fist and struck me; I repeated it, and he struck me again; he struck me three times. The woman, who keeps the snuff shop at the corner of the gateway, ordered the watchman to take the soldier to the watch-house, to be properly searched, which he did; I followed, but could not get in till the property was found.</p>
               <p>- LINDSAY sworn. - I am a constable of St. Mary-le-Strand: On the 12th of December, at eleven at night, the two prisoners were brought to the watch-house, and the prosecutrix and her fellow servant came in; the prosecutrix gave charge of Robertson for stealing her shawl. I asked Robertson what he had to say to the change; he said, he knew nothing at all of it; I ordered him to strip, and search him, but found nothing upon him. The beadle said, it would be proper to search the watchman; the watchman said, do you suspect me; then I ordered him to strip; he took off his watchcoat, and threw it on the ground, and put his hands in his waistcoat pockets, and said, now search me; I took up the watch-coat, and found the shawl in the pocket where he keeps his rattle; I then said, I shall take charge of both of you. The watchman said, never fear, I shall get through it.(The shawl was produced, and deposed to by the prosesecutrix).</p>

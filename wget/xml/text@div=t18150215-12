In consequence of suspicion, we had two officers in waiting for the prisoner to take him, of the name of Armstrong; they searched him. We asked him if he had any property of my father's about him; he said no. On searching him, they found a bag concealed in his breeches; he said it was his master's property. He was taken to Worship-street office that evening, and brought up again on the Monday following. The officer searched his house. We asked the if there was any thing at his house that belonged to my father; he said no. We found at the prisoner's house eleven pieces of canvas, three bags, and one blanket. The prisoner was shewn them at the office; I know them to be the property of my father, and the prisoner said they were the property of my father. The prisoner told us where his house was, and at his house we found his wife and four children.</p>

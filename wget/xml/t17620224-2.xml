I returned again in the evening; but I did not miss the shirt till the next morning, and then I looked for it, but could not find it. I suspected the prisoner at the bar of taking it, as she came often to the house, and I had no reason to suspect any body else. I got a warrant to search, and, upon inquiry, finding the prisoner, I charged her with having taken the shirt. She at first denied it, afterwards she owned she had taken the shirt, and pawned it at Mr. Brooks's for 4 s. Where I found it. This is the shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. What means did you use to induce her to confess it?</p>
               <p>E. Best. I promised to be as favourable as I could.</p>

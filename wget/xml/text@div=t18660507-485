                  </hi>. I live at Lyndhurst, in Hampshire—in January, 1862, I had an account at Drummond's, in London—at that time I was indebted to Messrs. Brown, Gould, and Co. 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in January, 1862, I received this account by the post—I then addressed this cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in favour of Brown, Gould, and Co.—I put it in an envelope with the account—I addressed it to Messrs. Brown, Gould, and Co. Bouverie-street, London—I do not think I enclosed a letter—I received the account back a day or two after, receipted as it is now with a stamp. I am quite sure it was a receipt for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and not as it is new—the number corresponds—after I received the receipt, I did not receive any accounts whatever, applying for the money—I heard nothing more of it—in April, 1865, my bankers sent me the cheque—I thought they had more money in their hands—it was in April, 1865, that I discovered the cheque had been altered—it had remained at the bankers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Brown, Gould, and Co. Cranbourne-street, Leicester-square—in 1862 we carried on business in Bouverie-street, Fleet-street, and the prisoner was then in our service as clerk—we had three rooms there—Mr. Skelton was the landlords—there was a letter-box, which was usually kept locked, and of which Mr. Skelton kept the key—he would give the letters to us or to the prisoner, whoever arrived first—the prisoner was usually there first—I believe we had a boy at that</p>

I believe to be in the prisoner's writing—these two bank notes for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. are endorsed "William Carter, 2, Terrace, Walworth-road, South," and I believe that to be the prisoner's writing, only it is more disguised—the prisoner, as our clerk, would have access to the books—in March, 1862, I made out a list of accounts that were owing to us, amongst those Mrs. Philip son's was included—in the ordinary course of business those accounts would be sent by post—the prisoner would post them—in December, 1862, or January, 1863, I made out fresh accounts, and Mrs. Philip son's was included in those—they were given to the prisoner to post—in February, 1863, he spoke to me about Mrs. Philip son's mother—it was the beginning of February—he said that a tall, well-dressed lady had called the previous evening, after we had left business, and paid the account, and he gave me the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash—he said he did not think it was Mrs. Philipson—he remained in our service up to April, 1864.</p>

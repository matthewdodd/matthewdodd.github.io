                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of Victoria Road, Deptford—on Saturday, 11th October last, about 2.5 p.m., I drove up to the Derwent Arms, Glengall Road, Peckham—I went inside the house, leaving the horse and cart in charge of a man named Barnet, who came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187912020033"></xptr>
               <p>up with me—I was there about 20 minutes, and when I came out the horse and cart were gone—somebody had called Barnet into the house soon after I went in, leaving no one in change of it—I looked up and down the road, but there is a bend in it, and I just saw the head of the horse going round the bend enough to recognise it—the prisoner was leading it—I sent Barnet after it, and I followed—the prisoner ran away—I and Barnet jumped up in the cart, and we pulled up at the first public-house to see if he were there—he Was in the front bar—I called him out and said "I want you, my man; what were you going to do with my pony and trap if you had got away with it?"—he said "I was going to take it to the greenyard; it has been standing outside four hours"—I said "You are a pretty body to take anything to the greenyard; who authorised you to take things to the greenyard?"—I took hold of him, and said "I don't believe your tale; I shall take you there first"—he said "Do not take me there, let me go"—I said "No, I shall take you there"—he began to scuffle—I took hold of the sleeve of his coat and then let go of him and said, "I can run as fast as you, and you will not get out of my sight; you are just as safe out of my hands as you are in"—he ran away over the bridge, and I followed him for about 20 minutes—he ran up one street and down another—Barnet was with me when we got to one street—he said "If you follow me down here I will make it warm for you," and three men and a woman dropped on to us—I don't know the name of the street—there was such a row—the prisoner then bolted round the corner into Camden street, and hid himself in a front court—a constable came up, and I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant P</hi>). On 11th October the prisoner was given in charge by the last witness for stealing a horse and cart—I told him the charge; he said nothing at the time, but on the way to the station he said, "I have been made the victim of a practical joke; a man a perfect stranger to me, whom I shall not know again, told me to take the nosebag off and bring the horse and cart to him at the Waterman's Arms; I did so, and as I was going along I saw the man coming after me, so I ran away as I knew it was a serious charge against me"—at the station he gave the name and address of King, Praed Street, Liverpool—I said, "When did you come from Liverpool?"—he said, "This morning"—I said, "By what line?"—he said, "The London, Chatham, and Dover."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had only come out of prison that morning, and I went down to Peckham, where I had my lodgings. The people had gone from my lodgings, and I went over to this public-house to see where they had gone to, and I was asked by a man to take this horse and cart down to the public-house, and the man came and asked where I was taking it to, and I told him, and he took it away from me. I went down to the public-house and they both came there. If I had wanted to steal it I should have jumped in and driven it away. I have been laid up nine months with a diseased heart and congestion of the lungs, and I am sure I can't run. You can have the doctor's evidence; I was in the infirmary the whole of the nine months, and I am under the doctor's hands now. I am innocent.</p>

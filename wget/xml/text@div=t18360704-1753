                  </hi>. I am a police-constable. I was on duty on the 29th of June, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, in Kentstreet, Surrey. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> person was given into my charge, for stealing a boot<lb></lb>leg—I had seen nothing of it myself—I took the man out of a public-house—I do not know him—he was taken before a Magistrate, but I for<lb></lb>get his name—after I had taken him into custody, he began to be very ob<lb></lb>streperous, and would not go with me—he said he would not be taken by</p>

               <p>me, and he put his hand up, and was going to strike me—my brother-cons<lb></lb>table, Walkins, came up, and a number of persons assembled round us—he was very obstreperous, and then the prisoner came out along with a great number more who assembled round, and said, "Don's he taken by the b—y r—s," or ruffians—that excited the people very much, and Watkins said, "Hold the prisoner fast," and he made a rush to get hold of Canman, because he was exciting the people—in consequence of that, he said, "Hold fast the prisoner, I am going after that fellow"—and I saw him catch hold of the prisoner just by the curb-stone—they both went in together, into the door-way, and I did not see what was done—this was in the street—I had brought the man out of the public-house, and then the mob came round us—I had not seen the prisoner in the house—I saw him first in the street among the mob—I was dressed as a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable. I was on duty in Kent-street on this night—I saw a great mob of people collected together—I went down the street, and there was Arman in the midst of them, with a prisoner in his possession—he said he had got him in custody for stealing a boot-leg—the man put up his hand to strike Arman, and I took hold of his collar to take him to the station-house—the prisoner excited the mob, by calling us b—s and vagabonds—I told Arman to hold his prisoner tight, and I went after Canman—he excited them to resene the prisoner, not to let him go—to leg the policeman, and not let the man be taken by us—he broke from the mob and went towards his own house, and I after him—I caught hold of his left shoulder, and we both went into the pas<lb></lb>sage of his own house, and he intentionally shoved an awl, similar to this, into my side, here—I left go of him, to draw my truncheon, and he ran up-stairs—I called three young men in to assist me, and he said if I came up-stairs he would take my life away—I found my wounds smart, and went into a leather-cutter's shop, who had given the first prisoner into custody, and undid my coat—I examined the wound, and it was tricking down with blood—I came outside, and saw four brother officers going on night duty—I went back to the shop, and the prisoner was sitting on the hence at work at shoe-making—he had got the awl then through the heel of a boot—I took him into custody, and took him to the station-house—I went to Mr. Odling, who gave me some physic, and ordered me to poultice my side.</p>

               <p>not seen him over night—I examined his side, and found a small wound about the size of a pea, on his left side, it seemed very much inflamed—he complained of a great deal of pain and pressure about the part, and said it also affected his breathing—I could not probe it to judge of the depth—I should say, decidedly, from the account he gave me, that it might have been dangerous—it might have been serous—I visited him till he was convalescent—till Monday—I saw him more than twice—he was not confined—I ordered him leeches and fomentations—there were symptoms of inflammation of the lungs when I saw him—the wound was in the left side, near his ribs—I should suppose between the sixth and seventh rib.</p>

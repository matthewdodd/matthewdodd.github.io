               <p>Q. Before you put any question to the prisoner, had you told him it would be better for him? - A. I made use of neither promise nor threat; I desired him to produce what property of mine he had in his possession, which, after some hesitation, he did; he took three wine-glasses from each of his coat pockets; I then sent for a constable to take him into custody, and to search him.</p>

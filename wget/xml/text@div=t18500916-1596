                  </hi>. I live in York-street, Westminster. The prisoner was in my service to carry out milk—she was to serve the customers, and give me an account in the evening of what she had served in the day, and to give me the money she had received—she went out every day, and I took the account generally every night—I always took the account down from what she told me—Sarah Morgan used to deal with me for milk, and used to pay every Saturday afternoon—I have an account which the prisoner gave me of Sarah Morgan's account—on 10th Aug. she gave me an account of 6 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 3rd Aug. 5 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and on 27th July, 6 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but the prisoner did not pay me them.</p>

On the 8th of October, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for four pounds of candles, which came to 4s. 2d.; she tendered me a 1l. bank note. I observed it was dated the 13th of August, and having taken two forged notes of that date sometime before, I suspected that was one of the same stamp. I asked her where she lived. She said her name was Smith, and she lived at No. 16, Love-lane, which I wrote on the note in her presence-(looking at one). This is it; it has my writing on it.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then - A. I told her I suspected it was a forgery, and I must detain it. I desired her to walk in, and sent for an officer. Gandar came and took her in a few minutes. I told him, in her presence, the circumstance of my having taken two forged notes before, and I suspected that also was a forgery. She said she hoped it was not, and appeared a little embarrassed. I then told him I should not give her in charge, but I would accompany him and her, to see if she lived at the place she had described. We all three went out, and went towards Love-lane. I had given Gandar the note.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were going did any conversation pass - A. She was in the officer's custody, I was a few paces behind. The officer turned round to me, and said, in her hearing, that it was of no use to go to the place, as she had told him she did not live there. She was taken into custody, and taken to Shadwell Office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I gave you the note, but gave you no address till I was at the watch-house - A. She gave me the address, and I wrote it on the note before I sent for the officer.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 8th of October I was called to the prosecutrix's house, and found the prisoner there, with the last witness and Mrs. MacCann. Mr. MacCann produced the note, with the name of Smith, No. 16, Love-lane, written on it; it was not dry when I arrived. We went towards Love-lane with the prisoner. When we got about twenty yards from the house, the prisoner said she did not live where she had given the direction to Mr. MacCann. She did not then say where she did live. I took her to the watch-house, searched, and found 7s. or 8s. in silver, and some halfpence, on her, and gave her in charge of the officers. MacCann gave me the note, I marked it-(looking at one). This is it.</p>

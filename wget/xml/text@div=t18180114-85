On the 28th of December I sent him to the one pair of stairs room to put some coals on the fire, which he did; there was a little box in the clock-case, which was in the room, it contained a 5l. note, a guinea, and a 3s. token-the box was locked, and I had the key. I saw no more of him, and did not know where to find him. I missed the box out of the case. On the following Saturday I was informed he was at the prisoner Brooks's house, in Red Lion-court, George-street - I did not know her before; I went there on the Saturday evening, and found him hid under the bed, his aunt pulled him out-Brooks was not there. I knocked at the door, the candle was put out before it was opened; I had seen a light at the window before I got there, and through the key-hole - I insisted on having a light. His aunt asked him what he had done with the box of money; he said he had given it to his sister, who is twenty-two years of age; she was brought to him, and he then said he had not given it to her, but he had hid it in a cellar in a court where Brooks lived - He afterwards said he gave it to Mrs. Brooks. She left her house the very night he was taken. She was taken up on the 7th of January.</p>

            . I am a headborough. Jones's house is in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green. I searched Brooks's premises on the 4th of January - She was not there then; I found two pair of gloves, which Sullivan said was bought out of the guinea that was changed. I apprehended Brooks on the 7th of January, at Bethnalgreen, and found two duplicates upon her; she said she was very sorry for what she had done. I asked her what she had done with the money; she said she had bought a suit of clothes between Sullivan and her own child; a handkerchief, a pair of shoes and a pair of stockings, which she had on her feet; and that she bought her child some things out of the guinea, at Mr. Harford's, at Kingsland; that she changed a 5l. note at Mr. Cotton's, Shoreditch. She said she bought the suit of clothes of a Jew, named Joseph, in Holywell-lane.</p>
               <p>JOHN SAWREY. I am headborough of Shoreditch. I saw Sullivan, I neither threatened or promised him; he said if I would go with him he would tell me all about it; he said four weeks ago he took a 1l. note, and next he took a guinea, and then he took another 1l. note, out of the box, and gave them to Brooks. I asked him about the 5l. note, he said he gave that to Brooks also. I took Brooks, she said she was sorry she had any thing to do with the boy.</p>

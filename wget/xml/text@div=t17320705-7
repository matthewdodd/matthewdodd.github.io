Robins took half a Crown and 6 d. from the Prosecutor, and Sarret took his Hat, and then Barret and I went over the next Field, on the right Hand, and the other went a contrary Way. We lay under a Hedge till break of Day, and then went to an Ale-house in Shore ditch ; I forget the Sign. where we drank 3 or 4 Pots of Beer, and eat some Bread and Cheese. From thence between 6 and 7 in the Morning, we went to Arthur and eat some Beans and Bacon, and at 9, to Mr. Rhodes's in Black-Boy-Alley. While I was at Skittles there, the Hat was sent to Pawn; I think

            . Last Monday, about 2 in the Afternoon, Mrs. Atley told me, a young Man had been at her House, asked for her Husband, and said he wanted to make himself an Evidence, and that he got from his Companions, but could not stay, for fear they should mistrust, but that he would come again in 3 Hours. I found out Mr. Atley ; we took Dangerfield in Field-Lane, and carried him to an Ale-house in Turn-again-Lane; he said he hoped we would help to make him an Evidence, and he gave us the Names of all the rest. We carried him to Wood-Street Compter, and then went to look for the others at Mr. Rhodes's in Chick-Lane. We mist of 'em there, but one Partridge (an Evidence against Barns and Fink) who came from Norman between 10 and 11 at Night, told us, that they were taking a Lodging at the 3 Compasses in Tottenham Court-Road. We were going thither, but met them by the Way, near the End of Hatton-Garden, and took

We carried the former three to Dangerfield in Wood-Street Compter; but Norman being an Evidence, it was thought proper to put him in the Poultry Compter; and in our Way thither, Country Jo past by us. Jo, says Norman what, won't ye speak to us? and so we took him too. When they were carried before Alderman Brocas, and charged with this Robbery, they all fell a crying, and accused Norman.</p>

Robins said the same, and insisted upon it, that he had offer'd himself to be an Evidence before Barret. Country Jo said, that he was but just come out of the Country, and was never concerned in any Robbery before he was acquainted with Norman.

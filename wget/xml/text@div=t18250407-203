I saw the prisoner on the 6th of April, in Mr. Gudgeon's room, which is next to mine; he was there for a quarter of an hour: after he was gone Mr. Gudgeon gave me some information; I looked out of the window, and saw him coming up an alley, with something in his apron; he lives opposite. I went up to my bed-room, and missed two coats of my husband's, which were safe half an hour before. I went for an officer - he returned about twelve o'clock at night; the officer was then gone, but I sent for him, and he took him. - I went the next morning to a pawnbroker's shop, and saw the coats given to the officer.</p>

The prisoner came there on the 6th of April, and staid about half an hour; after he left I thought I saw something in his lap; he had a black apron on; I told Mrs. Young. The prisoner told me at Lambeth-street the following morning, that he had sold the things to a Jew at the bottom of White Lion-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am footman to Joshua Wigley, Bateman, of Albany-road, St. John's-wood, Marylebone. It is his house—on the 18th of Nov. I left my pantry to go to dinner, leaving the window about three inches open,</p>

               <p>about one o'clock in the day—I left the silver tea-pot and sugar-basin in the cupboard—I locked the cupboard-door, left the key in it, and left the pantry door open—I went to the pantry again in about an hour, and found the door shut, but the closet-door wide open, and so was the window, which opened into the garden—I fbund the prisoner with the tea-pot and sugar-basin tied in a handkerchief on the window-ledge—I got out of the area window after him he ran up the area steps—I followed him about 200 yards, and did not lose sight of him—I stopped him, and asked what he had got—he said, Nothing, I might search him if I liked—I held him till the policeman came, and then went to get the tea-pot and basin from the window-cill, where he bad left them, but they were entirely gone, and I missed them from the cupboard—I am sure those I left on the window-ledge were my master's.</p>

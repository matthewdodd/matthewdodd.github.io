             came on the 2d of March to Mrs. Tyson's, where I lodged then, and she asked for a lodging; and we told her there was not room enough, and she said, sooner than go to a strange place she would sit up all night; I did not like to let her sit up all night, I let her sleep in my place, and I went and sleeped along with Mrs. Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before she had lodged there? - About a week before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her your bed? - Yes, for that night. Then she got up about half after six the next morning, and took the things away with her, a gown of mine, and eighteen-pence out of my pocket, and a pair of worsted stockings, and half a white handkerchief, and a patten; she left the other patten, because it was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these things the over night? - I hung my gown across the chair by the fire, before I went to bed; I laid my stockings on the gown; I laid my pocket in the chair, at the foot of the bed; and my landlady found my pocket on the stairs in the same house.</p>
               <p>Q.Then she got up before you was awake? - Yes, before I was awake. We found some of my things on her, I was present, the next day when she was apprehended; we found a pair of stockings of mine, and the patten she had on her foot.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the stockings? - I had mended them a good deal, I know my own work.</p>

She said if I could not make enough of her gown I was welcome to eighteen-pence more, which was in her pocket. The coloured apron Mrs. Tyson gave me to wear while I washed my own; the skirt and stockings I put on by mistake. On Monday morning I was coming to Mrs. Tyson's to ask pardon for what I had done.</p>

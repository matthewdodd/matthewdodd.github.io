Yes; and there are two back doors in Lombard-street, No. 88. and 89: On Tuesday, the 5th of January, I went out to dinner in Grosvenor-place with my wife and family; we returned about three o'clock in the morning; we went into the drawing-room, and saw the sideboard in the dining room, with the different articles of plate that were in daily use upon it; we went to bed about a quarter or half past three; I got up about half past eight; I found that the house had been broke open; I went down to the driling-room, and missed all the plate that usually stood upon the side-board, excepting a mustard pot; I missed a silver tea-pot, &amp;c. (repeating the articles mentioned in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Brookes? - A. My nephew, living in my house; he came home with me in the coach with his great coat on; he hung his great coat upon a deg in the passage of the dining-room, and that was missing; I then made some enqulty among the servants; I went down stairs, and viewed the door of the house leading into Lombard-street; the house extends from Cornhill to Lombard-street; it was evident the lock had been taken off on the inside, because the heads of the bolts which fastened it on, were on the outside in the street, and screwed with nuts on the inside, and the bolt of the door shoots into the door-post, so that the door being double locked, it was impossible to get the door open without taking the lock off; I found the lock lying inside of the house, close to the door; there were appearances, as if something had been used to wrench the lock off; the door was bruised; the bottom hinge of the door that leads to the cellar, was wrenched off, and the bolt that fastened it, had a variety of seratches; apparently in endeavouring to put it back.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any shavings in that cellar? - A. In the cellar of that house there were a great many shavings, because there had been men at work in the house; I then went to the Mansion-house; and got Mr. Canner, the under marshal, to come and view the place; Mr. Canner came with Cartwright and Read.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner, Parsey, taken up? - A. Three or four days after; I had seen him in my house glazing and cleaning the windows; he was journeyman to the glazier that I employed, who lives in Queen-street, Cheapside, and has a shop in Grocer's-alley; the prisoner lived in Chimney Sweepers'-court, Wood-street.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you? - A. A baker, No. 5, Newcourt, Great Bell-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Parsey? - A. Yes; the first time I ever saw him was on the 8th of November last, at a house in Gloucester-court, Whitecross street; there were James Parsey, James Ricketts, Richard White, and two young women; the prisoner said he had been cleaning windows at Mr. Bish's, in Cornhill, that day, and he had got something out of the house that day to the amount of five or six shillings; he made use of many bad expressions, and said, he saw more things in the house, and he would be d - d if he would not have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170051"></xptr>some more before it was long: On Wednesday morning, the 6th of January, about eleven o'clock, I was going up Cornhill; there were some men sticking up bills, by which bills I saw that Mr. Bish's house had been robbed, and it struck me directly that Parsey was the man who had robbed the house; I then went in pursuit of Persey to different places, but did not find him till the Friday; I came up with Parsey, Gill, Raymond, and a person of the name of Holloway, in Barbican; I followed them along Barbican sometime; I heard them talking to each other; Parsey said he had hid two large silver table spoons, half a dozen small spoons, and four guineas, in the cellar of the house in which he lived, in Chimney Sweepers'-court; I followed them a little farther, and Gill wanted to know what I was following them for; he said he was sure I had no business to follow them; I then crossed over the way, and left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Bish's name made use of in that conversation? - A. Parsey said he had been in a good thing in Cornill, at Mr. Bish's house, he had got all the plate out of the house that he saw; he said he was in the house from half past four o'clock in the afternoon, till three in the morning: On the Monday following, I was at a house in Golden-lane; I saw Raymond, Holloway, and Gill, they were angry with each other, that they had not had more of the money that Parsey sold the plate for; Holloway said, if he had known he was to have no more, sooner than he would have taken that, he would have cut his throat; Raymond said, they should have had more, if there had been no noise about the plate that was stolen, and then it was mentioned that Parsey had hid these things in the cellar; then I went to Mr. Bish's, and gave him information of what I had heard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was an acquaintance of your's who kept the house where you first saw the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you creep into the house? - A. I did not creep into it, I walked into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man who kept it, a stranger? -

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say these men entered into a conversation with you, a total staranger, and confessed to you the crimes they had committed? - A. Yes, I do; the first of the business was, they would loss me for some gin and some beer, but with all their tossing and gambling, they could not beat me out of any liquor; one of the women was sent out for gin, and the other for beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, the next morning you went befor the Lord-Mayor, and informed him of this confession? - A. No, I did not.</p>

            upon the feet; he told me he had got into the house about four o'clock in the afternoon; I never saw any other plate but the falt; he said, he had got in at the back door in Lombard-street, and from there he proceeded to a lower apartment, and got under some shavings; during the time he was there, the maid came into the place, and said, I have got some wood somewhere here, but I cannot find it; some man that was there, replied, perhaps it is among the shavings; and the maid said, I am sure it is not there; hesaid, he then concealed himself there till about half past three the next morning; that he then pulled a hinge off the door, by doing which it gave him liberty to go where the property was; that when he got to the plate, he thought he must have left it behind him, by reason he had so much trouble to get the lock off the door; he said, the door was double-locked, and he was obligated to take it off; he said, with a deal of difficulty he did do it, and got safe away with the plate; after he had been at my house some time, the prisoner Gill came in; they consulted together a little while, and then they went away with the property, under Parsey's arm; when they had been gone about an hour and a half, they returned without the property; then they had some sheep's hearts; they stopped about an hour, and then went out again together; I went out, and returned between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and, to my surprise, there were people fighting in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Who were they? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-52-person645">A. </persName>
            Parsey and Gill; I said to them, for God's sake, what is all this noise about? if you are not quiet, and disperse the house, I will send for an officer to take you all up; then Gill said, Parsey owes me a guinea; I said to Parsey, if you owe the man a guinea, give it him; upon that parsey went into my parlour, and pulled out of his pocket ten guineas and four half-guineas; then he put a guineas into my hand to give to Gill, which I did; then he took the remainder of the money, put it in his pocket, and left my house; Gill went away before him; Parsey said, he would give the rest of his money to John Horsley, the only friend he had; Horsley lives next door to my house; Horsley was not there at that time; I was sent for before the Lord-Mayor, and told him what I knew.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not go before the Lord-Mayor till you were sent for? - A. No, I did not.</p>

            Don't you think, as an honest man, it was your duty to have gone to the Lord-Mayor, without waiting to have been sent for? - A. The reason I did not go was, I did not understand it, I had not been long in London; I came from Essex.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not a crime to steal in Essex? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a reward of fifty pounds- you have seen the hand-bills? - A. I don't look forward for that.</p>

               <p>Q. And yet you would have us understand he told you this story about the plate? - A. Yes, by reason of my asking him what he had got there.</p>

               <p>Q. He told you he left the house at half past three in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And thought four hours had elapsed from the time of the robbery till he came to your house, he came with the things in his hand, when he might have taken them home or elsewhere, if he had pleased? - A. He might.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the wife of the last witness? - A. I am.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes, both of them: On the 6th of January, I saw them both at our house, about eight o'clock in the morning; I did not hear any conversation between them; after they had been in some time, they went away together; I did not see them come in, nor I did not see any thing they had; they came in again in the forenoon, stopped a little while, and then went out again; in the afternoon they came in again, when my husband was not at home; they went out backwards to speak to each other; and, after they had spoke to each other, they began to fight, and I was very much frightened; I desired one or two persons that I knew, to prevent their fighting, as I was alone, and in a few minutes my husband came in; I thought they were picking a pocket, and I called to my husband to go and part them, and so he did, and they went out almost directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. That was a queer suspicion - you don't have pockets picked, I hope? - A. I should be very sorry if I had.</p>
               <p>Q. If they had a bundle, I take it you must have seen it? - A. I did not see it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ARMFIELD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know the prisoner, Gill? - A. Yes: On Wednesday, the 6th of January, in the evening, I was at the Black Horse, in Aldersgate-street; Gill asked me to pawn a great coat for him; he said, it had been given to him, and it was too little; I pawned it for four shillings in Aldersgate-street, and he gave me the duplicate for my trouble; after that I wore the coat near three weeks, and then gave it to a woman, of the name of Daly, to pawn it for me for four shillings; I should know it again by a particular mark in the right skirt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What was the coat worth? - A. It might be worth half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. And this gentleman was generous enough to give you a ticket worth six shillings and six-pence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020217-52-person650">Q. </persName>
            You did not think fit to pawn the coat yourself, though you did for your friend? - A. I thought as I had worn it, Mrs. Daly might get as much for it as I did before.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not think if you pawned it your self, it might be the more easily traced to you? - A. No, if I had thought the coat had been stolen, I should not have worn it three weeks publicly in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you lived lately? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-52-person651">A. </persName>

            Would they have let you go away from them? - A. I might have run away from them if I had liked, for I have gone home to my father's every night this week.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in custody yourself? - A. Yes, nine or ten years ago, for playing with some girls in Leicester-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. That was in Tothill-fields bridewell? - A. Yes, I was sent there for a day, and no longer.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been a sword-cutler, and worked for Mr. Allen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect ever being charged by Mr. Allen with any felony? - A. I never was charged by him; he charged another man with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not charge you with stealing a saucepan? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear him charge you with it, in your presence, to-day? - A. Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever been to sea? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sent you to sea? - A. Like many other foolish chaps, I was fond of going to sea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go upon condition of Mr. Allen letting you off? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear him say so to-day? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave him? - A. About my wages.</p>

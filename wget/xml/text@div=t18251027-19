               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you take them or did I give them to you? A. I cannot say, as the fire was raging violently at the time.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoner in the shop - Cox told me to stop him; I brought him back and found a substance in his pocket - he said "That is the property," and gave it to Cox.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Seeing a fire I went and told Mr. Cox of the danger - a person told me to remove some gunpowder - I was removing some other things to the house of Mr. Robinson, and could have taken many things if I had been disposed, but I was not; I removed the boxes or drawers, which had those watches in them, and two watches fell down - I took them up and put them into my pocket, being much confused.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM EDWARDS re-examined. Q. Was he employed to remove things? A. No; there had been orders by the firemen not to remove any thing, which he must have heard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to THOMAS COX. Q. Had I not been employed to remove things before these were taken? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were these watches in a drawer? A. Yes, there was a pile of drawers, and this was the top one; he only moved the gunpowder.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he left the house before he was stopped? A. Yes, he had got two doors off when the constable brought him back.</p>

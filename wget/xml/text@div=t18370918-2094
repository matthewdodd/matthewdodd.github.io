                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a beer-shop in Lower Shadwell, in the parish of St. Paul, Shadwell. I have known the prisoner since the beginning of last March—he is master of a collier—he came to my house, I think, on Thursday the 17th of August, and asked me to lend him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as he had come up in a steam-boat to take charge of a vessel to Sidney, and was going to the brokers—I lent him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he came again next day, and asked if I would advance him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more—I said I had not as much, but would advance him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he came again on Saturday, and asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I wanted what he had got, and could not—he said he was rather intoxicated, and wished to go and lie down—I permitted him to do so, believing him to be respectable—I put him into the first floor front room—the room was locked when I took him up, and I locked him into it—he continued there about two hours and a half—my son had got the key in his pocket, and while he was gone to get me change, the prisoner knocked at the door to come out—I got the carpenter who was repairing the lock to take the bolt off the door, and he was let out—when he came down, I saw he had two frock coats on, and something crammed into his breast—he sat down in the back parlour, and had a bottle of ginger beer, and then went away—the door was locked again as soon as the bolt was put right, and I took the key myself—next morning at eight o'clock I missed out of the drawers a frock coat, a black waistcoat and trowsers, and a silk stock, which belonged to Henry Thompson, a steward on board the <hi rend="italic">Pilot</hi>, and who was at sea—he had left them in my care—I believe the coat to be worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the waistcoat about 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the trowsers about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the stock about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I should know them again—there was a purple stain on the right sleeve of the lining of the frock coat—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the property</hi>)—this is the coat, I have not a doubt—this is the waistcoat, to the best of my belief—I have no private mark on it—I believe the trowsers to be the same.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he was in the habit of borrowing money, might he not have taken the coat with the intention of returning it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my knowledge—I cannot swear he did not intend to return it—he never asked for it.</p>

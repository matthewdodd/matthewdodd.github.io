                  </hi> I am a plumber, and live in East-road, City-road. On the night of the 22nd February, I was passing along Old Gloucester-street, Hoxton, and saw three or four men, (the prisoner was one of them,) standing talking outside the Duke of Gloncester public-house there—I saw a horse and cart at the door—there was no one in the cart then—I crossed, and was going down New Gloucester-street, and then saw the prisoner driving the cart—the horse was going very fast—the prisoner was not doing anything—he had the reins in his hand, I suppose, and the whip—I believe he was flogging the horse at one time, but I was very much agitated when I saw the child in the road—one of the New River men was with me—I ran after the cart, as I saw it was going very fast, and thought some accident might occur—I saw him beat the horse while the cart was going very fast—I am sure I saw him beat it—I saw the deceased child lying in the road, and a person with it—the cart had then gone on—I do think it was out of sight—I took the child to the doctor's—it was bleeding, but very trifling—I cannot say whether there was any other carriage in the street besides the cart the prisoner was driving—I did not observe any—I did not attempt to overtake the cart—my atten<lb></lb>tion was drawn to the child—there were several people assembled, who called out, "Stop him," or something of that kind—when the cart stood by the public-house, there was a dog in it—while the prisoner was in the cart, I saw him turn round to look at his companions who were behind—I think that was just before the child was lying on the ground—I am not certain whether the pri<lb></lb>soner looked back before the accident or after it, but I saw his hand waving at or near about that time I saw the child in the road—I cannot say whether he was trying to stop the horse or not, I was so agitated—my attention these more on the child than looking after the man—I dare say I recollected these facts the next day when before the Coroner, better than I do now—at the station-house the prisoner said he had a dog in the cart—I forget what else he said—it was something about the dog having started the horse, or bitten the horse—I made the remark, that he was flogging the horse—I do not think he made any answer to that—I think the sergeant of police, or some one else there, interfered, and said that was not a place for altercation—I saw the prisoner with the whip in his hand, and think he was flogging the horse—I said to him, "The dog had no command over your whip"—I forgot that, as it is so long ago, but that was the remark I made—I think he was flogging the horse—yes, he was on one occasion.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Little John-street, Hoxton Old-town, and work for the New River Company. I was with Smith on this night, and saw the horse and cart standing at the public-house door—I got some distance from the public-house into New Gloucester-street, and heard the rattle of the cart, I turned round and saw it coming towards me on the gallop, as if it had started frightened, as if the horse had started of with spirit—there was a man in the cart—he had hold of the reins I suppose—as he passed me I saw him wave his hand to his companions whom he had just left—I did not see anything in his hand—he had not a whip in his hand when he passed me, but it was waving by the side of the cart after the child was knocked down; I cannot say whether it was in his hand or by the side of the cart—I he was not whip-ing the horse when the child ran off the curb—I saw the child struck by the fore foot of the horse—it was going at its full speed when the child started off the curb—the man could not have pulled the horse in to hinder the child from being run over—he was not whipping the horse or urging it on just before the child was knocked down—I have seen the prisoner once since, at Worship-street—I have not seen him since, nor any of his friends.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant N</hi> 14.) On the 23rd of Feb., I went to Mr. Herring's menagerie, at the the corner of Brook-street, New-road, kept by the father of the prisoner—the door was opened by a man<lb></lb>servent—I said, "Is John or William at home?"—the prisoner was standing in the yard, and said, "What does he want?"—he came up to the door, and I said, "I want to see one of the young gentlemen that was out in the cart last night"—he said, "I was out in the cart, come inside"—when he shut the door, I said, "Before I go any further, I must tell you I am an officer, and you are my prisoner; you ran over a child last night, and I believe it is dead"—the moment I said those words, he appeared to be quite unnerved, and shook, and appeared to be quite undone altogether, and said, "Good God! come inside"—I went into the parlour, and said, "You were in Hox<lb></lb>ton, last night?" he said, "Yes, I was; I knew I ran over something, but what it was I could not tell"—he said, "I had a dog in the cart; and the dog bit the horse's tail, which caused the horse to take fright; I tried to pull him in, but could not"—he said, after he had run over something, he tried to check the horse's speed, but the horse was ungovernable—he said he had just posted a letter to a friend, for him to inquire whether any damage was done, and was waiting for an answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I come from Brentwood, in Essex I was brought up as a Protestant—two years ago I was in the service of Mr. Gosling, at Fulham—while I was in that service I became acquainted with a man named Coatley—he is an Irishman, and a Roman Catholic—the result of my acquaintance with him was that I became in the family way—it was arranged after a time that Coatley and I should marry, and I went, in consequence of that, to Mr. Cornell, the registrar—I went to get a certi<lb></lb>ficate from Mr. Cornell—he wrote down what I told him—he is the registrar of the district in which Holland-street Chapel is situated—I signed a paper there—at that time I was living at Fulham—after leaving that notice, Coatley took me to see the defendant, at the Roman Catholic Chapel in Fulham-fields—they call it St. Thomas's Chapel—Mr. Ferguson asked us whether we were going to get married—I said, "Yes"—he asked me where—I told him, "At Holland-street Chapel"—he asked me why I was not going to be married at his chapel—I told him that I had a wish to be mar<lb></lb>ried at Kensington—he said that he could marry me at his chapel privately—he knew at that time what my religion was—nothing was said at that time about my religion—he said that he could marry me with the certificate that he had got from Coatley—that was the certificate that had come from Mr. Cornell—when he said he could marry me privately at his chapel, I said, "If so, I must get a certificate from Fulham-fields"—he said, "Oh, no, that don't signify; I will marry you with this one; I will marry you pri<lb></lb>vately"—he then had the certificate in his hand—I told the prisoner that I was a Protestant, and was always brought up as a Protestant—he told me that he could not marry me without I turned to his religion, and that I</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>

The learned counsel reviewed the provisions of the various Acts, and urged that by the</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th Sect. of the Act in question, it was expressly provided</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">considered that, according to that argument, Dr. Ferguson had only increased his offence, because he ought to have taken care that the parties' did make that declaration; the omission to do that, if that was necessary, would be, the unduly celebrating a marriage, which was the offence here charged.</hi>) (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">had no doubt that in performing this ceremony, the prisoner had satisfied his conscience as a Roman Catholic priest, that he had celebrated a marriage which was perfectly good and valid, according to the rites of that religion; but this Act of Parliament, leaving him at perfect liberty to do that, required that certain particulars should be observed, in order to protect the parties themselves, and their children, should they have any.</hi>) (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

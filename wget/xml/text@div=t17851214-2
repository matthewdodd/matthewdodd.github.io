               <p>Did you see him do all this? - I heard him open the drawers, when I was in the next room; and he took a pair of black sattin breeches, and a black sattin waistcoat, and half a dozen neck handkerchiefs, and there was a new coat of my master's, and a black coat of my master's hanging up at the side of the bed-chamber, and a dark muslin gown.</p>

               <p>Was the door open or shut when they forced you in, and went in with you? - Wilson staid behind and shut the door, while Leonard held the pistol to me, that I should not make any alarm.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 8, Holborn-court, Grays-Inn; on the 2d of this month, between eight and nine, I heard a double knock at the door, the girl came and asked me, if I should be at home to anybody, I told her not at that hour; she then went to the door and opened it, it was locked withinside, I then heard a man enquire if I was within, and in the space of a second or two, I heard the girl cry out, O Lord! I got from the chair where I was sitting by the fire, the door was close to me, and I saw the prisoner Leonard with a pistol at the girl's head, and I saw another man with him, but I cannot say it was the prisoner Wilson; for I did not observe him so much; the girl had a candle in her hand, I immediately thought of making my escape, there are two rooms, there was a bolt under the lock at each door, I bolted it, I then threw up the sash of the window, and got out into the Duchy Court, where my chambers look into, my chambers are on the ground floor, I then went into the Duchy office, and made an alarm from one of their windows which looks into Coney-court, and we called, porter, porter, a long time before we made anybody hear, upon their coming to us, I told them there were thieves in my chambers, and begged of them to come; I then went back to the window, and saw the candle on the table,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140007"></xptr> and the door shut; in about a quarter of a minute I thought I heard the girl cry out, I sent somebody to put too my outward door on the outside, which had a staple and a hasp, and I understood afterwards, it was put too by a boy that was there, and I found the door made fast afterwards; in a few minutes afterwards Mr. Jones, the porter, and a lamp-lighter, went into the chambers at the window, and I went to the window and saw the prisoner Leonard come along very deliberately, he was in a scarlet coat, and had a pistol in one hand, he came up to the window, and said now for it, and held the pistol; he run into Gray's Inn-lane, in five minutes he was brought back again, Leonard got out and he run towards Grays Inn-lane, I saw the prisoner Leonard in my room, and I saw the property, it was my property part of it.</p>

               <p>Court. The only view you had of the prisoner Leonard, was by looking through a key hole, and when you saw him in the window? - I have no doubt of his being the man I apprehended, these are my shirts but they have no marks, they have been in the possession of the girl ever since; they were not carried out of my chambers, only taken out of one room into another; I value the two coats at twenty shillings, and my shirts, I value at three shillings, a piece, here are almost a new pair of black sattin breeches, I value them at seven shillings, I believe I put in the waistcoat at two shillings in the indictment; I suppose upon the most moderate calculation the things are worth five pounds.</p>

I am very sure these are the buckles that I saw Wilson take out of my master's shoes, I told him they were not silver, he had no occasion to take them, and he took out another buckle, and I told him the same, and he dropped one of them, and put these buckles in his pocket, and these stockings; he came and told me he would tie me, and put his hand over my mouth; I told him I would not be tied by him, nor yet my breath should not be stopped by him; I am sure they are my master's stockings.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure they are my stockings, I know them by the mending.</p>

               <p>I have only to say, I know myself to be guilty of the fact; and as this is the first time I ever committed anything in my life, I hope your Lordship will grant me some mercy, and some little time to repent of my sins.</p>

               <p>The prisoner has lived with a friend of mine, Mr. Meggison, in Hatton-Garden, I think upwards of two years, he behaved then very honest; he has been at my house I suppose 150 times; I told Mr. Meggison to come here, but he declined it; I looked in just by chance, and hearing that declaration from the prisoner, it had an effect on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140009"></xptr> me. I believe he has left Mr. Meggison about six or seven months.</p>

            , Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>He was in my service seven months lately, he left it the 1st of November; I have intrusted him with valuables in bank notes and other matters, and money; I had not any doubt of his honesty till this circumstance; I should have given him the character of a perfect honest man, there seemed an indolence about him, which I attributed to his suffering in America; he suffered in his health, and he could not ride well, these are the reasons for which I parted with him; but I kept him in my service nearly two months after I wished to part with him; because I conceived him a worthy man, and that he should not be turned out of service at a time when the town was empty; and when he left my service, I gave him permission to come and take his victuals at my house till he got into service.</p>
               <p>What part of the town do you live in? - Charlotte-street, Portland-place; I had an equal good character of him from Mr. Meggison; and he has only served two since his return from America, or in the West-Indies; and he was an officer's servant in America, and has been serving in the navy; I understand he was led away by an improper connection after he left me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner Leonard. Was you enlisted in America? - No, my Lord, I was an officer's servant.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner Wilson. Have you any thing to say? - My master is gone abroad about two months; there was a gentleman said he would come, but I believe he is not come.</p>

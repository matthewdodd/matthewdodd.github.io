               <p>Q. Is the ware-house part of the dwelling-house. - A. Yes. The dwelling-house is above the ware-house; I live in the house only; we occupy the ware-house for our business, and the upper part for my dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. For some time back has the prisoner been your <rs id="t18091101-34-deflabel212" type="occupation">porter</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18091101-34-defend343 t18091101-34-deflabel212"></join>. - A. For a couple of months.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 29th of September, had you directed the prisoner to take any goods out of the ware-house to serve customers. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the three invoices that you gave him. - A. These are the three invoices that were given to me by the boy who made them out. I gave them to him and read them over to him; I gave the sheet and he laid the sheet. I gave him the goods myself corresponding to that invoice, previous to my giving him the goods. I told him to lay the wrapper or sheet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and he call over the goods together to see that they corresponded to that invoice. - A. I counted over the goods. I gave him the invoice, he looked them over, and said, it was quite right; after he said, the goods were quite right; he looked over the invoice again, he observed, that one part of the goods were for Miss Abraham's, in Holborn; he said, Miss Abraham's did not like to receive her invoice unless it was sealed up. The boy took and sealed it and gave it to the prisoner; upon that the prisoner turned up the ends of the wrapper. And I mentioned to the boy that I should go up stairs. I left him in the act of folding up the wrapper; I then went up stairs to my lunch, leaving this boy, whom I had received a fortnight before from Christ's Hospital, and the prisoner together. I came down I should suppose in two minutes, I usually come down in ten minutes, but, I then came down in two minutes, and when I came down I saw the prisoner confused; from his manner alone, I was convinced that he was in the act of doing something he ought not. I went backwards into the accounting-house, I watched him through a square of glass from that place. Previous to that he had changed the wrapper, and these two pieces he had placed upon a hole in the wrapper. I observed that as I passed to the accompting-house, with respect to the wrapper I observed a hole in the wrapper; I observed it the moment I came down stairs, and I observed goods in the wrapper that ought not to be; that I did not place in the wrapper.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked through the pane of glass in the accompting-house. - A. Yes, I observed the man looked confused; I let him tie up the wrapper with the two pieces that ought not to be in; when he had tied it up I went forward and stopped him. I pointed to the hole and said, that he must be going to rob me, and that he must have turned round from the counter to take them down; this was another wrapper to what he had when I went up stairs. I opened it I found two pieces of printed callico in the wrapper, these are the two pieces: they are stamped fifty-six, they are paid for stamp duty fifty-six, and they are of the value of twenty-two-pence a yard; they would be worth 5 l. altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the patterns of the goods in the wrapper that you sent to your customers. - A. These are the precise style of the things that he was to take out; that is the pattern of the furniture; these prints were of scarlet ground; and the others were two pieces the colour of brown holland.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you charged him then, and said he was robbing of you. - A. I did, I took these two pieces out.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you did not immediately apprehend him. - A. I was hurt at the time because I had no reason to suspect him till that morning. I took these two pieces out. I went into the accompting-house and reflected upon it. He went out of doors, and again he came back I provided an officer and apprehended him.</p>

No, I was not after Mr. Todd had gone up stairs. I said, I must go up. The prisoner said, he would wait for me. I went up leaving the prisoner alone; I came down the minute after Mr. Todd.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIS. I am a constable. These things were given to me by Mr. Todd, they have been in my care ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. To Prosecutor. After you had taken the things from the prisoner in the parcel did you deliver them to the constable. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. To Prosecutors. I ask you whether he had taken it up before you stopped him. - A. I will not swear whether he had or not; I waited till he was in the net of taking it up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How far were these things from him, supposing he was at the counter. - A. He must have turned round and taken them from a pile of goods.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not three feet from the place; nor neither had I the wrapper tied up; nor he never went into his accompting-house from the time he came down until I went out of the place.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not the charge. The charge is, you having taken these pieces of goods from the pile and putting them in the wrapper, in order to take them away.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

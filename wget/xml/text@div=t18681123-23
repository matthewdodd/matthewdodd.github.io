I am twelve years old—I live with my father, a lock<lb></lb>smith, at Harrow, and work for him—on 19th November, I was at work, pointing a wall, on the Mount Estate, Harrow—about 4 o'clock that day, the prisoner came up to me—I told him to go away—he said he should not—I told him again to go—he said he should not for me—I said "Go away, you young hypocrite"—he said he should not; and then he said, "You have got a trowel, and I have got a knife, and I will make you fight me"—I said, I should not fight at my work, and I turned round and went on with my work—he jumped on to the scaffold, took hold of my left hand, turned me round, and gave me several blows—he gave me five blow—I saw the blade of a knife in his hand—I did not know I was stabbed—I jumped down off the scaffold, and picked up a brickbat, and ran after him, and threw it at him—I then found myself bleeding—I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

I am father of the last witness—I was foreman at these works at Harrow, building a wall—my son was at work there—on Monday, 19th, he was engaged under my orders—I heard some boys coming up the road, and saw the prisoner come very close to where my boy was at work—he turned round to order them away, as I had given him orders in the morning—they stood a few minutes looking at him, and I saw the prisoner run and jump on the scaffold, and saw his hand go like this—I was not aware that he was stabbing him till I got close to him—I unbuttoned his waistcoat, and blood was pouring furiously from his throat—he was stabbed in five places—I took him to the doctors.</p>

The outside case of the watch was of tortoiseshell; the inside of silver. I am positive it is my watch; I asked him where he got it; and he said, he picked it up in the entry.</p>

               <p>Q. To Prisoner. How old are you? - Going of twelve. I was going down Long-alley, and this door was open, and I saw the watch, and I took it up, and the gentleman ran after me and took it away from me without any officer; he took me by himself, and if he had not torn my clothes he might have took me to the justice by himself, for I knew that I found it.</p>

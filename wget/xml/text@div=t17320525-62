On Tuesday Morning, about 7 o'Clock, as I lay abed, the Prisoner and Atkins came to me, and said, What do ye do here? And with that the Prisoner pull'd out what he had and piss'd upon me. Then says Atkins I'll hold her Legs whilst you lie with her. No, says the Prisoner, I'll only feel her Bubbies. Then Atkins kept me down, while the Prisoner took my Pocket, and when he had it, he held it up and said, See here, are not you my Wife? this will serve me to spend. And so they went away into the next Street, and there they got a Woman, and made her dancein the Street in her Smock, with a hundred Mob after 'em.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. When you sent for the Beadle and Constable, did I run away from 'em?</p>
               <p>Shaw. No, you fought with 'em, and after they had served me, as I told your Lordship, they bid my Maid fetch a Pail of Water, and said, they'd throw it over me in the Bed. I never saw the Prisoner but once before. I knew he wou'd suddle, but I never heard that he was a Thief.</p>

            . I went to the Prosecutor's for a Dram, and saw Atkins with his Hand in the Bed, and the Prisoner a pissing upon the Bed, and about the Floor. Says he, I will have you to Bridewell before Night, where's your Maid? Bring a Pail of Water! Atkins held up a Pocket, and said, Now, this will serve me to spend; are not you my Wife?</p>

And so we came together to my Landlady's; I invited him to dine with me next Sunday ; and he came and behav'd himself very civally then. But when he came again next Tuesday, he made this Riot.

            . I have known the Prisoner this 3 Years, he always had a very honest Character, tho' indeed he's often a running to these Bandy-houses (and the Prosecutor keeps a notorious one) but as for thieving, I never heard that he was that way given in the least: She swore a Robbery against me once. I live over against her, and hearing a Disturbance, I went to see what was the Matter. And says she, I can't say they robb'd me; but only abused me, and what can I do in this Case? She offer'd to make it up for half a Guinea.</p>
               <p>Justice Gifford. I never heard any Complaints of the Prosecutor, but Bushby keeps a notorious Bandy-house, and is a common Solicitor. The Jury <rs id="t17320525-62-verdict319" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280194"></xptr>How long did the mob continue at the house before it was completely destroyed? - There was a mob consisting of women and men and boys who continued till four or five o'clock on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Do you remember on Wednesday seeing the prisoner? - I cannot swear positively that I did till eleven o'clock; I was extremely busy all the time. I then saw the prisoner employed in the kitchen with an iron crow in his hand beating down the cistern. I begged of him to desist; he replied, he would lay me a wager (I think it was of a pot of beer) that he would have it down in an hour; there was another man seemed to try to get him away as well as me. I told him he could not get it down it was put up too strong. He seemed much in liquor. I went away and left him there; it is not down but is there still; I left both the men there.</p>
               <p>It ended, I believe, in Mr. Cox's house, being totally destroyed? - Part of the front wall is left; some of the piers between the windows are entirely destroyed, and some of the floors are pulled up.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When was this house first begun to be pulled down? - About eleven o'clock on Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>When was the first time you saw the prisoner there? - At eleven or half past ten o'clock on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>By that time I suppose the house was as much destroyed as it was at all? - It was greatly damaged before; at that time a good deal of flooring and wainscoting were thrown out of the house; the furniture was all I believe destroyed.</p>
               <p>Whether the mischief had not been done before this time? - There was mischief done at that time, and part certainly was before that time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner seemed to be very much disguised in liquor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were there many people about the house at the time you saw the prisoner doing this? - There were a good many people about it; they might be people looking on or the mob; I was so much engaged at the back part of the house to prevent their getting in there that I did not come much to the fore part of the house.</p>
               <p>Was there a fire burning then? - Yes, there were things burning; there were some tubs and other things got out of the cellar that morning.</p>
               <p>Was it in the back or fore kitchen that you saw the prisoner? - The fore kitchen.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay before you went away? - A very little time with the prisoner; I was backwards and forwards preventing the mob getting into the cellar. I was there but about five or six minutes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Franco was the last master I served; I am now out of place, but I am hired to go to a place on Monday.</p>
               <p>Were you in Great Queen-street on any part of the Wednesday morning the 7th of June? - Yes; I passed by there, going to my master, between five and six, a little before six; when I returned I came through the street again; it was half an hour after ten in the morning; I saw him pass by the crowd with three or four gentlemen's servants. I said I was very sorry to see what was doing there, for I knew Mr. Cox and heard he bore a good character.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes, for five or six years.</p>
               <p>What was he employed in when you saw him there? - He had an iron crow in his hand, a little before eleven, knocking down the pier in front of the two-pair-of-stairs. I saw him there twenty minutes or half an hour; he was working with the sharp end; he put it under the bricks and threw them down.</p>
               <p>Are you positive to the person of the prisoner? - I am. He bore a good a character, but his principles were certainly bad at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You have known him some time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He bore a good character? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be in liquor? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>That was the first time you saw him? - No, he was in the crowd passing by between five and six in the morning.</p>
               <p>Was not you the person who made the discovery of him? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280195"></xptr>Do not you know there is a reward if he should be convicted? - It is every man's duty at this time.</p>
               <p>That is not an answer to my question, do not you know there is a reward if he should be convicted? - There is none offered me.</p>
               <p>Do you not know there is a reward if he should be convicted? - I am not the person who convicts him.</p>
               <p>You have seen the proclamation? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to claim the reward if he should be convicted, was the warrant issued out on your discovery? - Yes; I was with him when he was taken; he offered to spend a guinea and give each of us a guinea.</p>
               <p>If he is convicted shall you claim the reward? - I certainly shall claim it.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long have you quitted Mr. Franco's service? - About six weeks.</p>
               <p>Have not you kept a chandler's shop? - A cheesemonger's, in Mary-le-bone; I lost two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Jury. Where was you going at six o'clock that morning? - Going to my master's after my character.</p>
               <p>Who was with you when the prisoner offered you a guinea a piece? - Two of Sir

               <p>Did you observe what he was doing? - All I saw of him was he came out of the house and went into a tap-house next door to me, there he eat and drank; I stood by him; he was in his shirt sleeves with a brown waistcoat; he came out shaking his shirt sleeves.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him before? - I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the man? - I am very certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>You say he was shaking his shirt sleeves? - As he came down the steps of Mr. Cox's, he was seemingly shaking the dust off.</p>

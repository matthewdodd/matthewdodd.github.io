            . I am a Police-constable. On Tuesday morning, the 14th of December, I was at the Three Hats public-house, Islington, and as I went out Knott came in with a stone bottle, and called for a pint of old Tom - when I got by Liverpool-road I saw Johnson standing there, with new clothes and a whittle on - I questioned him as to who and what he was, and where he was going; he said his name was Litchfield - that he was a parchment-maker, and was going to Birmingham, to look after work; I asked who he worked for last; he said Benjamin Long, of Newington-butts - I said," Are you not waiting for somebody?" he said, "Why?" I said, "Because a lad has gone in for some gin, dressed as you are, and I think you are companions;" Knott came and joined him - I took them to our station; Johnson said he had 14s., but I found he had 20s., and a metal watch in his pocket - a pair of gloves, a knife, and a silk handkerchief; I asked him who the handkerchief belonged to - he said his father, and the watch to his mother, and that he took them out of a box; I searched Knott, and found a cotton handkerchief and a silk shawl I wrapped in it, in his coat pocket - he said it belonged to Johnson, and he was taking care of it for him - that they were going to sell it to help them on the road; he had a pair of worsted gloves on, the same as Johnson.</p>

               <p>MRS. LITCHFIELD. This is my watch, and was left in the front room - some of the handkerchiefs are ours; I went to Hatton-garden, and they told me I must prosecute, but my son behaved well before this; it is through his very bad master - he is my only child; I would take him home again.</p>
               <p>Johnson received a good character.</p>

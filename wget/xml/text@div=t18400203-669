                  </hi>. I am master of the brig <hi rend="italic">Vesper</hi>, lying in the Long Reach. On the 3rd of February, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I took a walk out of Mr. Royston's house where I had been drink<lb></lb>ing—I found the door shut when I returned—I went up Gravel-lane, and saw the prisoner—I said, "Is that Beckey M'Carthy," she said, "It is not"—I said "Where do you live when you are at home?"—she said, "I don't</p>

On the 23d of January, between six and seven in the evening, I lost 15 wooden crops; they were in two parcels hung up behind the door: my house is a watering house for coachmen; one of the coachmen took them down to look at; I bid him tie them up and hang them up again, which he did; the prisoner was in the house, and had a pennyworth of purl; there was a call for three or four coachmen; they went out; a coachman came in and wanted a stick; my wife called to me to know if I had taken them down; I came to see, and the prisoner was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Could the prisoner have gone out of the place and taken them at this time?</p>
               <p>Stevens. He sat by the fire in the tap room; these were behind the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the prisoner go out without your seeing of him?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I was not in the tap room when he went out.</p>

A gentleman's servant came in as we were talking of the sticks, and said he saw a man go out with the sticks under his arm; I went and found the sticks at George Lewsmore's, where he had sold them.

            . The prisoner brought the sticks into my house about nine o'clock; I keep the Magpye and Horse-shoe in Fenchurch-street; he offered them to sale; I told him to call the waterman to look at them; the waterman said they were very good sticks; he asked me to buy them; he asked 5 s. for them; I gave him 4 s. Mr. Stevens came to enquire after them about an hour and a half after he was gone; I shewed them to him; he said they were his; I delivered them to the constable.</p>

I am the wife of William Stevens, a bootmaker, in York-road, Lambeth—he rents the house—the prisoner was his apprentice—he left on 3d July, about twelve o'clock—he had no business to go away—he was an in-door apprentice, and lived with us—after he had gone, I went down-stairs and missed some money from a Small drawer of-a chest of drawers; I thought by the look of it about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it might have been half-sovereigns as well as sovereigns—it was all in gold—the drawer had been locked, and I had the key in my pocket—it was locked when I examined it—I also missed a silver watch from over the parlour fire-place, and a pair of boots from the shop—I never saw the prisoner again till he was in custody.</p>

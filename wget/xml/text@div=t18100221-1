               <p>Q. Towards the close of the last year did you leave London and proceed to Lisbon - A. I did, in October; I returned within a fortnight after, but not to my own house; the prisoner knew where I was in town, and daily communicated with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you come to your house and miss these things - A. In December I missed these things.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe when you quitted London to go to Lisbon you gave this man a power of attorney - A. I did. I revoked that power of attorney on the 18th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had revoked that power of attorney could you find the prisoner - A. No, I did not find him until the 18th of January; at last I found out where he lodged, I applied to the office and got a search warrant; I went to his lodgings in Bunhill-row, and there I found the articles mentioned in the indictment. The prisoner was not then at home, he was brought to the office the same evening by Ray and Kennedy.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these things been left in your house when you left London - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given him any permission to take them away - A. None in the world.</p>
               <p>COURT. You were absent I suppose from your affairs being deranged - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I suppose he having a power of attorney from you, you placed a perfect confidence in this gentlemen - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose if you had been at home you would, if he had asked you, lent him the loan of these things - A. I do not think I should have objected to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the servant maid forth coming - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was an extent commission taken out against you, and government had a right to seize that property if he had returned them - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I borrowed these things of the servant, having a general power of attorney; I thought I was not doing a dishonourable act; I meaned to return them. The power of attorney was not revoked at the time. It is a malicious act.</p>

The prisoner came there on a Tuesday, I think the 27th of November, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning; he called for coffee and bread and butter - it came to 2 1/2d. - he gave me a shilling, which I put into a cup, in which I am certain there was nothing but halfpence - I gave him change, and he went away; I afterwards found the shilling was bad - I did not see the prisoner again till the Thursday afterwards, and may be mistaken in his person; I will not swear to him - we gave the bad shilling to the officer - he marked it in my presence, but I could not swear to it.</p>

On the Tuesday morning I received a counterfeit shilling from Miss Holroyd - I marked it at the time, and have it here now; I was sent for again on the Wednesday, and found the prisoner there; I then received this other shilling, which I marked in a different manner - I took the prisoner into the back parlour, and found a penny-piece on him - he put out his hand, snatched up the second shilling, and endeavoured to swallow it; I knocked up his arm, and it fell out of his hand - he tried to get it again, but I prevented him.</p>

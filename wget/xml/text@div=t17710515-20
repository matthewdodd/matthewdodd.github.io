I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150033"></xptr> was turned away at a minute's warning one Saturday night. I had given him warning. I went there on Saturday night; on Sunday my master gave me a caution that I must not let in any body without acquainting my mistress or my young master; I told him I would not; they said my young master had been very extravagant, and run into debt at a great many places; and that the bailiffs were after him. On the Monday they sent me out with two bad shillings; they gave me more money with them to help put them off; they said they took them, and must put them off; I was to buy some bread for their dogs, they kept some pointers, and some lard for pancakes, which makes me remember that it was Shrove-Tuesday; I passed the two bad shillings, and brought my mistress the change; on Tuesday they sent me out with another; I thought it something odd having another the next day, though I did not think any thing of their making them. I fetched the prisoner in a ladle one night and some mould; two or three days after this I went to warm my young master's bed; I went down stairs, and went into the parlour for some beer; and I saw a little pair of moulds lying on the table, about four inches square, with two quarter guineas upon them; and there was the ladle I fetched him in, and a little box of quarter guineas on the table; I went up, and staid a considerable while upon the stairs to watch; when he came in again, as he was then gone to the vault; at last, going down stairs, I hit against the wainscot; he ran out with a hanger, and said to me, it is well you was not ran through, D - n you, what do you do there? When I went up to my mistress, she asked me what had happened; I told her: she said, Did you go into the parlour? I told her no.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a hanger in his hand?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes; it generally hangs in the day time in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him yourself in the parlour?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes, the mould was all marked; I saw him put the mould together, and pour the metal in; then he broke the mould in two; I saw this while I was sitting upon the stairs, waiting to go down with the chamber-pot; the parlour door was wide open; and the hanger lay across the table; after I went, the prisoner came up and opened my chamber door to see whether I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him coin a quarter of a guinea?</p>
               <p>Clark. I saw him pour the metal into a a mould, which I suppose was the same as I had seen; and there was some quarter guineas in a little box upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after you had been in the parlour?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the mould made of?</p>
               <p>Clark. Round it, I believe, was iron, it was black in the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you apprehend it was made of?</p>
               <p>Clark. I can't tell; I did not take them off the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for you to see, as he poured the metal, what colour it was of?</p>
               <p>Clark. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see a mould before?</p>
               <p>Clark. Not till I saw young Mr. Byerman's.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. The parlour door was open, and your master was at the vault, you say?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And remained so?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Did you go to any magistrate?</p>
               <p>Clark. When I was turned out, a person took me to Sir

            's, in order to right myself. I told them the stuff they colour'd the money with was behind the pewter shelf?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go of your own accord to the justices?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes: they would not grant a warrant for the bad shillings. I was served with a copy of a writ to make my words good: then I told the whole story.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after this warrant?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Two months.</p>
               <p>Isabella Walker. I went to live with Mr. Byerman a month all but a day before Christmas. I came away on boxing day; the day after Christmas day. Mr. Byerman used me very ill; he sat up to write one night, he sent me to fetch a thing in out of the yard with a handle, such as plumbers use, about half a yard long. He called me up in the morning; when I came down stairs, there was a great fire made up with wood; he said he made it with wood, because I did not fetch the coals, and said he should not have called me so soon if he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150034"></xptr> had any coals: the writing lay upon the table: when I swept under the dresser, I found a little piece of money, it was larger than a five-and-three-pence, but not so large as a half guinea. I supposed it to be a medal. I carried it to my mistress, and my young master; my young master said it is nothing but an old medal that has been thrown about.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it if you saw it again?</p>
               <p>Walker. Yes; it had a head on one side, and nothing on the other.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is no evidence at all given on this occasion that can render it necessary for the prisoner to go into any defence; the prosecutors have undertaken to prove that he coined a counterfeit quarter guinea; neither of the witnesses are able to prove such a thing upon him.</p>

I am a cow-keeper, of North-street, Manchester<lb></lb>square—Wickens was in my service up to 21st May—I had formerly dealtwith Spice—I sold him milk—the last transaction was on 19th Feb., 1837, when I warned him not to come to my place any more—I suspected, andinstructed a policeman to watch—on 21st May last I was called up, and wentto my shed, and found Spice in the yard with a policeman, and Wickens undera cow, milking her—I said, "Now, Luke, you will leave that cow, and put onyour coat; you shall go"—he said, "For God's sake, master, forgive me; there is a woman here"—I said, "That has nothing to do with it; you shallgo with the policeman"—I saw some cans with warm milk in them, whichwas worth 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took it to the station—Spice then said, "<hi rend="italic">Ranson, don't</hi>, I have got no one that knows my walk"—I said, "You ought to havethought of that before"—he had no permission to take my milk—he had nocows in my shed—they were all my own.</p>

I could not cry out - he held me in this manner, while the other man came behind me, and took the watch out of my fob, my umbrella from under my arm, and 1 s. 6 d. in silver from my pocket, they then ran off across the fields; the prisoner ran towards Somers-town; I do not know which way the other ran. I immediately called out Murder! and Stop thief! as loud as I could - I was alarmed. Mr. Gliddon came by at the time, and seized the prisoner. He was taken to the watch-house, and searched. None of my property was found on him - the other man took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How can you swear to me? you said I came behind you - A. He came sideways of me; whether he came from behind or not I cannot say. I could not see his features at the time, but immediately that he got from me I pursued, and never lost sight of him until Gliddon took him. From the time he left me till I came up to him was not above five minutes. No other person was near - he was never out of my sight.</p>

            . I was crossing the fields on the night of the robbery, between ten and eleven o'clock, heard a person crying Stop thief! and Murder! and saw two persons running, one was in pursuit of the other - it was a bright moonlight night; the man who was running away made towards Somers-town, in the field, not in the pathway. I ran in a direction to intercept him, and stopped him at the back of the houses in Somers-town. I did not lay hold of him, I only detained him against the fence; the prosecutor came up in about two minutes, and immediately said he was one of the two who had robbed him of his watch and umbrella, and emptied his breeches-pockets, which were turned inside-out - he had some marks of violence about his face and nose. I took the prisoner, and some watchmen and others came up, and took him from me. When I first stopped him, I asked him what he had been doing? he said,</p>
               <p>"Nothing, Sir." I said,</p>
               <p>"You have been committing some robbery, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170005"></xptr>shall keep you until this person comes up." He said nothing more.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was crossing the fields, heard the cry, and was afraid the gentleman would knock me down - I made off, thinking he was the robber.</p>

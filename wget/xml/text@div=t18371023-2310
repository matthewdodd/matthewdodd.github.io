                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer. I was working on Mr. Wyllie's premises and saw this stove there—I can swear to it as being his—there is a W on it—I saw it at Mr. Dickens' house in Ealing—I recognized it directly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You swear positively to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes. I had seen the mark when I had been there several times—the last time I saw it was about the beginning of April—there was a W on it, and two other marks in white chalk or paint—when I first saw it at Mr. Dickens' I did not know it was Mr. Wyllie's—immediately it was brought down stairs and put on the barrow I recognized it—I did not see the mark then—I saw the mark when Turner came and took it away—I said, if you rub the dirt away you will see the mark"—I went to Turner—the stove was then gone on in a barrow—I found it against the Feathers public bourse, which is in the road to the house of Mr. Wyllie—I did not know there was a reward of ten pounds offered—I heard of it last night, bat not before I found the mark on it—I saw the stove at Dickens' alone—I recognized it, but saw no mark on it then—I saw it again at the Feathers in about five minutes—that might be two-hundred yards off—it was a quarter before seven o'clock—the man was resting there with it authorized him to take it to Mr. Wyllie's—when I got to the Feathers I saw the mark by seeking for it—that is the mark which I saw in April—it was about the third of the month that I found it at Dickens'.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furrier, and live in Great Portland-street. On Saturday the 9th of December, a few minutes after nine o'clock in the evening, I was in the parlour at the back of my shop—I saw the prisoner open the shop-door, come partly in, and take up a muff from the shop window, and go off with it—I ran out after him—he went up Ridinghouse lane—I called "Stop thief," after him, and he was stopped—I took him back to the shop—I picked the muff up in Ridinghouse-lane, and brought it back with me—I said I was astonished that a young man of his appearance should be guilty of such an act, and he had better get a broom and sweep the crossing than be guilty of dishonesty—he said he did not do it, that another person gave him the muff, but I had seen him take it.</p>

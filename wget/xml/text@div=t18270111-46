On the 3d of November the prisoner took a lodging in my house, at 2s. 6d. a week - he slept with my son that night - he got up at twelve o'clock in the day, on the 4th of November, and went out - he came home between five and six o'clock, and said he had an opportunity of going to the play, and would I let him in at a late hour if he came - I let him in at two o'clock in the morning, and gave him a candle - he went up to bed - he had not been in the room two minutes before he came down-stairs, and said he had left a small parcel at a public-house, where he had supped, and must go for it and would return in ten minutes; but as he did not return. I went up to the room and missed my son's watch - I had gone into my son's bed-room, before the prisoner came in, to see the time; the watch was then on the mantel-piece - the prisoner never returned - nobody but my wife and son were in the house.</p>

I went to bed about eleven o'clock on this night - I put my watch on the mantelpiece, by the bed-side - I did not hear the prisoner come home, and knew nothing about it till my father awoke me, and asked where my watch was - it was then gone - I have never found it - the prisoner did not return - I did not see him again till the 12th of December, when I met him in Princes-street, Drury-lane, and gave him in charge - my watch was worth 5l.; I gave seven guineas for it twelve months ago.</p>

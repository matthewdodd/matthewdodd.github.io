I told him the price; he said the price was too great; that he must inform the person for whom he wanted it before he purchased it; he went out of the shop without purchasing one. I had no suspicion of his having robbed me. Immediately that he was gone out of the shop, a young lad whom I had no knowledge of before, his name is

            , came in my shop; in consequence of what he said, I went out to pursue the man; he had got about 200 yards from my shop when I overtook him, the lad went along with me; I desired the prisoner to come back into my shop, I did not make any charge upon him at that time, nor till he came into my shop; I then desired that he would hear the charge that this lad made, because I had no knowledge of his having robbed me myself, the lad having mentioned the part where he saw him take something away. I immediately looked and said I have missed a four pound brass weight: he denied having taken any: after a little while I sent the lad to fetch a police officer. When the lad was gone I saw by his manner there where evident marks of guilt about him. I came close to him and put my hand to the side of his pocket and there I felt the very weight that was missing; a workman of mine happened at that time to come through the shop, I desired him to assist in taking care of him till the officer came: he assisted, and the prisoner took the weight out of his pocket and threw it on the ground. I am sure it is my property.</p>

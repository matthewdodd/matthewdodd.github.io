                  </hi>. I am a watchman of Woolwich. On the morning of the 24th of July I went in search of the prisoners—I went to a lodging where I found Leech—I knocked at the door—she looked out of the win<lb></lb>dow, and asked what I wanted—I asked her if she had been in company with another young woman and a sailor the night before—she said she had been out late, but not in company with a sailor—Benny was with me—he said she was the person who stole his things—she came down, opened the door, and called Benny in—I went to the door, to go in—she said to me, "You cannot come in;" but I pushed the door, and went in—I found Benny busy in picking up his things, which laid all about the room, and observed the cord had been cut with some sharp instrument—Benny said he had lost a basket of small shells—Leech said she did not have the shells, but she knew the one that had got them, which was Mary Ross—he accused her of stealing the money—she said she did not—I went to Mary Ross's—I found this basket, with some shells in it—I brought it to Benny—he said it was his, but there were some shells—I asked Ross where the other shells were, and she denied having, any; but she brought some down in apaper, which I took to Benny.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Leech</hi>. You asked me had I a brother come from sea last night. <hi rend="italic">Wit<lb></lb>ness.</hi> Yes, I did—you did not say that Benny was the young man who left his bundle at your house—you denied all knowlwdge of him—I did not say there was a young man who wanted to find to find his sister, and she lived up there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There was an inquiry about some shells? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I found Ross at a house, and she said there were some some shells which the man gave her—they were in this basket, in a corner, on a chair—she said the sailor left them there over-night—when I took them to Benny, he said there were part of them gone; and she produced some more in a paper, which she brought from up-stairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined. Q.</hi> Have you any recollection of going to the house of Ross? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Sir; I never did go, I can swear—this basket of shells was in the bag of clothes—no one could have got it without opening the bag; and the string was cut wwhen I saw it in the morning—I did not go to Leech's the night before—I did not go to either of their lodgings—I did not convey to either of their lodgings, the basket or the clothes; they ran away with them—I never allowed them to carry my things to their house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Leech's Defence</hi>. I met with Ross and Robert Prestwich, who asked me to take some porter in the Carpenter's Arms—they then asked me to go home; and in going along, we saw this sailor—he ran up against us,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183508170201"></xptr>
               <p>and asked us to have something to drink—we said no, there was no house open—he still urged us, and we went to the Hampshire Hog—it was not open, and we went to the White Lion—we had half apint of rum and shrub—he then broke a glass—we took three pints of porter home, and went with Ross to supper—we bade him good-night, but he would go with as—he wanted to stop and sleep at Ross's, but she said he could not—he then took a knife, cut his bag open, took out the shells, and gave her some and me some—I said I would leave mine there till the morning—I then went to go home—I met him again on my way; and in going through the church-yard, he asked me to let him leave his bag at my house—I said he might, and I gave him my direction—he brought it, and wanted to stop there, but I would not let him—when he came in the morning he missed the shells—I asked him if he knew where he had left them—he said no—I took him to Ross's, and he accused me of taking his money, which I know nothing about, nor yet of the clothes, only that he brought them to my house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ross's defence</hi>. What she has stated is the truth—I never saw any sovereigns, nor any thing more than the shells—he gave me half-a-dozen of them, and told me, he would give a crape-shawl and a coral-necklace to stop with me—I said he could not—he went out, and Mrs. Leech went after him—the watchman came to my house, and saw the shells—he took them to the sailor; and then he came and said, "Where are the others?"—I said, "What is freer than a gift?"—I went up-stairs, and fetched the other shells down, which he had given me.</p>

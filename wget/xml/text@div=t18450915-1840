                  </hi>. I live at Camberwell. On the 23rd of Aug., at a quarter before four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Bridge-street—I stood for a minute or a minute and a half, hearing a dispute with a man with a cart and the toll-collector—I felt my handkerchief go from my pocket—I turned, and the prisoner was placing it under his coat—I charged him with it—he did not deny it—I took it from him—this is it—it has no mark on it, but I know it is mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> There were a great many people looking at the cart; I saw this handkerchief on the ground; I took it up, looked at it; the prose<lb></lb>cutor caught me by the arm, and said, "You have got my handkerchief;" I pulled it out and gave it him; I was just going to put it into my pocket; I gave him my address, and told him I was on business. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He did, and I gave it to the officer—I am sure I felt the handkerchief go from my pocket—I turned and saw him with it, moving on—when I overtook him with it, he was about three yards from me—there was a crowd of six or seven persons, and I had to go through them to get to him.</p>

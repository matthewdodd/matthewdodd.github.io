I ran round to Rosemary-court, and saw the prisoner get over a fence - I ran down to Nelson-court and told two men to stop there, lest the boy should get out - I returned, and got over the fence; I found him standing under a door way; he said, if I would let him go, he would tell me where the cloth was - I gave him in charge of the two men, while I went to look for the cloth, but I could not find it; I then took him to the watch-house - I returned and found the cloth thrown over a wall where the prisoner had turned round, about fourteen-feet from where I took him.</p>

               <p>GOOD people, I pray, to these lines now attend, And listen a while to these lines I've penn'd; It is of a young damsel I mean for to sing, Who has long time been pleas'd with a delicate thing.</p>
               <p>Tol lal lal lol, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A waggish young lass I protest she has been; And by this time our neighbours are near of a kin. [pris'd; It is reported for truth that a young man she So attend to what follows, and be not surpris'd.</p>
               <p>Says she, my dear, I hope you'll be so kind, You shall ever enjoy me when you are inclin'd; Tho' I'd have you take care; for if we are found out, It will certainly cause a most terrible rout.</p>
               <p>My dear, such a scheme I have got in my head; Which, if follow'd, will lead you secure to my bed; [smile, And whenever I give you the nod, wink, or Then I mean to retreat to my chamber a while.</p>
               <p>You must know that I lie near the top of the house, Where there's none to molest us, no, not so much as a mouse; In at the garret window you easily may get. Then into my room you I quickly will let.</p>
               <p>Where we safely may lie, and fulfil our designs, And none to suspect us or rifle our minds; No girl half so happy or joyous as she, [be. And wish'd that such frolicks ne'er ended might</p>
               <p>But her father has lately found out their fun, By which I'm persuaded, his daughter's undone. Her mother cries, Hussey, how could you do so? And Betsy says, Mammy, you very well know,</p>
               <p>When you was in your youth you the like game did play, Then be not so angry, dear mother, I pray; It is said that one P - in the Borough did dwell, A man that you loved most wonderous well.</p>
               <p>It is well known that you both to a tavern did hie, And call'd for a bed there all night for to lie; And after you had revell'd the night unto day, P - gave you the bag, left the reckoning to pay.</p>
               <p>Since then, my dear mother, your frolicks are known, I hope you will always be ready to own, That all have their failings, tho' a difference in crimes; And you've had your tail-n-gs some hundreds of times.</p>
               <p>And now to conclude, I have only to say, It is a fatal disorder that will have its sway; But since its found out, it is a folly to pine, Since your case is my case, and my case is thine.</p>

Wright turned about to me, my daughter stood close to me, he pointed at my daughter, says he there is the young lady, there is a pretty maid for you, only look at her. He said that before twenty or thirty people. I believe he said you let them in at the garret window you know. My daughter fell a crying, and went in; he said I will sell you five or six dozen if you want them; I said I would have them; he said does the cap fit you? if it does you must wear it; I said when I have done wearing it I will make you wear it; he said now I would not have your daughter if you would give me 500 l. nay, I would not have her at all now. My daughter went in; she cried and said she would not stay in the house, and should be glad if we would send her into the country.</p>
               <p>Look at this song and see if it is one of the songs that you had of Cooley? - Yes, this is it, I set my name on the back of it.</p>

Some hosiery and other goods were placed under my care about Michaelmas - I was answerable for them; I placed them in my bed-room, and kept the door locked: the key was in my pocket, except when my sister went to make the bed. I discharged the prisoner the latter end of November, without warning. While she was in my service I missed several dozens of stockings and handkerchiefs, some Irish linen and flannel. The door must have been opened by a false key to get at them. I generally looked the goods over every day, and at one time I missed a quantity of stockings. On the 28th of December the prisoner called at my house, and next morning twenty-four duplicates were delivered to me by my sister. I went round to the pawnbrokers, and found my property.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Lecuse, a neighbour of the prosecutor's. I found these duplicates in a bag, under the gateway of the Dundee Arms, on the 28th of December - I took them home, showed them to Mrs. Lecuse, who said I had better take them to the Dundee Arms, as somebody had lost them - I gave them to Miss Morris.</p>
               <p>EDWARD RUBERY. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Anchor and Hope-alley, St. George's. On the 13th of November the prisoner pawned nine pairs of stockings and three handkerchiefs, for 10 s. in the name of Elizabeth Haley; she might say Daly. I asked if they were her own - she said Yes, she had just bought them; she gave her address at Green-bank, and said she lodged there. About a fortnight afterwards she brought another parcel of stockings to pawn, for 5 s.; I said she had a parcel of stockings already, and were they her own - she said they were: I refused to take them in. The counterpart of my duplicate is in the prosecutor's possession.</p>

On the 10th of November the prisoner pawned some linen, cotton, half stockings, and handkerchiefs, for 16 s.; the duplicate I gave her is among those produced. I asked her name - she said Sarah Anderson; that they were part her own, and part her husband's property. She pawned another parcel at the same time, for 16 s., and on the 23d of November she pawned eleven pairs of socks, for 3 s. - she said she lived in Wapping-street. Morris's house is in that street; my three duplicates are among those produced.</p>

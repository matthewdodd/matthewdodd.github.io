Last Wednesday, about six o'clock in the evening, I was at tea in the back room, and heard a rumbling. I found the constable at the door with the prisoner in custody; he shewed me two flutes, and said in the prisoner's hearing, that he caught him taking them out of the window. The prisoner pretended to know nothing about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090004"></xptr>them. I found a pane of the window broken, and pushed in; it had been cracked before, but was close together - the flutes are mine, and were close to the cracked pane; they are worth 10 s. I believe I saw them safe that day.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoner very close to Potter's window about half-past five o'clock in the evening; it was quite dark, he was looking about on each side. I found him with a flute in his left hand, close to his breast; he was drawing the other out of the window. I seized him and forced him into a grocer's shop - he threw them away, and I picked them up. I informed the prosecutor. I had observed the prisoner lurking about the shop with two others, and heard the window crack, the other two were very near the shop and ran away when I seized the prisoner - they were waiting two doors off, looking at the prisoner; they had both been at the window themselves, which of them broke it, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the office, he said a boy with a fustian jacket broke the window. I was coming by and stopped to look at it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Errill, a policeman. At a quarter to nine o'clock in the evening of the 1st of December, I bought a pennyworth of sprats of the prisoner at my door—he put them out in my plate—I gave him half-a-crown, and asked for change—he said he had no change—he put down his basket, and went to get change, and did not come back—the sprats he left were not worth 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were not fresh, and were thrown away—the basket and jug that he had left were valued at 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I swear positively he is the man—I have often seen him.</p>

I first heard of this on Wed<lb></lb>nesday morning, the 2nd of December, about eleven o'clock—I took the prisoner at a public-house, sitting alongside a female—I said, "I want you on a charge of felony"—he said, "You are joking"—I said, "I am not, I want you on suspicion of taking half-a-crown from a woman in the New Town, you answer the description of the person exactly"—I took him to the prosecutrix—she opened the door, and a few yards before we got to it she said, "That is the person that had my half-crown"—I said, "Can you swear it?"—she said, "Yes"—she went to the station, and gave charge of him.</p>

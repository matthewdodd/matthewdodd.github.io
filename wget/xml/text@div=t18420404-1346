                  </hi>. I keep the Green Man public-house, Muswell-hill, and have known the prisoner about a year and a half—he is a navigator or labourer. On the 10th of March, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, he came to my house accompanied by Page, who is not in custody—it was about a quarter of an hour before dark—I did not see them come in—I found them in the skittle-ground, making use of very bad language and conducting themselves in a disorderly way—they did not ask for any liquor—I desired the man not to take any light in when it became dark, until these parties had gone—they came into the house, and while there, a man in my employ brought in a pewter pot bent up and destroyed—when I went into the tap-room the prisoner had got one of my tap-room tables turned bottom upwards, and himself on the top of it—I asked who of these parties had been villain enough to destroy my property in that manner—the pot had been sent into the skittle-ground with beer—they both made use of most filthy language and conducted themselves so, that I ordered them out of the house—they would not go, and I sent for a constable—I gave the prisoner and his companion in charge—they used the most filthy language, and said I might look out for myself, they would do for me; and they were taken out of the house after some difficulty—I afterwards told the constable I did not wish to give them in charge if they would go quietly away—in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes they returned and went to the skittle-ground again—I told them to go away—they would not—I sent for the constable again and gave them in charge—as soon as the policeman proceeded to take them, I received a fall in some way, a blow which deprived me of my senses—I do not know where it was struck, and knew nothing more till four o'clock the next morn<lb></lb>ing, when I recovered—I was kept in bed three weeks, and am not quite recovered yet—I found I was injured on the top of my head—the skin was cracked very lightly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you serve me with a pot of beer which was on the table? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the table was bottom upwards, and you standing on it—I suppose your intent was to break the legs off.</p>
               <p>JAMES MALLETT (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 34.) I was called to Mr. Tyrrell's house on the evening of the 10th of March—there was a complaint about the prisoner and another being disorderly—I requested them to go, they said they would not, but with a great deal of difficulty I got them out—Tyrrell said he would withdraw his charge—they went away—I followed them home to their lodgings—they returned in a quarter of an hour swear<lb></lb>ing they would be revenged on the b y b I heard the prisoner swear</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184204040204"></xptr>
               <p>he would lay wait for the b, and Page often mentioned that he would be revenged on the b he said so in the prisoner's presence—I was fearful of their threats, and went up to Tyrrell—I got there as they ar<lb></lb>rived at the door, and requested them to go home or they might rue the con<lb></lb>sequences—they said they would not, they did not care for any policeman, they would go in defiance of me, and they entered the skittle-ground—I was afterwards called in by Tyrrell—he and they had some words—he insisted on my taking them in charge for wilfully damaging his pro<lb></lb>perty—they made a violent resistance, and knocked me down—Tyrrell came to my assistance, they both struck him and knocked him down—he lay as dead—I saw the prisoner strike him—I did not see any weapon in his hand—he struck him somewhere in the chest, and knocked him down as if dead—somebody said the man was dead—I got up, seized the prisoner, he knocked me down, seized me by the throat, and would have strangled me by holding my throat, but assistance came—he had got me by my stock twisting my neck—we took him to the station with the assistance of Marshall.</p>

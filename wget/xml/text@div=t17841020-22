               <p>On Monday morning I bought some pork of Mr. King, salesman in Newgate-market, and my boy came afterwards with a cart to carry it home; I brought three sides of large pork, and he brought a little pig and put it into the cart, I told him to go back with me and fetch another, I do not know how much I brought the second time, and afterwards I left the cart with the pork in it, and when I returned I missed one of the sides I brought the first time, I was told the man was in Stationers-court, I went down by Black-frier's-bridge, came up Thames-street to Newgate-market again, and told the salesman, and he said, if he was in my place, he would go to Blackfriers Toll-gate; I went up the Old-change, and down Lambeth-hill, into Thames-street, I was just going to turn to Black-friar's-bridge and I was informed a man was resting near London-bridge; I run on, and overtook the prisoner with a basket on his head with a side of pork in it, and a cloth upon it; I asked him to let me look at that side of pork, he set down the basket upon a post, I saw it was mine, and I told him so; he said it was not, for he bought it of Sam Best, in Newgate-market, he said he would go, and he came very willingly into Newgate-market, and just opposite the stall where I bought the pork he stopped, I called out mother King! he slipped away, I cryed stop thief! and he was taken to the Compter: I know the pork, I matched it with the other side, it was a very remarkable pig, the ribs were crooked, it was the most remarkable side you can see.</p>

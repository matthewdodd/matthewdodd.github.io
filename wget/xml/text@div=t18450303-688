                  </hi>. I live in Theobald's-road, and am a grocer. The prisoner was in my service from the 30th of Nov.—I suspected him, and on the 13th of Feb. I caused some persons to come and purchase things with money which I had marked—I then asked the prisoner if the cub in the till was all he had taken—he said, "Yes"—I said I wished to see what money he had about him, and he drew from his pocket two half-crowns and three shillings, and a purse with two shillings was found on him—the two half-crowns and three shillings were what I had marked—the other was not marked—he had left me on the 1st of Feb., but offered to assist me when I wanted him, and I availed myself of his services—'here b the half-crown and shilling which I gave to Mr. fiagster, and I gave some other marked money to Mrs. Crapp, who is not here.</p>

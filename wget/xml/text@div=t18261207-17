            . I am servant to Mr. France, the landlord of the Portland Arms public-house, Great Mary-le-bone-street. I have known Henry Tyers for two or three years - he was four years and a half old. I know the prisoner Hill. On the <rs id="t18261207-17-cd102" type="crimeDate">29th of November</rs>
                  <join result="offenceCrimeDate" targOrder="Y" targets="t18261207-17-off101 t18261207-17-cd102"></join> I went to him between three and four o'clock, at General Clinton's stable - I went to take a quartern of gin to him - I will not say that Mr. or Mrs. France ordered me to go; the gin was ordered by Hill; on getting to the mews I found the prisoner and the child (Tyers) there - Ancliffe was cleaning bridle bits, and the child was playing about; I poured out a glass of gin, and gave it to Hill; he drank it, and I then poured out a glass for Ancliffe, and he drank it; there was a small portion left at the bottom of the measure, about the third of a half-quartern, so small a portion I scarce knew that there was any left - Hill said,"Bill, do you take away the gin to drink?" I poured it out in the glass, and the child drank it; the glass was nothing like full; if the glass had been twice filled the two prisoners would have drank the quartern - it was about a third of being full. I asked the child if he would have any gin, and he answered, Yes - I gave it to him, and he drank it; Ancliffe was dressing a horse when I first went- Hill ordered me to bring another quartern, and I did so; I returned immediately - I had to go about one hundred yards, and was not long gone; when I got back I poured out a glass as before, and gave it to Hill; I then poured out another, and gave it to Ancliffe, and they drank it - there was nearly the same portion left as before, and the child was asked, either by me or Hill, whether he would drink it, and he again said Yes - I then poured it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070015"></xptr>out - it was near the same fulness; the child drank it. Hill then said, "Bill, bring another quartern;" I fulfilled the order, and went back again; I disposed of it as before, to Hill and Ancliffe; the child was asked, as before, by me or Hill; I cannot swear that the child answered Yes - the child took the remainder of the third quartern out of my hands. I went away after this - the three quarterns were paid for by Hill - I had the money each time. I did not take any more that afternoon; I saw the child after that - he came up to France's for another quartern; I saw him at the bar - he ordered it to go down; it was carried by William Garratt, my fellow-servant; I never saw the child after he ordered the fourth quartern. On neither of these occasions did I see the child's father with the coachman. When the deceased came to order the fourth quartern he did not seem affected by the gin he had drank; Mrs. France said to the child, "I hope you have not been drinking gin?" he said he had been having a little; she asked him how old he was; he said three years and a half; the gin was sent in an Imperial measure.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Hill is servant to General Clinton? A. Yes - he was not wet that I know of; he was cleaning bits and bridles; he took no further notice of what was going on - it was the same with Ancliffe - he was cleaning horses; I suppose it was five minutes after the third quartern that I saw the child. It was I who first asked the child to have the gin - Ancliffe never proposed it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. France. I was employed to carry some gin to Mary-le-bone-mews, about four o'clock - I took a quartern; I was present when the child, Tyers, ordered it; we went both together - when we got to the mews I saw the prisoners - I said to Hill, "Here is a quartern of gin;" I poured it out and filled the glass - I gave it to Hill, and he gave it to the child; he asked the child if he would have any - the child said Yes, and drank it all - the whole glass; upon the child saying Yes, Hill gave it to him; Hill drank a trifle out of the second glass; I then filled it up again: the second glass is the quartern. When I filled up the second glass again Hill gave it to the child. I do not know that he said any thing, but merely gave it to him - the child drank it; when I had disposed of it, Hill ordered a further quartern, and I fetched it; I asked if he would pay for it; Ancliffe had no share or part in that - I shaped it out in the same way as the other - the glasses were not quite full; I do not know that at this time he said any thing to the child; I am sure the child drank the glass; the other part was poured out into the glass, but I cannot say whether Hill or the child drank it - I mean the last glass of the second quartern which I took; I think the child drank the first glass I poured out; I do not know that the last was given to the child; the child got a little out of the second quartern - to the best of my knowledge Hill drank the first glass; Hill paid for both quarterns - I went away. It appeared as if the child had drank more than sufficient; he rolled about, and fell down - it appeared to be in misery, and could not help itself - it fell down before the mother came in, and laid on the ground; no person attempted to assist or take it up; its mother called, "Henry" in the stable - he was laying about the middle, and said, "Yes, mother." The father came in - the prisoners were there at the time; the mother said, "What have you been giving the child, some gin?" they made no answer at first; there was then a conversation between her and the prisoners - Hill spoke first. The father began to swear and say, "What have you given the child gin for?" Hill said he did not care a d-n for Mr. or Mrs. Tyers. The mother took the child out of the stable; when she took him up in her arms he cried; I do not know what was said by Hill at the time, but he used abusive language; I do not remember any thing more: I do not know that Hill said any more. I had seen the lad before that day; during the time I was there Ancliffe did not say any thing that I know of; I did not see that he shared any part of the gin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When the mother called out, the child answered immediately? A. Yes- it was then able to say, "Yes, mother;" during the time he gave him the gin the child said very little. He remained stupid and confused, as if he had been drinking a good deal.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who appeared stupid? A. Hill. I had seen Hill before this - he appeared more stupid than usual that night, as if he had been affected with liquor.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at No. 7, Great Mary-le-bone-street. I was called in to visit the child about seven o'clock in the evening - I found it in a kind of stupor; it had very much the appearance of a person having taken a large quantity of liquor; the arms and limbs were contracted; they hung down, and there appeared a sort of listlessness about the child; the pupils of the eyes were contracted - the appearance was that of a person who had taken a quantity of narcotic drink; I could not tell what it was. The effects of gin upon the human constitution would act as a narcotic. The child attempted to vomit; he appeared evidently dying, and there were symptoms of blood in the head; I stopped with him half an hour - I had no previous knowledge of it; I saw it three times within an hour or an hour and a half; I stopped about twenty minutes each time; when I left the third time I said it would not live many minutes, I smelt the liquor ejected, and it smelt strong of liquor; excess of liquor will destroy a child, or any person; this appears to be the cause of the child's death; I know what a quartern of gin contains - half a quartern would not kill the child.</p>

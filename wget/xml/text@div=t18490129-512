                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Luff, a labourer, and live at 8, Nottingham-place, Kingsland-road. The prisoner lodged in our house—on 29th Dec., about six in the evening, I went into the yard to take in my gown that I had hung out to dry—the prisoner came while so doing and pushed by me—I told him I was going to take in my gown, and he was not to lower my props; I did not want my gown dirted any more than his wife's—he said, "You b—y b—h, I will let you know who is master," and struck me with something that he had in his right hand on my temple—it bled very much—my clothes were swamped with blood—his wife, who was there, took a child away from him which he had in his left hand—he then said, "You b----y b—h, I will give you a Lancashire kick"—he then threw me down and kicked me on the left side of my head, and in the ribs—he then went into the par<lb></lb>lour, where he lived—I went and sat down in my husband's chair by the kitchen fire—his wife had gone out then—while sitting in the kitchen the prisoner came in and said, "You b----y b----h, I will do for you; I will cut your throat"—he had a buck-horn handled knife in his hand, and he drew it across my throat, but he heard footsteps, ran into his parlour, and shut the door—I pushed him when he gave me the second blow on the bead with his rut—I had not struck him at all before that—I bled furiously, and Mr. Finer was sent for and dressed my wounds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at North-place, Kingsland-road. On Friday evening, 29th Dec., I went to 8, Nottingham-place, about seven o'clock, and met the prosecutrix in the passage—I went with her into the kitchen—I found her clothes completely saturated with blood, while appeared to come from a small wound over the left temple—it must have been inflicted with some instrument; a fall, or a blow from the fist could not have produoed it—she fell back into a chair in an insensible state, and con<lb></lb>tinued so half an hour—I thought she was dying from loss of blood—her feet and legs became very cold—after she recovered she became violently sick—that would be very likely to be produced by such injuries as she has stated—I particularly observed what she vomited, and smelt it, and told the policeman Gilbert to do so also, and there was no smell of liquor—on the Saturday I found that one of her ribs was broken, I could not set it—I dressed the wound over the eye the same night, while she was lying on the floor—the prisoner was brought in by the policeman, and she said, "That is the man; it was he that did it"—the prisoner immediately answered, "I own I struck her; she struck me first"—I have seen a knife, and also some clothes-pegs—the wound was such as might have been produced by either of those.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long do you think she had been bleeding before you got there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say at least three-quarters of an hour—it was a jagged wound down to the bone, wounding a branch of the temporal artery—I will not say that the wound was made with the knife—a knife generally makes a clean, sharp kind of wound, but this is not a clean sharp knife—it might have been made with the clothes-peg—there was blood on that—from that I draw the inference that the clothes-peg was the instrument—I think it is the more likely instrument of the two—that peg was found among about three dozen others, in a basket on a table in the kitchen where the woman was—the prisoner said he had cut his knuckle, which he might have done with the nail in the clothes-peg—I should not like to say whether if the woman had fallen from a push or a blow given her, with the peg in her hand, and the peg struck her temple, that would produce such a wound—the prisoner always denied using the knife—the prosecutrix told me that the prisoner said he would give her a Lancashire kick—I have been four years a surgeon—I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and a licentiate apothecary—I had a good deal of experience in wounds while in the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live at Old ham, in Lancashire. On the 4th of July, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was in Hyde-park—I had only been five days from the country—I met George Webb, who has been tried and convicted—I walked with him a little way—(when I came to the gate there was a man on the other side—I asked him the way to Baker-street—he directed me)—while we were walking in the park, Webb whistled, and four other men came up—it was by the shrubbery—the prisoner seized me by the coat in the park, and demanded my money of me—I am certain he is the man—I told him I would not give it him—I put up my stick, and said I would strike them if they did not let me go—they did let me <hi rend="italic">go</hi>, and when we got to the gate I got over it, and met a man outside, and asked him the way to Baker-street—he directed me—I got to Blandford-street—I went to East-street to get some tobacco, and as I returned I went into a) public-house—Webb came in, took up the pint pot, and drank—I went out, and when I got out he gave a whistle again, and said he would charge me with an</p>

             picked me up, and afterwards there were two more women came; I turned angry with them, and asked them what they wanted; the last two went away and left me with the first; we went on a little farther, and there was a man that used me ill; he wanted to fight me; the prisoner had some conversation with him, what I cannot tell; the prisoner came to me again, and, as I was going along the street to St. Martin's lane, I missed the canvas bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you keep your canvas bag? - A. In my breeches pocket; going along I heard something fall; it happened to be my own canvas purse, I took it up, and missed a note out of it; I told her, if she would give it me honourably I would give her 5 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your note again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found your purse, what did you find in it? - A. All the money was left in it, and nothing gone but the note; I had felt her hand about that pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Not directly in it? - A. No, only about the pocket; I immediately put my hand there, and found the purse was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there were two other girls with you before? - A. Yes; but it was after they were gone I missed it;

             sworn. - I was constable of the night; she was brought in about eleven o'clock, the purse was delivered to me by Pocock; it contained two seven-shilling-pieces, five shillings, half-a-crown, and three sixpences, in silver; it was agreed by the Magistrate, at Marlborough-street, for the man to have some of the money, and three of the pieces of silver were marked. (The bag, and the three shillings marked, were produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in Long-acre, that man picked me up, and asked me to go and drink something; there were two or three more girls, they ill-used me, I went away from them; this man came up to me, and said he had been robbed; the girls knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you see the bag drop from her? - A. I heard it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were you sure that your purse was in your possession when the two women went away? - A. I cannot particularly say; when I missed it, the man wanted to fight me; I searched my pocket, and found the bag was gone.</p>

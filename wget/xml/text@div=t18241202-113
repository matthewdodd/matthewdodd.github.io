On the 5th of November, I missed a black gelding from a field behind my house - I had seen it safe on the 3d. I found it at Hatton-garden on the 12th, in possession of Read, and am sure it is mine. I took it home the same night - it knew the stable well - it was bred in that field, and would never leave its company - there were six or seven horses in the same field, and if it was put two or three fields off, he would break through to get to them; it must have been taken through the gate, for I examined the fence all round. I had offered to sell it for 27 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had any of its company got out of the field? A. No.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Horse Shoe, public-house, St. John-street, Clerkenwell. On Thursday, the 4th of November, about six o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my stables in company with another man; the prisoner rode a black mare, and the other man came driving this black gelding in a cart; the other man (I think) desired me to take care of the black gelding, for they had driven him very fast; the prisoner said, it was of no consequence what stable I put the mare into; they went away, and came back together about the middle of the day, and asked if I had fed the horses - I said Yes; the prisoner himself went and fed the mare with corn, which they had in a sack. I afterwards found the sack in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020056"></xptr>cart - I did not see him feed the gelding; the other man came up the yard at night, in company with Cowderoy. I did not see the prisoner then. Cowderoy had the horse out, and ran him up and down, but said it was too late; next morning, the prisoner and the other man came to the stables, and looked at the horses, and the other man observed, that they looked fresh. I asked him the price of the horse; he said the gentleman he had brought the night before, he dare say would buy it, and did not tell me the price - he said the man was coming up to try him in harness next day. I saw them together next day, (Friday) the other man asked what there was to pay for the horses. I said 6 s. the two, which he paid, and asked the prisoner to lend him 1 s., which he gave me for myself; he then said he had sold the gelding to the gentleman who had been to see it, and desired me to get the mare ready. I asked if the gentleman came for the gelding, who was to deliver it; he said "If I don't come myself, this man will;" meaning the prisoner, who was in the yard, and I believe within hearing - they went away together; the prisoner came back just at dusk with Cowderoy. Read was in attendance, and took them both.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. All the way through, the man treated the gelding as his? A. Yes - I considered him the owner. I have since heard that he is called Charley - he is not to be found.</p>

            . I am a cow-keeper, and live in Brook-street, Ratcliff. On the 4th of November, I was coming down St. John-street, and a man whom they call Charley, asked if I wanted to buy a horse. I had seen him in Smithfield before. I went to look at it, but it was dark. I did not see the prisoner then - on Friday afternoon, I saw Charley in Smithfield - he told me to call at the Castle and Falcon, and stop for him. I went and found him there, and wanted to know the price of the horse; he said he should not say till I had tried it, and said to the prisoner, "Will you go with this gentleman, and shew him the black horse," and that he would stop there till we returned. I walked behind the prisoner, and never exchanged a word with him. Read and his son were there, and took the prisoner; young Read asked if I knew where the other man was: we went to look for him about the market, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. All the prisoner did was to do what Charley asked him? - A. That was all; Charley is a horse-dealer. I have seen him at Smithfield a number of times.</p>
               <p>R. EVANS re-examined. Q. The mare seemed much in the same state as the gelding? - A. It was very lame in the fore feet, and appeared to have come the same distance; but it is hard to say, as some horses sweat more than others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The mare had been a good deal worked? - A. Yes; driven hard in the course of her life; the horse being fresh from grass. I should think would not he more liable to sweat - the mare could scarcely stand to eat - they were both very much fatigued.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received information, and waited at the Horse Shoe, public-house - the prisoner and Cowderoy came for the black gelding. I asked the prisoner how he came by it - he said, it did not belong to him, but to another person. Cowderoy said, the person was at the Castle and Falcon. I secured the prisoner, and my son went with Cowderoy. I questioned the prisoner - he said, he came from Heston - that he had seen the other man before; but knew but little of him - he believed they called him Jem - that he met him in St. John-street early on Thursday morning, with this black gelding, and he gave him 5 s. to let him put the gelding in his cart to try it in harness - he said, he was a butcher. I saw the cart; it had the name of "Hesther, of Heston," on it, and had two saddles on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you to ask these questions? - A. I generally ask questions when I take men; it is not altogether to give evidence against them. I did not ask them to trap him. I did it for the good of the public - he told me all this without being asked questions. I only asked where he came from, and he told me all the rest voluntarily. I asked where he met him, and what he was, and what he knew of Jem.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true then, that you only asked where he came from? - A. I asked those questions.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you give this account before the Magistrate? - A. No; for my son gave his evidence first.</p>

             I went with Cowderoy, but could not find the man. I asked the prisoner before my father came, if he knew the man - he said, he saw him a little before six o'clock in the morning - the horse was brought there, and that was all he knew of it. I found that the prisoner lived at Heston.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When this man came to pay for the corn, the hostler wanted to charge 9 s.; he gave him 6 s., and I gave him one to end the dispute. I told the hostler when I went, that the cart and harness was mine, and that was all - that the collar and black horse were not mine - he wanted to cut my collar, which was on the mare. I would not let him. I had a quartern of split peas, and two handfuls of bran, which I brought from home, and gave it to the mare. I stopped at the Queen's Head, public-house, St. John-street, that night alone, and next morning went to see my mare, and overtook the man going into the yard. I afterwards saw him and Cowderoy together, and he asked me to go and shew him the horse.</p>
               <p>COURT to EVANS. Q. Did the prisoner tell you what belonged to him? A. He did not; the collar on the gelding was cut. I only charged 6 s. for the corn - we had no dispute.</p>

            . I am a publican, and live at Heston. I lent my cart to Charley on the Monday morning, at Heston. I saw him go away with it - he had a chesnut mare, or gelding. I believe the prisoner had a horse at my stables at the time. I did not get my cart again, till it came from Hatton-garden; but Charley might have brought it back, for the prisoner had leave to use it whenever he chose, without asking me. I think he was at my house on Wednesday night. I never saw him and Charley together; my collar and harness always went with the cart. I saw the mare in my stable on Monday morning - it then belonged to one Champness.</p>

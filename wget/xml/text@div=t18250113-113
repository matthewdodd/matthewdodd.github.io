            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Gray's-Inn-Inne. These planes were brought to our shop on the 17th of December by the prisoner - we did not take them in, as we had some information about them - I was not in the shop when he brought them, but I went for an officer, and saw him come out with the officer.</p>

            . I went to the shop on Friday, the 17th of December, and found the prisoner, and these two planes on the counter. He said a strange man, in a white jacket, gave him them to pledge.</p>

I saw a young man pass the shop, and he asked me to take the planes in and pawn for him, in the name of Bellinger. When the officer came I told him this story - we went out, and the man was not there.</p>

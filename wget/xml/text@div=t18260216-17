               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is yours an office of considerable business? A. Yes; we had done business once or twice before for Rigaud, and once since; I never heard that he was agent for obtaining letters of administration.

            . I am clerk in the Registry office of the Consistory Court of the Bishop of London. I have the proceedings of the Court here; letters of administration were granted to Eliza Gardner, to the effects of Joseph Ricci - here are the affidavit and bond - I am subscribing witness to this bond, and saw it executed on the 11th of August, 1825, at Doctors'-commons.

             re-examined. All the body of this bond is my writing, except the word "Spinster," which was afterwards inserted by a clerk in our office. I prepared this instrument from the warrant - Rigaud and the administratrix were there when I prepared it - I saw them both execute it - but who the administratrix was I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You prepared it from the warrant? A. Yes; the body of it; but the names and addresses I got from the party themselves - I asked Gardner where she resided.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive the names and descriptions from written instructions? A. I cannot exactly charge my memory, but think it was from word of mouth - they could see the warrant.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Who produced the warrant in their presence? A. I brought it into the office - they accompanied me to the surrogate; the oath was administered to the same person who signed the bond - [Samuel Trueman here produced an affidavit of property from the Legacy Duty office] - this affidavit was prepared by me, by direction of Rigaud - they were written directions - I read the affidavit over to the administratrix who signed it in Rigaud's presence - it was done at the same time as the bond was signed.</p>
               <p>Dr. COOPER. This warrant is signed by me. A person, calling herself Eliza Gardner, appeared before me, and swore to this affidavit of property; the same person took both oaths within a few minutes of each other.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen Rigaud on these sort of transactions before? A. Several times; I have known him four years; he represented himself as employed by parties to obtain administrations, and has done so through me four or five times - he has since applied for administration to the goods of John Richmond.</p>
               <p>Mr. SERJEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Did he bring an instrument to you for that administration? A. Yes; it was signed Eliza Baker - but letters had been granted - he called and took those papers away - I could not get them back again.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. I suppose the name is immaterial when letters are applied for? A. If persons take the oath we take it for granted they are the parties.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Barwise, watchmaker, St. Martin's-lane. I know the prisoner Meek - she always represented herself by that name - she made several purchases at our shop - I have seen her there several times. (Looking at the boud) I believe the name, Eliza Gardner, to this bond to be her writing. (Looking at two powers of attorney and the affidavits) these are also signed in her writing. (Mr. Fletcher here produced another bond, signed "E. Garner") I believe this name to be in Meek's hand-writing.</p>

From 1820; she lived in the family of a customer of ours, and was afterwards a customer herself; she wrote an order for a clock in my presence, about the end of 1822, and signed the name of Meek - I have seen her write several times since; I have no doubt whatever of these signatures being her writing; I remember her writing from circumstances which made a strong impression upon my mind. I have had several letters from her upon which I have acted - one of them returned 8l., which she had borrowed.</p>

Consols - I find by my book that they produced 89l. 12s. 6d., and the other, for New 4 per Cents., 108l. 5s. 7d. I paid him the money by a draft on Messrs.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Were the prisoners charged, before the Magistrate, on this particular case? A. The bond was produced on a charge of forging the letters of administration - evidence was given of the forgery of the bond - they were committed on account of a true bill being found. I knew Rigaud had been residing at Worthing; I went down there on the 16th of November, and seized his papers - I did it on my own authority. Meek was taken into custody there, on a charge of misdemeanor; some papers, partly burnt, were brought to me, and they brought to my knowledge these felonies - there was no charge of felony against them then; Rigaud was in London at that time; he did not send me word that he had surrendered to Whitecross-street. I gave directions for his apprehension, and an officer brought me ward that he was taken by the Sheriff. I saw him at my office four or five times between the 4th and 16th of November, respecting the claim of one Eliza Garner, to property in the Bank, in the name of Baylward.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. What claim was it? A. The claim of a young woman, described as twenty-one years old, by the name of Eliza Garner; this bond was given in evidence before the Magistrate; I gave Rigaud notice of this bill being found before the last Sessions.</p>

               <p>The affidavit of Eliza Gardner - that she was so related to Joseph Ricci, praying that letters of administration might be granted, and swearing the effects to be under 300l. - two powers of attorney, from Eliza Gardner, to Rigaud, for the sale of the stock - another administration bond, describing Eliza Gurner neice and only next of kin of another person, which was also proved to be signed by both the prisoners.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Meek put in a written Defence, denying that she had ever signed any of the papers, and all knowledge of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Rigaud, in a long address to the Court, went through the same line of Defence as on the former trial (page 139), representing that he had been employed by several persons, as agent, to recover funded property, and that a Mr. Issitt applied to him to procure this property for Eliza Gardner, and upon inquiry he had no reason to doubt the statement; he complained of an illegal warrant being issued against him by the Bank solicitor, whom he had frequently called upon respecting this claim - that the expenses paid for administering, together with his own charges, would amount to the notes traced to him.</p>

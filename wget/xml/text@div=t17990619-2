             sworn. - I am in the service of the prosecutor: I am a Custom-house watchman; I was going down to the Custom-house, on the 30th of May, Thursday, in the evening, about six o'clock; I turned out of Thames-street, and up a gateway that leads up to the Custom-house quays, and I saw a man coming from the Hull crane, where the Hull vessels unload their goods; I saw him coming with the linen under his coat, some Irish sheeting; I did not stop him then, but the manner of his coming gave me a suspicion; I let him pass me, and I followed him till he came into Thames-street, and then he set off running up Water-lane; I cried out stop thief; he run about five yards, and then dropped the linen; he was stopped by two watchmen near Syms's coffee-house; he was brought to the quays, and gave but a poor account of himself; he said a man gave him a shilling to carry it to some house.</p>

               <p>- CALVERT sworn. - I command a vessel; the linen was landed by a company of ticket porters; it was a rainy day, and could not he forwarded home; I imagine if it had been totally lost, I should have been accountable for it; I took it under my charge again.</p>
               <p>William Green, a constable, produced the linen.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Calvert). Is that the same linen? - A. It looks like the same linen; the pack was cut open, and there was just room for such a bundle as this.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am a labourer, and always worked very hard for my living; I came down upon the keys, and I met a man, who asked me if I was willing to earn a shilling, and to carry this bundle to Fenchurch-street, to the Saracen's-head; I was willing to earn a shilling, as I have a wife and two small children; he walked before me, and then he run; I heard the cry of stop thief, and I run; they took me into custody.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Ironfounder's Arms Cold,-bath-street, Greenwich—on a Wednesday afternoon, 9th or 10th November, the prisoner came several times, but I did not always see him, as I was very ill—I saw him at dinner-time, and at a quarter to 5", when he came to the bar, and asked for half a pint of beer—I was then in the bar parlour—he said, "I have got some little puppies"—I did not remain there—he wished me good night, and I said "Good night," and went into the back parlour—he had only been in the bar two or three minutes—he was alone—I heard him leave—there was a bird in a cage hanging up in the bar—I saw it safe about five minutes, should think, before I left the bar—no one else came into the' oar, but I presently missed the bird singing, and came out to look for it—I have to change its place four or five times a day—it is a very valuable bird:—I then" missed it and the cage—I have not seen the edge since, but I saw the bird at the police-court—it is not here—I am quite sure it is the same—I know it by its song—it had been with me a long time.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Ironfounders' Arms Greenwich—this bird and cage were mine; they were missed about 9th November—on the day that it was found, I saw it in a different cage opposite where the pri<lb></lb>soner was working—I am prepared to say, without doubt, that it is my bird by its peculiar song and peculiar marks—these birds are bred between a goldfinch and a canary, and they are all different and peculiar; they are not like robins or goldfinches, which are all alike—I gave very nearly 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi> for it—it is a bird that you would hang up, for the fanciers round' to come and hang their birds around him on account of his song—I saw him on the same morning that he was missed.</p>

I am in the service of Mrs. Ward—on this Wednesday I was going in and out the bar—I remember the prisoner coming about a quarter to 5, and I saw him drinking there at about ten minutes to 5—I heard him leave about 5 o'clock, but did not see him—I was in the tap-room—I had seen the bird and cage safe that afternoon, but had not noticed it for two hours—I missed it when Mrs. Ward told me something—I have seen it since, but cannot swear to it—I saw no one there but the prisoner.</p>

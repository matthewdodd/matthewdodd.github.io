               <p>On the 3d of November I went to Mr. Jones's wine vaults, at the end of Widegate Alley, and I saw Baker snatch this bundle from the boy, I am sure it was him, I have seen him several times, but never spoke to him: they ran by the side of me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he lay hold of the boy or attempt to knock him down, or make use of any violence of that kind? - No, Sir, Abrahams went up to the end of Gravel lane and made a retreat back again; I cannot say they were in company, he was standing there; the boy was standing at the end of Widegate Alley when they snatched the bundle from him; but whether he stopped of his own accord, or whether they stopped him I cannot say, I saw Baker snatch it from him.</p>
               <p>Court to Neale. Where the things ever found? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you first see Abrahams? - I saw him the next day, and I saw him that night just before they took the bundle from me.</p>
               <p>Did you see Abrahams with Baker, just before Baker snatched the bundle? - Baker and Abrahams stood talking together at the corner before Baker snatched the bundle from me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Did either of them say any thing to you? - No, neither of them.</p>
               <p>PRISONER ABRAHAMS'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was apprehended on Tuesday morning about twelve o'clock; I was brought up to Justice Wilmot's Office and had my hearing; this little boy swore to me; I was sent to gaol for another examination on Friday; then this little boy could not swear to me.</p>
               <p>PRISONER BAKER'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at work on the Monday when this was done; I came home at and worked till half after eight o'clock at night, I went to bed before nine, the door is ways locked up at nine.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner Baker called for Witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this offence is stated to be that of a highway robbery, and the indictment states all the requisites of such an offence: the distinction that is established in point of punishment between a common theft and an highway robbery, is intended to protect the personal safety of individuals; therefore it is that the law which makes a common theft only what we call a single felony, and always allows to it the benefit of clergy, punishes highway robbery with death: but in order to constitute a highway robbery, there must in point of law either be a putting in fear so as to excite an apprehension of personal danger to the party who is robbed, and by that means intimidate him to deliver his property, or else there must be actual force and violence used to his person: without one or other of these requisites a highway robbery cannot exist in point of law, and in all cases where these requisites are not found, if the Jury are satisfied that property is taken by a person, it becomes a simple theft and not a highway robbery. Now in this case there is no pretence to consider this as a highway robbery: one of the prisoners snatched the bundle, he never laid hands on the boy, he never spoke to him to threaten him, and though it was snatched with a degree of force to get it out of his hands, that is not the kind of force that the law means in the case of a highway robbery, for in this case there was no previous putting in fear, neither was there any violence used to the person of the boy, so that I am clearly of opinion that the evidence in this case will not support that part of the indictment which makes it a capital felony: but the indictment<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100072"></xptr> contain in it a sufficient description of a common theft therefore those words which would make it a capital offence if wanted may be so far separated from the rest of the indictment, as that you may find the prisoners guilty of the single felony, without that aggravated circumstance, if you are persuaded that those are the persons who committed the fact. Now subject to that observation in point of law; I will state to you the evidence. (Here the learned Judge stated the evidence to the Jury.)</p>

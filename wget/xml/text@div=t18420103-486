                  </hi>. I live in Upper Cheyne Mews, near Gower-street, Tottenham-court-road. On the 2nd of December the prisoner came to the news, about eleven or twelve o'clock, as I was standing at <hi rend="italic">my</hi> door—he aid to me, "You get a bad light here, don't you?"—I said "Yes"—he said, "I wish I had a ladder to take this one down, and I will get it re<lb></lb>paired; the gas is to be laid on to-night or to-morrow"—I lent him a ladder, and he took the gas-pipe and burner away with him, and said he would repair it, and put it on again</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the Hampstead-road, and am agent to the gas company. The prisoner had no authority to take the pipe down—I went to the place on the 6th, and found it was gone—it was in the district of the commissioners—Mr. James Thompson is one of the commissioners, and Mr. Davies is one of the former commissioners.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant E</hi> 12.) I took the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody on the 15th—he said he was employed by the London Gas Company to repair the pipes—I found on him this half-pint pewter pot, and nineteen duplicates, principally referring to gas pipes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I saw with my blow-pipe where the pipe was broken. I mended it and gave it to a coachman in the mews. He gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it. I have worked for a gas company eighteen years. The duplicates are my property; they relate to gas pipes and tools, and my own clothes. I told the officer he could find them all at one place, if he liked to go. I own to taking the pipe. The coachman told me he had nearly capsized his coach the night before, and he told me the first lamp going down the Mews was broken. I said, "Perhaps the gas may be laid on by and by." He said, "If the pipe is mended I will go and turn it on." I said I would go and stop it. I went down and asked Mr. Lewis. He said it leaked. I took it to a public-house and mended it, and gave it to the coachman, who said he would screw it on himself. I never said I belonged to any gas company; if I were to see the coachman I could point him out in a moment.</p>

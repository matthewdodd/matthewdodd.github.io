                  </hi>. I am a labourer, in the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. On the night of 13th Dec. I was going from the Fountain public house with Reynolds and Slark, at a few minutes before 11 o'clock—we passed a young man and woman talking together—we then heard a disturbance, looked round, and saw four marines; they hit the young man and woman, and I said they had better <hi rend="italic">step it off</hi>—Reynolds said, "What for?"—I turned round, Lammie hit me with his belt under the right jaw, on the left hand, and left knee—they then hit Reynolds, and knocked him down an area—I called, "Police!" caught Lammie, took his belt away, and put it into my pocket—it was covered with blood—those are two of the men.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cameron. Q.</hi> Did I strike you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, you began upon the others.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Spooner, I turned round when he did, and saw the prisoners running down the road, after insulting the young man and woman—they then hit Spooner, and one of them, I cannot swear which, hit me on the back of the head with a belt; another hit me on the eye, and they broke a rail down, and put me down an area—I am sure the prisoners are three of the four—there were no other soldiers near.</p>

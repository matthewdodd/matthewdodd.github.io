March, in consequence of information I received, I went to Munden-street, Fulham, accompanied by Swain, another constable—when we got there I saw the prisoner William Kennerfick coming apparently from the direction of the Rising Sun tavern, playing with other boys in the street—on my approaching him he ran in doors, to No. 2, Munden-street—I went after him to the first-floor back room—the door was fastened inaide—I asked for admittance, and said that if they did not open the door I would break it open—it was then opened from the inside—I went in and saw the three prisoners there—there was also a person named Chambers, who had come in apparently just before, and was in the act of sitting down—the prisoner Margaret was sitting by the fire, William was coming from the right-hand corner as I went in—there was a closet in that corner—James was standing between his mother and brother—there was an elder brother there too, besides these—when I got into the room I addressed the prisoner William, and said, "I want to know where you got the florin from, that you passed at Mrs. Butlin's shop last night"—he said, "I was not out of this house last night"—upon that the mother said, "My boy was never outside this house</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186204070061"></xptr>
               <p>last night"—before taking William in custody, I took him to Butlin's, in King-street, Hammersmith, to be identified—on the way there he said, "I was there Iast night; I did pass the florin," or "offer the florin," I won't be sure which—he said, "I did go to Butlin's; a man gave it to me at Hammersmith-gate, for wheeling a load of furniture to Knightsbridge; I did not know as it was bad"—the prisoner said that he went to buy a loaf of bread—I said, "Why go so far to buy a loaf of bread when there are two or three baker's shops in your own street?"—I do not believe he made any reply to that—I took him to the station and then to the Magistrate, which occupied about half an hour, and then went back to Munden-street, where I had left Swain in charge of the room—I found him there when I got back, and made a search in the room—in the corner of the room, from which I had seen the boy coming, I found these two shillings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) among some fire-wood—some more were handed to me by the other officer—I saw Swain make a further search—I directed him to search a closet, which was situated at the back part of the same room—he handed me out from there two crown-pieces, rolled up in paper, and nine florins, also rolled up in paper—he could not see what it was—he said, "Sergeant, here is something," and handed it out to me—I was close to him—he was in the dark, and I was in the light—he handed them down to me from the closet, also five shillings, wrapped in paper—I also saw him find a fourpenny <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> in the corner of the room, on the floor—I took the prisoner James into custody the same afternoon—I told him it was for uttering a counterfeit shilling to Mrs. Felthouse—he said, "Yes; I did give the shilling, but a man in Derbyshire-street gave it to me," or "I received it from a man in Derbyshire-street"—afterwards he said, "It was not a man in Derbyshire-street; it was my little brother"—I produce this counterfeit shilling which I received from Mrs. Felthouse—I got this florin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Mrs. Butlin—on the following Monday I took the prisoner Margaret into custody at the same house in Mundan-street—I said to her, "I am come to apprehend you, being the owner of this room where this counterfeit money was found, for having it in your posses<lb></lb>sion"—I believe her remark was, "Oh! my God," or something to that effect—she said, "I know nothing about it"—I believe she said, "The boy Crocknell brought it from Fulham-fields on Thursday last, and has been stopping in my house ever since?"—I said, "Do you mean that boy that I searched in the passage?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Why, you told me that was your son"—she said, "I know I did, but I am very sorry for it"—I believe I said, "If you had given me that information then, he would have been in a different position"—I am satisfied that he is not her son—I have made inquiry; he has absconded from the neighbourhood.</p>

                  </hi>. These two shillings found in the corner of the room, of 1836 and 1859, are both bad—the shilling uttered to Felthouse is counterfeit—it is of 1836, and from the same mould as one of those found in the corner of the room—Butlin's florin is counterfeit, and of 1859 (<hi rend="italic">The Court considered that the shilling uttered to Jackson must be excluded</hi>)—here is a counterfeit groat found under the prisoner's bed—of those found in the closet, here are two counterfeit crowns of 1821 from the same mould, two of the best I have ever met with; here are nine counterfeit florins of 1859, all from one mould, and from the same mould as the one uttered; here are five counterfeit shillings, one of 1852, two of 1859, and two of 1860—the two of 1859 are from the same mould as the one found in the corner of the room—those of 1860 are from the same mould, and from the same mould as that objected to.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no evidence against the two boys for having counterfeit coin in their possession, the coins passed by them on different occasions not being any of those charged in the Indictment, which were those found in the room proved to be in the occupation of the woman; that the boys were not of an age to have possession apart from the mother, and that the four<lb></lb>penny piece was not in the Indictment at all.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROWDEN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">contended that the fact of the boys living in the same room, and having been two days previously passing counterfeit coin from the same mould as those found in the possession of the mother, and in the cupboard; was evidence of the possession of all, they having all been together when the money was found.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated that it would be very difficult for the jury, if it were left to them, to dismiss from their minds the coin uttered to Felthhouse; that there were, no doubt, other coins in the boys' pos<lb></lb>session independent of the mother, but the Indictment only included the coins found in the room; that if they were charged with uttering, the uttering by the boys might be used to show guilty knowledge on the part of the mother, but that there was no evidence to go to the jury in respect of the boys.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">could not withdraw the case from the jury, but left it to them to say whether they believed the coins were in that room with the mother's knowledge, and under her control; and whether the boys, or either of them, could be said to have any possession or control over them, or whether they were merely employed by the mother or some other person; if they thought the latter, then the boys ought to be acquitted.</hi>

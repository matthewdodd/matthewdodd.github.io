               <p>Prisoner Bell. Do not you recollect sitting in the bar, and my wishing you a very good night when I went out? - I believe he was not gone, to the best of my knowledge, I was sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Strong. Do not you remember my wishing you a good night at one, while you was lolling your head on the bar? - No; I have often seen the prisoners both in the week before the robbery, and several times before for two or three months.</p>

               <p>Did they continue there till Mr. Harrison went to bed? - I do not rightly remember whether they did or not, I remember letting Bell out before Mr. Harrison went to bed; I do not recollect either letting Strong out or seeing him go out; I saw Strong last in the house, between ten and eleven, that was about the time that the dog was dying, I did not much mind about the dog, I am quite sure to the fastening the bar.</p>
               <p>Is that petitioned off from the tap room? - As it opens into the tap room, there is open work, that goes down of a night; I locked the door of the bar, and all the doors in it, my brother was the last up.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing not in the bar when you went to bed, that was there in the morning? - In the morning I found in the bar a red garter that had not been there the night before; I missed two quart silver tankards, and one silver pint, two silver salts, two silver table spoons, four silver tea spoons, one silver watch; it was in the drawer locked up, where the salts and table spoons were, there was some silver coin of King William and Queen Mary; I do not know what it was; there was a guinea of King William and Queen Mary.</p>
               <p>What time did you go into the taproom in the morning? - I got up about about half after seven; I lost a work-bag, containing a new shirt, almost finished, and two pocket handkerchiefs that have since been found, there were several pieces of cotton; I have the garter, and have had it ever since; I have seen the prisoners several times at my house, nobody has any access to the bar except people belonging to the house; they were all in the bar, I saw them. I observed this man at my house that night; I have seen the prisoners several times at my house before, but never saw them in the bar.</p>

               <p>I assisted in the apprehension of both these prisoners; it was last Sunday morning; I took Strong at a house in Old-street road, I was with Jealo us; we had been Grub-street, and had information that he lived about Saffron-hill quaater, but we thought to call at this house in our road, and Jealous got out of the coach, and left us three in, presently a boy came and beckoned us, and there we found the prisoner Strong, East was there, and some other persons, some boys that I did not take much notice of, that I suppose are always there, and there were some things found by some of the other people, not by me, and we sent East to New-Prison, and Strong was carried to Covent-Garden round-house, I did not see the garter found; I was told that I should see East at the Adam and Eve in the afternoon, there I found Bell, and took him into custody, and he was very troublesome, he said he would be d - nd if he would be tied or taken, or any thing of the sort; I told him it was for breaking into a house in Fleet-street that you are wanted for.</p>
               <p>What did he say to that? - He did not like it, he said something of living in Fleet-street, or working there; I found a little small gimblet about him, nothing like a housebreaker's tool; Shallard and Townsend were with us.</p>

               <p>Harrison. I believe it to be mine; there is a cypher of two Ws upon it; I bought it second hand; it was in the drawer in the bar.</p>

               <p>I live in Old-street; I know both the prisoners at the bar by sight; I remember the day that Jealous and the other officer came to my house, it was last Sunday; Strong was there, he came to know whether every thing was safe that I had of him; I had two tankards, a pair of salts, one milk pot, some silver coin, a watch, and a napkin, marked L. T; I had them of him between seven and eight in the morning; I went and fetched them from Bell's room.</p>

               <p>Where was that room? - In Aldersgate-street; they fetched me at half past six to go to Bell's; I asked them what they wanted, and they both told me they had some plate; they both spoke; I went soon afterwards to the house of Bell, in Aldersgate-street, facing Westmorland-buildings; nothing passed in the room till the plate was weighed; Bell took the plate out of a small hand basket, and weighed it; I carried the scales with me, it weighed seventy-five ounces; he took them out by pieces; Strong was present; when I had weighed it, I tied it up in the napkin, and I put it on the bed while I paid them the money; I put the money on the table; they did not share it while I staid; I was to have the plate, and watch, and five pieces of silver coin, and a guinea with a King William and Queen Mary's head on it; I had it from Strong first, and I returned it to Strong and he gave it to Bell, in the room that Bell calls his room; I had never been at that room before; I was to give them twenty pounds for the whole; I gave them nineteen guineas and a shilling, that makes twenty pounds; I carried the plate away with me; nobody went with me; I went to my own house; I saw Strong, he came about half past nine to know whether every thing was safe.</p>
               <p>What to know whether it was all put into the crucible? - I suppose so; while he was talking about that, in came Mr. Jealous and asked Alexander where it come from, and he said, from Fleet-street; in the room where I weighed it, I asked him does it come far or near, and he said, it does not come far, it comes from Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>It then became necessary to put it in the melting pot sooner? - Yes, a great deal the sooner.</p>
               <p>You was taken into custody? - Yes, and sent to New-prison.</p>
               <p>How long was it before any body came to you? - Bell came to me in the afternoon of the Sunday; he came to see me, and told me, if I held my tongue nothing could hurt; Bell was taken that night; that work bag was wrapped in the basket, to keep the plate from gingling; it was put in by Bell and Strong; I delivered it to Mr. Carpmeal, they were the same I bought of the prisoner; I gave twenty pounds for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bell. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Strong. I leave it to my counsel.</p>

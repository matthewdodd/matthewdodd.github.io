                  </hi>. I am a silver polisher, of No. 8, William-street, Manchester-square. On Easter Monday, about 7 o'clock in the evening, I was in Greenwich fair—I had my watch in my left waistcoat pocket, by an Albert guard—I was just turning round to one of the stalls in the centre of the fair, and felt something at my waistcoat pocket—I turned round and saw the prisoner's hand move from it, and his other hand moved behind me—I had looked at my watch not two minutes "before—I took him by the collar and told him that he had got my watch—he called me a false fellow, wrestled very much with me, and tried to strike me—a constable came up and took him in charge—when be found he could not get away, he turned round and asked me what was the value of the watch, and he would pay me for it—I told him it was entirely out of my hands, and he must take his chance—the watch has not been found—the chain remained hanging in my button hole.</p>

I was in Greenwich fair on Easter Monday, but was not on duty—my attention was called to a mob, I went up, and saw Cave with his hand on the prisoner's collar—he said, "This man has taken my watch," and gave him in charge—he resisted very much, and going along he looked over his shoulder and said to Cave, "What is the value of the watch, and I will pay you?"—he said, "It is entirely out of my hands; I have nothing more to do with it"—I took him to the station, and found 2(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>

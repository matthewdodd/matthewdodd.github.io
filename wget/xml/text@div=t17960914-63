               <p>I am shopman to Messrs. Pinheiro and Brandon, in Whitechapel; On Wednesday the 20th of July, when the woman came from work as usual, I robbed her down; I had a suspicion she had something about her that she should not have; I asked her what she had got, she would not tell me; I asked her again, and she said, if I would go down into the cellar with her she would show me; I went into the cellar and she took up her outside petticoat and pulled out this tobacco, (producing it); it was loose in a kind of a pocket, I have had it ever since; there was another woman in the cellar that saw me take it from her, and I desired her to call my master; he came down, and I told him I had taken it from her.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Pinheiro). Had you such tobacco as that in your house? - A. Yes; It was never out of our premises; she had one hundred weight of tobacco weighed out to her to strip; it was out of a hogshead that had been damaged at the sides.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not miss such a quantity as that? - A. Not very well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser—on Wednesday morning, 30th May, about half-past one, I was passing through some small streets called the Vinegar Ground, leading from the City Road into Old Street—I saw three young men and a female—the prisoners are two of the young men—they came up to me, and Prior got in front of me and asked me what I had got to say about his sister—I said, "I don't know your sister"—Prior seized me by the throat—the other man who is not here kicked me under the chin—when I got the first kick I said, "I know you"—then they said, "Let's finish him"—after they kicked me they got my watch and chain—Edwards took the watch and chain—the man who got away took nothing—he has not been taken into custody—they all ran away—I got up and went the same way that they went—a policeman came up and I gave a description of them—I had not seen either of the men before—I said I knew them at the time they were seizing me—after the occurrence, between one and two in the afternoon of the same day, I saw Prior in a public-house near the spot—I had gone down to see if I could see any of them—I went in to have a glass of ale, and Prior was there, and said, "Make it a pint"—I didn't take any notice—a pint was called—I put down a two-shilling piece and Prior took up the one and sixpence and ran away with it—I said to him, "I know you"—he said, "I know you do"—he said, "I will get you your watch and chain back if you don't make a noise about it"—I gave a description to 198 S, and he was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (198 G). On Wednesday, 30th May, I was on duty in the City Road—the prosecutor came and told me he had been robbed—he gave me a description of the men—from the description I looked after them, and took them into custody—I took Prior first, about half-past five in afternoon of 30th May, in the Vinegar Ground—he was in company with five other men—when he saw me he walked away—I ran after him and caught him—the prosecutor then came up, identified him, and charged him—on 23rd June I took Edwards into custody at Playhouse Yard, Golden Lane—it is a very rough neighbourhood—I was alone on both occasions when I took these men—Edwards was in company with a female—I took him to the station and placed him with two others something like himself—I brought the complainant, and he identified him at once—he picked him out from the others.</p>

The prisoner said, the ale-house people were gone to bed, then he declined to send; that she told him all his other servant were gone to bed; that he went to bed, and put his breeches under his head, with that Money in them. That the prisoner bid him a good night, and took away the candle. That about four in the morning, the prisoner come into his room; he asked her business, she said she came for some foul linen to wash, he went to sleep again, and slept till between seven and eight. When he came to put on his breeches, all his money and purse was gone, and the breeches were removed from under his head, and were lying by him upon the bed; that he charged her with robbing him; she denied it; he opened her box, and found the other things mentioned in the indictment; all which he deposed to as his own property, except the linen. That he had not laid the whole of the money in the indictment, but only such pieces as he could swear were in his purse.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in her defence said her master had presented her with the other things, and denied knowing any thing of the money.</p>

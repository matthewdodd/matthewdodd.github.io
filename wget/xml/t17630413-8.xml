            . I am a constable; the doctor got a warrant from Justice Wright, and I went with the Pawnbroker's man to the Castle in Castle-street, Bloomsbury, where we found the prisoner, and took her to the Justice; then we went to her lodgings, and there we found the duplicates of the things pawned, which are to answer to the pawnbroker's tickets; they were in a drawer, and also a handkerchief, (produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix) and this paper, (producing a paper) the maid declared the mistress's silver cloaths were put in to keep them from tarnishing. I went to the lodging two days after, to enquire if I could find the man named Stoaks, who lived with the prisoner, but he had made off; there was found this key (producing one) in their room, which I got liberty to try, and found it opened the late Lord Warwick's door, it is an empty house, two doors from Dr. Hibbins's house; we went up to see in what manner they could get from that to the doctor's house, and found any body could walk with a good deal of safety to the doctor's garret window. When the prisoner was examined the second time, she confessed that Stoaks told her he got into the empty house, and so got the things.</p>

               <p>Mr. Stoaks told me when he brought those things, that he brought them from a relation out of the country, and desired me to pawn them in his name, which I did.</p>

            . I am single, and live in Bear-street. I have known the prisoner a good while - I was with him on that evening, and picked up the shawl in King-street, Holborn - I gave it him to look at - he took off his hat and put it in - he was looking at it in his hat - we walked on about twenty yards, when this good woman said, "That is my shawl; I lost it, and I will have it;" he said he did not like to give it up till he knew the proper owner, and would have further proof of it being hers, and if it was hers to charge the watchman with him - Pratt came up and took it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where was Mrs. Shorter when you picked it up? A. I do not know; she was turning the corner of Orange-street when we got up - I think I told the patrol that I picked it up, but cannot exactly say - I said so at the watch-house, and I said so when the patrol came up - I will swear that.</p>

            . I am the patrol. I did not see this woman till we were going down to the watch-house - she was not present when I took the prisoner - I took him at the corner of Vernon-place - she came up at the bottom of King-street - I have no recollection of her saying that she picked it up, but he said, on going along, that she picked it up - she did not come into the watch-house - they talked together about her picking it up - the prisoner said at first that he had picked it up - I cannot say whether he said a woman picked it up before she joined him; the prosecutrix was quite sober.</p>

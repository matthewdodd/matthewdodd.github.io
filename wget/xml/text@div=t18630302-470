                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, 141 <hi rend="italic">H</hi>). About half-past 6 on the morning of 29th December I was on duty in Bethnal Green-road, near the Bell beer-shop, and saw the prisoners Attill (that is Goodland), Crane, and Lawrence; I cannot speak so confidently of Wright, because he stood in the shade, bat I can swear to the other three—I had never seen them before—when I first saw them they were about 200 yards off, close to the beer shop; and when I went along they divided into twos, just before I got opposite them, on the opposite side—I went down as far as Abbey-street, crossed the road, and they got together again, but divided before I got up to them—I went up as far as Tyson-street, thinking to meet some plain clothes men, but did not—I returned as quick as I could, ran down Orange-street and Satchwell-street—this was about half-past 6 in the morning—I got into a narrow place, where there is a narrow path, at the back of the beer shop—I had my hat off, and crawled on my hands and knees eight or ten yards behind the beer shop wall—I saw Goodland on his hands and knees nearest to me, and Crane next to him; there were only two on their knees—Lawrence was standing two or three yards off, looking into Bethnal Green-road; Wright was in the shade, I did not see his features at all—Lawrence gave a low whistle when any one passed—Crane got up off his knees, just straightened himself, and went on—I heard the door of the beer shop go, and ran out and struck at Crane with my truncheon, as he was on his knees, but missed him—Lawrence started across the road, and I saw no more of him; but he looked after me, to see if I followed him—I got hold of Attill and struck him, either on the shoulder or head—he had hold of this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and struck me with it; then my hat fell off—I am not certain whether I hit him—I then closed with him, expecting to get another—we got down, and he got uppermost; I threw him off—he had hold of the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, and I caught him by the throat—by that time the others came back; I could not say which, but two or three; and I can say that they were these men—I was then on the ground, but uppermost—they kicked me several times on the legs, but I cannot say which of them—I then wrenched the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> out of his hand—I lost my staff, and was bleeding very much—I called out for assistance, as I found myself getting much weaker—an old man came, and caught hold of Goodland—I let him get up, and took him as far as Gibraltar-walk, which is 200 yards—Crane and Lawrence were hustling me and trying to trip me up—I tried to get them into the coffee-shop, but could not because they got round the door—I got very weak, and could not stand—I received a fresh cut, and became so weak that I fell, and recollect nothing for a couple of days, when I found myself in bed at the station-house.</p>

I am a physician and sturgeon, of 2, Spital-square—Thomas was brought to me in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with blood streaming from a wound in his head—it was a severe lacerated wound; the bone was exposed—it was two inches long, and an artery was divided—he also had a cut on the inner side of the right hand an inch deep, and a bruise on the loins, and a wound on the shin—he was in a very exhausted state and insensible—it was such a wound as might be inflicted with this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—he was in great danger of his life for forty-eight hours—he is still under treatment and incapable of performing his duty.</p>

I am one of the Portsmouth Police—I took Lawrence at 2, Union-street, Portsmouth, at half-past 10, in January, on another charge—on the way to the station, I said, "You are also charged with attempted burglary and nearly murdering a policeman in London"—he said, "I know nothing about it; I never was in London"—I took a life-preserver like this from his pocket, and said, "Is that what you kill the policemen with?"—he said, "No; I carry that because of the garotters"—he was given up to the London Police.</p>

            . I a Bow-street patrol. On Thursday, the 17th of February, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was in Hereford-place, New-road - I saw Morris, whom I had known before, and Canham a short distance behind him, with a porter's knot and something in a sack - I stopped Canham, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got here?" he said, it did not signify to me - I said, I am an officer and demand to see what it was; I then endeavoured to pull it down, but he turned himself round; Morris came up and caught hold of the sack with one hand, and with the other tried to push him away from me - I got the sack down, and found it contained the lead - this was about a quarter of mile from the Manor-house at Paddington - I put the lead on Canham's head again, and said, I should take charge of him - Morris said, he should go home - I said I should take charge of him likewise, and as we were going along, Morris said,</p>
               <p>"You are giving yourself unnecessary trouble - this is my property, and I can prove it;" we took the lead to my apartments, and in our way down to the office, Morris said,</p>
               <p>"I have been as much as four or five months collecting this lead, buying it by 1 lb., or 1 1/2 lb. at a time;" I weighed the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070068"></xptr>the lead, and there is about 116 lbs., in a number of different pieces - I did not find where Morris lived.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MORRIS. I told him my name and place of abode. Witness. I am certain he did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner CANHAM. Q. When you met me, you passed me, and then turned back - I told you it was Morris's property? A. I had not passed him - he did not tell me it was Morris's property, but Morris said so.</p>

On Tuesday, the 16th of February, the prisoners were employed on that house, taking the lead off - I saw them there about half-past six in the morning of the 16th, stripping the lead off - I saw a great many pieces of lead lying on the ground, and these two pieces on the roof on Wednesday morning - I have no doubt in the least that these are the same.</p>

            . I am a plumber; I have compared these two pieces of lead together, and have no doubt whatever, but that they formed one piece; the marks of the water course, and the weight of the lead, together with the cutting, leave no doubt on my mind that it is so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MORRIS. Q. Suppose another building to be covered with lead, and a piece of that lead to be brought here, could you tell the difference? A. No.</p>

               <p>CANHAM'S Defence. I had been at work at the Manor-house, I went to my mate's house to breakfast, and he asked me if I would assist him in carrying this lead to sell, as he wanted to buy a pair of shoes and some other things; he said he would give me part of a pot of beer for carrying it; the watchman stated that I was at work on Tuesday morning; I was working in Black-lion-lane at that time for Mr. Stubbing, the surveyor; they sent a man to fetch us to work at the Manor-house. I have sent to Mr. Stubbings to beg him to come forward and prove that fact, but he said he dare not on account of the parish. I wish to ask Richardson, whether he saw me at work on Wednesday, and whether he remembers what I said to him on Thursday morning, when I came down from the top of the house, and whether I had any lead about me.</p>
               <p>RICHARDSON. Not that I saw, he had no bundle; but I did not rub him down; I had no suspicion of him. I had to watch the building from six o'clock in the morning till twelve.</p>

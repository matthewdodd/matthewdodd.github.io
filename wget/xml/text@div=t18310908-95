            . I live in Carter-street, Houndsditch, and am a furrier. On the 13th of July, the prisoner brought four fitch skins to my house, and asked what I would give for a dozen - I offered 15s.; he asked how much I would give for the four, and said 2s. - he said he would fetch the rest - I gave him 1s., and he went away; upon looking at them I knew they were the prosecutors, and informed him - I saw the prisoner in about an hour at his house.</p>

            . I am a furrier. The prisoner was about two months in my employ, and I discharged him on account of ill health; I was out of town at this time - he had an honest character; I had known him three or four years - I would not object to take him again; I have no means of knowing whether these have been sold.</p>

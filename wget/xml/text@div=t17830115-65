               <p>I saw the prisoner taking coals out of of Mr. Eddington's craft, on the evening of Monday the 9th of this month; the prisoner was on board the craft, I was on a platform adjacent to the craft; he was putting coals into his sack after he had got as many as there is now in the sack, he twisted the sack up, and lifted them on shore, and he took them on his back, and walked up the Bridge stairs along Chatham-square, and at the corner I stopped him; I asked him where he got them coals, he said they were given him, he resisted; another young man came by, and attempted to help me, he knocked the young man down: I collared him, he threw the coals off and struck me, and he cleared himself of me and ran away; I pursued him; till we got about the second arch of the bridge and I secured him; I am sure I saw him put the coals into the sack, I was about seven or eight feet off him, I was right over him: I could see him clearly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What are you? - A knot-maker by trade, I am a ticket porter.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner's person? - No, I knew a man of the same description.</p>
               <p>You mean you had heard a man like him spoken of? - I mean that a man like him had been described as being there several times.</p>
               <p>You know nothing of him before? - No.</p>
               <p>As you was in that position upon the wharf where the goods were landed, a kind of wharf or platform, I fancy you could not see any person wherever it was that had the coals, from the time that he took them out of the lighter, till he got up where he had got them on the wharf? - You may as well tell me, I cannot see you all the time.</p>
               <p>Answer me? - I saw him come up, there was nobody but us two, and I walked close behind him, I think he might be about a dozen yards off, I never lost sight of him, I am quite clear in that.</p>

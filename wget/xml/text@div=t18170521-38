            . I am the wife of John Collins. On the 30th of April, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I heard a noise, and ran down stairs - A mob came round; as I was going to my back room I saw the prisoner taking my husband's watch-no other person came into the house. I called out stop thief, he ran out, and I followed him round Charles-square - He was stopped before he got out of my sight; I did not see him throw it down - He had not got it when he was stopped. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>RICHARD CHAPMAN. I heard the alarm and ran after the man; the prisoner was stopped in the square - He had no hat on; I picked a hat up, when a man sprung out from behind a tree, and asked me what I had picked up; I asked him if he knew the prisoner; he said he would not run the risk of getting himself into trouble, and ran off. The prisoner said he had lost a hat. I picked the watch up.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MARY COLLINS. I am sure the prisoner is the man, he had a hat on when he took the watch. He was stopped at the end of the square.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was pursuing the man, and they took me for him - They knocked my hat off.</p>

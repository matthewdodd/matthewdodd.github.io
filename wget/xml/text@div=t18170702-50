            . As I was taking down the shutters on the 9th of June, about seven o'clock in the morning, and carrying them into the private passage, I heard a noise, and looking into the shop, I saw the prisoner going out - I immediately followed him. He crossed over Ratcliff-highway, down Breeze's-hill, and in the middle of the hill I saw him throw the handkerchiefs down; when he got a little farther he threw off his hat - I still followed and secured him - He was never out of my sight; I gave him in charge - They were worth 5l. I had seen them safe on the Saturday night. Tailor picked them up. I am certain I did not discover the prisoner until I saw him going out of the door. I did not see him take the handkerchiefs.</p>

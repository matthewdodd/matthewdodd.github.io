                  </hi>. I am an Usher of the Lambeth County Court—I know the defendant by sight, and I believe the oath was administered to him on 6th December—it is customary to do so—as near as I can repeat, the attorney for the plaintiff asked him "Did you ever have any coals, either on your own account or your mother's, on credit"—he answered in the nega<lb></lb>tive; the question was put a second time, and he again answered in the negative—I do not recollect hearing the Judge ask the same question—it was the mode in which the question was put which called my attention to it, otherwise I should not have troubled my head about the matter, there are so many cases—I mean that the way Mr. Elworthy put his question called my attention to the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Elworthy said "Will you swear that you never had any coals on credit, on your own account or your mother's?"—that was the only question asked—no notes were taken—that is Mr. Elworthy—the case may have lasted a quarter of an hour—thousands of cases are tried in a year—I am there three-parts of the day—I occasionally have to attend to other duties—the question I heard was not "Will you swear that either you or your mother never had these coals on credit;" but that question might have been asked.</p>

I am a coal-merchant, of 13 1/2, High Street, Vauxhall—I was formerly manager to Michael Pass &amp; Co., coal-merchants, of Princes Wharf, Vauxhall, and I am still acting for them—I had not the charge of the books, but I had the sole control of everything—I entered their service about the latter part of February, 1870—the prisoner very frequently came to the wharf to purchase coals—he generally bought them for cash, but I do not recollect his saying positively who they were for—it was my duty to be at the office every day—he has also ordered coals on credit—a person first applies at the office for the quantity of coals he requires, and a ticket is given to him, which he delivers to the foreman on the wharf, who delivers the coals accordingly—the tickets are filed every morning, and returned—they are marked "Paid," when paid, and left blank when unpaid, so that a party paying takes his receipt with him—I have only a personal knowledge of one ticket, that is March 21—the books are here—I saw the ticket of 21st March handed to the defendant—it is a ticket given at the office when coals are ordered—I wrote nothing on it—this is the writing of one of the clerks on it—I know from the books that the defendant ordered coals on credit on 21st March—I cannot swear it from my memory—I know they</p>

               <p>were not paid for, because I said "How is it that you almost invariably pay cash for your coals, and that there are several other transactions for which you have not paid cash?"—I had not been long in the place then, and wished to know—he said that his mother was not in the way, and there were two or three amounts outstanding, and he would call in a few days and settle them altogether—he did not have credit for coals at all after 21st March—the tickets not marked "Paid" were collected in the evening, and entered in the day-book in the usual course of business—I personally ex<lb></lb>amined a number of tickets where coals had been purchased by the defendant—I found the word "Paid" on all that were paid—this signature "Ellen" is the name of the bargeman; he always marks them—I also examined the books with regard to the account between the defendant and his mother and Mr. Pass.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I entered the service about the latter part of February, 1870—I employed Mr. Elworthy at the Police Court—I hardly ever saw Mr. Pass, perhaps once a week—I do not think the attorney began his question "Will you swear" I think that was at the close of the question—he did not begin "Will you swear"—I took no note of it, and do not know whether my solicitor did—I was not near him—I have not seen any notes of the evidence—when Mr. Elworthy took down my evidence, I told him what was said—I only give you my view of what the question was, as far of I remember, and to the best of my belief—a cash-book was kept, in which Mr. Pass, junior, copies the entries from the original book, which was kept by the boy Davis—the Judge did not tell me in dismissing the case that the books were so badly kept that he could make neither head nor tail of them—I was in Court the whole time, and I pledge my oath to that, for this</p>

               <p>simple reason, that the books were never produced; but he did say that our system of doing business was very irregular; you will find that it was not so—I differ from the Judge—I do not think I said at the County Court that the prisoner said that his mother had given him the money and he had spent it, for the whole case did not last three minutes—I did not tell Mr. Elworthy that—I gave him instructions to conduct the case, and con<lb></lb>sulted with him when the summons was taken out—to the best of my knowledge, I never told the Judge, or Mr. Elworthy, or the Police Magis<lb></lb>trate, that the prisoner said he had received the money and spent it, and promised to pay—I think I mentioned it to the Counsel when I had a con<lb></lb>ference with him here on Tuesday evening—Mr. Elworthy was not present—I did not tell Mr. Elworthy because there were so many little details which cropped up, and I did not attach the importance to it you do—the mother has dealt with the firm two or three years.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, South Lambeth Road, and travel in the coal trade—I was foreman and weigher to Mr. Pass for two years from the place being opened—I saw the defendant there many times, purchasing coals—when a person came to me for coals he brought a ticket from the office, upon which I put the name of the barge or wharf—when it was not paid I used to say "Halloa, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, credit again," and he would say "Yes, you b——, I am not such a b——y fool"—that happened several times—the tickets were collected, and I took them to the office in the evening—I enter them in a book; but I do not state whether they are paid for, I merely enter the quantity, so as to discharge myself for the coals—the defendant never paid me for any of these coals; he has paid me on the wharf, at times, and then I have always put "Paid" on the ticket; but not on the days in question—I was at the County Court on 6th December, and saw the defendant sworn—I heard the attorney ask him whether he had ever had any credit for his mother or himself; he said "No"—the question was repeated, and his answer was the same—I believe the Judge asked him the same, and he said "No"—to my knowledge he has had credit for his mother and himself; it may be fifty times, and it may be 100.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That is during the time the yard has been open, which is nearly three years—he may have had credit five or six times, in March, 1870—I cannot tell when the money was paid, or if he brought it next day—the attorney's words were "Have you ever had any coals on credit for your mother or yourself?"—he did not say "Have you ever had <hi rend="italic">these</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that a very great authority, Mr. Gray, disagreed with the late Lord Chief Baron's decision in the case cited, and contended that it was impossible to know when a witness was going to commit perjury, so as to have shorthand notes of his evidence taken.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">agreed with Mr. Gray's ruling rather than that of the late Lord Chief Baron, and further did not consider that case on all fours with this; but would reserve the point if it became necessary.</hi>

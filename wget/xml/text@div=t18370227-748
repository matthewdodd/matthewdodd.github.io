                  </hi>. I am a tobacco and snuff manufacturer, in Broadway, Westminster. The prisoner was in my employ from December, 1829, as traveller—he had a commission on what he sold—when he received money it was his duty to bring it to me, and enter the receipt of it in a book—here is the day-book in which he should enter his orders, and in this cash—book he should enter the receipt of all the money—on the 22nd of October, I find an entry in the day-book in his writing—he debits Susan Colstock with 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for goods sold on my account—there is no account in the cash-book of the receipt of that money—this receipt is in the prisoner's handwriting; and this letter also, which I received by post—I called on him on Monday, the 8th of February, to render an account of money that was owing, and we agreed with every thing—here is the book—"Mrs. Col<lb></lb>stock,</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Feathers public-house at Mersham, near Reigate.

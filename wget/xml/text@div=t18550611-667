On Thursday, 10th May, the prisoner came to No. 128, Lower-marsh, asked for a pound of tripe, and gave me half a crown—I gave him two shillings and two penny pieces in change—the instant he went out of the shop, my young man called my attention to the half crown—I had placed it in the till, but there was no other there—I found it was bad—the prisoner came again, about 7 o'clock, for half a pound of tripe—I recognized him, and asked him whether he would have the fourpenny, the same as he had had before—he said, "Yes," and gave me another half crown—it had the same peculiar ring as the first—I gave it to Koser, the boy in the shop, and told him to get it changed—he brought it back in a minute or two, and</p>

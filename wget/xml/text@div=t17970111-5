                  </rs>. He was also charged with the like murder on the Coroner's Inquisition.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury. You have already collected from the indictment which you have heard read, that you are called upon on one of the most awful, and, perhaps, at the same time, the most unpleasant duties that can devolve upon any set of men whatever, because, not only are you to pass, by your verdict, upon the life or death of the prisoner, but, at the same time, you are to bear in mind that he stands there to answer for having deprived a fellow creature of life.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the circumstances in which the deceased, met his death are very short. The prisoner, who keeps a house in Greenfield-street, Whitechapel, had a lodger, a young woman of very good character, though moving in a very humble station in life; this young woman was taken much notice of by the deceased, a young man of twenty years of age; he seemed to have a very great attachment to her, and which was likely to have been attended with a marriage, upon his return from a voyage upon which he was about to set out. The deceased frequently met at the house of the prisoner, and having engaged to set off on a voyage the next day, he came to take his leave; and, with a sort of anxiety, which was very natural upon such an occasion; after he had taken his leave he again returned to the house, and, I believe, a third time, finding it irk some to leave a house to which he seemed so much attached; however, about half past ten he came back, in the interim she had gone to bed; he knocked at the window, which was the usual signal for being let in, with the knowledge of the prisoner, he was told that he could not be let in that night<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110014"></xptr>they being gone to bed; but he, perhaps, having been drinking, and a little warm with liquor, continued rapping at the window; finding he could not get in, he went to a public-house in the neighbourhood and ordered some beer to the house, in hopes, by that means, to gain admittance; after some persuasion the beer was let in, but they told him they would not get up to let him in, it being an improper hour; the last time of rapping at the window he broke it; he then went to the door and knocked at that, this knocking at the door was heard by the prisoner, who came down with a poker in his hand, a weapon, one would have supposed, sufficient for any correction he might think proper to give him; however, the prisoner went out to fetch a watchman, or some other assistance, I cannot say what; however, it will appear, that he went to the house of a patrol, who was not at home, and there met with a woman of the name of Godfrey, and, instead of asking for the man, he asked her to lend him a pistol, and to induce her to do it he told her there was a person at his house that was troublesome, and, says he, I want to frighten him; the woman, apprehending no mischief, was prevailed upon to lend him a pistol belonging to one of the officers of the Police; when he got possession of the pistol, he loaded it with powder and ball, and he then returned to his house, he did not find the deceased in his house, but in the highway; he told him, if he did not go about his business, he would blow his brains out; he, with that sort of levity which was very natural to a young man in a state of intoxication, or perhaps not believing him to be in earnest, replied, blow away, and bed - d; without more ado, he took him at his word, raised his hand, fired the pistol, and the deceased fell, he died, I believe, in a few minutes, but what is very extraordinary, the prisoner, instead of affording any assistance, retired into his own house, and shut himself up till he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall abstain from all observations upon the law of this case, because it will come much better from an authority, which will be much more satisfactory, and much better applied to the facts than any statement of mine. Gentlemen, it is in fairness upon this occasion where the investigation of truth is the only object to be obtained, that all those who have already given any information should be called, that those whose duty it is to defend the prisoner (and here he will be very ably defended) may have an opportunity of examining them; I shall therefore call them, but you will find, in the course of their testimony, first, that this man was in no doubt who the person was that he so fired at, that he was not only sufficiently acquainted with him to permit him to come to the house, but seeing him so much attached to this young woman, and he being a man in the habits of life, in which he was not perhaps accustomed to the indulgences of life as we on shore are, frequently obtained permission of him to remain in the house all night, that when he went out, instead of evincing any intention of getting assistance, he went to this house, where he procured the pistol, and afterwards himself, coolly and deliberately loaded that pistol. Gentlemen, there is another circumstance which seems to me to bespeak a least at want of feeling that is beyond all pardon, that, when he had shot this young man, after the only provocation that I have stated to you, he left him in a dying state, without offering him the least assistance. Gentlemen, I shall abstain from any further observations; the humanity of the learned Judge will point out to you every thing that may arise in behalf of the prisoner, and you will have the law laid down if any thing shall arise distinguishable in this case, to enable you to pass a verdict properly, according to your oaths, and, at the same time, with mercy to the prisoner.</p>

             the deceased? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he? - A. He was a young man that used to visit me; he was at our house about half after six o'clock that night, he staid about ten minutes or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Cunningham see him? - A. Yes; he stood at the window at that time with a child in his arms, he returned again about nine o'clock, he did not come in then; he tapped at the window, and I went up stairs to him; he said, Nancy, I want to speak very particularly to you; I said, what do you want, we are going to bed; said he, you must come over with me to the Prince of Orange, and have something to drink, and I said it was rather too late, and I would not go, but he laid hold of my hand, and he would make me go; he called for a pint of two-penny, we had it at the door, we staid about ten minutes, and then I returned; there was another young fellow came by, and said, Henry, are you there, how do you do? and I told him I must go home to bed, and I left him directly with that young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see or hear any thing afterwards of him? - A. He sent the boy from the White-hart with a pot of beer to the window, that was about twenty minutes afterwards, I was in bed then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body sleep with you? - A. Yes, Mrs. Evans and Mrs. Cooper, they were both in bed at the same time; when the beer came, the boy called, are you in bed? I said, yes, he said, here is a pot of beer that the young man has sent for you; I told him, we were all in bed, and would not take it in; the boy carried it back, and then they both came back together, the deceased and the boy; Mrs. Evans then got out of bed and spoke to the deceased; says Wood, Mrs. Evans, take the beer for I cannot drink it myself, and I have paid for it, it is a pity it should be wasted; Mrs. Evans went up stairs and took the beer in, he said, he wanted to speak to Nancy very particularly, I heard him say this; Mrs. Evans said, Nancy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110015"></xptr>is in bed, she cannot come up at this time of night, and then he tapped at the window, and Mrs. Evans answered him, to go about his business; she said, it was rather too late to disturb the persons in the house; he tapped at the window again, with a stick that he had in his hand, which he put through the iron rails, and broke one of the panes of glass of the window; Cunningham got out of bed, and spoke to him through the window, telling him to go about his business; he returned again, in a few minutes, and began to tap at the window, and Cunningham went out to the door with a poker in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he dressed or undressed? - A. I did not see him, but suppose he was undressed; I heard his wife say something about a poker, and he went to the door, and told him to go along about his business, or he would charge the watch with him, and then Cunningham returned in again, and he dressed himself, and he went out again to the door, and I heard him say to the deceased, I am going to charge the watch, or something of that kind; and the deceased called three or four times, as he was going along, he says, Cunningham, Cunningham, I say, come here, Cunningham, come here, but he would not answer; and Cunningham returned in the course of ten minutes, as far as I can guess, and the first word he said, was, stand away, or I will blow your brains out, I heard him say that out in the street, and the deceased made him an answer, blow away, and I heard the report of the pistol immediately; Mrs. Cooper and I went up stairs immediately, and I met Cunningham in the passage, he had then returned into the house and shut the door; I said, Mr. Cunningham, did you kill him, says I; say he, I don't know, and if I did, it is his own fault.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This certainly was a very unseasonable time, when the deceased came to the house, you were accustomed to go to bed early? - A. Yes; about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was told repeatedly that he could not see you, that you were in bed? - A. He was told so by Mrs. Evans.</p>
               <p>Q. He kept continually tapping at the window, and made a great noise? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not he knock at the door? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know - recollect - did not he make a great noise at the door? - A. I did not hear any knocking at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't suffer any feelings that you may have for the young man that is gone, to prevent your telling the whole truth? - A. No; I did not hear him knock at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Cunningham told him through the window, if he did not go away, he must charge the watch with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he still continued making this noise? - A. Yes; he told him he would charge him with the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. And afterwards, this man continuing to make a noise, he got up and went out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he returned, I wish you to be correct, because there were other persons in the house who heard it, did not you hear him repeatedly call, stand off, stand off, before he fired, repeatedly? - A. No, he did not; says he, stand off, or I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he repeatedly say, stand off, stand off? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Cooper and Mrs. Evans were equally within hearing with yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a Mr. and Mrs Ramsay lived in the house? - A. Yes, up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When the man came in, did not he call out,"Come down, Mr. Ramsay, for I am afraid I have killed the man?" - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as ever he came in, he made up to Mr. Ramsay's apartments, and said, come down, Mr. Ramsay, for I am afraid I have killed the man? - A. Yes; he said, Mr. Ramsay, come down, for I believe I have killed the man; I met him coming down from Mr. Ramsay's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear at any former meetings any enmity between this man and the deceased? - A. Not that I perceived.</p>
               <p>Q. There could be no cause of quarrel between them till he chided him for making a noise? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you hear any knocking at the door at all? - A. After Cunningham went out he knocked at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. In an ordinary way? - A. No; he knocked at the door once or twice after Cunningham went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that he gave one or two strokes at the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect exactly what the words were before the report of the pistol? - A. The words were, stand off, or I will blow your brains out.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I live right opposite the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the 12th of December, any thing happening at his house, or near it? - A. I was at the front window opposite the house about twenty minutes before eleven; I heard a noise, and I went to the window to see what was the matter; I saw the deceased knocking at the prisoner's door; he wanted very much to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he knocking very outrageously? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Merely as a person desiring to be admitted? - A. Yes; he was very much in liquor; he had a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110016"></xptr>violent fall; he recovered his fall, and the prisoner then came out in his shirt, and told him to go away, for it was a late hour, and he should not let him in; the prisoner went in and shut the door, and the deceased continued standing outside the door, and wanted very much to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the situation of the window that the last witness has been speaking of? - A. Yes; the window is close to the door; the prisoner then came out dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he in the mean time, before the prisoner came out again, done any thing, or made any considerable noise? - A. No, he had not; he had only stood at the door; the prisoner came out dressed, and passed the deceased; he said something to him, but I did not hear what he said; he was gone about the space of ten minutes, as nigh as I can recollect; he came back with something in his right hand, held up in this manner (describing it); I thought he had got something of a club stick in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. At that instant, how was the deceased employed? - A. He was standing right up at his door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he doing any thing? - A. Nothing at all, only standing in the street close to his door; the prisoner came round the corner from the house into the middle of the street, and pointed something, I did not know what it was, and said something to the deceased, but I did not hear what it was; the deceased crossed over from the prisoner's door, and made up to him, not knowing, as I suppose, the danger he was in; the deceased went up to the prisoner, and the prisoner rather backed and pointed something at him; the deceased was then in the middle of the road, as near as I can recollect, opposite my window; I never went from the window; the prisoner then fired the pistol at the deceased, and he dropped instantly in the middle of the road, opposite my window; the prisoner crossed over and knocked at his own door a double knock.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was he from his own door when he fired this pistol? - A. Some yards.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What distance was he from the deceased when he fired this pistol? - A. A yard and an half as nigh as I can guess; the door was opened, and he was let in instantly, and the door shut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You live directly opposite to this house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your attention was directed to this business, in consequence of the repeated enquiries this man was making, and the noise he was making at the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe no watchman was by at that time? - A. No watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a watchman belonging to that beat? - A. Yes; but no watchman was by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear from within the house the prisoner Cunningham make use of any such expression as this, desiring him to be gone from the door? - A. Yes; in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that expression accompanied with this further expression, namely, that he would go for a watchman? - A. No; I did not hear any thing of that kind pass.</p>
               <p>Q. You supposed he was gone for a watchman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where he went you don't know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came back, he was at a considerable distance from the deceased when he turned the corner? - A. Yes; he kept the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was by the deceased making up to him that he got nearer to him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me the prisoner was quite on the other side of the road, the deceased was at his door? - A. The prisoner was rather on my side, about the middle of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the distance from where the prisoner stood to his own door? - A. About four yards.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was by the deceased's own act that he got so near to the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time when he was making up to the prisoner, as you state it, did not you hear this expression, stand off, stand off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that repeated? - A. Yes; it was the prisoner was making back, and he repeatedly said, stand off, stand off, and then he fired.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner went into the house, and the conversation that passed in the house you know nothing about? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the prisoner's general character in the neighbourhood? - A. I always looked upon him to be a very sober, decent man; I do not know a great deal of him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. If I understand your account rightly, it is, that the prisoner at the time was at a distance from the deceased, and the deceased made up to him; could you distinctly see the manner in which the deceased made up to him? - A. Yes; he was so much in liquor that I was afraid he would fall down.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he use any gesture, or any threatening expression? - A. No; I did not hear any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing threatening or terrifying in the posture or gesture of the deceased? - A. Nothing at all of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. He was very much in liquor? - A. Yes, so much so, that I was afraid he would fall as he made up to him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am servant to the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the room with your mistress on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110017"></xptr>the 12th of December last? - A. Yes; I was looking through the window; the window was down, and the Venetian blinds were down.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinctly see all that passed? - A. Yes; my mistress gave the first alarm; upon hearing the noise of a man very much in liquor, I looked out, and saw the deceased knocking at the door; soon after that the prisoner came out in his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him at the time? - A. No, I did not see any thing that he had; the prisoner said something to the deceased which I did not hear; when the prisoner found that the deceased would not go away, he went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shut the door after him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the deceased then? - A. He still kept at the door, and knocked several times, and tried at the latch, and the prisoner came out afterwards, dressed, and said something to the deceased that I cannot tell; he went across the way round the corner, as we thought, to get a watchman; the deceased still kept outside of the door of the prisoner's house; in four or five minutes he returned; he came along the road; he had something in his hand, I could not tell what it was; he came along the side of the way opposite his house; the deceased was then still standing at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he doing any thing? - A. No; and when the deceased saw the prisoner come, he made up to him.</p>
               <p>A. In what way did he make up to him? - A. He walked up to him; as the prisoner was in the road, he told the deceased to keep off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you hear all that was said? - A. No; I cannot tell all that was said.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in the same room with Mrs. Daniel? - A. Yes; then, as the deceased was going up to him, he let the pistol off.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did he hold it? - A. He held it very exact to the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. But, before that, how did he hold it? - A. He held it down in his hand till then.</p>

               <p>Q. When he fired it off, what became of the deceased, and what became of the prisoner? - A. The deceased fell down immediately, first upon his bottom, and then he rolled round on his face; the prisoner knocked two or three times at his own door, and he was let in, and the door was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how far they stood from one another when the pistol went off? - A. A couple of yards, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so far off that one could not have reached the other with his hand? - A. Not cleverly, I think, so far as I could judge.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a moon-light night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he at any time been nearer to him than when he shot him, after he returned with the pistol? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he went to his own house; do you mean that he went immediately, or that he turned round and spoke to him? - A. No, he went immediately home; he was at that time nearer to our side of the way than his own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I think you say, that before the prisoner came out of his own house, this man had been knocking at the door, and lifting up the latch, before the prisoner came down dressed? - A. He had been knocking at the door, but not lifting up the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the pistol went off as the deceased was coming nearer the prisoner? - A. Yes, he was backing.</p>
               <p>Q. When a man has a pistol in his hand, and is going back, it is the most likely time for a pistol to go off by accident, as he is going backwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear what passed in his house afterwards? - A. No, I did not go into his house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you saw the deceased making up to the prisoner, did you see him very distinctly? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then describe the manner of his coming up to him? - A. He was very tipsy, and he reeled.</p>


               <p>Q. Was there any thing in his manner that could alarm any person who knew him? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I live at No. 8, in Fieldgate-street; the house belongs to Mr. Coombes, an officer of the Police-office, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Cunningham? - A. Yes; I never saw him but three times in my life before he came that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come to you? - A. About ten minutes before ten; he knocked at the door; I was very ill in bed, and a little child opened the door, and he asked for Mr. Coombes; I called to the child, and said, what is Mr. Cunningham's business? and then he came up to my room door, and said, he had been running up and down the street a great while to find a patrol or a watchman, but there was none to be had; he said, he was afraid he had got some thieves breaking into his house, and had had for these three nights, and he was so disturbed, that he could not sleep in his bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure of what you say that you recollect it? - A. Yes, perfectly sure; and he was afraid, when he got home, whether he should not find his wife and children killed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was what he said? - A. Yes; and his lodgers were very much disturbed; then he asked me if I would lend him one of Mr. Coombes's pistols, which hung over the mantle-piece.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110018"></xptr>Q. Did he know that the pistols hung over the mantle-piece? - A. Yes; he had been mending a bedstead just before, and had seen them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bedstead he had been mending in the same room? - A. Yes; the bedstead that I was then upon; I rather hesitated, but, however, he took it down, and he asked me if it was loaded; I told him, no; he said, had not I got a little powder in the house; I said, I did not know whether Mr. Coombes had got any; Mr. Coombes said afterwards, that there was powder and two balls in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he got them from your own knowledge? - A. No; he said that would do to frighten them, if there was no powder.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been very ill, I understand; recollect yourself again as to the account he gave you why he wanted the pistols? - A. He gave me the account I have told you.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. I live at the prisoner's house; the deceased came on the 12th of December a little after ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew him, did not you? - A. I have seen him, he was a tall, stout man; a little after ten o'clock, I heard him knock over the grating, and call Nance, once or twice, some of them answered, and he went away, and then a boy came over with a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know all this yourself? - A. I heard it all; they told him, the beer was not for them, for they were all in bed; and then the deceased and the boy returned together, the deceased told them the beer was paid for, and if they would take it in, he would go away about his business; Mrs. Evans went up and took the beer in, and told him to go along; he swore he would not go away, but would come into the house, and she shut the door and came in, and then he jumped upon the grating, and swore he would come in, with very bitter oaths to the girl to make her come up, and she said, she was in bed, he stamped and swore a great while, and then I heard Mr. Cunningham's shutter open, I cannot tell who opened it, but I heard Mr. Cunningham say something to the deceased, and Wood swore at him very much; I heard the sash shut down again; I did not hear any more, till I heard the glass rattle, and the windows broke, but I could not tell how many till next day, and then Mr. Cunningham came to the door, and asked him if he wanted to rob the house, if he did not go away about his business, he would charge the watch with him; upon which the deceased swore very much at him, and told him, if he would come out, he would lick him like a dog, and then I heard a scuffle between them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What sort of a scuffle? - A. I heard the door bang very much against the wall, both of them against it, upon which my wife wanted me to go down stairs; I told her, no, if Mr. Cunningham would harbour such lodgers, he might undergo the trouble of them, and I would not go down; then I heard Mr. Cunningham shut the door, and immediately that the door was shut, the deceased knocked more violently than he did before, and by and by I heard Mr. Cunningham dressing himself, as I thought, I heard him moving about, he went out and shut the door after him, he said something to the deceased as he passed by him, but I cannot tell what it was; the deceased said something about a shilling, but I could not hear what it was; as soon as Mr. Cunningham was gone, the deceased tried very much to force the door open to get in, and shook the whole house for about ten minutes in trying to force his way; when Mr. Cunningham returned, I heard the deceased trying to force the door open; I heard Mr. Cunningham say, by God, if you do enter my house, I will blow your brains out, to which the deceased made answer, blow away and be d-d; upon which Mr. Cunningham told him, he certainly would, if he did not keep off; the deceased still kept swearing at him, and telling him to blow away and be d-d; the prisoner still kept telling him to keep off, a great many times, and every time the deceased answered him in the same way, and I was just then gone to bed, and I heard him say again, keep off, keep off, very sharp.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were they at this time? - A. I did not get out of bed till just as the pistol went off, and then the deceased was lying in the middle of the road, raising himself up.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw that very distinctly? - A. Yes; and I saw Cunningham, as I thought it was him, there was nobody else about, come from the other side, where the deceased was, over to his own door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who let Mr. Cunningham in? - A. I cannot tell, he came up to me immediately as he was let in, and I opened the door; he said, for God's sake, Ramsay, come down, for I am afraid I have killed him, and threw the pistol down in the chair; when I got down to the door, I heard the people say he was a dead man, but they said they did not know the cause of his death, any more than they heard the report of the pistol, but they could see no blood.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoner came back, some time must have elapsed after he had returned with the pistol, and before he fired it, for all this conversation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110020"></xptr> to have passed? - A. Yes, four or five minutes at least.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore that, of course, must have been heard by any body who was attending at the time? - A. Yes; it was loud enough for any body to have heard it; it was loud enough for a watchman at the end of the street to have heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. All this you heard yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And what Mr. Cunningham said to him when he went out you did not hear? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The knocking then, that you describe after Mr. Cunningham went out, was so violent that all the neighbourhood must have heard it? - A. Yes; the hammering was so violent that it shook the whole house, and my wife was afraid he had forced the spring lock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have lived some time with this man? - A. Two years next April.</p>
               <p>Q. From the observation you have made upon his character, did he appear to be a good natured, easy man, or otherwise? - A. Always; I never saw any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do they usually go to bed? - A. Between nine and ten; they themselves used to go to bed between eight and nine sometimes; we were very often very much disturbed by this man coming after the girl.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I was frequently called up in the night by the lodgers, of thieves breaking into the house; I fetched the pistol to desend my life, and my property, little thinking that the deceased would rush upon me blaspheming in the manner that he did, which was the cause of the pistol going off unknown to me.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. You lodged at Cunningham's house at the time of the accident? - A. Yes.</p>

The first time I saw him was about half past six o'clock, I was going towards Whitechapel, he was coming towards our house; he said he was going to see Nance, and I told him she was there alone; I was not gone above a quarter of an hour, and when I came back he was gone; about nine o'clock in the evening he came again, and tapped at the window, we were eating our suppers, and Nancy Hughes went up to speak to him, she staid with him about a quarter of an hour, and when she came back we asked the reason of her coming back so soon, and she said, she did not like to stay longer with him, she was afraid of him, and then we eat our suppers and went to bed; then, about ten o'clock, we heard a boy come to the window, and cry, holloa, there was some beer for us; I asked him who sent the beer; and he said, the young man over the way; I told him to take it back again, that we did not want it, for we were all in bed; then I went to bed again; in a few minutes after, the deceased, and the lad with the beer, came back again, and I went to the window and told him we were all in bed; and he said, we might as well have the beer, for it was all paid for, and it was a pity to throw it away, and if I would take it in, he would go away directly; I then put my things on, and went up stairs and opened the door, he put the beer into my hand, and pushed against the door, and wanted to come in; then I told him he should not come in, it was too late; and I told him, you know what a piece of work we have had on account of your disorderly hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he then before come at disorderly hours? - A. Yes, at very disorderly hours; and was very troublesome indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your refusing him to come in what passed? - A. He said he had no place to go to, he must come in; I said, no place to go to, why where is your lodgings; and he said nothing; I told him he should not come in, and I pushed the door against him, and shut it; he said he wanted to see Nance; I told him Nancy was just come from him, and he should not see Nancy at this time of night; then I went down stairs and went to bed; and then he came directly to the window making a great noise, cursing and swearing, and blasting; and he said, Nance had as much right to let any person into the house as I had, for she paid for it, and if she could not he would; he was there thumping and stamping at our window with his foot upon the grating.</p>
               <p>Q. You live in the kitchen below? - A. Yes; and I went to him again, and said, how can you be so, why don't you go home; and he cursed and swore, and used very improper language for me to tell here; and I told him, if he would not go I would charge the watchman with him; we were all afraid of him, making such a noise; there were

Yes; then Mr. Cunningham came in and dressed himself, I suppose, I did not see him, and went out again in a few minutes; and while he was gone, he continued making the same noise all the time, stamping upon our windows, and making a noise; when Mr. Cunningham went out he said nothing to him, but the deceased holloaed after him pay me the shilling you owe me.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I lived with Mrs. Evans at the time of the accident, in the house of Mr. Cunningham.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the deceased? - A. Yes; I knew something of him, very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to the house on the 12th of December? - A. Yes; I and Mrs. Evans met him first, in Fieldgate-street, about half past six; he asked us where we were going, and we said, we were going to market; he then asked where Nance was, that was the young woman, Aun Hughes, we told him she was at home; he then went towards our house, and we returned home again in less than a quarter of an hour, the deceased was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see him after? - A. I did not see him again till about nine o'clock, he came and knocked over the grating with his foot, the young woman then went up stairs to him, she stopped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110022"></xptr> with him about a quarter of an hour, and returned back again; Mrs. Evans then asked why she returned so soon; and she said she was afraid to stay any longer with the young man, the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give any reason why she was afraid? - A. She thought he was very much intoxicated; we then eat our suppers and all three of us went to bed; after we had been in bed some time, a boy came and tapped at the grating over the kitchen window, the boy called out, is nobody here; and Mrs. Evans, or me, I don't know which, said, who is there; and he said, there was a pot of beer; we asked him who sent him; he said, the young man; we told him we were all in bed, and did not want any beer; he went away, and returned again in a few minutes with him; the deceased then called very loud, he said, holloa, are you all in bed, come up and take the beer; Mrs. Evans then got up, and went to the window, and told him we were all in bed, and did not want beer at that time of night; and he told Mrs. Evans, if she would come up and take in the beer he would go quietly, for it was paid for, and it was a pity to waste it, he still kept repeating and calling Nance; Mrs. Evans then went up to the street-door and took the beer in; when she came down, she said he wanted very much to come in; he then went to the grating of the kitchen window, and made a great noise, calling Ann Hughes to come up.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a noise did he make? - A. With his feet upon the grating; then Mrs. Evans got up again, and told him, if he did not go along she would charge the watch with him; I then heard something at the parlour shutters; Mr. Cunningham lives in the parlour; I then, about a minute after, heard Mr. Cunningham speaking to him; he desired him to go home quietly, for it was a very late hour of the night to come there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do that in a temperate manner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was mildly said? - A. Yes; he told him he would not go home, and told him to come out and he would fight him like a dog as he was; then Mr. Cunningham went in and shut the window; he still kept making this noise over the grating, and Mr. Cunningham came to the door and told him, that if he did not go along quietly, he certainly would charge the watch with him; he then took hold of the knocker at the door, and rapped several times very violently; then Mr. Cunningdam got up and dressed himself, as I have been told.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular that you heard at the window? - A. It was as if it was the bolt of Cunningham's window; then Mr. Cunningham went out at the street-door; the deceased was then stamping at the grating, and knocking at the door by turns; Cunningham, when he went out, told him again that he would charge the watch with him; then he went, as I suppose, for a watchman, and returned between ten minutes and a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that Cunningham was gone, what was the deceased doing? - A. He shoved his back against it, as if he was trying to force the door open; he abused the house very much, and told the girl to come out, if she could not pay the rent he would; when Mr. Cunningham returned, I heard him say, stand off, if you attempt to break into my house, I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that Cunningham made use of that expression, what was he doing? - A. There was a scuffle; I thought the watchman was dragging him away; it was like two men trying to get away one from the other; Mr. Cunningham told him if he did not stand off he would blow his brains out; the deceased told him to blow away and be d-d; then Cunningham said, I will, by God, and then I heard the pistol go off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner come into the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have lived some little time at this house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner, during the time you lived there, a peaceable, quiet man? - A. A very quiet, inoffensive man, as ever I heard of.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was the house usually shut up? - A. It was always shut up at ten o'clock at night; he used to go to rest between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the prisoner? - A. He is a carpenter and cabinet-maker.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Did you hear all this perfectly? - A. Yes, perfectly; I got out of bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you heard all that Mrs. Evans heard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The conversation you have stated, did that take place close to the door? - A. Yes; I think it did, by what I could hear, I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Even the last word, just at the instant that the pistol went off, when he said, stand off, was close by the door? - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. They were so situated, that you must have known it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Wherever this took place, there the pistol went off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not examined before the Justice or the Coroner? - A. I attended two days.</p>
               <p>Q. This poor young fellow was very much intoxicated? - A. Yes; he tumbled down two or three times outside the door while he was walking backwards and forwards; when first he began to make the noise, when I saw him first in the evening, he was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110023"></xptr>Court. Q. Was the fall upon the flag stones by the door? - A. Yes, between the kennel and the grating of the window.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Mrs. Evans threatened to charge him with the watch, and Mr. Cunningham too? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was loud enough for any body to hear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Though you were not examined before the Justice or the Coroner, you attended in order to be examined, if they thought proper to examine you? - A. Yes.</p>

The deceased came a little after ten o'clock, the first time that I noticed it, and he knocked very much at the kitchen window and the door; we lodge in the front room up one pair of stairs; Mr. Cunningham got up and desired him to go, and he would not go.</p>

               <p>Q. He was not at all warm or angry in any thing that he did? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Perfectly cool? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you heard any body say so; perhaps somebody may have seen it? - A. No; he was shoving very violently against the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of the words that Cunningham made use of, being of a very good temper, that if he did not go about his business he would blow his brains out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not something like this-if you break into my house, I will blow your brains out? - A. Yes, that was the word.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not make use of the other expression? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was, that if he broke into his house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110024"></xptr>Q. And that both you and your husband considered so? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no other offence? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was to defend his house? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all this conversation that you speak of, take place close to the house, or at any distance? - A. Nigh the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the last words that were spoken were, blow away and be d-d? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And at that moment the pistol went off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say, stand off, or keep off? - A. Stand off.</p>
               <p>Q. And the moment the other said blow and be d-d, the pistol went off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you went to the window? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How wide is this street? - A. About thirty feet wide.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Therefore you could not be mistaken whether this took place close to the house, or the other side of the way? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mrs. Daniel, who lives opposite? - A. I have seen the lady.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You say, that though you did did not see him pushing the door, you concluded, from the found of it, that he was pushing with his back? - A. Yes, very violently indeed.</p>

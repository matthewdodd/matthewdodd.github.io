                  </hi>. I am a horse-patrol of the Division of Barking, in Essex. Between ten and eleven o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 21st of June, I was llford—in consequence of some information I received, I proceeded in the direction of Wanstead, in pursuit of some persons—I overtook them near the George Inn—there were two men and two woman inside a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and the prisoner driving—I asked to see what was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the prisoner told me had got a goose—I ultimately took him into custody—when I pulled the knee-board a way from their knees I perceived the goose, and took it away—I asked the prisoner how he accounted for having the goose—he stated that he bought it at Romford of some man</p>

               <p>for a half-a-crown—it was dead—it was goose—I asked if he bought it dead or alive—he said dead—the goose than appeared quite warm—it had no appearance of its having been stuck, but it appeared as if it had been struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Britain Pond, at Barking. I recollect on the 21st of June I had occasion to fetch some water for my schoolmaster from a pump at Mr. Reynolds's public-house—I saw the prisoner stop his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and get out of it—I saw him stoop down and pick up a goose before he got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he threw it in—I cannot say whether it was dead or alive—it went in like a dead one—I do not know whether it was dead or alive when he picked it up—there were several goslings running about—he drove off as soon as he got in—there were two males and two females in the cab, besides the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ten years old, and live at Ilford.

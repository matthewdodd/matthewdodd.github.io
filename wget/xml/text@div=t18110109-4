Yes, I was present when she was tried and convicted in September session 1809, she was ordered to be imprisoned in New Prison, Clerkenwell, one year and at the expiration of that time to find sureties for her good behaviour for two years more; she staid in the prison that time and found sureties and was discharged; I am positive she is the person, I know her very well.</p>
               <p>JOHN COBHAM. Q. You are a potatoe merchant - A. Yes, I live in David-street, Berkley-square. On Saturday the 15 of December about a quarter past five in the evening the prisoner asked me if I had any kidney potatoes, I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090006"></xptr>her I had, she desired two pound of the best, I weighed her two pound and there were rather more, she said never mind make it three, they came to three pence, she gave me a bad shilling, this is the shilling, I returned it to her instantly, it is a crooked shilling; I stated to her it was a bad one, I expostulated to her on putting off bad money at that time of the night, because it was an hour we often take bad money at our shop; she was about a minute and a half searching her pocket, at last she produced a sixpence very much battered saying very likely you may not approve of this, I have no other silver except a dollar which I do not like to change; which dollar afterwards upon searching her I never found.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards searched her and found that shilling upon her - A. Yes, about a quarter of an hour after I searched her in Mr. Clarke's shop and found this shilling in her hand, that she had offered to me with three others; I found another bad shilling and a sixpence in her pocket. I did not approve of the battered sixpence, I returned it her; she then left my shop desiring me to leave the potatoes in the scale she would return for them. I followed her at a distance, I saw her cross over to a public house and look in at the window, she did not go in there, I then followed her to Mr. Clarke's a butcher in Grovesnor-market, she took up a piece of meat smelled it and put it down again, she then went to Mr. Clarke's shop; I crossed opposite, it is very narrow there, I could see her, I heard Mr. Clarke ring a shilling upon a block, it sounded bad, I saw her come out of the shop and as she came out I went in, I asked Mr. Clarke if she had given him a bad shilling, she was not within hearing, Mr. Clarke went after her and brought her back, Mrs. Clarke returned the shilling to her, I seized her wrist instantly and took four shillings out of her hand, her hand was clenched, three of the shillings were wet; I asked her where is the shilling that you gave me, she said where; I said at the potatoe warehouse; she then begged for mercy, she said she was an unfortunate woman, she would give me any thing to let her go. I took her to the watchhouse, she got behind a chair, rather in the dark, she untied her pockets, I picked them up and examined them, I found five shillings and ten pence three farthings in copper, a penny bread cake, a penny plum bun, two tarts, two skains of thread, a box of salve, and this terner's cerat, I then took her to Marlborough-street. This is the money that was taken out of her hand, and this is the money that was found in her pocket.</p>

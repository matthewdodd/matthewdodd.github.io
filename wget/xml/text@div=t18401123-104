Between two and three o'clock in the morning of the 7th of November I had been taking a little with some friends, and I met the prisoner about half way down Lamb's Conduit-street—she asked me to treat her to a glass of ale—I said there was no place open—I walked a few yards, and left her; and found I had lost my purse, con<lb></lb>taining eight shillings and a half-crown, from one of my trowsers' pockets—I taxed her with it—she had walked close to me for a few yards—I can<lb></lb>not say on which side she was—I called a policeman, who took the purse and money from her hand in my presence—this is the purse.</p>

"—he said, "James Collins "—I asked him if he would put his own name or James Collins's on the note—he said he would put either—I then took the note into my bar parlour for further examination—I went round another way to the counter, and called aloud to my pot boy, "William, come and get change for this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—I called aloud purposely for the prisoner to hear—I told the potboy to fetch a policeman, and he went and returned with Serjeant Horan—in consequence of something Horan said to me, I put a mark on the note—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I went to the counter and told the prisoner my boy could not get change for the note, and asked whether he would wait until I got change—he said yes, he would wait—I then took the note to the police station to ask the inspector his opinion, and Horan went to inquire if the address the prisoner gave was correct—I returned to the house shortly afterwards with two police officers—I found the prisoner standing on the steps of my door outside, the officers took him inside, and asked him where he lived and where he got the note—he said he got the note from a sailor named James Collins—he said that he met two sailors in Rosemary-lane, and one of them gave him this note, and told him to come to my house to get two bottles of rum—he said the sailors were strangers to him, and the one who gave him the note told him to say, if any questions were asked, that the note was from James Collins—the policemen said we had better go to the station, and we all went to the station together—on the way there the prisoner said he had been a bricklayer's labourer, and had worked at Ashby and Homer's in Aldgate—he also said he had lived round the corner, meaning one of the houses towards the station—he said he had lodged at No. 8, Keate-street, Spitalfields, for the last two of three nights, and that he had dined there that day—he gave the name of Andrew Dris<lb></lb>coll—he said it was about a month since he had been at work, and that he had worked last at Ashby and Horner's—he was detained at the station for the purpose of Horan making inquiries whether he had been to Keate-street.</p>

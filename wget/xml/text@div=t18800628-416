                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—he was a foreman tailor—I now live at Hollywood Road, Kensington—on 17th March last I left him, and have since then been living apart maintaining myself—we were then living at 41, Sidney Street, Brompton Road—I left him at that house and did not see him again till I saw him at the Infirmary on the afternoon of 1st June—on the Monday, the day before, I received this letter—it is my husband's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated from the Chelsea Infirmary, and contained an urgent request for his wife to come and see him and bring his son Edwin, and complaining that a previous letter sent to her, enclosed in one to his son Frank, had not been delivered to her.</hi>) This other letter is also my husband's writing, and is the one sent to my son. (<hi rend="italic">This also contained a request for his wife to come and see him.</hi>) In consequence of the letters I went to the Chelsea Infirmary and saw the prisoner—he said, "Have you brought Edwin?"—I said I had not—he then said, "Go"—I went half-way down the infirmary—he followed and caught hold of me and said, "Do come and talk matters over"—I went back with him and we had a conver<lb></lb>sation about different things—he asked me if I would live with him again—I said I could not think of doing so, as the life we had led the last few months, I could not live with him anymore—he asked me again and again. if I would live with him, as he knew that I had four rooms, and would I make him up a bed where I was living—I said they were not my apart<lb></lb>ments and I could not do so—ho importuned me so much, that I told him if he kept sober three months and came to me a different man, I might give him a different answer—with that he put his arm round me, and with the right made three stabs at me with this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said some<lb></lb>thing at the time—I don't know what—I was too excited—some one in the ward took hold of him—he stabbed me once under the heart and once here—that was only a scratch.</p>

               <p>good wages and kept a good home till three years ago, when he left Bond Street—I heard him make a long statement at the police-court—when he was in a situation he allowed me money for homo and the children—he was a good husband and father when he was a teetotaler, but when he was drunk he was anything but that—he was a teetotaler for six year—I have lived at 41, Sidney Street, two years—he said at the police-court that I was too familiar with one of my lodgers—he did not mention any name—there was no truth whatever in that supposition—the 17th of March was his birthday—he went out that day to the public-house, that was all—he was in and out all day from six in the morning, 10 minutes at a time—the last time he came in was about five in the evening—the furniture of the house was then in a van being moved—my lodger and my son and daughter were in the house—he was not locked up in an empty parlour while the furniture went away—he was never locked up at all—he went into an empty parlour and the things that were being moved blockaded the door—he could get out—I heard him say at the police-court, "They locked me in the empty parlour; except an old sofa, everything was stripped," but it was false—he was in the parlour, but it was not empty—I did not leave the house before he got out of the parlour—when I left the house at 10 at night he was in the kitchen—my son took me away from him because he was follow<lb></lb>ing me from room to room threatening me—he had the full scope of the house to go where he liked—it was my son Frank that he wrote the letter to—I left the prisoner on 17th March—when this happened he must have had the knife concealed on his person—I did not see where he took it from—he walked over to the window on the opposite side of the ward to look at the time—it was not in his locker, because I looked—I did not hear him say at the police-court that it was in his locker, nor did I hear him say, "I wanted to frighten her to get her private address; I had no intention of hurting her in the least; I thought by being locked up I would get her private address"—he asked for my private address when he was in charge at the police-station—I refused to let him have it—I had my reasons—I told him I could not think of living with him after his unmanly conduct and his threats to me—he had no cause to be jealous—I don't know whether he was jealous or not—I don't know that he was jealous of me and the young man lodger—he never complained of it—he was more intimate with him than I was—he was not jealous—there were no words between us about this young man—we had a frightful quarrel, which was the cause of my leaving him—he came home and abused me and struck me because I had not money to give him for drink; that was all—nothing was said about the lodger—it had nothing to do with that subject—am I compelled to give the young man's name?—It is Webber—I have two young men lodgers, Webber and Peel—I don't know which you allude to—Peel is outside—I mentioned Webber, because the prisoner has been going about to my friends and talking about that young man and me—he could not be jealous of him, he is a young man of 23, a friend of my son's—he is not here.</p>

I am a labourer, living at 67, North Street, Knightsbridge—I was in the ward on the afternoon of 1st June—I heard a noise and saw the prosecutrix and prisoner struggling together—he had his left arm round her neck and a knife in his right hand—I saw him make three or four plunges at her—he said "You b—, I will do for you"—I went and got the woman away, and took her to the nurse.</p>

I am assistant medical officer of the Chel<lb></lb>sea Infirmary—on 14th May the prisoner was brought there under an order from Mr. D'Eyncourt, as a person wandering at large—I saw him—he was suffering from the result of drink, delirium tremens—during The first day or two he was noisy and excited and very restless at night—he afterwards became quiet and rational—on 24th May he was admitted into the infirmary as a patient for general debility—from that time till 1st June he had not manifested any sign of lunacy—on that afternoon I was called to the ward and saw Mrs. Rafferty—she had a slight incised wound on the left side, about one-eighth of an inch or a little more in depth, and about a quarter of an inch in length, just the point of the knife—it had passed through two whalebones of her stays as well as her outside jacket and dress and other garments—this knife would cause a wound of that character.</p>

She came back to the shop and staid from three till about half after twelve at night; then my wife, myself, and the maid went home. The maid entered the house first, and said, Lord, have mercy! what is here? I then entered the room, and saw my wife's clothes on the ground, out of the drawers. I then went into the room adjoining to this on the ground-floor, and there lay my clothes, some on the bed and some on the floor. I suspected the thief had got in at the back part of the house. I got up a ladder and saw the leads had not been disturbed, upon which I suspected my maid and Mr. Perdue's maid, and charged them with it.</p>
               <p>What is Perdue's maid's name? -

            . They both denied it with a great deal of fortitude. When I saw the clothes were all safe, I said to my wife, we have certainly lost the money; she said no, nobody could get that because it was on the top of a cupboard, close to the cieling, nobody could get their hand in, without it was flat. The money was in a purse. I had been robbed about two years before, and had put it there for safety. It was in the room where I lay. My wife counted it in the morning. She went to look, and it was gone indeed. I asked my maid if she had not a sister; she said she had two, that they lived in the New Buildings, by the side of the Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>Do you know that she had a sister? - The prisoner is my maid's sister. I went to the constable of St. Sepulchre; he went with me and a watchman to the house; we knocked at the door; the sister looked out and asked what was the matter; I said her sister was in hold and wanted to speak to her; she hesitated a little and spoke to somebody; she called Mary, and then came down and opened the door. I asked her if she had not another sister there; she said she had another sister who came there sometimes, but she was not there then. The constable said let us go up stairs; we went up, and the prisoner was in the garret dressing herself very slowly. The constable took hold of her pocket and asked her if she knew what money she had in her pocket; she said a shilling or two and some half-pence, and half a crown. The constable<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230070"></xptr>searched her and found about eleven shillings or eleven and six-pence in silver. We took her to St. Sepulchre's watch-house. She behaved with all the insolence possible; she said the constable tickled her, and she would not be searched. The constable felt some money in her hair but somehow it was conveyed away.</p>
               <p>What did she say about the money? - She said it was not in her hair; she said she knew nothing of it, though her sister told her to her face that she had taken it away.</p>
               <p>Was it ever found upon her? - I never found any of it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This is not all you know of this matter, there is one thing more, you know she was taken before a magistrate and discharged? - She was. The magistrate took more cognizance of my maid, who said the prisoner was a week seducing her to do it.</p>
               <p>Who searched her? - Mr. Roberts and Mr. Jones.</p>

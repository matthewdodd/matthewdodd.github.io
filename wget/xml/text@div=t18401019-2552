                  </hi>. On the night of the 9th of October (I do not know the time) I was walking along, and met the prisoner—I asked her the way to the Mitre tavern—she said, "This is the way"—she caught hold of me, twisted me round a corner into a narrow street, and put her hand into my trousers—I said, "Don't do that"—she then made an attempt at my waistcoat-pocket—I said "No, you d—b—, you shall not rob me"—I had some silver in my waistcoat-pocket, and a guinea, a sovereign, and a half-sovereign in a purse in my browsers-pocket—she put her hand into my trowsers-pocket, and took out my purse and its contents—it was done so quickly I could not help myself—I tried to catch hold of her right hand, but could not—I caught hold of her left hand, held her tight, and called the police, who came—I told them what I had lost before she was searched—there were two other females with the prisoner when I met her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Castle-street, Whitechapel, on this evening, and was called—the prosecutor told me he had lost a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and an old guinea—he charged the prisoner with taking it out of his left-hand trowsers-pocket—she said she did not take it—I searched her at the station-house, but found nothing on her—I went back, by the inspector's orders, to the place where I took her, and about thirty yards from there found the bag, empty and open, close by the wall—three men stood about three yards from them, but they did not interfere.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I met the prosecutor; he said he would take me to a house, but he did not; he attempted to behave indecently to me in the street, which I resisted, and he instantly accused me of robbing him; I said I would go to a policeman; he would not let me; about five mi<lb></lb>nutes afterwards a policeman came up; he said I had robbed him of a guinea, two sovereigns, and a half-sovereign, and at the station-house he only said one sovereign; he was intoxicated, and asked for a pot of beer and a pipe in the station-house, and in the morning he denied knowing any thing about it.</p>

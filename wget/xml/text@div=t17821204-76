             sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to the Rotation Office in Litchfield-street; on the 25th of October last I went to one Bulger's house, in Nag's-head-court, Fish-street, or Gracechurch-street, Macdonald and Blacketer went with us; we left Grubb at the house in Goose-alley, while we went to this other house to get the stamping press; we saw Connor sitting by the fire in the parlour, with his coat off, and his hands very dirty, greasy, and black; I immediately tied his hands, and ordered Blacketer to secure him while I lighted a candle and went into the cellar; Macdonald opened the door, the shutters were put before the top door that comes into the passage; I broke the top cellar door open, and went below, and there was another door, and Macdonald opened that other door; we went into the cellar, and saw the two women prisoners sit by the stamping press, they were just pulling the fly round, and on seeing us did not pull it up sufficient: this farthing I took from between the dies, but they did not pull it sufficient to make so good an impression as they have on the other, it is rather faint; this blank I took out of Ellis's hand; I took these dies out of the press, they were fixed, and that farthing between them; there were a great quantity of finished halfpence, except the blacking of them: we then secured the women, and I sent Macdonald and Blacketer with them to the office: two candles were lighted by the side of the press; the door into the street was padlocked on the outside, and the parlour shutters being put before the cellar door, some body must have come out of the cellar to have done it; and when we went down the cellar stairs, there was another door which was locked outside likewise, and the key in the door; we took them into custody; the women were without their gowns: Conner pretended to be asleep after he saw us go in.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Counsel. There was a press you say in this cellar, and the two women at work? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Both at the same press? - Certainly, one could not very well work at a press, nor two with any great deal of propriety, it generally takes three.</p>
               <p>However, Conner the man was asleep in the parlour? - No, I do not think he was in sleep.</p>
               <p>He appeared to be so? - He made believe to be so.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell that he made believe.</p>
               <p>Court. What did his hands appear to be dirty with? - In the situation these peoples hands are, he had his coat on.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with Dixon; I saw the prisoner Conner, he had his coat off, and leaned back at the fire side; his hands were dirty, as if he had been at work; they were all black like the womens hands that were below; I searched him, and found this letter on him, directed to

             in Goose-alley, where the cutting out press was; and this key, that Hamilton swore was his key; I went into the cellar; the prisoner Ellis was feeding the die, pushing in the farthing between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040103"></xptr> the die, and the other woman sat where they pull it from; she was pulling the fly: they jumped up directly, I told them not to stir: the two women were without their gowns.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it dark when you got into the cellar? - They had candles burning, but Dixon went for two candles more.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Counsel. How did you get into the house? - I lifted up the latch and went in; we found the press and the dies below; the women asked us to let them put on their cloaths, their hands were all black: I tried the key which I found on the prisoner Conner, to the door at Hamilton's house, in Goose-alley; it locked and unlocked both the two pair of stairs, and the garret.</p>
               <p>- HAMILTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner Conner, he had two rooms at my house in Goose-alley, at 10 l. a year; I saw the cutting out press, the day it was taken, it was in one of the rooms (in the garret) he took of me.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Counsel. Do you know whether the prisoner Dunn was married to Conner? - Their connection together was as man and wife, whether they were married or not, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. It is too late now I believe to make that objection, for she has pleaded as

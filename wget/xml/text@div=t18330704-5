I was so on the 13th of May; I no longer belong to that body; I belong now to the Lincoln militia; I entered that on the 4th of June, as sergeant-major - I had been in the Metropolitan police upwards of twelve months, as near as I can guess; I belonged to the C division - on the 13th of May, I was called out; about twelve o'clock we fell in at St. James' watch-house, and proceeded to a riding-school in Gray's-inn-lane - I don't know the name of the riding-school; it was on the right hand side as we went to Calthorpe-street - we arrived at the riding-school about two o'clock, and remained there upwards of an hour - after we had marched there we fell in regularly in the stables, and I was ordered to march out with the right sub-division of the C division; there was about forty or forty-two constables in that sub-division - we marched out into Gray's-inn-lane, turned round the corner to the left hand, and went into <placeName id="t18330704-5-crimeloc33">Calthorpe-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18330704-5-crimeloc33" type="placeName" value="Calthorpe-street"></interp>

               <p>Q. Could you see any part of the banner itself? A. I did; it was a sort of American colour, a union, white and red - I know the colours of the American standard; it seemed to me to be a flag or colour; I could not see the size of it; I saw it folded in the man's left hand; I saw a part of white and a part of red on it; I did not see any other colour; it was fastened to a pole or stick - the prisoner is the man who had the flag; I am certain of him; when he came opposite to where I was in the centre of the street, he raised his right hand and struck me on the sixth rib on the left side - I had been doing nothing before he struck me, only commanding the sub-division; I neither raised my staff nor touched any individual since I came into the street, nor saw anybody else attempt to do so - the blow was with the right hand; it was with an instrument something like a dagger, seven or eight inches long; the hilt of the dagger was brass - after I received the blow, I retired back two or three paces, and after I had retired I looked particularly at the prisoner, and saw an instrument like a dagger in his right hand - I received a severe wound; it produced such a wound that I was obliged to leave the division - I saw another constable there named Redwood, he was on my left; he went towards the prisoner; I then turned and looked at him, and saw him and the prisoner, and other constables scuffling together in the street - I went to the end of the street towards the fields, and there I met the sergeant, who took me to a doctor's, to get my wound dressed - there was no probe or instrument put into the wound then; they examined it and put a plaster over it to prevent it from bleeding; it had bled - I must have been six, seven, eight, or nine days before I was able to go about; it was probed the morning after - I was at my own house during the eight or nine days, confined to the house; it was four or five days after that before it was healed up; when it was proped it was found that the dagger had struck the sixth rib - the blow was given with considerable force.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Your rib was not broken, I believe? A. It was not; the fleshy part over the sixth rib is slight, there is a very thin surface or skin over the rib.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it since this affair that you got promoted into the Lincoln militia? A. No; I have got it since, but I was recommended to it some days before this - Earl Portmore is the colonel of the militia - I don't know how many divisions of police were there that day; I cannot form any opinion at all; I was at the head of a subdivision; I don't know how many there might be in the field - I had the use of my sight till after I was wounded, and then my sight was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said you looked particularly at the prisoner, after you were wounded; how could that be, if your sight was taken away? A. That was immediately after, but I had some distance to go before I got out of the street - I turned round and saw the prisoner with another policeman.</p>
               <p>Q. Your sight was not gone then, was it? A. Why, I was not killed dead; my sight could not be gone then - I cannot tell how many policemen I saw on the ground; I saw the division I belonged to; I cannot say how many more there were; I will not swear there was not five hundred nor twelve hundred; I am not able to swear about it; I did not see them; they had all truncheons, all that I know of - I did not see the hustings or railings where the chairman was at all - there were several policeman and inhabitants about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040010"></xptr>the prisoner at the time this took place; I cannot say how many; I dare say there were some hundreds coming into the street, and there were some hundreds near him, because they were meeting.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the inhabitants, as you call them, that is the persons who were not of the police, doing all they could to get out of the way of the police? A. They were coming down the street from the field; I did not see any police driving them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they not appear to be doing all they could to get out of the way of the police? A. I did not see it; I had not a considerable view of the ground; where I was I could only see to the end of the street and no further; I was about the centre of the street - I cannot say what the people had been doing, they came down on the division down the street; it was about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by coming down on the division? A. I should suppose to drive them out of the street; I cannot answer for our whole division having truncheons; all my subdivision had to the best of my knowledge; they were paraded before they got there, in the riding-school, and my subdivision was at the head of the whole of them; they were paraded, and I saw they had truncheons then, but some of the men might have lost their truncheons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they not march to the ground with their truncheons in their right hand, leaning on their left arm? A. No, not to my knowledge; I was at the head of them, leading them, and cannot say what was going on in my rear. I did not give my division an order to draw their truncheons - I can say my subdivision did not strike nor offer to strike - after I turned about I could not see all my subdivision; I saw part of them - I cannot say whether they had their truncheons out, because I was wounded then; they might have had them out and I not see it - my subdivision consisted of between thirty and forty, to the best of my knowledge - it was upwards of forty, I will say, forty-two; I cannot swear it was not fifty; there was not sixty; I cannot say exactly the number - I know it was under fifty, by the number of files - I speak to the best of my knowledge - the people were not quiet at the time the police rushed on them; they were coming out of the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they not peaceable? A. They were not, for I was stabbed; at the time the policemen went into the street they were coming from the fields - I did not consider them peaceable - I did not see any person commit a single act of violence till I was stabbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what was it induced you to say they did not appear peaceable? A. Because this man came deliberately from the side of the street into the middle and stuck me - I am speaking of what I saw, and what was done to me - the people round the prisoner were not peaceable, they were fighting with the police - when I came down they were scuffling round about where I was - I saw that, it was when I went towards the mob - directly after I was stabbed this scene commenced.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear this instant, that when you came down you saw the people scuffling and fighting with the police? A. That was just at the moment that I was wounded.</p>
               <p>Q. How long the scuffling and fighting had been before you came there you can't say? A. I cannot say; at the time I went up there was no fighting with the police or the people - not till I was stabbed - I explained before that there was no struggling and fighting in Calthorpe-street till I was stabbed.</p>
               <p>Q. You swore that when you came down you saw the people scuffling and fighting with the police? A. That was at the time I was at the head of my subdivision, when I received the wound - directly after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to me the people were fighting and scuffling with the police when you came down? A. That was after I was wounded - there was no fighting in the street till after that happened.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by this expression? "How long they had been fighting before I came I can't tell."? A. That was a misunderstanding of mine, because there was no fighting till I was cut - not in that street - I was not able to see into any other place - I was going away when they were scuffling and fighting with the police - I did not see the police use their truncheons; some of the men had their truncheons, but not using them - I believe an inquest was held on a man killed in this affair, but I was not there - I don't know who prosecutes this case - I am one of the witnesses - I incur no expense to my knowledge in this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know another policeman named Popay? A. No; I don't recollect a man of that name; he may go by another name - I never heard the name before to my knowledge - I don't know a name of that kind in the police - I have not seen a man here to-day of that name - I don't know whether any of the police were in plain clothes that day on the ground; they were not to my knowledge - I did not see any of the people wounded that day - I saw no women and children knocked down and bleeding in the street - I stated before the magistrate to the best of my knowledge, that when I was struck I retired two or three paces, and then looked particularly at the prisoner - I don't know whether I did say that before the magistrate - I believe I did - what I said was taken down.(POPAY was here called into Court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that man; have you ever seen him before? A. I don't recollect the man, Sir - I have never spoken to him to my knowledge; he is no acquaintance of mine - when the policeman are paraded, they are in ranks regularly like the military; but I could not see them all - I saw my own subdivision at the door - I was never away from the door of the riding-school - I was obliged to turn my back to the door to look at them - I did not notice whether the riding-school was nearly full or not - they had not their truncheons in their hands when they were paraded, they were then in their pockets - I and another serjeant, I believe his name is Macdonald, commanded the subdivision, - there was a superintendant - I commanded a subdivision, not a division; and that subdivision had their truncheons in their pockets in the riding-school - when they got out into the street, the superintendant gave the command to draw their truncheons I believe - I did not give the command - I heard the command given, but I did not see the constables have their truncheons in their hands, as I said before - the command was given loudly, so that the division could hear, and the private are regularly in the habit of obeying the command when given - I have no doubt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040011"></xptr>their truncheons were drawn when the command was given; I did not see the American flag unfurled; the man had it in his hand - I believe there are red and white in the English union flag, but a colour of that description is generally called an American flag - I only saw white and red colours, that is generally what is used in the American shipping, the Union; it was like an American flag - is like the English flag too - I have no reason for calling it an American flag - I have no other reason than I have given; it was like an American colour or flag, and as like the English - I have no reason for calling it one more than another - it was not to prejudice the prisoner, that I called it an American colour instead of English - there was a superintendant with us in the riding-school - I did not see any other officers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the superintendant an officer? A. He is called an officer, he commands the division.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did you come from to the riding-school? A. From St. James's, Westminster, watch-house - I only saw my own superintendant and inspector there; I did not see Colonel 
               <persName id="t18330704-5-person166">Rowan</persName>
             there; I saw him in Gray's-inn-lane; fifty yards or less from Calthorpe-street - I did not see Lord Melbourne there - I did not see any military officers there - my weapon was a staff - I had been in the police upwards of twelve months; before that I was in the guards, about two years ago - I got my discharge from the guards; I asked for my discharge; I had completed my service - I was in no other regiment - no court-martial was held concerning me in any regiment, nor court of inquiry - I was twenty-five years and forty-one days in the guards - I was out of the guards upwards of twelve months before I went into the police - I have been in the field, and ought to know the use of arms - I did not hear any cries of"Shame, shame!" from the windows in Calthorpe-street - I saw Fursey in a stable or coach-house, after the surgeon dressed my wound - I told the magistrate I believed it was a coach-house, but I was not certain; I was not well enough to take notice - I did not hear anybody say in the stable that was the man, because he carried the death and liberty flag - there might be upwards of fifty or sixty persons in the stable or coach-house, or more; they were not all policemen - there was no wounded men there that I know of; I was there myself - when I went to the door, the man came to the door; I did not go up into the coach-house - the prisoner came from behind the men; they called his name; as soon as I saw the man, I identified him as being the man who stabbed me in the street; he was sent forward, I believe, from the men; I then identified him; that was about two hours, or upwards, after I lost my sight from the wound - there was nothing to prevent my going in; and being desired to point out the man, instead of his being sent forwards - I saw no wounded men in that place to my recollection - Fursey himself was bleeding at the side of the face, but I did not see any wound; I did not see him wounded nor yet struck; I did not notice his head; I believe he had a hat on when I first saw him in the stables; yes, he had a hat on at the time I was there - I did not see his head bandaged - there was blood on his cheek, but I did not see any wound; it was only for a moment or two that I saw him - I did not form any notion how the blood came on his face, I was too ill to take notice - I was stabbed about one hundred or two hundred yards from the doctor's, more or less - I walked that distance with another serjeant - I did not notice that Fursey had the appearance of a man violently ill used; he had blood on his cheek.</p>

               <p>MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL. Q. You were above twenty-five years in the guards, in which regiment? A. The 1st Grenadier guards - I entered the regiment at eighteen years of age; I served at Waterloo - I could not discover how the stripes were distributed in the flag; he had it folded in his hand - I think I should know the flag again if I saw it - I came to the stables about two hours after I was wounded - the prisoner came from others towards me - I did not know his name till his name was called, and directly the man came towards me - I identified him as being the man who stuck me - I have not a doubt whatever that the person I saw there, and who is now at the bar, was the person who gave me the wound.</p>
               <p>A JUROR. Q. How long was it after you received the wound before you lost your sight? A. It was a minute or two afterwards - directly after I received the wound I lost my sight - after being wounded I went round to the doctor's to get my wound dressed - I was some considerable time in the doctor's shop, then went into a yard and sat down - I was upwards of two hours before I was taken home - I had recovered my sight before I got to the stable-yard; I might be about a quarter of an hour getting from the crowd to the surgeons - I was with the sergeant who conducted me there- I was not able to go by myself.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How near was Redwood to you when you was struck? A. He was just on my left, about a pace or two - he had said or done nothing to my knowledge before I was struck; I did not see anything of the kind - the instrument was in the prisoner's right hand - he was carrying it down by his side, hanging his arm down with it in his hand - I did not observe anything in his hand till he raised his arm against me; I did not observe anybody trying to take the flag before I was struck - I did not try myself nor demand it.</p>

I am a police-constable, and was so on the 13th of May, I belong to the C division - Brooke was my sergeant; on the 13th of May I was at the riding-school in Gray's-inn-lane with Brooke - I went from there into Calthorpe-street, Brooke was with me - he was in front of us; when I got into Calthorpe-street I saw a mob of people coming down the street out of the open space or field - I was in the first subdivision of the C division, and saw the prisoner at the bar, leastwise I saw a flag, which I have here - the prisoner had it (producing it) - he was holding it in this direction with his left hand(holding it before him); that stick was part of the staff, but he had lowered it down - he had hold of the staff at the lower part - the staff was whole at that time, and the flag fastened to it - he held the staff in his left hand - his right hand was down in this manner, in the first instance when I went up to him (holding his arm down by his side); I saw him come from the right hand corner of Calthorpe-street, as we were coming out of Gray's-inn-road - he came out into the middle of the street - I left my rank and went out towards the prisoner to get the colour from him, and in so doing heard sergeant Brooke say, "Oh!" - that was before I got up to the prisoner, Brooke was in front of me then - the prisoner just passed him at the time - I saw them close together - he had passed him at the time Brooke said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040012"></xptr>"Oh!" - he had passed him - the prisoner was close by the side of him; I don't know what became of Brooke - I lost sight of Brooke because my attention was on the prisoner; I advanced up to the prisoner and demanded the colour of him - he refused to give up the colour - I told him I should take it from him; I then seized the flag with both hands - the moment I seized the flag I saw him raise his right hand with a blade in it, terminating with a sharp point, about six or eight inches in length - I then struck him with my staff for safety - he raised his hand from his side, and I raised my truncheon, and struck him - in defending the blow I put my arm out - he lifted up his arm in this manner - I put up my left hand to defend myself, and he struck me through my left arm; that was before I struck him with the truncheon - I struck him on the head with my truncheon somewhere, but where I cannot say; after I struck him I collared him with my right hand on his left hand collar - I never lost sight of him from the time he struck me, till the time I took him in custody - I took him in custody on the spot; the wound I received was a threeedged wound - I have the same coat on now as I had then - an instrument was found in the stable where he was confined - I saw the instrument in his hand - it was about six or eight inches long, and terminated with a sharp point - I took him in custody, and delivered him over to two more, - Holland No. 155 and

             No. 167, both of the C division, and they took him away; I told them at the time that the man had stabbed me - the wound was a three-edged wound, commonly called a triangular wound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you acquainted at all with St. Albans? A. I am; Rickmansworth is my native place - I have been to St. Albans, but never lived there - I was never there on any charge that I am aware of - I was indicted once for an assault - I now recollect myself.</p>
               <p>Q. All of a sudden? A. All of a sudden; that was the only charge against me - I know the Giltspur-street Compter - I was there once but it was wrongfully - I don't consider that a charge; I consider it a charge when a man is in confinement - I was not in confinement there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you there? A. I had some property of my own, and another man wanted it, and I would not let him have it - I was not in confinement in Giltspur-street - I was taken there and liberated immediately, without going before anybody except those at the watch-house - I don't know whether it was Giltspur-street Compter or the watch-house that I was taken to - I am not much acquainted with London; I have been in the police two years last April - this was before the police came on, it was the large stone building I was taken to - I have never been there since - it is on the right hand as you go across from here; I don't know who let me out - the man who wanted my property and I went up to the Compter together - he wanted to charge me with felony, but he could not - I was not charged with it - the man's name was Booth - I cannot exactly say what property it was now; a watch and a gown was two things among it - I cannot recollect any more - there was a few more - I don't recollect what they were - I knew they were mine, because I bought them and paid for them, and that is a good reason; the watch was made by Mr. Atwell, of Uxbridge, and that is where I purchased it - it was a metal watch, a woman's watch - I bought it of him in 1824 - I cannot say whether Mr. Atwell is alive now; I cannot say whether it was in my fob or in a bundle at the time - I had a bundle I know - I had a bundle in my hand - the gown was in my handkerchief, which I had in my hand; I was not in the habit of carrying watches about in bundles - I cannot say whether the watch was in the bundle or in my fob on the occasion - I was not charged with stealing that bundle - the charge was not taken - the man accused me of it; there are so many linen-drapers in London, it is impossible to say where the gown was bought; the piece was bought; it was made up into a gown afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was this transaction? A. I cannot say whether it was in 1826 or 1827.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the bundle opened? A. The bundle was opened in the compter in my presence - I cannot say who opened it, whether I opened it myself or anybody else - I cannot say whether I had the watch in my fob or in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Or whether you had another watch in your fob? A. That I don't recollect - I bought it at Atwell's in my own name; I gave five guineas for it - the watch produced at the compter was metal, having the name of Atwell, Uxbridge, on it - it was my wife's watch; my own watch at that time was in pledge - I was then living in Little Charlotte-street; I mean at the time I was charged, not when I bought the watch - I had left London - I was living at Rickmansworth, down at my sister's at the time; I was out of employ at the time - I had been living with my sister about a week or so before that; my wife was living in London in Little Charlotte-street - the charge was made in the middle of the day; I have seen the man since - I have got some more property from him which he had belonging to me in his possession - I met him accidentally in the street one day, and got his address from him; he had lived in the same house as we did.</p>
               <p>Q. What business had he with your wife's gown and watch? A. That has nothing at all to do with this trial - he had got the property away from my wife; she told me so herself - I do not charge him with stealing it; it is impossible for me to say how he got it from her - I consider it an unfair question when it relates to a man's wife; I don't think it relates to this - I got the property lawfully by going into my wife's apartments, where she lived at the time - Booth was living in the same house as we were - I came up to London from Rickmansworth to fetch my wife down, and also the things which she had; and that is the plain truth of the matter and all the account I will give you of it - since I have been in the police, there has been no charge of intemperate conduct against me, nor has there been any report against me of any description - I never answered to any charge, and if there had been one I should have answered it - I never acted intemperately in the street; I was put on what is called house-duty - I was a turnkey in St. James's watch-house; that was not in consequence of any intemperate conduct out of doors - there was no complaint of my having misconducted myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I think you said, as you advanced, down Grays-inn-lane, and turned into Calthorpe-street, you saw the prisoner with the flag? A. I did; that is the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040013"></xptr>way he held the flag (here the Counsel held it up) - it was not furled round, but hung so that the blues and stars and all were plain to be seen - Brooke was in advance of our division, and nearer to the man who carried the flag; (here the witness described the position in which the flag was held) - he held the flag so that the whole was plainly to be seen; the star and blue and all were sufficiently seen for any one to understand what the colours were - I was not in Court when Brooke was examined; I was of the same sub-division as Brooke - as near as I can guess our sub-division consisted of from twenty-two to twenty-six; there were not so many as thirty, I am certain - in the whole there was more than forty - I don't remember their being paraded in the riding-school.</p>

               <p>COURT. A. Do you mean the whole sub-division under Brooke's command amounted to twenty-six? A. Yes, not more; they were divided into sections - two sections formed a subdivision.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the subdivision to which you were attached, or the section of it, paraded in the riding-house? A. There was no parading, we were all in there - it was Dawson's riding-house; I suppose there were from three hundred to four hundred there of different divisions - we were not paraded nor examined by any officer in the riding-school - we were not paraded to ascertain whether we had our staves, but we were all called on and formed into a line to go into Calthorpe-street; their staves were not in their hands in the riding-house - we have a piece of string or whip-cord affixed to our truncheons to hold them, so that we should not lose them - we were the first subdivision that came out of Dawson's stables, and we were the first subdivision that advanced into Calthorpe-street from Gray's-inn-lane - I know nothing about any other divisions being stationed at different parts to command the other end of the street; there was no other division in Calthorpe-street that I know of, except those who came from Dawson's riding-house, when we left the riding house, as we passed, the gate Superintendent Baker gave the order to draw our staves - Brooke was then in front of us; he had his staff in his hand - whether he drew it then or had it drawn before, I cannot say; the furthest distance he was away from us was about three paces - I saw none of the populace till I got into Calthorpe-street - some were standing at the corner of Calthorpe-street, and the people came rushing down - there were people at the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any people in Gray's-inn-lane? A. At the time we went there, there were a few at the corner of Calthorpe-street and Gray's-inn-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How many? A. There might be forty standing on the pavement - they did not interfere with us - not in Gray's-inn-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the men, when told to draw their staves, spit in their hands and say, Now for it? A. No, they did not - there was no one in my presence said so; I did not, on my oath, see anybody spit in their hands, in order to grasp their staves the stronger - I am positive I did not do so myself - when we got to Calthorpe-street - I could see right down Calthorpe-street into the fields; the open ground is immediately at the bottom of Calthorpe-street, and is terminated by the prison wall - I could not see the end of the prison wall - I could see the prison wall - I could see the paling at times, and at times I could not; as we advanced down Calthorpe-street we were about twelve or thirteen abreast, and we were in the middle of the road - I heard hooting, and shouting, and brickbats were flying - I saw some bricks and stones; I suppose there might be about a dozen flying - I don't know whether there was six of each; if I had known you had requested it I would have counted them for you - there were no cries that I heard further than the shouting of the mob, as we went down Calthorpe-street - the mob came down from the fields, down Calthorpe-street, towards Gray's-inn-lane - about two hundred came down the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come pretty fast? A. Those that came on the pavement did, they came out of the fields as fast as they could come - I don't know whether that was the place where the meeting was to be held, because I was not on the ground - the meeting was dispersed at that time, when the people came down Calthorpe-street, towards Gray's-inn-lane they were pursued by no police that I know of, they were not by ours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see one body of the police coming from the fields, driving them in that way, and you stood thirteen abreast, so that they could not come your way? A. I did not see them, nor was I aware of any police being at the other end - I was in Calthorpe-street from five to six minutes - the people separated themselves on seeing us, and got out of the way - it was our business to advance up and disperse them, and also to keep the people quiet; of course it was our business to keep in our ranks till we received orders to the contrary, unless we saw a breach of the peace - Fursey was waving the flag, and heading the others; he had the flag in his hand; he passed Brooke first; he was nearest to Brooke when I rushed forwards to seize him.</p>
               <p>Q. Must Brooke have seen him wave the flag? A. I know nothing about that - he was waving the flag and urging the people to come on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say, "Come on my boys?" A. I don't say that - I could hear him shouting something - I was examined before the Coroner - I am positive I told the Coroner that I heard Brooke cry out "Oh!" - that was after I left the rank; I had not advanced above one step when I heard it - I did not receive any order to advance - I was in the front line.</p>
               <p>Q. When before the Coroner, did you tell him the man Fursey raised his arm as if to strike, and then you hit him somewhere on the head with your staff? A. No, I did not; I have told you so now - I did not strike him till he struck me with the dagger or instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Why omit to state that before the Coroner? A. I cannot say any thing about that - it has not come into my memory on a sudden; I was sworn to state the statement before the Coroner, and did so - I was sworn to tell all I knew, and I told all I knew before the Coroner, except striking him - on my oath, I did not purposely conceal that from the Coroner; if I intended to conceal it I should conceal it now - I did not state it there, nor at Bow-street, because I thought there was sufficient evidence without that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did recollect it? A. I knew of it, certainly - it I had not omitted it, I should have said it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040014"></xptr>I omitted it because I thought there was sufficient evidence without, as I said before.</p>
               <p>Q. If you thought there was sufficient evidence without when before the Coroner, and at Bow-street, why did you not omit it to-day, if there was sufficient evidence without? A. Because I am bound to speak the whole of the statement, and that was not required of me there- it was not asked me - I was sworn, but I was not asked, whether I struck him or not. - I was sworn to speak the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Q. And is it not part of the truth, that you struck the man? A. After he stabbed me - I state it now because I am to state here the whole particulars - I have not stated the whole particulars before - I did not suppress it to prevent any body from knowing that I had used violence - it was before I got to the man with the colour that Brooke cried "Oh;" and I was one step in advance of the rank when I heard it - I saw the flag, and my intent was to take the flag from the prisoner - I did not see any persons in Calthorpe-street lying on the ground wounded - I was advancing up the street; my intention was to take the prisoner into custody; I was not to see who was lying down in the street, or who was standing up; I heard no cries for assistance - I heard shouting - the prisoner came from the right hand corner of Calthorpe-street, to about the middle of the street; he was not alone, there were several with him, he was at the head of them; there were two hundred or three hundred, some in the middle of the street, and some on the pavement - those who came down the street escaped, and the ringleaders are what we apprehended - after the prisoner was apprehended, I told the superintendant I was wounded; he told me to go and get the wound dressed - I was told the prisoner was taken to Dawson's stables; and I went there, but found nobody except the woman who lives there - I went from there down to Burbridge's stables, where the prisoner was - he was in the coach-house at the time I went in - I went to that coach-house two or three times, I cannot say it was not six times, it could not exceed half-a-dozen - there were other persons there besides the prisoner, from fourteen to eighteen - the first time I went in I recognised the prisoner from the rest, and afterwards came out and gave his name - the superintendent requested me to search him, which I was unable to do; I cannot say who it was I gave his name to; it was to one of the officers of the A division; I don't know whether he is here - I do not know a man named Popay; I don't know such a person in the police; there are many I don't know - I can't say whether I saw a man there in plain clothes and white hat, there might have been many, I did not see one - I am not aware that any of the division or subdivision to which I belong are members of the Trades' Union, nor any of the police that I am aware of - I do not know of any of them being directed to enrol themselves members of the Trades' Union, nor of any other Union - I know nothing of Popay; I believe there were some of the police on the ground in plain clothes that day, I know there were some - I know they were sent there in their plain clothes, but I cannot say whether by the superintendent or by the commissioners - I did not hear them ordered to go.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were sent there? A. Because I saw them there, and know they were there - I only know I saw them there - on meetings of any description there are persons sent in plain clothes - I saw them there, and they came into the yard, after the meeting was over - I was not at the meeting myself; how is it possible to distinguish them among a mob - I saw them come into the yard where we were, and I saw one in Calthorpe-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not sworn you saw several of them at the meeting? A. At the meeting, and attending the meeting, are two different things; I said I could see the prison wall before me - I saw one of the police in plain clothes in Calthorpe-street; I saw him by coming up and speaking to us - I did not see him till then, that was just as I took hold of the prisoner; it is impossible for me to say his name - I know he was a policeman, because he told me so, and he had a staff in his hand - some of my own division were there in plain clothes, Farrant and Hobbs, Stone and Harwood - I know no more, they are all that I saw that belonged to our division; none of them are here to-day that I know of- I cannot say where they were, they were there; I saw them in Burbridge's yard - I believe the back of the yard is at the back of the field where the meeting was; it is not open to the field - of course they had all got staves, every one goes out with his staff; no constable goes out without his authority, whether he has regimentals or not - we none of us carried arms that day, except staves; I saw none at all - I saw a pistol which was found in the stable afterwards - I did not see Mr. Thomas, the superintendent with any arms - every superintendent had the command of his own division and Colonel Rowan, I believe, commanded all the divisions - there was no general-officer or soldier there, that I know of - I saw no orderly men there to ride from the spot to the Horse-guards; I did not see Colonel de Roos at the inquest that I know of - I don't know him; none of our division as we advanced, either by accident or otherwise, hurt any body, or broke any body's head that I saw - I did not see any of the subdivision break any body's head - I heard no cries; nothing but the shouts - I have said my object was to take the prisoner - if I had paid attention I might have heard cries, but my object was to take the prisoner; I cannot say whether there were any cries of wounded persons - Compton and Holland are both here; they are both policemen, and were in uniform, the same as me - nobody was sent out to command the police who where in plain clothes that I know of; they had the same means to act improperly as anybody else - I did not state at Bow-street, that a man named Coltman, a baker, was heading the mob in Calthorpe-street, nor anywhere else.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. If I understand you correctly, your division was divided into two sections; does the number twenty-six apply to your division alone, or each section? A. There were twenty-six in the two sections together; I think fourteen in one, and twelve in another - I did not see Brooke use any act of violence before I heard him cry Oh! nor raise his staff.</p>

            . I belong to the C division. On the 13th of May, I was in Calthorpe-street; I was close to Redwood when he was stabbed; I did not see him stabbed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040015"></xptr>- he said he was stabbed - he had hold of the prisoner - he called to somebody to take hold of the prisoner, and I and another constable, named Holland, took him, and took him to the White Horse livery stables, Gray's-inn-road,(Mr. Burbridge's).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there another policeman with you? A. Yes; a man named Holland - we both went together - there was a scuffle between the prisoner and Redwood; that was the only scuffle; the prisoner went very quietly with us - I can't say what scuffling there might have been when I was away; there was scuffling when I was there, between Redwood and the prisoner, and between several in different parts of the street; there was a disturbance - I cannot swear whether the people were fighting with each other, or with the police - of course it was between the police and the people - I did not rightly understand you when I said I could not say whether the police were scuffling with the people, or the people with each other; I did not rightly understand the question - I certainly understand you - I certainly did say so, but it was in the flurry of the moment - the scuffling was between the people and the police, the police were trying to disperse them - the police were trying to disperse the people, by telling them to go away - I mean to swear that; I cannot answer for what they might do in another part.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that nothing passed but the police telling them to go away? A. Certainly there were blows struck on both sides; I mean to swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. What weapons had the people that you saw them strike with? A. Why, there were stones thrown, and there was a short stick, about five or six inches long, loaded with lead, and they hit one man on the chin with it - I had the stick in my hand after the prisoner was taken to the stable - it was taken from some prisoner - I did not see it taken from a prisoner - I saw one man strike with it after I left the prisoner in the stables - I saw scuffling between the people and the police before I took the prisoner to the stables - I don't say I saw the blow given with the stick then - before I went to the stables I saw scuffling between the people and police - I saw the people with sticks, and there was some long staves, about four or five, or three or four - I did not see the police striking right and left - I saw them striking the people with their staves - I cannot form any idea how many were in action at that time - I belong to the same division as Redwood and Brooke - I took Fursey when the scuffling was ensuing - the scuffling was going on at the time I took him to the stables.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Redwood said he was stabbed - was the scuffling going on? A. Yes; the prisoner and Redwood were wrestling together.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you heard Redwood say he was stabbed was the scuffling going on with sticks and truncheons? A. The constables were dispersing the mob, of course, with their staves - I staid in the stables with the prisoner about a minute and a half, or two minutes - I did not search him at that time to see if he had any weapon nor did my companion - there was nothing to prevent our doing so.</p>
               <p>Q. As you had a colleague with you, and heard Redwood say he was stabbed, why not search the man, to find if there was a weapon about him? - you seem a sharp man, why not give an answer? A. I can't tell the reason - I must have forgotten it; I was as much in my senses then as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to give a flourish with your truncheon as you were going away? A. No; I had it out.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the prisoner when you were taking him to the stables? A. He had received a blow; on which side of his head I can't tell, but the blood was running down his forehead - there was one prisoner in the stables when I took Fursey there, and some police constables; about three or four - we left them behind us; some of them are here to-day - there was nothing to prevent them from searching Fursey if they chose - I belong to the same division as Brooke; I went out with the division; I can't say how many Brooke commanded, I was not under his command, I was under Serjeant Ellerby - I heard no cries when the blows were given between the people and police - there was hallooing; I did not hear any screaming, as if the people were hurt - there was shouting - I cannot say I police halloo.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it was from the people, and not from the police, that the hallooing came. A. There might have been some of the police hallooing - some of the police were in plain clothes that day - I don't know Popay - I believe there was one or two of my division in plain clothes - I can't tell who they were - there was not above, (I believe,) two of my division in plain clothes - they had their truncheons about them; I did not see them, but they mostly have orders to carry them with them - I saw them when we were in the livery stable-yard - it was not when I took the prisoner, it was afterwards that I saw them - it was a stable we took the prisoner to; I left him, but he was removed from that to a coach-house; I saw him afterwards in the coach-house - I don't know whether the other person in the stable was wounded; he was not moaning as if wounded; he was standing up - I don't know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard Popay's name, I suppose? A. I have heard his name outside to-day, and that is all I have heard of him - I was not at the inquest - our division was not paraded, it was drawn up in a line - we were ordered to draw our truncheons when we came out; I can't say who gave the order; it was as we were in the road - I don't believe there was above one hundred of our division.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear there was not upwards of fifteen hundred policemen assembled altogether all round the place? A. I was in Calthorpe-street; it was impossible for me to see what was in Bagnigge-wells-road, and other places; there might be two hundred in Burbridge's stables after the meeting was over; there were about three hundred, I suppose, in the riding-house before we started - it was in Gray's-inn-lane we were ordered to draw our truncheons, and they drew them as they were desired - none of us had been struck at that time, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You carried your truncheons in your right hand resting on your left arms? A. I don't know, I carried mine in my right hand (holding it straight up).</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons did you see wounded in Calthorpe-street, before you took the prisoner you saw blows struck on both sides? A. I never heard of one person being wounded till after I returned from taking the prisoner to the stables, and then I heard of Serjeant Brooke being wounded.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040016"></xptr>Q. About how many persons did you see wounded when you were passing on to the stables? A. The prisoner was the only one I saw with a cut over his head; I did not see any wounded, nor crying out from their wounds; I did not hear of anybody else but Serjeant Brooke being wounded.</p>
               <p>Q. None of the people's heads being broken? A. I did not see any, I heard there was such things; I did not see any men and women struck; I must have seen a thing of that sort if it had been in Calthorpe-street where I was, when I was there - I left Calthorpe-street about half-past four or four o'clock, after it was over - I was in Calthorpe-street a little after three o'clock, after returning from the stable - I did not see any one wounded from that time till half-past four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And you said, if any one had been wounded while you were there, you must have seen it; do you mean to represent that, from half-past three to half-past four o'clock? A. I do.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. How long had you been in Calthorpe-street before you took the prisoner? A. I took him a little after three o'clock, we had been there two or three minutes, hardly three minutes - after taking him in custody, I took him down to Burbridge's stables; I took him there at once, and after that returned - I was at the stables about two minutes, and I remained about an hour after I came back from the stables.</p>

            . I am a policeman belonging to the C division - I was on duty in Calthorpe-street on the 13th of May - I was close against Redwood when he had the prisoner - I saw him with the prisoner, and heard him say he was stabbed - Redwood had hold of him himself, and he told me to hold him fast, for he said He has stabbed me in the arm - I laid hold of him - Compton came up at the same time - I took him into the stables in White Horse-yard, Gray's-inn-road, with Compton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe it never occurred to you to search him till after you had left him there some time? A. It did not, Redwood had told me he was stabbed; I saw no weapon about him; the weapon might have been in his pocket for aught I know.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take the trouble to see? A. No; I might have done so if I liked, but thinking Redwood was following down, I did not know whether Redwood would search him or not - there was one person as a prisoner in the stables where we put him; I don't know his name; he was there before I put Fursey there, and a police-constable was there keeping the door; we took him into the further part of the stable; nobody else was in the place; I placed him in the stable myself, in the lower part of the stable - there could not be three or four persons there without my seeing them - there was not three or four police-constables in the stable; there was one police-constable there and nobody else; there could not have been three or four police-constables inside - I have not heard Compton examined; I was under Sergeant Harris; I got to the riding house at one o'clock, or half-past one - I was not examined there to see if I had all my accoutrements about me - I went there from Marlborough-street; I was at Dawson's; I should think there were about two-hundred there; I heard of only two meeting places for the police-constables - fifteen or sixteen hundred policemen could not have been put in two places; I don't know how many men were out that day, our division produced their staves about three o'clock, when we were called out of the riding-house - when we were called out and came into Gray's-inn-lane I did not see any disturbance any where; there were a great many persons in Gray's-inn-road; they were quite harmless and peaceable for what I saw; we were there to disperse them if there was a row.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the people peaceable after you produced your staves? A. I saw nothing to the contrary; as we went along they certainly never interfered - I had my truncheon in my hand; I did not see Brooke; he was in advance of me; I was in the rear - I cannot say how many divisions had advanced before our column came up; the C division was the first that came out, and they were divided into five subdivisions, I believe - I don't know exactly; I cannot say how many each subdivision contained; there might be six subdivisions; I cannot say - the divisions are marked by letters A, B, and C, &amp;c. I don't know how many letters there were in the riding-house - there is a string round our truncheons; I don't know whether our truncheons are made of box-wood; they are no doubt capable of breaking a man's head - the people did not offer the slightest molestation as we passed down Gray's-inn-lane, not till we got into Calthorpe-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you called out, do you know, because a row had began or because one was expected? A. I cannot say; we were called on to quell a row; I imagine that one had commenced - as I went into Calthorpe-street I saw no broken heads, nor heard any cries; I saw no fight; I saw a great number of people - I saw no stones or brickbats flying; we followed at the same time as Brooke - I was looking about to see if there was any mischief. I did not hear of our division breaking anybody's heads - I heard of one of the C division being struck in the eye with a stone; I saw none of the people injured; I saw no fighting in Calthorpe-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps none had commenced when you came up? A. I did not see any; I heard no shouts of murder, nor saw sticks, staves, or bricks flying, nor any sound of sticks and staves going against each other; nor any appearance of fighting at all - we were not molested by anybody from first to last; there was more of the mob than police in Calthorpe-street; they did not offer us any harm; I did not see them offer the slightest molestation to anybody, except in words - the words came from the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that, because they were in plain clothes? A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. But some of the police were in plain clothes; they could kick up a row as well as anybody else; how do you know that part of the mob were not policemen in plain clothes? A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether the great body of the people did not divide themselves in Calthorpe-street, on each side of the way to let you pass, in order to get rid of you? A. Yes, they did; I did not hear a cry of "The police are coming, make way."</p>
               <p>Q. Am I right in supposing you have said, you saw them immediately at your approach divide themselves on each side of the way, while you filled up the high road, and passed along? A. Yes; I did not see or hear of any riot or disturbance in Calthorpe-street - I found no disturbance<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040017"></xptr>except the prisoner; I saw no likelihood of any disturbance except that.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you to Compton? A. I was the first that took hold of the prisoner; Compton was close by me; he remained close by me, while I walked up; he had the same opportunity of observing what passed as I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think brick-bats and stones could be flying and he see it, and you not? A. I saw none; I don't know the house of Mr. Stallwood; I know the northern house at the corner of Calthorpe-street, on the left hand side nearest to the field - the hustings or railing where one of the persons had spoken were down at the bottom part of the field - I should think nobody could have a better view of the field than a person from the balcony of that house.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not the space resound with cries of shame, shame, while the police were knocking people down with their staves? A. There was that cry in the top part of the field, at a little after three o'clock; that was as soon as we got there - I believe that was after I had taken the prisoner; I cannot swear whether it was when I first went up into the street, or after I had taken Fursey to the stables, that I heard the cries of shame, shame; I really cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you believe you heard those cries as soon as you got into Calthorpe-street from Gray's-inn-lane? A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath were not the police at that end of the field knocking them down right and left? A. I was not at that end of the field till after the mob were dispersed - I saw no wounded people then; I saw nobody knocked down - I heard the cries of shame; I saw no fighting; I had no notion what the people were crying shame at.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go to see? A. I kept along with my division; I afterwards went to the coach-house, where the prisoners who were taken were put, and saw through the door sixteen or seventeen - the doors were shut at the time; I had no opportunity of seeing them except through the door.</p>
               <p>Q. To the best of your recollection had not every one of them his head broken? A. I should think not - I don't know that any man's head was bleeding except the prisoner's; I could not see them to distinguish them perfectly - the door was shut, and I looked through the keyhole - I did not count them; I went out of curiosity; that was about four o'clock or afterwards, after it was all over - If a woman had been knocked down with a staff, and her head broken, while I was in Calthorpe-street, I might not have seen it - our directions were to disperse the people away as quietly as we possibly could.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were not to strike unless resistance was offered you? A. No; I saw nobody attacked - I don't know Popay; I never saw him to know him - I don't know how many policemen were in plain clothes there; I know of none except Harris, I believe of the K division; I am not certain of his name; he is a witness for the prosecution - I saw him in the White-horse-yard, nowhere else - I did not see him in the field, nor in Calthorpe-street; I don't know how he came there in plain clothes - I don't know of any policemen being members of any unions of trades; none of our division or subdivision are so I believe - I know Sergeant Dean, he is in the corps now - I don't know a man of that name who is not now in the corps.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Before you heard Redwood say he was stabbed did you see any blows struck by the police? A. I did not.</p>

            . On the 13th of May I was a police constable - I was stationed in Mr. Burbridge's livery stables, Gray's-inn-lane - I remained there when the other officers left the stables; I recollect the prisoner being brought to the stables; I cannot exactly say who brought him, but it was by two police-constables in uniform - two others were brought about the same time, named Tilley; they were in the yard all at one time, brought out of Gray's-inn-lane - I had been in the stable; and taken a truss of straw into one of the stalls for the purpose of sitting down on; I sat down on it; I was not sitting on it when the prisoner and Tilleys were brought in - I was standing at the door then; I had been sitting on it before that; I got up, it might be about ten minutes before that; when Fursey and Tilleys were brought to the stables they went to the further stall, to which I had taken the truss of straw, and on which I had been sitting - they sat themselves down on the litter, and leaned back against the truss of straw, which was near the manger - they remained in that stall about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; they were then taken out and put into a coach-house - about ten minutes after the prisoners were taken out I observed part of a book in the stall, which seemed to me to be a penny publication, it was laying on the litter - I went into the stall and turned the truss of straw over; I pulled it over towards me, and there I found a dagger, and pistol, and powder flask - I had not seen them there when I placed the straw there; it was light enough for me to have seen them if they had been there; I think it is impossible they could have been there without my observing them - there had not been any one in the stall from the time I put the straw down till I found the dagger, and pistol, and flask, except Fursey and the two Tilleys - not to go to the manger - I have the dagger (producing it).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Would it not be rather difficult for a man who was seized to secrete that so long without being observed, he being taken in the act of stabbing - don't it strike you as difficult for a man to conceal it in his pocket at a moment - do you think you could do it? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not search the prisoner when he was brought in? A. I had nothing to do with him, except to take charge of him - there was nothing to my knowledge, to prevent the policemen who brought him in from searching him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there anybody in there before the prisoner was brought in? A. Yes it is my firm belief there was a person sitting in a chair - it was not my duty to keep the door - there was a police-constable in uniform there besides me - I was not in uniform - I don't know that the police-constable is here who was to keep the door; I saw him there; I don't think I should know him if I saw him - I am not able to say his letter and number - I was just inside the door when the prisoner was brought in - to the best of my belief there was a person sitting on a chair there - it was light in the stable - the chair was under the window.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040018"></xptr>Q. Was there a person in it or not? A. I believe there was; to the best of my belief there was one; I have not a doubt of it - I was not aware that he was a prisoner; to the best of my belief there was one in the chair, but I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a person seated on the chair? A. There was such a bustle, just at the time, it is impossible to say - I saw the chair, there was nobody in it when I looked particularly at it the last time - there was no person sitting in it the first time I looked; there was a police-constable sitting in it afterwards - it was before the riot or row began that I saw the policeman sitting in it - he went out, all of them went out after the riot began - I cannot say whether any body sat in the chair after that; it was a man who was sitting in the chair - I cannot swear positively that there was a prisoner brought in before Fursey - if anybody was in the chair it must have been a man - I will not swear positively that anybody was in the chair - I brought the straw close from the side of the chair - it is about half a dozen yards from the chair to the stall.</p>

               <p>Q. If it was so light that you could have discovered a dagger if it had been there could you help seeing a man, if he had been there? A. If I had thought to have looked if there was a man undoubtedly I could have seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it a thought to look for a dagger, when you put the straw down? A. No; it was impossible for it to be there, with the powder flask and pistol, without my seeing it - a man might have been there without my taking particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you say whether the chair was empty or not? A. I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not say you took the straw up from close by the side of the chair? A. That was an hour before the prisoner was brought in - a police-constable was sitting there then - they all went out, leaving me and another in the stable - I had orders not to leave the yard.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the situation of the chair an hour before? A. Several police-constables were sitting in it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not they leave it, and leave you behind? A. When the row began; they did not leave me alone in the stable, because I walked out to the door at the same time as they did - I went back again certainly, I never left the stable door - it was when I went in the first time, at one o'clock, that I took the truss of straw - there was people in when I first went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a prisoner there, on your oath? A. If I was certain there was I would say, Yes; but I am not certain - I did not take notice till Fursey was brought in; I found when Fursey was brought in that there was one there, because I heard what was said - two police constables brought in Fursey, and two others were brought in at the same time - and there was five or six very shortly after - I cannot say whether there was a prisoner there before Fursey and the Tilleys were brought in, to the best of my belief there was - I don't know whether the man who minded the door is here - the door was not closed; it was not guarded particularly; we just stood at the door to see that they did not go out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he stationed there to see that nobody went in or out without his knowledge? A. I am not able to say - I found this sheath that I have on the dagger, it was in the sheath when I found it; he must either have sheathed it in the stable, or before he came there - I believe the prisoner was searched at last, I was not present - it was loose straw for horses to lay on, that I put the truss on - the dagger is in the same state as I found it, except that I put a mark upon it; it was as bright as it is now when I found it - I was not in Calthorpe-street; I was not there as a looker-on.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go in disguise, and not in uniform? A. I was there to go for my own division, in case they were wanted - my superior ordered me to go in plain clothes, his name is Murray - I had my trucheon with me - I saw other officers there in plain clothes, it is impossible for me te say how many - twenty, or there might be more or less, I cannot say; there was several standing about in different places - I did not go out of the yard till after it was over? six or seven persons were brought into the stables afterwards; I did not see any one wounded but Fursey, nor any marks of wounds - Fursey had a handkerchief bound round his head, he had a hat on - I could see the handkerchief not with standing the hat - I don't know the name of the person who searched Fursey - no reason was given to me for my going in plain clothes - there was a numerous body of policemen about the place; some hundreds - my truncheon was to defend myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You took it suspecting that being in coloured clothes you might be attacked? A. Yes; very likely - and if I saw a necessity, to help my brother constables - I did not use it that day; I saw no necessity - I was at the inquest; I did not see Popay among the persons in coloured clothes- I did not know him; I have seen him here to-day; I cannot say that I ever saw him before - I never saw him dressed as a policeman to my knowledge - P is Popay's letter, I don't know his number.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know his letter if you don't know him to be in the police? A. I know he is in the police - I have never seen him in the police, but I have seen an account of him in the papers, and heard of him - I spoke to him to-day; I asked him if he was still in the police, and he said Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL. Q. How long, according to your best recollection, do you think Fursey was in the stall? A. From ten minutes to a quarter of an hour, to the best of my recollection - Tilleys and he went into the stall together - nobody had been into the stall to sit down in the stall after I put the truss down - from the time Fursey and the Tilleys were removed, until I went and found the dagger, pistol, and powder-flask, nobody had been in the tall.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long passed from the time you went out of the stall till the prisoner and the Tilleys were brought there? A. Not above ten minutes altogether; it might have been an hour after I had brought the straw in there, because I sat down some time myself.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROOKE re-examined. Q. You observed in the hand of Fursey a dagger with a brass handle, look at that? A. It was a dagger something like this; I cannot swear to this being the one, it was one similar to that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What kind of a coat had Fursey on? A. A different one to what he has now; it was a ragged coat - it was a ragged sort of coat to the best of my knowledge - it was a coat of the same make as he has on now - I don't know whether the person is here who searched Fursey.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040019"></xptr>MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL. Q. Do you know of his having been searched? A. I do not - the dress that Fursey has on now is not the dress he wore then - the prisoner at the bar struck me with a dagger similar to that which is now lying on the table.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you observe at that time the prisoner's head or face, to see whether there was any mark of blood on him? A. At the time I was struck I saw no blood on any man - his head was not bloody at that time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Since you were last examined, have you come to your recollection what were the other things in the bundle which the man wanted to get from you? A. I have not troubled myself to recollect.</p>

             on the 13th of May, about eleven o'clock at night; it was over the sixth rib, on the left-side - it was inflicted by a pointed instrument a little triangular - I probed it; the point of the probe stuck in the rib; proving that the blow must have been given with some violence - in all probability, if the instrument had not been met by the rib, it would have passed through the heart - such an instrument as this would produce the wound - I examined Redwood on the following morning, the 14th, he had a wound in the left arm; a triangular wound about four inches in depth - that was precisely such a wound as would be inflicted by such an instrument.</p>

My Lord and Gentlemen:- I am so overpowered by my situation and the fatigue I have undergone, being in ill health, that I feel incapable of making such a defence in the way of address to you, as my case would admit of, therefore I prefer submitting to your better judgment from the mouths of my witnesses, a full statement of my case; from which I have no doubt, you will see just reason to conclude that the aggressors throughout were the police-constables, whose conduct from beginning to end, I am sure, will turn out to have been wanton, brutal and savage; and but for their misconduct, no riot or disturbance whatever, would have taken place. My life is in your hands, Gentlemen, I am sure you will do justice between me and my prosecutors.</p>

            . I am a gentleman living on my fortune, my residence is No. 13, Calthorpe-street. I remember the 13th of May, the day the meeting was intended to be held in Spa-fields; my house is the corner house, the north-east corner of the street - it commands a view of the field in which the meeting was to be held; of Calthorpe-street, of the Union public-house, and all the avenues leading to it - on that day I took my station at the balcony of my house rather before three, say half-past two; I observed the police make their first appearance - there was no disturbance whatever up to that time, nor any disposition to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you observe the first appearance of the police, in what position? A. They came up in a body up Calthorpe-street, the first division; occupying the whole of the carriage and footways; they came from Gray's-inn-lane - I had let some stables to a Mr. Burbridge; he calls them the White Horse livery stables - I observed some of the police come out of those stables; they went out of the eastern gate into Gough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is a considerable portion of Spa-fields bounded on the eastern side, by the prison-wall? A. It is not Spafields, it is the Calthorpe estate; the east side is bounded by the prison-wall; Gough-street, and Calthorpe-street, are two avenues leading to the west from the Calthorpe estate; outlets through which a multitude might go through westward - the first body of police that came into Calthorpe-street, halted directly opposite my house - I observed a chairman and railings in the meeting; they halted within about sixty feet of where the chairman was - the body who proceeded into Gough-street, halted at the corner of Collingridge's-buildings, which was about forty-five feet off the chairman - when these two bodies had both halted, the body in Gough-street were ordered to draw their staves out of their pockets; the other body drew their staves at the same time, they observing that all the avenues were first stopped up by bodies of the police - I should conceive the police force in my view, consisted of seven or eight hundred - it was a few minutes after three when the bodies were all formed - when the staves of both bodies were drawn, the order was given to the Gough-street body to charge - I distinctly heard the word Charge - up to the time that I heard the word Charge, everything was peaceable on the part of the people - on that order being given, the police bodies charged immediately, making for the chairman, knocking down everybody indiscriminately that they met with.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What, the Gough-street body? A. The two bodies - one coming one way and another the other.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Now, Mr. Stallwood, your being in that commanding situation, was there, up to that moment, either order to disperse, or Riot Act or Proclamation read? A. None whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the consequence of the charge that the two bodies made? A. The ground was strewed immediately with bodies of every description, men, women, and children - I saw that, and after it had continued some time, my blood boiled in my veins, and I addressed the police force.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What division was it you addressed? A. I addressed them both; it was the last division - I addressed the C division, with Mr. Thomas at their head - that was the division that came up Calthorpe-street.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long before that had you been in your balcony? A. Half an hour or more, and during that time there was no disturbance whatever, or breach of the peace, till the police came into Calthorpe-street - I stated to the C division, that as the Riot Act had not been read, nor the Proclamation for the people to disperse, I begged of them, if the people had done wrong to take them into custody, and not knock them down - I had occasion to go down stairs with two ladies who had been at my house, and had a carriage waiting for them, and they got off as fast as they could - I saw some women and children at the different doors in Calthorpe-street, as well as men, and some of them were beaten, boys' heads were broken, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040020"></xptr>one woman was so beaten in the field, that two gentlemen went out of my house to rescue her - two gentlemen of the press - Mr. Courtney was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said this affair began a few minutes after three o'clock, how long did this outrage continue in the street? A. An hour and a half before they cleared the premises, and that would bring it to about half-past four o'clock - I sat down to dinner at five o'clock - while this was going on, and I was at my balcony; the inhabitants shouted out of their windows, "shame, shame" - one of my daughters fainted at the sight; Mr. Courtney was very much affected, and another gentleman with him - I was examined at the inquest - I could not single out particular individuals in the confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, from the time the word charge was given and obeyed, did the police force appear to be under any control whatever? A. None whatever; I thought they were rather intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SOLICITOR GENERAL. Q. Were you ever a Justice of the Peace to the county of Middlesex? A. I was; I think I was nominated in July, 1831 - I continued so three or four months - I have since that ceased to be a magistrate - I made application to the Duke of Portland and the Lord Chancellor to know why, and they refused to inform me - I was superseded in the commission from the representation, I believe, of the select vestry of Pancras, which I have opposed for twenty years - there was never any complaint made against me - there was never any complaint made against me to the select vestry.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever a member of this select vestry? A. I am now; this is the second year that I have been so - I was not a member before that - I have been the means of overthrowing that vestry, and have been elected in their room - no complaint had been made about a payment of rates by a tenant of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been tried? A. I was tried for a riot and assault on the corn question in 1815, and honourably acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only time you have ever been tried? A. For a riot and assault - there was never any charge brought against me respecting an apprentice of mine - I never had an apprentice - I was tried in 1819 or 1820, at the Quarter Sessions for the county of Middlesex - the charge was, a boy named Jones, came with a horse and cart, and threw a great quantity of bottles on my ground; I requested him to move them, he would not - I desired two men to compel him to move them, in doing which they threw him off a horse - I was tried with two men and was convicted, and paid ten pounds to the prosecutor; I was at that time spending my private fortune in a building speculation - I was brought up as an architect and surveyor - I continued spending my private fortune in building speculations, till I made forty or fifty thousand pounds by it - I did not know there was to be a meeting on the Calthorpe estate, till the Sunday, when my groom informed me there was a proclamation on the prison walls, and I then went to read it - the thirteenth was on Monday - I did not consider it a proclamation, because it was not signed.</p>
               <p>Q. Because it was not signed, did you consider it was to be disregarded? A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not caution persons against coming to the meeting on the following day? A. It cautioned persons from holding any illegal meeting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not state, that the object was to adopt preparatory measures to form a national convention, as the only means of obtaining and securing the rights of the people, did it not state a public meeting held for such a purpose, would be dangerous to the public peace and illegal? A. I believe it did; if you will hand me the paper I will tell you whether it was what I read; - (copy handed to Witness) - this is a copy of what I saw on the wall - a copy of that was stuck against the wall of Coldbath-fields prison, and is there now, and was there on the 13th of May.</p>

               <p>Q. You thought this not being signed was to be disregarded? A. I did, as it does not specify what Secretary of State.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you thought there would be nothing illegal in such a meeting? A. I never considered the question at all, because there was a meeting held by Mr. O'Connell, with ten times the number, and the peace was not broken; I don't know what the object of that meeting was, they spoke for three or four hours and then went away - I did not know before the meeting assembled, that this object of it was to adopt preparatory measures for forming a National Convention - I looked at the paper, generally on the prison walls the day before - I have no doubt but I read the whole of it - I saw flags at the meeting - I saw a flag with death's head and cross bones, all the same flags were at the former meeting and more too - I did not read the words on the death and cross bones flag - I believe it had an inscription - I have no doubt it had - before the police came that flag was not flourished about, it was exhibited - the moment the flags came up the police attacked the body instanter - I think there was four flags - I do not recollect the inscription on any of them - I saw that flag - I think it is the flag - I did not observe the person who carried it to notice him particularly - I saw it unfurled - I do not think the person who had it in his hand waved it - I think he furled it as soon as he got to the chairman - it was unfurled all the way down the street - there was a caravan at the meeting half an hour before; there was not a stage erected; the boy who first proposed the chairman, got into the caravan, with the chairman; in the first place he was in a caravan, and the man belonging to the caravan, finding they would not pay him drove him away; he drove about thirty feet up Calthorpe-street, and then the boy Lee and the man jumped out of the caravan into the street, finding they were likely to be carried away - the boy Lee first climbed up the rails, and in a very impertinent manner, proposed Mr. Mee to be chairman - I did not mean to take any part in the proceedings; I despised the meeting altogether; he then put it to the vote, forty or fifty hands were held up, and he declared Mr. Mee to be the chairman - I was still at my balcony - I heard what the chairman said - he addressed the meeting, and requested them to be peaceable and quiet, for it was essentially desirous for their purpose to have peace and quietness, and that he was very much obliged to the Whig government for advertising their meeting, for it gave them an importance they did not possess; he there halted and was desired by the people to go on, he appealed to the people if they were prepared to sacrifice one-tenth of all their earnings to support his wife and family, if they were not he requested them not to tell him to go on, and at this time the police made their appearance - the flags had arrived just before, and were all four near the chairman - when the police came they tried to seize the flags - I think I observed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040021"></xptr>one of the flag-staffs had a spear head; I did not see the American flag taken by Redwood - I cannot at all recognise the prisoner - I have seen Brooke and Redwood here - I did not see either of them do anything that day - I cannot recognise any of them - there was two distinct divisions came down Calthorpe-street; one had commenced the attack, and the other came up afterwards; I addressed the last that came up of the C division, with Mr. Thomas at their head - I did not see one body station themselves about the middle of Calthorpe-street; they arranged themselves on one side of the pavement afterwards; I saw them about the middle of Calthorpe-street, the latter part of the day, not before the American flag was captured - I did not see any person carry the American flag across the street - I believe Thomas was at the head of the C division; it was the E or C I think it was the E - it was the division which he headed I addressed.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the divisions all join together? A. They did - I am sure the incursion of the police took place before the American flag was seized at all; I considered the proclamation not legal; I believe there are four or five principal Secretaries of State in the present government; Mee said they were puffed into importance by the Whig government, by that proclamation; I have seen puffs desiring people not to buy any thing on any account, and I considered them puffs to the people to buy them - I was made amagistrate by the present Lord Chancellor, and have been a reformer of the select vestry many years and continue so - I saw the American flag at a former meeting, when O'Connell was there - there was not the least row there, nor any police unless they were in plain clothes - I don't know whether that flag figured at Birmingham when the ministers were in some danger, it looks as if it had seen some service - I never saw a proclamation put out by the government of this country before, without the name of some Secretary of State to it, or being headed "By the King in Council" - the whole of the buildings about Calthorpe-street belong to me now; I built the whole of Calthorpe-street, it all belongs to me now except six houses, Gough-street, and Well-street, and the stables; also I have upwards of fifty thousand pounds there - I never saw the prisoner in my life, till this morning, to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. I observe this anonymous paper desires the civil authorities to apprehend any person offending - was what you saw on the part of the police an attempt to apprehend or knock them down? A. They began to knock them down, and did not attempt to apprehend until I addressed them; then they took persons into custody, but not till then - I saw no responsible person on the ground directing the police except Mr. Thomas; he rode there on horse-back.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you saw of the meeting before the police rushed in, is it your opinion that half-a-dozen policemen would easily have prevented their meeting? A. If I had had half-a-dozen policemen, I would have taken every person without a blow - I beg to add there was not a brickbat thrown.</p>

            . I am a reporter to the Courier newspaper - I did not know of this meeting till the morning of the 13th of May, when our editor sent me to attend; I arrived on the ground before twelve o'clock, and found small collections of people on different parts of the ground, but nothing to indicate a meeting; the appearance of the field was precisely as I have seen it on other Mondays; there was servants about with children, and people playing; and there was a preacher addressing a small body of persons; there did not appear to me any disposition to create a riot, either then, or at any time that day - I went there to make a faithful report to my employer of what I saw; about half-past two o'clock or later, I saw the van come up, into which one of the speakers got - this was the commencement of the meeting - I think at the time the first speaker got into the van, there was about two thousand people - there were a great number of women and children, I mean boys and girls of thirteen and fourteen years old. I saw several boys beaten afterward.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any disposition to riot when the chairman got into the van? A. None, I think the feeling of the multitude was ridicule, for when the van was drawn off, somebody said it was the police had drawn it off - then there was a shouting and laughing - I heard it proposed that Mr. Mee should take the chair, and immediately after Mee began to address the crowd - I found the pressure inconvenient, and a person said "We can go up to this balcony," and the gentleman allowed us; I could see to the bending in Guildford-street to the right, to Gough-street north and south, and over the whole field to the Union, my view commanded the whole of Calthorpe-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Up to that time had any body of police come into Calthorpe-street? A. I did not see the police till I got into the balcony, but I heard Mee say "There are the police, I recommend that we send somebody to ask what they want." I heard that before we got into the balcony - there was not the slightest disposition to tumult - I saw some persons approach the hustings with flags - I was then at the hustings; it was before Mee took the chair - I think I saw the flag produced; it was on a pole floating and waving in the air; that is, the banner; it was afterward wound round the staff, and the chairman, I think, jumped out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the party attended by the banner, come towards the chairman? A. Yes; they came from Gray's-inn-lane - there was not any policemen on the ground then; at the moment the banners came down Calthorpe-street, the crowd increased very largely; but I don't know how many of the party marching in procession were abreast- I saw no disposition to tumult; the banner men were very loudly cheered - I think there were four with flags; they arranged themselves two on each side the chairman; one of them grasped his banner staff with his legs and arms, and the chairman put his hand round that staff. I was at the corner of Calthorpe-street and Gough-street, and the chairman was just the breadth of Gough-street from me - he was right in the centre opposite the middle of Calthorpe-street. I observed the person who carried the flag, but could not identify him - I think in going up to the chair three or four of the persons carrying the banners looked a little swaggering and triumphant - I don't think I had been in the balcony a second, when on turning round, I saw the police drawn up across the street and halting; they were about two-thirds the length of the street from the corner; they had advanced about one-third up the street - there was at the same moment in my view as I turned round, three other bodies of police, each of them completely blocking up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040022"></xptr>the avenues to which they approached - each blocked up its avenue.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they surround the persons who were at the meeting? A. No; the four bodies completely inclosed the meeting, surrounding it; completely inclosing all the people at the meeting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe at that time where this flag stood? A. I cannot charge myself with remembering a particular flag - on the bodies of police advancing, the people fronting the chairman separated, part on each side, making a clear way for the police to come up to the hustings; that certainly appeared to be their object - the body of police in Calthorpe-street having halted about half a minute, proceeded to march, and as they went on, the end man of each rank pushed, thrust, and beat the people who were standing by them on the flag stones at a considerable distance from the meeting; all the end men did this as they advanced up the street; they just occupied Calthorpe-street from flag to flag - the people were crowded together - as soon as they began to march, they began to beat; and we on the balcony cried Shame! shame!</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive over any part of the spot the meeting were dispersed, any act to provoke this? A. I think a crowd of policemen coming across from the Union might suppose the people were coming to attack them, as they were running from the other policemen; but they made no attack at all, and there was none.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I understand you to say, the police were going up Calthorpe-street towards the chairman, the people who had cleared the way retired down the other side? A. No; I say the policemen at the end of the ranks struck those who were on the flag stones; but as they reached the chair in the centre of the crowd, and the police in North and South Gough-street did the same, before the party coming from the Union could be seen - and it struck me, the police might suppose the crowd running from that body of police, were advancing to attack them. I don't mean the Calthorpe-street body, they could not suppose any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What body might suppose the people were advancing to attack them? A. The body of police coming from the Union, (which is at the eastern end of the street coming from the wall,) might suppose so; the other bodies had no such pretence; neither the Calthorpe-street nor the Gough-street. I saw the Calthorpe-street party follow people who were running away, and knock them down; they struck them on the legs till they fell - they stuck them across the shins, not one, but dozens; they were not offending - they were running away; the police ran after them at full stretch and struck them across the shins till they escaped - I don't know when the police first got into Calthorpe street, but the moment I got into the balcony I saw them, and they were standing, it appeared to me they were waiting for a signal - there was no means left for the people to escape, till the police in beating them, broke their own line; and then the people rushed by them and great numbers got off. If the police had not wasted their strength by three or four beating one man lying on the ground, I don't think one of the crowd could have escaped without a blow. I saw three policemen strike one man repeated blows on the head till he fell; and I saw other men beaten on the ground after they fell, by several policemen - I saw two or three policemen as they passed the man, strike him as he lay on the ground - when the Calthorpe-street party came to the end of the street, a man who was standing in front of the division, and who two or three times addressed them as they marched on, rushed towards the chairman; the banners then stood on the rail at which the chairman stood, and the place was quite open to them - when they got to the end, the person in front rushed forward to take the chairman, and he was followed by a greater part of the others from the middle of the division; the four banners were by the chairman at that time - the man in front rushed forward as if to seize the chairman, and the others rushed after him. I did not see what followed, for my attention was attracted by two girls being dragged and shoved under the balcony, and one of them was pushed down with the baton, not absolutely struck with it - these two girls were on the steps of Mr. Stallwood's door, which have a gate in front of the railing - that gate was shut, and a crowd of persons inside - these two girls were in these, they had no caps or bonnets, and as I went into the house, I opened the gate and let them in there. I looked over the balcony and saw the policemen beating the people inside the gate; hitting them indiscriminately over their heads and shoulders; and as one of the girls rushed across the street, I saw the policeman shove her with his baton, as she fell; she was screaming out Mercy, mercy. I saw the struggle at the banner, but what was done I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that about the time the rush was made at the chairman? A. Yes; just at the time I saw Mee leap down and run away - I saw a scuffle between one of the police and the bannerman - I saw the banner open - immmediately after, I saw the girl run across the street a man who was running away was struck by three policemen successively; I called to them to let the man run; one of them looked up at me, called me an odlous name, and said"You shall catch it too."</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that the crowd were desirous of remaining or escaping? A. Of escaping certainly - the conduct of the police seemed studiously to prevent their escape, I could have no doubt of it - there was no attack made on the police by word or deed till they commenced the attack; they struck the people over the head with their batons, with the full swing of the arm, as hard as they could; and they struck in that way over the crowds that were standing on the steps of the doors - I saw I should say from twenty to thirty persons laying on the ground, none of them were policemen - they were all wounded - I saw a number wounded - I saw the blood of many - at that time the crowd were endeavouring to escape - the police were beating them - the police were then as much scattered as the crowd was - they appeared under no control whatever, except the worst of passions - I saw two policemen striking a woman, that was after the banner was taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Confine yourself to what happened before that.</p>
               <p>Witness. The girl was struck before the banner was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear any attack made on the people by the police before the banner was taken? A. Certainly I observed it a very short time before the banner was taken - less than a minute - it continued after the banner was taken, and it was then frightful and appalling - I went out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040023"></xptr>of Mr. Stallwood's house to rescue a woman who had been beaten.</p>

               <p>Q. In your judgment from the time the chairman was first in the van, would there have been any difficulty in dispersing the meeting without violence? A. None in the world; they appeared quietly disposed from the commencement; the majority seemed indifferent as to whether a meeting was to be held or not, for I spoke to several.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR GENERAL. Q. Were any of the people killed? A. I believe not; heads were broken and arms - since the meeting I have seen two or three persons whose arms were broken; I saw persons cut and laying on the ground senseless and bleeding - I have since seen two or three whose arms were broken that day - I know they applied to be examined at the inquest and were refused, for I made the application myself to the corner - I attended during the inquest except on the first day - I did not conduct the proceedings; I was sent for the paper to take the proceedings - and two or three days after when these persons were waiting outside I told the coroner two or three outside were wishing to be examined; they seemed exhausted with waiting - I did not see any placard calling the meeting - one colour was an American flag which has been produced; another had death's head and cross bones, and "death or liberty" on it; I don't remember the others - I did not see the procession, but the crowd was more than doubled immediately the banners came - there was a great cheering; I should infer that the mob had increased by the persons following the banners - I think all the four banners were unfurled; they were waved; the one with death's head and cross bones was waved; there was considerable cheering as the banners came up; I should not say it was particularly when that flag was waved; the four were placed right and left of the chairman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the cheering continue after the flags were placed there? A. No, there was perfect silence; the persons carrying the flags appeared a little swaggering and triumphant as they marched up; they did not wave their banners at that time; they carried them; the banners were floating at that time; I cannot recognize the person who carried the American flag; I have seen the prisoner since but don't remember to have seen him; I have no recollection of Redwood, and cannot say I saw him do anything - when the police came into Calthorpe-street, they occupied the whole street, from flagging to flagging, but were not on the flag; and in Gough-street from wall to wall; I should say there would be one hundred and fifty in Calthorpe-street, they were in close order; I should say there were three ranks and each rank might contain from twenty to thirty men abreast, or more, but I cannot be certain of that- there could not be so little as thirteen - I should not hesitate to swear there was more than twenty or thirty abreast as far as I could conjecture - I mean in Calthorpe-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take on yourself to swear positively there was as many as twenty abreast? A. I swear positively to my belief there was more - I did not count them; there was as many as there could be - I believe there was more than twenty - I hesitate to swear it - I don't know that I have seen Brooke before - I have seen the prisoner two or three times since he was committed - I do not recognise having seen him on the 13th of May - I saw the American colour in Calthorpe-street, and the man who carried it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the flag with death's head and cross bones been taken before you saw the American flag in Calthorpe-street? A. No, the time I saw the flag and the man who carried it was when they were coming to the chair - at the time the police came into Calthorpe-street I saw the American flag at the railing - I did not see it in Calthorpe-street - I think I can swear I did not see it at any time in any part of the crowd except at the railing after the chairman took his place.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand then you are not able to speak to what took place when the flag was seized in Calthorpe-street? A. No, I saw a scuffle at the railing - I saw no scuffling for a flag, and don't know what took place then - I have called on the prisoner in Newgate three or four times since the last sessions, last week or the week before - I think, I called on him four or three times.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you know there was such a person in the world before this disturbance took place? A. No, the first time I saw him to my knowledge, was in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. You are asked if you saw a scuffle in Calthorpe-street about the banner; do you believe there was any scuffle in Calthorpe-street with a banner at all? A. On my oath I do not; I was not looking about all the time for I left the balcony for a few minutes, because I was taken ill and near fainting; that was after the attempt to take the chairman into custody - every thing was in my sight till after the police were in complete possession of that piece of ground and Calthorpe-street - till after the uproar had comparatively subsided; if any banner had been captured in Calthorpe-street I must have seen it; I think the banners were all captured at the rails - there was no struggle for any banner in Calthorpe-street - I saw no banner removed from the side of the chairman till the police advanced and the meeting was broken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible a man could have come across from the right corner of Calthorpe-street, into the middle of the street and there contest for the banner with a policeman, and a multitude at his heels, and you not see him? A. I should think it impossible - the whole scuffle for the banners took place at the rails - I could not distinguish one policeman from another; the incidents were too numerous to attend to the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe this conduct to be the act of individuals of the police, or was it the act of the body? A. The acts of violence were certainly the acts of individuals, but it was impossible to distinguish one's brutality from another; they were all alike - I cannot say whether Redwood or Brooke were among them; they might or might not be - there was no disposition to riot or tumult as the banners came up, nor any act of violence on the part of the people - there could not be less than five or six hundred policemen in the four bodies.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL. Q. Did you see any policeman stabbed in Calthorpe-street? A. No; one might have been stabbed as it has been described, without my seeing it, or two - a dagger might have been used without my seeing it, and it appears it was done.</p>

            . I am minister of Bunhill-fields burial-ground. On the 13th of May, about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040024"></xptr>three o'clock, I was passing from Bagnigge wells round to Wilson-street, Gray's-inn-lane - I wished to inquire concerning a nephew who I understood was dying, and it was my nearest way to cross from Spa-fields across that place - I was not at all connected with the meeting, or its purpose - I observed when I got near Calthorpe-street, an assemblage of people; they were so peaceable that, although many hundreds, yet I should scarcely have thought it possible that above half-a-dozen persons were on the ground - I saw some colours flying where there was a van - I observed a rush made towards the persons who carried the banners by the Metropolitan New Police, who appeared on a sudden to come from all directions, but particularly from Calthorpe-street - up to the time of that rush, every thing was perfectly peaceable; they surrounded the assembly, and instantly commenced beating them indiscriminately with their staves; I saw this myself - I had not observed the smallest insult offered by the people - they attempted to escape, but were not able; for the new police who were in ambush, rushed out of almost every avenue and prevented their escape - I saw many persons knocked down by them; and one particularly streaming with blood, in fact, deluged with blood - I know Margaret-street very well; several people run up there, and were pursued by the police; and as they were running, I saw the police strike men, women, and children, indiscriminately in the street - I believe many of the police remained behind in Calthorpe-street - I continued there till about twenty minutes or quarter to four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time the rush made by the police commenced till you went away, did you observe any cessation of this brutal violence? A. I did not; I was not in Calthorpe-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went on the ground about three o'clock? A. About that time - I did not stay on the ground till a quarter to four o'clock, but about the place - I saw the persons bearing the flags come up; there was no shouting and cheering that I witnessed - I was about the centre of the ground; I should think there could not be great cheering without my knowing it - I did not perceive any person carrying the flags except the policeman who had them under his arm - I did not see the flags brought up; I saw them near the van - I continued mostly in Bagnigge-wells-road; that is not many yards from Calthorpe-street - I was quite in view of Calthorpe-street - I saw a policeman bringing two or three flags from that quarter - I did not observe what was on the flags; I saw no flags in Calthorpe-street; they appeared to me to be in the van; I did not perceive that they were set up, two on each side the chairman - I did not see them till they arrived on the spot - I was too far distant to hear the chairman address the meeting - I was not examined before the Coroner; I sent a note to the Coroner that I might be examined, but he did not call me - I saw nothing in Calthorpe-street about a man being stabbed.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. In the note you sent to the Coroner, did you state that you were a clergyman? A. I did not; I wrote it in this way, "Reverend J. S. Pearsey requests that the Coroner will allow him to step forward as evidence" - when I saw the flags in possession of the police, they were rolled up under the arm of a policeman; I did not perceive what was on them.</p>
               <p>A. JUROR. Q. I wish to know whether you could see the position the chairman occupied? A. I saw two or three persons; one might be the chairman; I was not acquainted with him - they appeared to be in the van - I could witness the whole of the transaction throughout the ground to the end of Calthorpe-street - I saw the van move off; who took it away I cannot say - I did not see what became of the chairman after the van moved off.</p>

            . I am a hair-dresser, and live at No. 17, Little Guildford-street, Russel-square. I went to this meeting a few minutes after two o'clock - I suppose at that time there were one thousand persons collected, men, women, and children - I went in consequence of reading a proclamation forbidding the meeting; I went to see what kind of a thing they had forbidden; that was the first thing that induced me to go - I saw the van drive up a little before three o'clock; I presume it was a quarter to three o'clock - it was at the end of Calthorpe-street, opposite Mr. Stallwood's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any little altercation between the persons in the van and somebody else? A. There was an altercation, but I don't know the nature of it - the van moved off - there is a railing close by, and a few minutes after a young man, about twenty-one or twenty-two years old, got on the railing and proposed a man, named Mee, to be chairman - he was voted to the chair by the acclamation of the persons surrounding; he stood on the railing and commenced addressing the multitude by first exhorting them to quiet, orderly, good conduct, to be particularly on their guard for they had their enemies about them, and if they saw a man commit the least breach of the peace to consider that man their foe - I was about twenty feet from the speaker, on a plug hole, and could hear all distinctly.</p>

               <p>Q. Up to that time had the meeting been peaceable and orderly? A. It was extremely peaceable - I remember the banner men coming, they were cheered a little as they came up towards where the speaker was - the banners were unfurled till they got a stand near the chairman, and then they were immediately furled - when there was a cry that the police were coming, I was elevated on the shoulders of two men, to see if it was a fact or not, and saw them coming down Calthorpe-street forming as they came, completely under military tactics; after they were formed completely, they occupied the whole space of Calthorpe-street, and marched up in regular military order; after some few had got away, from railing to railing, the inspectors were in front, the body marched up towards the railing; they pressed the people more compact towards the railing- I remember a tall man with full whiskers saying, "Seize this man," pointing with his hand towards the chairman - the banners were by the chairman at that time, and furled, and almost instantly an attack commenced.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that within hearing of the banner men? A. Within hearing no doubt - I think they were near enough to hear it - the police instantly commenced one rush on the people, knocking down those nearest to them, cutting away in all directions; while they were so doing, an inspector, on the right of those who marched up the middle, said, "Go it, my lads, that is right;" I was then immediately dropped down, and tried to make my escape down Gough-street, but I found that part was blocked up by the police; I was carried by the pressure of the crowd, who were try<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040025"></xptr>ing to make their escape, into Calthorpe-street, and there a tall man, in the garb of a labourer, immediately before me, had his head cut, and the blood came trickling down on me - at that moment, I crouched a little till I got into the second doorway, No. 11, and the mob of course could rush by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether any of the mob were knocked down? A. There was very few but were either knocked down or knocked about by the police indiscriminately; I saw one man very active in knocking down, and he struck an old man, and when his hat fell off he was grey-headed and bald-pated, and his head was streaming with blood; immediately he knocked the man down, he struck him once or twice after he was down - a lad was attempting to run by him, and he struck him and knocked him down with his staff - I afterwards saw that very policeman taken to a doctor's shop in Gray's-inn-lane, he had his hand in a sling, and was led by two men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe a man with a banner? A. I did; he was being knocked about at the time I first saw him with the banner, by at least eight or ten policemen, they surrounded him, some pulling the banner and some striking at him; the inhabitants cried, "Shame, shame," - that cry was quite audible - when they were striking the man with the banner, a poor woman standing on the steps of a door said, "Oh you scoundrels consider their wives and families, and don't murder the men," and immediately after three policemen came up to the doorway, where she and I were; one of them made use of a very bad expression, and struck her down the face, cut it open, and fetched the blood out - she had given no provocation, except what I have stated - one of the others struck me with intent to cut my head open, but the blow came on my shoulder as I held my head on one side - as they first came up, they used a very awful expression beginning with a B; this man after striking me on the shoulder, raised his arm up to strike me in the mouth, I seized his arm and rushed behind him, in my trying to get away he fell down - I think he was intoxicated, or he would not have fallen so easily - I consider him to have been quite inebriated, or he would not have fallen so easily - the people all ran away, and I got another blow across my back, as I ran - the police said, "Run, d-n you, run."</p>
               <p>Q. Did they run after you? A. No; as they ran by, the police stood on the curb, and as each man ran by they tried to have a thump at him; directly I got into Gray's-inn-lane, I heard a cry of a policeman having been stabbed, and saw a man with his arm bound up, it was the same man as I saw knock the old man and the boy down, I am sure - for I went twice after him trying to get his number, but all I could see was, that he was of the C division, and had three figures; I said to him, "Thank God you have got it, for you richly deserve it," knowing him to be the same man as I had seen knock the old man and boy down - I tried to dress three or four persons' wounds, they were hurt principally over the head, rather towards the back part of the ear - I tried to dress three; I tied one up with rag, and two I tried to bandage with strapping - one was very severely wounded indeed, in fact, I advised him to go to a surgeons considering it very dangerous, for I could see the brains through his hair - I consider several of the police were not sober.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR GENERAL. Q. Look at that person,(Redwood) do you recognize him as having been present? I have every reason to believe this is the man; I have every reason to believe he is the man I saw strike the old man and boy - I swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. You do? A. Yes, provided he is the man I saw; but remember it was upwards of two months ago, but to the best of my belief this is the man; I believe him to be the man; it was in Calthorpe-street; I don't know that I saw Brooke there; I have no recollection of him - I only knew of the meeting from the government placard - I don't know the meaning of the word Convention, and went there for information, to see what the thing was likely to be - I was never at such a meeting before.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had been a meeting to put down the King, Lords, and Commons should you have thought it legal? A. Unquestionably not; I should not have attended it to make part or parcel in it; I might have gone from curiosity as I did then - I did not consider there was any meeting at all; I went to witness the nature of it, and to find out the meaning of these words National Convention - I saw death's head and cross bones on one banner, and I believe "Death or Liberty" - I did not read the others; when the banners advanced there was cheering and shouting - there were not a great many persons following the banner men.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not hundreds? A. Oh dear no, when they came the meeting increased about one hundred I should think - I think there were about one thousand on the ground when the banners came, and about one hundred followed them on a rough guess or calculation - I believe there was very few, if any, more than one hundred - they furled the banners when they advanced; they twisted the poles round to furl them, I could not then read the inscription, what with their playing in the wind and their furling them up - I don't know what an American flag is; I believe the one produced was there; I don't know who carried it, and don't know where it was stationed - I remember seeing it coming up; I saw it coming up Calthorpe-street towards the chairman, but not afterwards that I know of; it might have been furled - I saw no policeman stabbed in Calthorpe-street; it might have been done without my seeing it, or two or a dozen might have been stabbed; there might have been such a thing - the policeman who said "Seize that man," was a tall, powerful looking man with full whiskers, and he had a silver collar on his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the banners then by the chairman? A. Yes, as near him as they could get; all four were as near as they could get round him - I don't know how many banners there were; there might have been five or six for what I know; all that I saw stood outside the railing near Calthorpe-street - I saw the prisoner struggling with a banner, but whether it was an American one I cannot say - he was holding it in the road at the very end of Calthorpe-street, and seven or eight policemen were contending with him for it, and beating him, and others trying to force it from him at the same time - while he was struggling there this man, who I believe to be Redwood (on my conscience I saw him) he was about as far as I am from the prisoner when he struck the old man - when Fursey was struggling for the flag, the policeman I believe to be Redwood was about two yards from Fursey, and at that time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040026"></xptr>he knocked down the old man making his way towards where the prisoner and the police were contending for the banner, and he cut down the old man at the time, and the boy immediately after; I did not hear any policeman groan or cry out, Oh - they were struggling with Fursey for the banner about two minutes in Calthorpe-street, at the very end.</p>
               <p>Q. Struggling to get the banner from him? A. Yes, beating him all the time, and the numbers were continually increasing - Fursey had the banner in his hand till they got him down on the ground, then he twirled his hands and feet round, and the police hurled him round and dragged him towards Gray's-inn-road way; they at last got the banner from him, by the second house, about the middle of the street, rather more on the north side; they there got the banner from him - I have not heard Mr. Courtney examined - nothing was said then about a policeman being wounded or stabbed; it was about four or five minutes after this that I saw the man with his arm in a handkerchief - I had not seen that man struggling with Fursey - I had seen him about two yards from Fursey at the time they were contending for the banner; I never saw him nearer than that; he might have gone nearer because after knocking the boy down he rushed past, and might have gone nearer - I lost sight of him among the rest of the police; I kept sight of Fursey till the banner was taken from him; I don't know what became of him then, for he was completely surrounded by the police, and my attention was drawn by the screams of some women towards the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did many of the police appear to you to be intoxicated? A. Not what I call downright drunk; I don't mean to say they could neither stand nor walk; they could just make a decent sort of a walk of it to conduct themselves - I suppose, I myself saw ten or a dozen who were greatly the worse for liquor, many others seemed partially the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Might the greatest number appear partially the worse for liquor? A. No, I should think about one-fourth; Redwood seemed partially the worse for liquor - from the savage ferocity with which he went to work with his truncheon, and the apparently excited state of his feelings; and he nearly tumbled down at one time, when he was striking the old man, I imagine he was partially drunk - others were considerably more intoxicated than him; I did not see them take any liquor.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you were not in their company in the public-house? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said a dozen men might be stabbed in Calthorpe-street without your observing it? A. It is possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there considerable riot and outrage all through the street? A. The people laid down prostrate in all directions; they fell down to the ground bleeding - I expected to find several dead myself, from the manner in which they bled.</p>
               <p>Q. How many in your observation might be tumbled down from the blows of the police, is it too much to say twenty? A. I hardly think twenty in Calthorpe-street alone - the greatest part was at the further end, I should imagine about a dozen were knocked down.</p>

               <p>Q. You have described a struggling for a banner, you do not know whether this is the one or not - was it such a struggling as might have smashed the pole of it? A. I wonder it stood it half so long - the manner of the policeman which I suppose to be Redwood, in rushing past the old man and boy was extremely violent, most outrageous violence; he struck every body who came in his way - when I lost sight of him he was cutting right and left - I had not the slightest concern with the meeting.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw the banner taken from the prisoner - what became of him afterwards? A. He was so surrounded, and my attention being taken by the screams of some women I don't know what became of him; I did not see him afterwards till to-day.</p>
               <p>A JUROR. Q. How near was you to the prisoner when the struggle took place about the banner? A. I should think a little further than I am from you, Sir, about half as much again (about ten yards).</p>

            . I keep an oil-shop, and live at No. 38, Upper North-place, Grays-inn-road. On the 13th of May, I was at my shop-door, about one o'clock; my house is next door to the Calthorpe Arms - a little after one o'clock, I saw bodies of the police advancing - one party went to Mr. Burbridge's stables, and the other to Dawson's - I was standing at my shop door, and saw them go in - I went into the Calthorpe Arms to get my family their beer, and saw some of them there - I afterward saw some persons come with flags, they went towards Calthorpe-street; that was before the policemen came out of the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. While these persons were advancing towards the fields was there any disturbance? A. I did not see any- there was no violence used - there were a few policemen there then straggling about.</p>
               <p>Q. They did nothing? A. No, they did nothing but eat and drink at the public house - I should think it was not above five minutes after the procession came that I saw the police marched from Dawson's - I could not so well see them from Burbridge's - they took the same direction as the procession with the flags had taken - as they passed my house they all turned up their coat sleeves, spat upon their hands, and grasped the leather of their truncheons round their wrists, and they appeared in an agitated state, grasping their truncheons firmly - and marched at a quick pace into Calthorpe-street - I know Baker the inspector by sight; I saw him, he had his staff in his hand moving it in this manner, (waving it,) leading his men on - I did not go from my door; I cannot see down Calthorpe-street; I only saw into Gray's-inn-road - when Baker moved his staff, his men advanced with their staves in their hands; they seemed to look pale and agitated; I did not see them do anything - I saw several persons with their heads cut; I saw a man about fifty years old; I saw several people knocked about by the police, by my door on the curb stone; I saw one woman very much hurt, and I saw one boy from ten to twelve years old; these persons had done nothing, nor given any offence to the police, they were very quiet and inoffensive - I saw the people trying to get out of the way of the police but they could not, if they got out of the way of one party, another fell in with them, and then they knocked them about; I saw a policeman throw his truncheon after one man down the road, it was two policemen pursuing one man or two men, they could not catch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040027"></xptr>him, and threw a truncheon at him - I took five or six women into my shop who were endeavouring to escape, two of them had children in their arms, and two or three young men - I cannot say whether my neighbours did the same, but I saw them standing at their doors - I saw Baker produce a dagger, there was a sheath to it - it was the same sort as the one produced - I cannot swear to it - he stated where he got it from.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR GENERAL. Q. Did you see any person struck in Calthorpe-street? A. No; I was never in the street at all, and do not know what took place there.</p>

            . I live in Penlington-place, Lambeth, and am one of the editors of an evening paper, I went to the Calthorpe-street ground, on the day of this meeting - I got to the ground about a quarter before one o'clock; at this time I should think there were scattered over the ground about three or four hundred persons - (I frequently cross the ground; it is a place of resort for idle boys and children to play) - there was no indication of a meeting being held there; I went, understanding one was to be held - as I went there I passed several bodies of the police who were going to the meeting - I continued on the ground till the persons who subsequently commenced the proceedings of the meeting arrived.</p>
               <p>Q. You passed several bodies of police apparently moving towards the ground, did you see those police afterwards approach the ground? A. I saw bodies of police; at that time the persons assembled were perfectly peaceable - I was standing on the ground when the persons bearing the banners moved down the street; and in consequence of the influx of persons at that time, I requested permission to go into the balcony of Mr. Stallwood's house - I got into the balcony, which commands an extensive view of the place - about the time I had got in the balcony I found the police drawn across the ends of Calthorpe-street, and across Gough-street, which runs directly across Calthorpe-street; and immediately afterward I heard orders given to the police who were drawn up at the end of Calthorpe-street to move forward - they occupied nearly the breadth of the street; they moved on, the persons falling back to allow them to go on; and as they went on the crowd was denser, and as soon as they were obstructed in their progress by the persons who were quietly standing in the crowd, they immediately began to use, their staves.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that the obstruction was caused by the denseness of the crowd, or did the crowd attempt to strike them at all? A. Certainly not; all the people who could move on one side had done so; but when they got farther the crowd was so dense, it was impossible for them to do so, and then the police began to strike them with their truncheons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they seem to you to care where they hit, whether it was in the face, or head - did they seem to you to care where they aimed? A. I saw the truncheons being used in every possible direction - scores of them flying about in every possible direction - the body of the crowd were generally men, but towards the sides of the street, on the pavement, I observed several females, who could not move, as the police had crossed the other side of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. The females, from the pressure of the police could not move backward or forward? A. On one side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear anxious to get away? A. No; I saw no movement; they did not move - when this indisoriminate striking took place the inhabitants cried, Shame, shame - I joined in the cry myself; and two or three gentlemen in the balcony, and some ladies, were crying out, Shame - Mr. Courtney was there; there were the same cries from various other houses - I was induced to cry Shame, from seeing the people surrounded by the police, and their retreat being rendered impossible - I thought it a most barbarous thing for this armed body of men to commence an attack on this unarmed and unoffending people - I saw several persons knocked down, and saw them struck on the head when they were down - this was after the crowd had dispersed; they were struck by the police with their truncheons - immediately under me I saw a crowd of persons who had got into a little area, apparently out of the way of the police - I saw policemen, in bodies of three or four, come from the ground where they had been dispersing the people, and going up to the persons standing in the doorways; I saw them lay hold of two or three gentlemen by the collar, and thrust them away - those gentlemen were standing quietly, and appeared to turn round to remonstrate with the police, and they were struck in this way - while I stood on the balcony I saw two females crossing the waste ground, coming in a direction for Calthorpe-street; I saw them surrounded by four or five policemen - this was at the identical period of the attack.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you saw the flags marching up to the van was it that you saw this uproar and outrage committed in Calthorpe-street? A. Three or four minutes; it was almost directly; certainly not more than five minutes; I had just time to get on the balcony - I did not in the whole course of the outrage, see any stones or brickbats thrown - I saw nothing whatever in the conduct or demeanour of the people to provoke the outrage on the part of the police.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL. Q. Did you know of the intended meeting before you went on the ground? A. Yes, it was my knowledge of it took me there - I saw it stated as the intention of the meeting to establish a national convention - I saw it in various publications, and advertisements and bills I think - it was notorious I believe; Mr. Stallwood's is a corner house; one face of it is towards Calthorpe-street, and the other towards Gough-street - the balcony is in Gough-street, and the end of it is in Calthorpe-street - I had the range of the balcony; the party came up with the banners before I went into the house - there was a general shout raised when they came; I noticed the banner with death's head and cross bones, and liberty or death, or something of that kind on it - the people with the banners stationed themselves on this side the railing in which closes the waste ground; I took very little notice of the banners - I saw a struggle for a banner which I believe was a striped one, but cannot say it was this, it was at the end of Calthorpe-street, soon after the attack was commenced by the police on the people - I did not hear of the policeman being stabbed; it could not be above a minute and a half from the first attack to that struggle - I did not hear of a policeman being stabbed till I returned to the office - I saw the struggle myself; I did not see the banner actually taken - a policeman might be stabbed and I not have seen it - I am editor of the "True Sun."</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You saw the struggle for the ban<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040028"></xptr>ner, about how many policemen did you see surrounding the man? A. There was a large body of police, I should think ten or more surrounded him - I cannot say whether they had truncheons; they were exceedingly violent; they had got hold of the pole of the banner - I suppose the man who held it, was trying to retain it; but I did not see the man; he appeared to be doing his best to prevent them getting it - there was a violent struggle for a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. So as to cause the use of both his hands? A. Yes. I have said I did not see the person who held the banner - I should suppose, certainly, that he was doing his very utmost to retain it. I went to the meeting to see the proceedings, and give an account of it in our paper, as all our reporters were down at the House of Commons.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, Bolton-place, Margaret-street, Spa-fields; and am a surgical instrument maker. On the 13th of May, I got to Calthorpe-street about half-past two o'clock, as near as I can guess, I did not see any watch or clock. I had come from Berner's-street, Oxford-street, and was standing in the field - I was there before the chair was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Up to the time that the chair was taken, was any disturbance offered by the people? A. Not any; the police had not come on the ground - I saw the police advance, it was after three o'clock - I could not see all the avenues leading to the field, on account of the crowd - I did see the Calthorpe-street avenue distinctly - I saw a very large body of them come up Calthorpe-street; they walked very steadily and very firm within a few yards of the speaker at the end of Gough-street - they were not molested or interfered with by anybody; the crowd in Calthorpe-street opened on each side for them, and offered them no violence; a space was opened for them to get up to where the chairman was - I both saw them use their truncheons, and had them used on myself; the few banners which were there, were near the chairman - I cannot tell how many there were, they were furled.</p>

               <p>Q. Were any of the bearers of the banners using any gestures with them, or doing anything offensive at all? A. Not at all; up to the time the police began to use their truncheons, they had received no offence or injury from anybody - I was in the middle of Gough-street - I parted on one side with part of the crowd to let them pass up to the chair - this was a little after three o'clock; the moment this was done, the police raised their truncheons - they had them laying on their arms ready for action, holding them in their right hand, and laying them on their left arms - they fell upon the people without giving them any warning, and knocked them down just as they came indiscriminately.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they knocked them down, did they require them to disperse, or say any thing? A. Not one word; I received a blow at the corner of my left eye; there is the scar now - I had done nothing either by word or deed to provoke that blow - I could not recognize who it was given by, but it was a policeman; it knocked me down and drew blood; I bled a great deal - six or eight fell on me while I was down on the ground, and beat me most unmercifully - they were all policemen; this was as they were advancing towards the chairman, before the struggle for the flag. I was one of the first they struck - I was struck on my arm and shoulder; I was on my left hand and knee endeavouring to get up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this while you were bleeding at the head? A. Yes; I was so muchinjured, I could not work for a fortnight - they ran from me to fall on a man and boy, and knocked them down. I then arose and made my escape - on my road home I overtook 
               <persName id="t18330704-5-person182">
                  Charles

            , he came up to me in the field near Bagnigge-wells by the side of the prison wall and said something to me; the field was full of policemen then; Wheeler and I walked to the end of Margaret-street, there were three policemen there, and one of them knocked him down - this was about a quarter of an hour after I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you drawn to the spot by having seen a placard or bill? A. No, I had not seen any; I was coming home; I had been out on business - I saw the flag bearers march up to the place where the chairman was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say they came quite peaceably, and no crowd after them, no hooting and hallooing at all? A. Not any, every body was perfectly silent; the people might have spoken, but they did not shout nor cheer - the flags were unfurled when they came up, and were furled after they took their standing; I did not take notice, and don't know what was on the flags; I did not notice any with stripes and stars on them - there was a noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that the flags coming up brought people with them? A. People who brought the flags of course - I don't know whether the other people followed the flags, or whether they came by accident - I cannot calculate how many came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there ten or fifteen? A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there fourteen or fifteen hundred? A. I cannot say, I cannot pass an opinion - they were quite quiet and peaceable - I could see down Calthorpe-street - I did not see the policeman stabbed, nor see him after he was stabbed; I saw nothing about it; I heard of it at near night, when I was standing at the end of Bolton-place, and Margaret-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, considering your bad eye, you were out very soon? A. Yes, but people after severe bruises don't feel the effects so bad till next morning; I felt it more a week after than I did at the time; I had my eye dressed by a surgeon - I work for the trade, I receive no weekly wages, but take jobs from surgical instrument makers, and make them according to their directions - I was examined before the coroner the last day of the inquest; I forget how long that was after I received the wound, it was more than three days.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you exhibit before the coroner the injuries you had received in the temple and otherwise? A. Yes - Bolton-place is only a few yards from my house, it is a little, short court.</p>
               <p>Q. From the commencement of the uproar to the conclusion, did you see any thing on the part of the people to warrant the attack which was made on them? A. Not any.</p>

            . I am a professor of music, and live at No. 30, Rawstorne-street, Clerkenwell. I had to go to Mr. Duffs, a string maker in Gray's Inn-lane, and passed through the Calthorpe estate ground, as well as I can recollect, at near three o'clock, every thing was then most remarkably peaceable - as I returned, I entered the ground again from Calthorpe-street, and in endeavouring to pass out at the Bagnigge-wells-road, I saw a quantity of policemen.</p>

             re-examined. When I went into Calthorpe-street I was quite sober; I was not in liquor at all - a man had come into the stable with some porter, and two friends of mine of the F division were there; I purchased a pot of porter of the man; we had a pot among four of us, I only drank once, and did not drink half a pint - I had drank no other strong drink that day, neither beer nor spirits; I had drank nothing more at the time I was struck - the men of my division were perfectly sober for what I saw of them - I saw none of them at all the worse for liquor - I never raised my truncheon to any body till after I was stabbed.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you in health and strength enough to strike people after you was struck? A. I only struck one blow, and that was at Fursey.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you persist in swearing that none of your fellow-policemen struck other people in Calthorpe-street? A. I cannot answer for their conduct; I saw none strike while I was with them - I did not mention before the Coroner or magistrate, that I gave Fursey a blow after I was struck myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Although not tipsy, were not you rather excited by the scene, or anxiety of promoting and distinguishing yourself? A. Not at all; I was quite cool, as I am now, and I went up to Fursey in a cool manner.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, did not many of the police strike before you struck Fursey in Calthorpe-street? A. Not that I saw - I heard no cries at all - I did not go more than half way up the street - I never went into Gough-street - Coldbath-fields prison is before you when in Calthorpe-street; Gough-street crosses Calthorpe-street, but I know nothing of the road; I never was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear the distance from the entrance of Calthorpe-street is more than sixty yards from the railing which separates it from the ground? A. I cannot say what distance it is; I am not acquainted with the distance- I was in the street, and saw the railing - I entered from Gray's Inn-lane - I suppose it may be about sixty yards - there was shouts from the mob, but my attention was on apprehending the prisoner - I heard cries of the mob hooting; I heard no cries of Shame - I did not see Mr. Stallwood - I saw no one struck while I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the banners went up did you go up Calthorpe-street? A. That was the only banner that came into Calthorpe-street - when I was taking the colour from Fursey, there was about four or five of us about him; we were pulling at the colour, and he had hold of it; he had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Only one hand? A. He had them in his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had two hands holding the colour? A. For what I know he had - he had his hands to the flag-staff - he had nothing in his hand at that time that I saw, but the flag-staff.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL. Q. He had the staff in his hand, when was that? A. I saw him come from the right to the left out of Calthorpe-street, he came on from about the middle of Calthorpe-street to the left - I advanced out from my rank, and demanded the colour from him; he refused to give it up - I then told him I should take the colour from him; I accordingly seized the colour with both hands- I saw him raise his right hand with an instrument in it about six or eight inches long.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he held the flag-staff with both hands? A. That was on the right hand side, as we were going out of Gray's-inn-road up to Calthorpe-street - it was on the right hand side of the street that he had hold of the flag with both hands, but that was after I was stabbed; I was stabbed on the opposite side.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he hold of the flag in both his hands before you was stabbed? A. No, only in his left hand; his right hand was down in this manner (straight down at his side) before I was stabbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the flag been got from him before you were stabbed? A. Not that I saw - after I had struck him he ran into the ranks, and he still had the flag in his left hand, and he still had the instrument in his hand when he ran into the ranks.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw him holding the flag with both hands? A. After I had got hold of him, and got him over to the right, that was at the time I gave him into the custody of two officers; I had hold of him then with my right hand by the left collar; it was then there was a struggle with him, and four or five round him.</p>
               <p>JUROR. Q. I think you said there were four or five constables round the man after he had the flag-staff in both hands, was you one of the four or five that were endeavouring to take it from him? A. I was one; I never lost sight of him after taking him by the collar?</p>
               <p>Q. How could he go into the ranks? A. I had got hold of him, and went in with him.</p>
               <p>The following is a Copy of the Proclamation.</p>
               <p>Whereas printed papers have been posted up and distributed in various parts of the metropolis, advertising that a public meeting will be held in Coldbath-fields, on Monday next, May the 13th, to adopt preparatory measures for holding a National Convention, as the only means of obtaining and securing the rights of the people: and, whereas a public meeting holden for such a purpose, is dangerous to the public peace and illegal, all classes of his Majesty's subjects are hereby warned not to attend any such meeting, nor to take any part in the proceedings thereof. And notice is hereby given, that the civil authorities have strict orders to maintain and secure the public peace; and to apprehend any persons offending herein, that they may be dealt with according to law.

               <p>Q.Who dragged it out? - A.The prisoner; I immediately seized him, and said, you villain, you have taken my watch; there was another man close to him; he kept hustling me, but I kept hold of him; he hustled me three doors below my own house; my wife came out, and said, she saw the chain of my watch hanging out of his hand; the watch was found in the area of No. 6, three doors from my house.</p>

               <p>MARY RYAN sworn. - I saw my husband have hold of a man, and I heard him drop the watch down the area; I saw the chain in his hand; I got the watch, and delivered it to the watchman.</p>

               <p> - PIPPIN sworn. - I heard a great noise; I went out, and Mrs. Ryan desired me to fetch her husband's watch out of my area; I picked it up, and gave it to her.(Jeremiab Obrien, a watchman, produced the watch, which was identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. Ryan was along with a man of very bad character, and somebody shoved me up against him, and then he said I had taken his watch. <rs id="t18030706-13-verdict68" type="verdictDescription">

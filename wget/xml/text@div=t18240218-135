            . I was in the back parlour, and saw the prisoner come into the shop and take this coat down - throw it over his arm, and run away with it - I ran out and saw him nearly five yards off - overtook him; but he had then thrown it down - I picked it up about twenty yards from where I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You lost sight of him, did not you - A. No; I saw nobody else running; he was walking,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180063"></xptr>with his hands in his pocket when I took him. I only lost sight of him in turning the corner, by the Sessions-house Court.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took him, could you see the coat - A. No; my Lord, it was dark and he had turned the corner. I speak to him by his dress, and not his features - he ran across the road and then walked - he was three or four yards off when he turned the corner, and when I turned he was about the same distance.</p>

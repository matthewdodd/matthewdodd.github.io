                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's daughter, and am 11 years old—I lived with my father and mother at 13, Eton Street—on 10th July, from 3 to half-past, my father was cutting bread and butter for me in a washhouse near the kitchen; my brother came in, and my father said "Have you been looking after work?"—he said "No, you are better able to work than I am"—father said "I am not; will you have some bread-and-butter?"—he said "I want something better than bread-and-butter"—father said "I have nothing else"—then my brother used bad language to my father, and struck him in the chest, and I ran to the washhouse.</p>

I also live at 13, Eton Street—the washhouse is at the back of the kitchen occupied by the prisoner—on 10th July, about 3 o'clock, I was in the washhouse, and heard quarrelling in the kitchen—the last witness ran in to me, and said "Oh, Miss Ellis, my father and George are quarrelling!"—George was the prisoner's son—while she was speaking George ran upstairs—I ran after him soon afterwards, and saw him in the street lying on the ground—he was brought into the passage by the police, and some brandy was given to him—the prisoner came into the passage, but they did not speak to each other—a doctor came.</p>

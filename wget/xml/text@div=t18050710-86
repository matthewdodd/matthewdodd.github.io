               <p>- COLSTOCK sworn. - I live at the milliner's shop next door: On the 11th of June, a woman came into the shop, I did not see her face; she stooped down, and went out; she enquired the price of some of the articles in the window; I did not give her any answer; I got up, and a little further in the shop from where I sat, I saw a pair of shoes lying on the floor; I went to the next door to enquire if they had lost any, and if they had, to come in for them. (The shoes produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her Counsel, and called five witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

On the 28th of July the prisoner came and asked me for something for his neck - I said I would serve him directly; he went up higher in the shop - I saw him shuffling something under his coat, and I thought I saw something bulky under it; he then went out; I went out and collared him, took him into the shop, and he dropped eight handkerchiefs from under his coat, which were my master's; I detained him till the constable came - I had seen Mrs. Pike take these articles down from a shelf, to shew a customer, about twelve o'clock.</p>

            . I took charge of the prisoner and the handkerchiefs; I had known him some time - he has been a watchman in St. George's parish, and afterwards a patrol in St. James's parish; he had a good character, but was rather given to drink.</p>

He did say he had 1s. taken from him, but I do not believe it; he made a rush out of the shop, and tore Mrs. Pike's bonnet off - I think he was a little in liquor; he pulled some new books out of his pocket while he sat in a chair - he was very violent, and said he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100015"></xptr>strike the first man that came near him; a butcher came in and tied his hands.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, of 19, Earl's Court, Kensington—on 22nd May, about 11.30 p.m., the prisoners came in, and Crazzy asked for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of fish; he gave me a florin—I put it in the till where there was no other florin, and gave him his change—they ate the fish and left together—Tyson came back in two or three minutes and asked for a pennyworth of fish; he gave me a shilling—I told him it was bad, and he had better break it and throw the pieces away—he broke it and gave me a good one—I afterwards got one of the pieces—three or four minutes after he left I found a bad florin in the till, the only one there—I gave information, and after wards saw the prisoners in custody at the station—I told them they had given me a bad florin—Cazzy said "I did not give it to you"—I gave the florin and the pieces of that shilling to the constable.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman T R</hi> 27). On 22nd May, in consequence of what I heard from Joseph How, I searched and found the prisoners drinking in the Civet Cat—they came outside, and I saw Cazzy pass something to Tyson, who put it in his left hand trousers pocket—I went and got another constable—we went into the Civet Cat, and the prisoners had returned there—I told them the charge; they made no reply—on the way to the station Cazzy had a packet in his hand, which he attempted to put down an area; he afterwards threw it on to the roof of a stable—I saw another con<lb></lb>stable go up a ladder and get it—it was opened at the station, and con<lb></lb>tained thirteen florins and thirteen shillings in separate packets, eights florins in tissue paper, another packet with five florins and one shilling, and another packet of ten shillings, also two shillings tied up in the corner of a handkerchief—I found in Tyson's left pocket one half-crown, two shillings, five sixpences, a threepennypiece, and elevenpence halfpenny in bronze, all good—I produce the bad money, also this bad florin and piece of a bad shilling, which I received from Mr. How.</p>

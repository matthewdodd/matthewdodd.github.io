                  </hi>. I am a broker, in the City of London, and live at Wellington-chambers, London-wall. On Tuesday, 15th March, I had been to the warehouse of Mr. Penson, No. 43, Newgate-street—I had my pocket book out while I was in the warehouse, and I presume I put it in the inside pocket of my coat; that was my usual place of putting it; I am almost certain I put it there, but I may not have put it properly in—I then buttoned up my coat, and went towards Cheapside, on the right hand side of the street—I then went to post a letter, which I had forgotten to do at the West end; opened my pocket to pay for the letter, as it had no stamp on it—I did not take the letter from the same pocket where I had put my pocket book—after posting the letter, and leaving the Post-office, when I had got just close to Goldsmiths'-hall, I felt that my pocket book was gone—it contained three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes, several papers, and five or six cards, with my name and address on them—I have never seen my property since—I had not the numbers of the notes at the time, but I recollected where I got them, at Messrs. Herries, the bankers—I stopped them at the Bank, but they were paid in through a banker's, and therefore the Bank of England was bound to pay them; they have all been traced—it was about o'clock in the morning when I lost my pocket book.</p>

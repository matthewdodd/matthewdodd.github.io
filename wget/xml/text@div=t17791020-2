               <p>How long have you lived there? - Upwards of six months; she lived there, I believe, about two months, or not quite so long. Two large table-spoons, and two tea-spoons, were missed. The prisoner went to town the first of October. On the Sunday was a week, before that I missed the spoons, she continued in the family till the first of October. She went out, under pretence of going to Lord Milton's, and she went quite away.</p>
               <p>Was her wages paid? - No.</p>
               <p>Did she carry her clothes with her? - No; my master came on the Monday, and said she was taken up by a pawnbroker in town, and was in custody. I saw the spoons afterwards at the Rotation-office. I can swear they are my master's property.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker in Berwick-street, Soho. A washerwoman first came to my house with these spoons, as I am informed. My young man desired that the person who owned the spoons should come herself. The prisoner then came with these spoons herself, and said they were a Mrs. Watson's; she said her mistress was that morning going out of town in a post chaise; that she had no money; that she gave her these four spoons to pawn or sell; that when she got the money she was to follow her mistress into the country in the ten o'clock stage.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning might this be? - About nine o'clock, on Saturday the second of October. I told her I did not believe the story to be true; that I would send to the house where she said this Mrs. Watson was a lodger, to enquire the truth of it; but that I must detain her and the spoons till I had an answer; she was very eager to go along with the person that should be sent, but I told her no, she must stay; she then said they did not come from that person; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177910200005"></xptr> said then that she lived at Weyhill, and that she took them there, being in distress and want of money.</p>
               <p>To Bradford. Is that the place Mr. Watts lives at? - No.</p>

               <p>Cordy. I took her immediately to the Rotation-office; in searching her pocket I found a letter directed to her at Mr. Watts's; then she confessed she took them from Mr. Watts's.</p>
               <p>To Bradford. She went from your master's house, you said, on the first of October? - Yes, in the morning.</p>
               <p>How far is that from town? - Twenty-four miles; I went to Egham with a lady who was at our house; I met the prisoner walking across the forest.</p>

               <p>Mr. Cordy brought the prisoner, and the spoons, to the Rotation-office; what things I had of the prisoner belonging to Mr. Watts I have delivered to Mr. Watts. I know nothing more of the matter. When Mr. Watts was in town he promised to send a letter to your lordship to recommend her (he is gone lower down into the country) as he said she behaved well in his service. There is another gentleman that she lived with a year and a half, who is gone out of town.</p>
               <p>To Cordy. Are these the spoons the prisoner brought to you to pawn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you show these spoons to the first witness at the Rotation-office? - Yes; I have had them in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>To Bradford. What became of her clothes? - She has had them restored to her.</p>
               <p>Grxbb. Mr. Watts paid her eighteen shillings wages, at the office; and ordered me to allow her something a week, as she came of very good parents.</p>

               <p>I was very much in distress; I therefore pledged them, and thought before my master came to town I would take them out, and replace them again.</p>

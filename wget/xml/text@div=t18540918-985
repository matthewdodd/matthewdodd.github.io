                  </hi>. I am the son of Thomas Shackle; he is a brewer and maltster, at Uxbridge. On 28th Aug. I went to the premises of Duval—the brewhouse adjoins a garden belonging to the brewhouse—Duval is a cooper, and has a shop in Attwell's yard—a side door of the brewery opens into Attwell's yard—that leads into the brewhouse—you cannot get into the counting house without a key—the door of the brewhouse is twenty or thirty yards from Duval's workshops, on the same side of the yard—I was certain that I had lost a great deal of property, and on 28th Aug. I had a ladder put up to the wall—I looked over, and there I saw a quantity of my father's property in Duval's premises—there was a hen house built of what I considered our property, and three boards I could swear to—I called a policeman, and went into Duval's workshop—I told him that those boards belonged to us; that I believed all of them did, but those I could swear to;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180019"></xptr>
               <p>and I said, "I shall give you into custody, without you can tell me where you had them from"—he said that <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Ransley, who had just left us, had brought them in, and put them up—Ransley had been in our service, as a stoker—we had dismissed him on 7th Aug.—it was Ransley's duty to come to the brewhouse at 2 or 3 o'clock in, the morning, and light the fires—the servants came generally about half past 6 o'clock—my uncle generally went up to the brewhouse, for ten minutes, about 4 o'clock, and then went back to bed—the premises would be in Ransley's charge from 3 o'clock till about half past 6—these are the boards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were the bottom of an old beer cooler—we have brought one from the premises to compare with them—I can swear to them by these marks all across—they are parti<lb></lb>cular boards; you would not find any like them—they have been in use these forty or fifty years—Duval knew that Ransley was in our service—this is the hen box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we found that in a little yard—it belongs to my father—it was made to fit into a place—we took Ransley into custody that same day—on the 29th we got a search warrant, and went again to Duval's premises—we then found these three hop pockets in his warehouse—they are my father's—I know them by the marks, and I have the invoice of them—I also found sixteen and a half bushels of malt, and 8 lbs. 6 oz. of hops, in flour barrels, headed up, in the same warehouse; I mean that the heads of the casks were put in—I have missed malt and hops for a long time, and some of my father's hop pockets—I cannot swear to the malt and hops—I found some tiles, I think 192—they were found on the top of the hen house—the hen house had been recently put up—we had lost some tiles—I should not like to swear to the tiles; I believe they belong to my father—we missed tiles of that description—they are of a peculiar make—I missed a few slates—I found some on the top of the hen house—there was one row—I did not count them—I saw them on the 28th—I told Duval that they belonged to my father—I said I believed that the materials of the whole hen house belonged to us, but the boards I could swear to, and the hen's nest—it was after finding those things that we took him into custody, directly we had found the malt—we then found the thermometer—I said, "That belongs to me"—he said, "Yes, it does belong to Mr. Shackle"—we found that in his warehouse—I have examined the character and colour of the malt, and also my father's bulk of malt—I have samples of both here—in my judgment, they correspond exactly—one of these hop pockets I had not seen for some time; the others I must have seen more recently, because the hops were only grown last year in two of them—we suppose that they went away full—I cannot say to a month or two when they had been last on my father's premises—on that same Tuesday I went to Duval's dwelling house, on Uxbridge-moor—it is more than a mile from his warehouse—I there found eight casks, and seven we found in the warehouse—we have a sample of them here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I cannot say whether this was found at the house or the warehouse—they were all put together when they were found—it is one of my father's casks—four of the fifteen casks I can speak to distinctly; there is a brand mark on them—I have the particulars of them—I got it from my books—my books are not here—the casks had been out, and came home, and they were missed off our premises, one of them a year or so ago, but the others very lately, some time in the beginning of the summer.</p>

I was called in to assist Mr. John Shackle, in examining Duval's premises on the 28th Aug.: I found a piece of plank which Mr. John Shackle identified—he also pointed out the hen box, and the tiles and slate he said he believed to be his—Duval was present at that time, and he said that he had the things of Ransley—he said that of all the things—on the 29th I got a warrant and went there again with Roadknight—I then found some malt in tubs, I cannot say how many—I was not present when the whole were found; Mr. John Shackle claimed some of them, he particularized them—Duval had then gone to the station; Roadknight had found some of the tubs and some malt before Duval was taken to the station, but they were not identified before he was taken away—I apprehended Ransley on Monday, the 28th—I told him that Mr. Shackle, and likewise myself, had been and identified some boards and tiles, and slate, and the hen box in Duval's yard—he said he knew nothing about it—I told him that Duval had said he had them of him—he said he knew nothing of it—that was all he said that day—he had lately moved from Uxbridge to Harefield which is near to Uxbridge, and there I apprehended him—he had left Mr. Shackle some time previous to his going to Harefield—I saw him again on the Tuesday, before the bench of Magistrates at Uxbridge, at the time he was under examination—he said something to me after his examination—I did not make him any threat or promise—I con<lb></lb>veyed him to the House of Detention on a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> from Uxbridge, and going along he commenced a conversation respecting the robbery—I told him I did not particularly want to hear it, but if he did say anything I should notice it—he said that he in the first instance assisted Duval to a lock on purpose to get a key made, to give access to Mr. Shackle's premises—he said it was a brass lock—he did not say what it belonged to—the lock of the side door that goes into Attwell's yard, is not a brass lock—he said that the agreement between him and Duval was, that he was to receive 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per week, on purpose to give Duval access to Mr. Shackle's premises—he said that he had seen Duval remove things at various times, and that he had left Mr. Shackle's because he should not be found out.</p>

I went, in company with Mr. John Shackle, to search the house and premises of Duval—when I went up the yard, Duval was standing there—I told him I had got a search warrant to search his premises—he took the key out of his pocket, and undid the warehouse door—I went with Mr. Shackle through his warehouse into a little workshop, in a little yard, at the back of the warehouse, and in his workshop I found this thermometer—MR. Shackle said, "That is ours"—Duval said, "Yes, that is yours, Mr. Shackle"—in a flour tub, in the same place, I found about a bushel of malt—I said, "This is malt; how do you account for this?"—he said, "It is for my fowls"—that answer did not satisfy me, and I said, "You must now consider yourself in custody"—I then went into the warehouse with Mr. Shackle—I found seven flour tubs headed down; they were about three bushel tubs; some were full and some not—the heads of the tubs were fixed in—one head was taken out, and I said, "This is also malt"—that was full of malt—I said, "Here are six more; do they contain malt?"—Duval said, "They do"—in another flour barrel I found about eight lbs. of hope; that was not one of the seven tubs, but a separate one—I did not at that time proceed to ascer<lb></lb>tain whether or not the other six tubs did contain malt—I did afterwards—there were sixteen bushels and a half altogether—nothing was said about the hops; he gave me no account of anything—as I found these things, Mr. Shackle claimed them, and I took them all into my possession—the seven casks had the numbers upon them—the names had been chopped out of them all—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were all cut in this way—the other casks of Mr. Shackle are marked "J. Shackle, Uxbridge," in the place where these are chopped—Mr. Shackle claimed these—I then took Duval into custody, and sent him by Beaman to the station—I then went with Mr. Shackle to the dwelling-house of Duval, at Uxbridge Moor—I searched the house, and found eight more brewer's casks, also with the brand mark chopped off and the numbers remaining—they were claimed by Mr.</p>

               <p>Shackle—on Wednesday, 30th Aug., I went to Howard's house, at Cowley, about a mile and a half from Uxbridge—he was not at home, but I met him in the road—he has been in the employment of a gentleman there for twenty-nine years, I believe, and I have known him fifteen years—I know the other two prisoners—I have seen them and Howard together—I said to Howard, "<hi rend="italic">Ben</hi>, you know Duval and Ransley are in custody, and I have been told you have been removing some of the things away from Duval's place down to his house"—he said he had moved nothing away but three flour tubs, and those I might go to his (Howard's) house and see, if I liked—we were a very short distance from his house at the time; I had just come from it—I went back with him to see the tubs, and there were three fowls feeding in the yard—I tasted one of the corns, and said, "This is malt"—he said, "No it is not, it is barley; my wife bought it at White's"—that is a person who keeps a corn shop in the neighbourhood, who sells barley—I then went into the house, and in the kitchen I found about a pottle of malt in a tub—I said, "Now this is malt, Howard; don't get yourself into trouble for other people"—he said, "It was Duval gave it me for my fowls"—I said, "You were seen up in Shackle's yard the other morning, moving some things away from Duval's shed"—he said, "I moved away three small brewer's casks empty, and something in some bags, which he told me was chips; I do not know what they contained"—he said he had taken them to Duval's house—the three flour casks that I found at Howard's were not Mr. Shackle's; they belong to Duval, who is a cooper, and makes tubs for a mustard factory—all I found in his house was this small quantity of malt—on the following Monday, 4th Sept., I brought Ransley from the House of Detention—I took him to my house to give him something to eat, and to change his shirt—the inspector was there—I had previously received a letter from him—I said nothing to induce him to make any statement, nor did I begin the conversation—he said, "I am very glad I have got away from Mr. Shackle's; I have been very uneasy in my mind for some time; Duval would never leave me alone; on Friday week Duval called me up at 4 o'clock in the morning; I got up and got over the wall into Mr. Shackle's premises, and let Duval in"—and he said it must have been then that he took away this property that we had found; the rest of the property he said Duval had taken away himself—Ransley seemed very sorry for what he had done—I have known him for some time—this is the letter I received from him while he was in custody—his wife brought it to my house—I do not know his handwriting—he afterwards asked me whether I had received a letter from him—I said I had, and he said he wanted to see me before he went before the Magistrate—he stated at the time that there were others of Mr. Shackle's men that had been robbing him for some time—he mentioned their names, and said, "If you go to such a man's house you will find so and so—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read:</hi> "Sept 18. Sir,—I do not know whether I am asking an impossibility, or not, but as most likely the Justice room will be full on Monday to hear our case, if you can prevent any one but the prisoner's relations being there I think it would be beat, as I shall in my evidence say things that perhaps master would not like every one to know. I am very glad it is found out, for it made me miserable when I knew such things were going on. I should have still been at Mr. Shackle's if it had not been for Duval; it was through him that I left as I did, and through him that I left Uxbridge as soon as I could, for he would not leave off. I should like to see you on Monday morning before we go in, if you can get there. Accept my best respects. I remain, your obedient servant, Benjamin Childe Ransley."</p>

                  </hi>. I am engine man at Mr. Grimsdell's, the mustard maker. About 5 o'clock one morning, about a month ago, I remember seeing a horse and cart go up Attwell's yard, leading to Duval's workshop—it was empty; Howard was driving it-—about twenty minutes afterwards I saw it come down the yard loaded—Howard was driving, and Duval sat on the seat with him—I do not know what day it was—I could not see what it was loaded with—on Friday, 25th Aug., about 5 o'clock in the morning, I was down in my furnace, and saw a man come from Duval's door, which was nine or ten yards off, with a bag or sack on his back—I cannot say who that man was—it was daylight, but from the little place I saw through, I could not tell—I saw William Smith go by the door directly afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the brewhouse of Mr. Shackle. On Friday, 25th Aug., about twenty minutes past 5 o'clock in the morning, I was coming down Attwell's yard, and about twelve yards from the brew-house door I saw Duval—he bid me good morning, and I bid him good morning—he was between the brewhouse and his workshop—he had got a sack on his back, containing about a bushel of something, by what I could see of it.</p>

                  </hi>, Sen. I am the brother of Mr. Thomas Shackle, and assist in the business. I have seen three casks and two firkins; they are my brother's property—I saw them on Duval's premises on 28th Aug.—I also saw the three boards that have been produced; they are my brother's property—they have formed part of an old beer cooler, which was pulled down some years back—Ransley had been stoker to my brother up to about three weeks before this discovery—it was his duty to come to the premises about 3 o'clock in the morning, or soon after, to light the fires, get the liquor hot, and call me at 4 o'clock—I stayed till near 5 o'clock, and the general staff of men came about half-past 6 o'clock—Ransley would be there by himself for two hours at least, or rather more—the door leading into Attwell's yard is always kept locked—I keep the key of the counting house, and the other keys of the premises are kept hanging up in the counting house—I know this thermometer to be my brother's property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter at Uxbridge. On Monday morning, 31st July, I was working at Mr. Grimsdell's mustard mills, which are close to Mr. Shackle's brewhouse—between 5 and 6 o'clock that morning I saw Ransley unlock Mr. Shackle's side door in Attwell's yard, and lock it again</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180024"></xptr>
               <p>—that door led to the open shed—I also saw Duval; they both of them loaded themselves with tiles, took them away, and locked the door—I am not speaking of the door leading into the brewhouse; it is a door that leads to an open shed—they took the tiles partially up the yard—I did not watch where they went to.</p>

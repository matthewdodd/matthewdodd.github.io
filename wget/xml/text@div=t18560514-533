On 15th April I was going from St Paul's down to Farringdon-street, about 10 minutes past 9 o'clock—the prisoner spoke to me, and I walked with her a short distance—my watch was then safe in my pocket—we turned up Wheatsheaf-yard,. she remained talking to me there two or three minutes—a man came up, and she ran away—the man tried to hold me, and began to ask me about some chambers—my suspicions were aroused, I felt for my watch, and found that it was gone—I followed the prisoner, and saw her running on the other side of Farringdon-street—I ran across, took her by the arm, and accused her of taking my watch, and she put it into my hand, but said nothing—a policeman came, and took her—I found the handle of my watch on the ground in the yard—the chain was left behind—the watch is worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Black Prince public-house, Walworth Road, and am seventy-two years old—on 7th January, about 9 o'clock a. m., I was carrying this bag under my coat tail, and was pulling the door open with my left hand, and when I had got it open about 9 inches the prisoner threw a lot of snuff into my eyes—my left eye was blinded and my right eve partially blinded—I held the bag firmly; he gripped his hand down my right arm, caught hold of the bag, and tried to get it—I struggled with him two or three minutes, and when he found he could not get the money he struck me right and left across my forehead, and inflicted three or four wounds—I have had a headache ever since; I have never been well since—he then managed by main force to get the bag from me, and immediately ran off with it—I followed him, and caught him about 60 yards from my own door—I put my hand over his left shoulder to grasp his collar and he gave me a punch in my ribs, which gives me pain still, and knocked me down, grazing my knee, which will make me limp for life—I followed him to the corner of the New Kent Road, and he was stopped by a policeman—I followed—the prisoner retained his hold of the bag, but it was taken from him—it con<lb></lb>tained 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver.</p>

I live at 34, Rockingham Road, Newington—about 9. 15 in the morning of 27th January I saw the prisoner strike the prosecutor on the ribs and on the forehead, and run away with the money; he was stopped by a constable, and the prisoner and the constable both dropped down together in the struggle.</p>

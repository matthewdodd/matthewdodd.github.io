                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to Mr. William Bright, who lives in Whitechapel-road, and is a tailor. On the 26th of Sept., about seven o'clock at night, I was sitting at tea in his shop, and saw a person's hand round a coat, which was on a block between the shop door and the street door—the street door was open—I got up and went to the door—I saw a person taking part of the coat off the block—I did not see his face till he got the coat off the block—I saw his face then—it was the prisoner—he ran away, and dropped</p>

               <p>the coat—I picked it up a few steps off—I pursued and caught the prisoner about four yards from the house—he asked me what I wanted with him—I called, "Police," and my master came and held the prisoner—this is the coat—it is my master's.</p>

I was formerly Inspector of the G division of police—on 27th March I went with other officers to a house, No. 237, Kent-street, about half-past 10 o'clock in the morning—Elliott was there when I arrived, by my direction—I found the door of the house open—I went into the back parlour—I found William Gillard the elder there and Emily Gillard—Bryant and Serjeant Brannan went in with me—they seized Emily Gillard, and another officer seized William Gillard the elder—I proceeded to the front parlour—I found on the ledge these two shillings, which I believe to be counterfeit—while I was there I saw William Gillard junior come to the outside of the window—I ran out—he ran, and I seized him; and another officer came, and we pushed him into the back room, where In<lb></lb>spector Moore received him—when I seized him he pulled his left hand out of his trousers pocket, and opened it and said, "You all see that I have nothing"—at that time his right hand was in his trousers pocket—In<lb></lb>spector Moore received him in the back parlour, where William Gillard senior and Emily Gillard were—the inspector went to search him, and he pulled his right hand from his right hand pocket, and from his hand three shillings dropped, two on a chair and one on the floor—I took up one, which is counterfeit—he said, "So help me, God, I have not had them!"—at that time Inspector Bryant and Brannan were endeavouring to get a purse from</p>

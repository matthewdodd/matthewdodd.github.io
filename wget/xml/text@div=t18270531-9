            . I live in Dove-court, Lombard-street. I saw Coveney with two baskets; he brought the prisoner into Dove-court; what took my attention was, that the prisoner put his head into our window, which was open- Coveney then took one basket to Mr. Traver's in Swithen's-lane, and the prisoner followed him, but immediately returned, took up the other basket and went away - I did not see him again till the 2d of May, when he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the prosecutor in Cheapside, and being a baker, I asked if he knew of any work - I was acquainted with him, and followed him to the place, he left his basket there; I said, "You had better take it into a public-house, and then nobody will take it"- I then went away.</p>

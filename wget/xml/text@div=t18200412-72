On the 17th of February, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I heard a noise in the back parlour - daylight was entirely gone. I entered it, and saw the prisoner run across the room; he made his escape out of the parlour window into the street - mine is a corner-house, and the back parlour window leads into the street as well as the front. I jumped out, and pursued him some distance, knocked him down, and brought him back to the house - he had no property about him. I found my servant in possession of the property. I lost a plated toast-rack, and two silver spoons, worth about 8 s. together; a dark lanthorn was found outside the area railing - I had not moved the property from the side-board. My wife and servant were the only persons in the house.</p>

I am the only servant - I had not thrown them there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single at the present time—I have been mar<lb></lb>ried, but I have lost my husband a long time—I am an unfortunate girl—I lived in Pheasant-court, Gray's inn-lane, for one week, about the middle of Jan.—I had a room—last Saturday night week, about twelve o'clock, I was with two or three others in Gray's-inn-lane, and saw the prisoner—I had never seen him before—he spoke to me first, and it ended in our going home together to my room—he gave me a half-crown before we went home—I paid for a pot of porter out of that, and we took it home with us—he was very drunk—I do not think he knew what he was about—we went to bed—when we had been in bed about three quarters of an hour he got up, and insisted on the trifle he had given me back again—he said, "I shall have my money back again"—I refused, and a scuffle ensued—he took the key out of the door, and I could not get out—he was not in bed when he asked for the money back—he was dressed—he had got up—he was undressed before—it was after he was dressed, and when he was going away that he asked for the money back—he would not give me the key of my door—there happened to be a knife on the table—I suppose he did not know what he was about—he only gave me a slight stab in the neck—it was a white-handled knife—this now produced is it—he said something at the time—I do not know what it was—he was very tipsy—I was undressed—I had got my petticoats on, but not my frock—Mr. Taylor, the head surgeon at the workhouse, dressed the wound, and it has got well now—it bled very much at the time—I threw up the window, and called for a policeman, because I was in the dark—I did not call any thing but "Police"—I have been examined before—I only called "Police"—the policeman came—the prisoner was then sitting down at the side of the bed—the policeman did not see what was done to me—he might have seen the stain on my chemise—I do not know whether he did or not—the prisoner did not get back any of the money—he was taken into custody.</p>

Last Saturday night, about one o'clock, I was on duty in Gray's-inn-lane, and heard a scream of "Murder" from Pheasant-court—I went there, and went up into an apartment, where I found the prisoner sitting on the bed in his shirt-sleeves—he seemed very much agitated, and he charged the prosecutrix with robbing him of a sove<lb></lb>reign—she then turned round, and eharged him with stabbing her with this</p>

               <p>knife—there were three or four other persons in the room before me—one of them had this knife in her hand, and she handed it over to me—I requested the prisoner to dress himself, and come along with me, and the prosecutrix also—as we were going to the station, she said she did not wish to press the charge, and he did not wish to press the charge against her about the sove<lb></lb>reign—I said I could not settle it now, they must go before the inspector—I took the prosecutrix to a surgeon on the Monday morning—when I came into the room I saw that she had a cut on the left side of her neck, and blood was coming from her—I saw the surgeon dress it—it was a very slight cut indeed—there was very little blood from it—the prisoner was drunk.</p>

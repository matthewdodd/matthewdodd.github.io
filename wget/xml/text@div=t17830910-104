               <p>I live with Mr. Greaves, on Monday the 18th of August, about nine in the morning, the prisoner came to my master's shop to buy a pair of shoes, he was fitted, and my master assisted me; then my master quitted the shop and went down stairs, and left me and the prisoner at the bar in the shop; the prisoner said, come with me to Oxendon-street, and I will give you the money, I went with him, when he came to the Black-horse door of Oxendon-street to the public house, he asked me to drink, I said, no, he pulled a little bit of paper out of his pocket, which I understood was a bank note, and said, he must go and get change, I asked him for what, says he, go and get something to drink, and I will go and get change; he had a bit of paper in his hand, he went three doors, I had a suspicion, and went to see, when I came to the corner, he was crossed over the way, I ran after him and lost sight of him, whether he went round James-street, or New-cross-street, or into any house, I cannot say, I saw him no more till he was taken up, his excuse was, he was going to pay for the shoes, on examination he had no money, and was very much confused, and had no excuse at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. But he offered you if you would gave him change to pay you? - Not to me, no, he said he would get change; on examination before the Justice, he confessed to me that it was no note, it was a piece of blank paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You told him it would be better for him to confess? - I told him it would be better for him to have paid for the shoes.</p>
               <p>Had not you seen the prisoner at the shop before? - I might have seen the man there before, I think I have seen the man once in the shop before.</p>
               <p>Did he buy any shoes before? - If he had he paid for them, he never asked for credit or trust.</p>
               <p>When you went with him he told you all along that he would pay you, and desired you to stay till he got change? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I was going about some business to Mark-lane, to enquire for some prize-money, going through Leicester-fields I had the misfortune to break my shoe, I went into Mr. Greaves's, where I had several times been with my wife and children, and had a pair, he advised me to have two pair, and I said one would do, I put them on, and the man went with me to Oxendon-street, I went in hopes to get the money to pay for them, the friend I went to ask for some was gone into the country, and I expected a remittance from Mr. Lloyd, who is an agent at Plymouth, and I went down to Charing-cross, I had no thoughts that the man, as I had frequently used that place, had any suspicion of my defrauding him; I believe two or three days after I was going to Mr. Greaves's to tell him I was going to get the money to pay for them, and he caught me in a violent passion, and would not let me go; I never had the least thoughts of defrauding any body, and I have witnesses here that I believe can prove it.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner called three other Witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, if you are of opinion that the prisoner really did intend in his heart to pay for the shoes, but that he did not like to subject himself to say, I have no money, I am in distress; yet if he bore about in his mind the intention of paying for the shoes, it does not amount to a felony; one circumstance speaks in his favour, which is going to a shop which it is proved he used, for if a man intended to get possession of a pair of shoes in an unlawful way, it is not likely that he should go to a shop he had known, that was a risk too dangerous for the prisoner to run.</p>

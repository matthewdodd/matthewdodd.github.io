               <p>Q. Where was he? - A. He was in the high road; the other two came up, one on the right hand, and the other on the left hand, and took me up upon the foot-path; I asked them what they wanted of me.</p>
               <p>Q. They had not spoke to you? - A. I don't recollect that they had; Condon pulled a pistol out, held it up to me, and said, he wanted my money; he was distressed for money, and money he must have; I said, he should have what little money I had, and welcome; I then put my hand into my pocket to take out what I had, while Condon put his hand over the horse's neck, and felt the watch-chain; the seal was tucked in my pocket; there was only a link or so out; he rugged two or three times, and broke the chain, and put that in his waistcoat-pocket; one of them then desired me to pull the watch our myself, I cannot say which of them it was; I had some difficulty in getting the watch out of a long sob, and Duggan said, shoot, d - n you, shoot; I got the watch out, and gave it to Condon; I dropped my glove; I said to them, be so kind as pick my glove up; Condon picked it up, and gave it to me; as I turned off the foot-path into the road to go away, a fourth person then, whom I had not seen before, stood by, and said, is it done? Duggan said, yes, or something to that purpose, and then I left them; he was at about thirty yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you saw no more of them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoke to Condon being the principal person concerned, and you have spoke to Duggan telling him to shoot - what did Ogle do? - A. He assisted in bringing me up upon the footpath.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing else to say? - A. I met with a person who sent the patrol after them; Duggan had something in his hand, I thought it was a cane or a sword, I cannot say; I was minding the pistol that was against my breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the night dark, or how? - A. It was very light, moonlight.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this take up? - A. Three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how they were dressed? - A. Yes; Ogle stood at the right hand of me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170023"></xptr>with a light-coloured coat on, and the other two had dark coats.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the moon shine towards you, in your face, or on your back? - A. The moon shone upon my back.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had an opportunity of seeing their faces distinctly? - A. Yes, I saw them very plain.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from them when you first discovered them? - A. I was but just got out of Kensington Gravel-pits, I suppose nothing near one hundred yards from the last house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean positively to say, that you had so fair a view of them as to enable you to speak positively to their persons? - A. Yes, I think I had without a doubt; Condon and Ogle I have not the least doubt of; and Duggan I think I have no doubt of; the fourth person was shorter than either of these.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them afterwards? - A. On the Thursday following, at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they were taken up upon your information? - A. I heard they were, which made me come to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you give information to? - A. To one Carter, who keeps a cow-yard at Tyburn-gate; I told him if he went any further he would be robbed, he rode very fast, and I believe was afraid of me; I told him I was a friend, and he went back with me to Shepherd's-bush; he said the patrol could not be far off, and he would send them after the men; he rode home before the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them immediately, when you saw them at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons with them when you saw them at Bow-street, or were they brought up by themselves? - A. There was nobody else.</p>

            Had they the same clothes on that they had when they robbed you? - A. It appeared so to me; one had a light-coloured coat, and the other two, dark ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in great coats, or common coats? - A. Common coats.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. (Counsel for Duggan and Condon.) Q. Had you never seen any of these persons before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not before this transaction that you have been speaking of? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There were three persons, and another person coming up afterwards, attacking you, I should think you must have been a little agitated? - A. It was very little indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. This was between six and seven o'clock in the evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nobody by? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody passing along the road? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you were very little agitated when three or four persons were attacking you in this way? - A. Very little.</p>
               <p>Q. One person having a pistol at your breast, and another desiring that person to shoot, and yet you were very little agitated? - A. Very little indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt at all of the persons of these men? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I understand you right, when my Lord put the question to you, that you did not know what was in the hand of the other person? - A. I saw something in his hand that looked like a sword.</p>

               <p>Q. Though you are able to speak to the persons of these men, you cannot say what that was? - A. It was either a stick, a cane, or a sword.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you did not look particularly, because the pistol was at your breast? - A. I did not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they round hats on? - A. I did not take particular notice of their hats.</p>
               <p>Q. Do try and recollect? - A. I make no doubt but they had, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether they had round hats on or not, you cannot say; but as to their faces under round hats, you have no doubt of? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you not told those were the persons who were charged to have robbed you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not mixed with others for you to pick them out? - Q. No; they were brought out and I identified them immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. You know, I dare say, or have heard since this business, that there are three forty pounds reward, that is one hundred and twenty pounds, if these men are convicted? - A. I have never heard it, no body has said any thing to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard that there is a forty pounds reward upon the conviction of a highwayman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not expect to have a share of these rewards? - A. I never understood that, I understood those who took them would have it; I never heard of any thing of the kind in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you lived all your life then? - A. I have lived in Warwick, and in Gloucestershire.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What do you know of this? - A. I am one of the patrols of Bow-street: On Sunday evening, the 7th of this month, I heard there were three or four footpads on the Uxbridge-road; I went with three others of our people, Barrett, Barker, and Griffiths, and as we were going into the country, we met with the three men at the bar, near Bayswater.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you had heard of this robbery that night? - A. Yes; just before I met the prisoners; I laid hold of Duggan, and on the right-hand side, inside his coat, I found this pistol,(produces it); upon further searching him, in his pockets I found two seven-shilling-pieces, two sixpences, and one halfpenny; then I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they dressed? - A. I believe two of them were in blue, but the middleman, Condon, had a light-coloured coat on, they had round hats.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Round slapped hats? - A. Common round hats.</p>
               <p>Q. There was other money found I suppose? - A. Yes; three guineas, and two half guineas, in a little purse.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about eight o'clock? - A. Between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Some distance from Notting-green? - A. I suppose about a mile, or a mile and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. The pistol was not loaded? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You found nothing upon Ogle but four shillings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was Condon that had the light-coloured coat on, and not Ogle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is an old pistol with the handle knocked off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Wood.) Q. I forgot to ask you what you were robbed of besides the watch? - A. Two seven-shilling-pieces, and about half-a-crown.</p>

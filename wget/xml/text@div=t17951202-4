            When was this? - A. On the 1st of June we took it out of Mr. Weedon's field, about eleven o'clock at night, at Mile-end.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it was Mr. Weedon's? - A. The prisoner at the bar said it was, and that he had one out of the same field a little while before; we took it to Fenny Stratford, and sold it to Lucas, who keeps the public house there, for 6l. the prisoner and I were both together, and we shared the money; two guineas were paid at first, and as we came out of the country the prisoner called for the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. When were the two guineas paid? - A. The next morning, after we took it out of the field; we went lower into the country with two more horses, down to Birmingham; we crossed the country, and sold another horse at another place; we returned to Fenny Stratford, about a week after, and received the rest of the money, in gold and silver, making altogether 6l.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went into the field when the mare was taken out? - A. The prisoner and me both together, and brought her over the bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that the prisoner took you to the field, or how? - A. Yes, the prisoner lived just by there; I lived almost by Moorfields.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the prisoner and Bowtell bring with them? - A. Two horses; I bought one.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and Bowtell and that prisoner, by which it appeared that the prisoner claimed to have any right in the money? - A. No; Bowtell came for the money; the prisoner at the bar did not claim any of the money; nor I did not pay him any; I paid Bowtell two guineas; I think they said they were going down into the country; and I was short of money; they called again in about ten days, or thereabouts, and then I paid the rest of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present? - A. Yes; I paid it to Bowtell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass then, in consequence of which it appeared to you, that the prisoner claimed any thing in the money, or the mare? - A. No; the prisoner claimed none of it; I paid it to Bowtell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer at 5, Ocean Street, Stepney—on Wednesday, the 19th March, between 2 and 3 p.m., while on London Bridge, my attention was called to the prisoner and another man—they were going from lady to lady and looking into their jacket pockets, and then feeling in them—I followed them to King William Street, and saw the other man go and face a lady while the prisoner took out this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from her pocket—the other man then went towards Eastcheap and Gay towards Arthur Street East, and I followed him and called out to the policeman, and I had a struggle with him and he got away—I first saw the purse in his 'hand, and am sure he is the man.</p>

It was my dinner-time—I was standing upon the bridge, and they were going over from the Surrey side—I saw who took the purse, and saw it thrown away, and I picked it up—I did not look into it; they opened it at the station—I followed the policeman, and came up to him in Thames Street, where the prisoner ran on to the wharves, and I called out "Police!"</p>

I was on duty in Arthur Street East on the 19th March, and saw the last witness struggling with the prisoner—I went towards them, and Gay got away—in consequence of what the witness told me I went to Thames Street and apprehended the other man, Wilkinson—the witness gave me this purse.</p>

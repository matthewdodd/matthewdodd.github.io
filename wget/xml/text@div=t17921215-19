               <p>I am an hackney coachman; I drive for Mr. Mumford, at the time that this affair happened, it was Saturday evening about nine o'clock, or between nine and ten; I lived at the time with Mr. Butler, Whitechapel; as I came up from the end of Fenchurch-street into Gracechurch-street, this hackney coach passed me very fast, to go over the water; and I being very tired jumped behind to ride, being a driver of an hackney coach myself; I stood up and looking through the hole of the coach, that was behind the coach, I saw nobody inside of the coach, and then looking over the roof, and seeing this dirty boy driving it, I thought something was not right, and knowing it to be Mr. Cannon's property, by the chocolate brown colour, with a kind of a gold border; so then I sets myself down and rides over London-bridge, and he drove at a very great rate indeed; I was determined to see what he meant to do with this coach and horses. I rides this coach till he got off the stones at the Borough, and he turns it about, by the stand going to the King's-bench; I dropped down from his coach, as he was getting off his box, and I went round and came to him, as if I was coming from St. George's-fields, and I came up to him, and I said, my lad what are you at now, he makes answer and says, my master is here, we have just set down a fare at the corner, he has given me six-pence to ride with him to night, says I it is no such a thing, I know you have not come honestly by this coach and horses, and I will find you a master. with that I called to the watchman immediately, desired him to take charge of him, on suspicion of stealing the coach and horses; I think his name is Dicks, and he took him into custody; I got up on the box, and the boy had a desire of speaking to me, and called me on one side, and said, stow it; stow it; I suppose he meant for me to let him go, and say nothing about it, says I, what do you mean, how came you to go to be guilty to take a man's coach and horses away? says he, I took it from Charles-street, Covent-garden; I asked him if he had earned him any money? He said no. I drove the coach and horses up to the watch-house, on the Surry road, and told the night constable the same as I have told you. Mr. Wood the constable agreed for the boy and watchman to be drove to Mr. Cannon's, in the coach, and I to drive the coach; I told the night constable, who the owner of the coach was, and he thought it most prudent for me to drive him there, and I drove him there; and one of the city constables was sent for, and the boy was sent to the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the boy drunk or sober? - He appeared sober, I did not see him any thing the least disguised for liquor.</p>

               <p>I am an hackney-coachmaster, the coach was brought to me, and the horses, and the prisoner was in it, on Saturday the 3d of November. The horses were two black geldings. I am sure they were mine, I should have known them in any other person's coach.</p>
               <p>Court to Clare. Were your horses geldings that you left? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ply for Mr. Cannon? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you that night at your master's house after the coach and horses were at home? - I was, I knew them to be my horses, I was very glad to see them, it was past 12 o'clock. I had sent word by my fellow servant to let my master know of the circumstances I had light of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in Charles-street, Covent-garden, and a man asked me to feed his horses, and he said he would be back again in five minutes, he came back and gave me 1 d. and gives me the whip and says, if there is a job comes you may go with it, and come back to me at two o'clock, accordingly I went with the job.</p>
               <p>Jury. I beg to ask a question, the fact was perpetrated in Charles-street, Covent-garden, which is in the country, can a London jury be competent to judge of it.</p>
               <p>Court. The action is maintainable in any county where the property is carried, it appears he came through the city of London, therefore the action is maintainable here.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Cannon. What may be the value of these geldings? - £30.</p>

            . I am the watchman of St. Marylebone. I met the prisoner at half-past eight on Saturday night, the 3d of March, with this bundle on his head in Upper York-street, about a quarter of a mile from Portman-green, it had been dark about an hour and a half or two hours, then. I stopped him and asked what he had got there - he said dirty linen; he put it down on the post, I put my hand on it and said,</p>
               <p>"Why this is wearing apparel;" he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is, it belongs to my master who is a pawnbroker;" and that he was carrying them home for his master, who had bought them of another pawnbroker who was selling off; that his master lived in East-street, and he was before him going home with another bundle; I took him to the watch-house with the bundle, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110011"></xptr>attempted to get away from me, but I secured him, he was searched at the watch-house, and the flute found - I delivered the bundle to Coates. That produced is it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Q. Did I not say I found them - A. No.</p>
               <p>MRS. SKINNER. The parlour window is in front of the house - there is a garden before the house and a path close to the window - there is no area; the things are all ours, they had been left in a box in the bed-room - the box was not locked. I missed a Bible which is not found - here is a counterpane, a quilt, a pelisse, three gowns, a leather apron, a curtain and two petticoats; they are worth 24 s. 6 d. together, and were all in the same box with my husband's clothes.</p>

            . I went out with my wife on Saturday morning - I returned on Thursday following, and found the house had been robbed, a pane of glass near the fastening was broke and taken out - by that means they got in. I saw every thing fast before I went - here are a pair of breeches, a waistcoat, two jackets and a flute, which are mine; they are worth 31 s. 6 d. together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The watchman says I wanted to escape; as I was walking with him my foot slipped, he knocked me down, and said I was trying to get away - I made no resistance.</p>

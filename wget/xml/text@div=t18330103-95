On the 3rd of December, in consequence of some information, I took Ballard and Goddard, the officers, to Mr. Gill's, a chemist, at Charing-cross; I saw the prisoner there, behind the counter, acting as an assistant; I did not speak to him, but passed through, and spoke to Mr. Gill - I then had the prisoner called in, and told him that we had been robbed, and I wished to see his boxes; he agreed that we should - he accompanied us up stairs, but we did not find any thing in his boxes; in consequence of something else, we went to a house in Groveterrace, Camberwell - I was there shown a portmanteau, which Ballard searched, and found in it the articles stated, which are mine; a part of them were in a cholera medicine-box, and the rest in the portmanteau; we then went back to Mr. Gill's - we did not find the prisoner there, but in consequence of what I there saw, we went back to Grove-terrace; we found the prisoner in the house in which the portmanteau was- the officer stated to him that we wished to go up stairs, and search the portmanteau again, and the prisoner accompanied us up stairs - the portmantean was opened, and the officer asked the prisoner who the things belonged to; he said they were his, meaning the things which were then in it - the officer then said, "I have turned many articles out of it that Mr. Gray claims;" the prisoner said they were Mr. Gray's, but he had paid for them - I remarked "Mr. Steane, you remember it was your duty, whilst in my house, to set every article down in the book that was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030063"></xptr>sold, however small their value," that the book should be produced, and I trusted that he would be able to clear himself by it; I had given him those directions on his coming into my service - I have examined the book, and these articles are not entered - my shopmen are occasionally allowed to have articles if they ask for them, but not otherwise; among other articles found in the portmanteau, I found some essential oil of orange-peel, which was drawn in England many years ago - it had become by age exceedingly thick - and for a compound which I make, it is very valuable - and I stated to the prisoner when he once put up 2 ozs. by accident, not to sell it to any druggist at any price, even if five, ten, or fifty guineas an ounce were offered for it - it is quite different to what we have in the trade; here are a number of other essential oils which have marks on them - and, among others, here is an essential oil of sandal wood, which is in an unfinished state, not fit for sale; here is some essential oil of angelica, about an ounce and a half of it - I have missed about this quantity of it from my shop; I have no doubt that all these things are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had the prisoner been in your service? A. About three months - I believe I had a good character with him, as I cannot find any written one; when any of my young men bought articles of me, they had them at the trade price, which is much under the general price; but if he had put the money into the till, and not entered them in the book, there would have been an excess of cash in the till - I certainly have known that some things have not been entered in the book; we profess to balance the book by the till every ten days, it may have been fourteen days, I think not a month; if there has been an excess in till, it has been entered in the book as sundries, but there generally has been less in the till than in the book; the common petty cash disbursements were made out of the till, and there was a book for them - I have spoken to the prisoner about the money in the till being deficient; I forget whether the prisoner's salary was 30l. or 35l. a year; I found the prisoner at Mr. Gill's; I knew Mr. Gill's shop, but had not seen him before - he keeps a respectable chemist's shop; the prisoner was there, and was quite willing that we should search his boxes - when I saw them, I inquired respecting a hair-trunk, and a carpetbag, which I knew had gone from my house with his other boxes - we found the carpet-bag in the portmanteau; when we first went to Mr. Gill's, it was about twelve o'clock in the morning; and we did not see him again till six or seven o'clock in the evening - I had desired Mr. Gill not to let him go out; but he did go out, and left a note - we found him at Camberwell; he might have gone off if he had chosen - the portmanteau did not belong to him; I really cannot tell whether it was locked or not - there are stamps of mine on these bottles; the oils could have been poured out, but I should have known them any where; they had been removed from our store bottles to stopper glass bottles.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever see the prisoner write? A. Yes, this letter is his writing; I received it by the Twopenny post - I am quite sure I saw the prisoner on the 13th of November; I am certain there was a hair-trunk and a carpet bag among the articles I sent for the prisoner, and he denied having them- (letter read).</p>
               <p>Mr. Gray, Oxford, 4th of November 1832.</p>
               <p>DEAR SIR, - I am exceedingly sorry that I cannot write you in favourable terms of my brother, who still continues in a very precarious state - and it is the wish of my friends not to leave Oxford while he continues so ill; in all probability I may be in town the latter end of this week, on business of my brother's - should I, I will give you a call; - the "Bride of the Isis" I have not yet been able to get, but shall have them as early as possible, when I will forward them you. I am extremely sorry that my leaving town so hasty, but under the present circumstances it could not have been prevented; should I return to London again for a permanency, shall solicit the favour of your interest in procuring me a situation.

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 3rd of December I went to Mr. Gray's, and went with him to Mr. Gill's; I saw the prisoner in the shop; we begged to speak to Mr. Gill first - I think the prisoner spoke to Mr. Gray, but nothing material passed; when the prisoner was called into the back parlour, I told him Mr. Gray had been robbed by several of his servants, and he was suspected; I asked if he had taken any thing- he said No, he had not; I asked if he had given any thing at any time to any of Mr. Gray's servants; he said No, he had not - I said, "A bottle of lavender water - now, have you given that to any body?" he said No, but he had given a box of tooth-powder, and I think he said a box of pills to the maid; I said we must search his boxes; he was quite willing that we should - we went up stairs, and he produced some keys, but I did not have them; there was nothing found there - Mr. Gray then asked the prisoner respecting a hair-trunk, and whether he had any other box; he said he had not - I will not be sure whe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030064"></xptr>ther any thing was said about a bag, but he said he had no boxes at his brother's - I am quite sure he said he had nothing at his brother's; we then went down stairs, and left the prisoner in the shop - this was in the morning, perhaps about eleven o'clock; we then went to Camberwell - I found the articles which Mr. Gray claimed, in a portmanteau on the landing of the second floor; the prisoner was not there - I saw a lady and gentleman there; the portmanteau was not locked, I believe; I opened it; I took the articles away, and have had them ever since -I have them here; part of them were in this cholera-chest, and the others in the portmanteau; we then went to Mr. Gill's, and in consequence of a note which I got there, we went back to Camberwell and showed the note to the prisoner, who said it was his writing - this is it - (read.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Gill.</p>
               <p>SIR, - Excuse the liberty I have taken in leaving your premises without your consent, as I could not rest satisfied till I had seen my brother at Camberwell. I will be back as soon as I possibly can.

               <p>Witness. When we went back to Camberwell I told the prisoner I had found a great many things in a box, which Mr. Gray claimed, and some others which Mr. Gray had some doubt of, and he had better go up to the box; we went up and found the box where we left it, I threw open the lid, and said, "Whose things are these?" the prisoner said, "They are mine;" I said, "I have taken out a great many things, what answer have you to give to it?" he said,"Yes, they came from Mr. Gray's;" I said "Do you mean you have taken them without Mr. Gray's knowledge?" he said he had accounted for them; I said, "Of whom did you buy them?" he said, "Of myself;" I said,"Do you mean you have bought them, and paid the money into the till?" he said "Yes;" I then took the prisoner to the station.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was Mr. Gray up stairs when you had the conversation with the prisoner? A. Yes, and Goddard also; I should think they must have heard the prisoner say he had nothing at his brother's; I said so at Marlborough-street, but it was not taken down.</p>
               <p>MR. GILL. I am a chemist, and reside at Charing-cross, The prisoner was in my service for three weeks - he came on the 12th of November; I did not see him taken, but he left me abruptly on the day he was taken - he did not leave me to go to Oxford, nor did he intimate a wish to go - on the 29th of October I applied to Mr. Gray to make inquiries respecting another young man; I saw the prisoner there, who said, "He was going to leave Mr. Gray, as there were several things uncomfortable in the situation;" I said, "Well, if you have made up your mind to leave, I may as well engage you as any other person, but I beg you will leave Mr. Gray in a handsome manner, and whatever notice you have agreed to give him, I hope you will give;" he said, that was a fortnight - on the 10th of November he called at my house in my absence, and said, he was very sorry but he could not come to me till the 12th; he came to me on the 12th, and from what he said I was led to conclude he had left Mr. Gray</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was what he said to you that he had received his wages from Mr. Gray and done with him? - A. Yes - he did not desire me to keep it a secret that he was coming to me; I received notice to attend here about an hour ago.</p>
               <p>MR. GRAY. These are my property; some of the articles have never been opened - this is a bottle of essential oil of orange-peel; here is about 4 ozs. of it, which I should refuse to sell at any price - here is some oil of sandal wood in an unfinished state, in which no one would buy it; I cannot speak to the bottles, but I can to the contents of them; here is a case of lancets, which are wrapped up in a paper, which has two of my seals on it - here is a German silver spatula and spoon, which I had from Prague, in Bohemia, and I am short of them; I believe there are none such in London - I kept them in my shop for use, but do not sell them; this ink-stand contained these three coins, which were up stairs in my cabinet.</p>
               <p>The prisoner read the following Defence: My Lord and Gentlemen, - I entered the prosecutors' employ to get acquainted with his method of chemistry, and to get such information as would ultimately enable me to set up in business; and I accordingly bought, while in the prosecutors' service, essential oils, and other articles, which I did not enter in the day cash-book. I have already stated to the officers, on my being taken into custody, that these goods were Mr. Gray's; and that they came from his shop. When I took them, I was under the full persuasion,(which I believe is common to young men employed as I was in that trade,) that the custom of the trade allowed the young men to take goods at the cost price. I paid the cost prices into the till, from time to time, as I took the goods. They were curious articles, and I took them to be useful to me as samples, when I went into business for myself, as I fully intended to do. The cost prices bear but a small proportion to the actual selling price. I have been wrong in not paying Mr. Gray himself, or keeping evidence by somebody that I did pay for them. Mr. Beacall, my fellow-shopman, knew (as I thought) of my paying for some; but by a letter received from him by my attornies since I have been in custody, it appears that there was only one article which he could distinctly remember, and for which he knew that I paid into the till; as his evidence would not go further, and as he is in Dublin, and to bring him here might be the loss of his situation, I have not so far made use of his good feeling for me as to bring him as a witness. Mr. Gray said before the Magistrates, that if I had paid, it would appear by his daily cash-book; that book was not regularly kept, and only balanced once a month, as I can show; therefore that is no proof. I once reminded Mr. Gray of an omission to enter an article sold by himself, and he told me, in harsh terms, to mind my own business, and leave him to take care of his; I confess that this, which happened soon after I went to Mr. Gray helped to make me careless in entering. I made no concealment of having these things - I showed many of them to my sister Jane long before my apprehension, and they were left in an open old trunk of my brother's. My condition in life was such as not to make me at all needy - if I wanted more money than my salary gave me, I had it on application to my brother; I mention this to show that I could easily pay for what I had. The character which I have always borne will show, I trust, that I am incapable of stealing - I have had no motive for it. If I had wished to conceal them, the last place where I should have deposited them would have been my brother's, at Camberwell, to whose house, according to Mr. Gray's evidence, I had directed him to send my boxes, when I could as easily have had them sent to a coach-office, which would have afforded no clue to their discovery.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030065"></xptr>- GWATKINS. I was in the service of Mr. Gray, the prosecutor, for three months. The cashbook and the disbursement-book were not regularly kept; they were balanced once a month, but did not always come right.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Mr. Gray sell such coins as these? A. No - I have seen such spoons and spatuals as these at the prosecutor's; they were not for sale - I left him in consequence of a quarrel; I went to Mr. Gardner's, but am not there now - he gave me a trial, but I was not fit for his situation; I have seen essential oil of orange-peel there; it was old and spoiled - it might be of use to him, but it would not sell in the market; I have seen such coins as these given to children.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a most excellent character from nine highly respectable winesses.</p>

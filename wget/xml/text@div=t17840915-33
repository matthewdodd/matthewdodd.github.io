                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150076"></xptr>At what time of the day? - Between five and six, I was coming from Houndslow, going to Walthamstow.</p>
               <p>What was there a croud? - Yes, there was a match at prison-bars, and I stopped to see it, I was not long in the croud before I caught the man's hand in my pocket, I laid hold of his wrist and he snatched it away, I cried out thief, and he was stopped by the mob directly, he was endeavouring to run off, and the mob put him into a great pond, he was there very high half an hour, he was very ill used in the pond; we had him out and searched him, but we found no property upon him, and he was taken to the Justices and committed.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not search him before he was ducked? - No, when he was searched we found no money, only three picklock keys.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you might not have mistaken the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you lose sight of him? - No, he was stopped directly, I never lost sight of him before he went into the pond.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt, look at him now? - He is the same man, but he does not look so well as he did, when I first saw him; but I know he is the same man.</p>

               <p>I was standing seeing the game go forwards, and two Gentlemen began to fight, and this Gentleman said, he lost some money; he said it was a man in a light coloured coat, one of them took me down to this pond, and threw me in, and kept me in, and kept me there half an hour, and when I came out again, the prosecutor said, he thought I had a mixed coat on, they core me and cut me there half an hour; I begged to be taken before some Justice, when the man said, I should come out of the pond, and I came to the Justices with him.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. What is your business? - A taylor.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never mentioned any thing of the kind about his coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said at first before the Justice, that he did not take hold of my hand, and could not for the crowd.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Deptford—on 1st June between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning, I was in the Borough, near St. George's Church, I met Griffiths—she spoke to me and asked me where I was going—I said to my ship—at that time Brown and Edwards came up—Brown came behind me and throttled me, and Griffiths aud Edwards came in front of me and rifled my pockets—I struggled, and I held Brown a good bit till I heard the policeman coming; he then got away, and he and Edwards ran off, and Griffiths came and took me by the arm and told me not to run after her husband—it was just break of day—I was perfectly sober.</p>

Between 8 and 9, the same Night, Mr. Bruce coming that Way, found the Cellar Door of his House open, and heard a Noise within; upon which, he got a Light and Assistance in the Neighbourhood, and enter'd. When he came up one pair of Stairs he found several Goods bundled up ready to carry off; and going higher, he found the Prisoners both together in a Room. But Low was already gone off with some of the Goods. Several Witnesses gave Tyler a very good Character, and the Jury <rs id="t17260114-43-verdict256" type="verdictDescription">

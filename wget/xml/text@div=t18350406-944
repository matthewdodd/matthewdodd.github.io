                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 164.) I heard that two shifts had been stolen, and went to Half-Moon-street, Bishopsgate. I saw these shifts at Fordham's—I told them to keep them, as the prisoner had said she would come for them—I went again, and waited till the prisoner came for them—I said, "Are these yours?"—she said, "Yes"—I asked if there was any mark on them—she said, "No"—she said she bought them of a woman in Shoreditch—I said, "Did you buy two wringing wet shifts of her?"—she said, "Yes"—I then took her to the station-house.</p>

I live at 8, Denby-terrace, North Battersea, and am a collector of the lighting and sewer's rates of the parish of Battersea—I know the priwoner by sight, not as a friend, as an acquaintance—he lived near me, and I have talked to him in the garden—I have been to his house and he has been to my house—I have known him in my capacity afll collector—I have called at his house and received money for rates—I used to buy eggs from him—about Christmas time, on a Sunday of Monday, I won't be positive which, he said he had more eggs than he wanted—he did not care about hawking them about, and he would let me have an many as he had to spare at the rate of a penny apiece, if I would take all he had; and I used to give him a penny apiece for all he had to spare—I had two from him either on Christmas day or the day aftef—he said they were a Christmas box—he refused to take the money for them—I said, "No," it was a small amount certainly, and I insisted upon Joying—he refused to take it—I left the money on the wall, and said,</p>

               <p>" Give it to the child, then, if you won't take it"—he drove the child back, and said the child should not have it, and he, refused to take it, and was offended at it, and next day he said, "There is your money on the wall still, you can take it if you like; you shan't have any more eggs"—on Tuesday afternoon, 27th December, a little before three I was at home—my wife and children had gone out—I was alone in the house—the prisoner called on me—he kicked at the door to come in—he said he had first met Mr. Jones, the servant and the baby, going across the fields, and Mr. Jones had told him to call on me and have a glass of wine and make it up—I said, "Come in," and said, "Make what up? I did not know I had offended you; comein;" and then I asked him to take a seat, and said, "What will you take, port or sherry;"—he said, "Port," and I went and fetched the port down for him—we sat down and had some wine—I helped him to two glasses, and I think he helped himself to another; I had a glass of porter—after some indifferent conversation, I told him that I had a letter to write to save the afternoon post, and I asked him if he would excuse me—he was sitting smoking, as I thought—I sat down to write, and then I saw him take two or three steps past me—I thought he was going to look at something behind me till I felt a blow at the back of the neck—I was stooping—the blow will show that it could not have been given while I was upright—I grappled with him directly, and we struggled round the room—I had seen him open a knife before that to clean his pipe out—we struggled along the dresser—there was a clock at the end near the kitchen door, and he put his back against the kitchen door, to prevent me from getting out—I tore the clock weight down and struck him as hard as I could over the head and face; he has the marks I dare say—we struggled round the room, and the room has the marks of the blood all over the paper—however, I was the better man of the two—he demanded some money of me; that was after he had struck me in the neck—he did not say a word to me for about a minute or so; then the first words he said, were, "I must have money; give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—and then he asked for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was lowering his price every time, and then after that I said, "Drop your knife," or "Let go your knife, and I will go up stairs and get the money;"—he said, "No, I will go up with you;"—then I saw it was no use, it was a struggle for life and death—I refused to do that—he said, "You had better give in, or you will soon faint from loss of blood," and then the struggle recommenced—we were struggling round all the time he was trying to stab me—I grappled him by the right hand, and he grasped my right hand, so we were both almost powerless—I had called for assistance before—I called "murder" as far as I could—after some minutes, it appeared an hour to me, it must have been two minutes after I had thrown him off, I managed to get the kitchen table between us, and then I laid, "If you don't leave the house, I will smash the window and call for assistance;" it is rather an uninhabited neighbourhood—there is a very small number of persons passing by—the parties next door had gone out, and he had seen them go out, I have no doubt—when I threatened to smash the windows and call for assistance, he closed the knife and put it in his pocket and said, "Oh, Jones, what have I done?" and then said something about hie poor wife—I forgot to state that before he asked for the money he said something about two hours, but in the excitement of the moment I could not tell what it was—I remember his saying something about giving him two hours to get away—when he closed the knife he said "Oh, Jones, what have I done? my poor wife, will you forgive me?" I said, "Go at once, or else I will smash the windows," and then he opened the kitchen door and went out—my</p>

               <p>next door neighbour and myself knock against the fire-place to call each other out, and whoever knocks the other answers—I knocked directly for the next door, and had an answer from the girl—there was only the girl in the house—I went out at the back and saw her, and told her to go for a doctor directly and a policeman as well—I was dripping with blood—I could feel the wound on the back of my neck, and another behind the ear—the doctor afterwards attended me and dressed the wounds.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might have been twelve months; I can't say the date—I never sat down in his house in my life—he had some plants; he hag given me some; I have been to look at his, and he has been to look at mine—I don't call that visiting—I can't say how many times I have been at his house, more than once or twice, but not more than half-a-dozen times—he might have been to my house three times—I have shewn him my plants each time—he only came for that purpose—on 27th December, he said he came because he said Mr. Jones told him to come and keep me company—from the time he came into the house till the blow was struck, nothing had been said between us of an unpleasant nature—when he came in he said he was annoyed respecting the eggs, but there was not an angry word—he did not say a word about the manner in which he desired to be paid for the eggs—the did not say he wanted half a dozen kisses; not a word passed about kisses during any part of the time—he might have talked about kisses with reference to something else, but not in reference to the payment of the eggs—there was not the slightest irritation on my part towards him—he did not use an angry word at all—I was never more surprised in my life than when he stabbed me—I took up a heater and a candlestick, and struck him with both; it was the heater of an Italian iron—I took up the candlestick because I was stabbed; not in consequence of any expression of his about kissing—no such expression was used—the last words that were spoken before he struck me, were when I asked him if he would excuse me for a moment, and he said, "Certainly; I will have a smoke, have you any tobacco?" I said, "Yes," and gave him the tobacco—he filled his pipe as I thought, and then I felt the blow directly afterwards; these were the only words that passed between us—I believe he had commenced smoking, because I gave him a pipe—his pipe went out I believe—I saw him apply a light to it, but I was writing—after he had struck me he demanded money—I had not struck him when he demanded the money because I was defenceless then—I did not strike him till after he demanded the money, then I tried two or three times it might be, I can't say how many, to get my right hand disengaged—I can't tell how many times I struck him with the candlestick or heater—I struck him as often as I could—I only felt one wound in the back of my neck—he tried to strike me after I got up from my chair—I cannot tell whether he did or not, but I know I had the wounds—my hands were cut all over; you can see the wounds now; those were received after I got up from the chair—there was also one blow behind the ear—that was given either after I got up, or else as I was rising—after I got up, I grappled with the prisoner and got the knife, and got the wounds on my hands then—no one else was present—I can hardly say how soon after that it was that I saw the police—it was not many minutes; perhaps 10 minutes; it was as soon as we could fetch them—I did not see the prisoner again, till I went to the police-court, a fortnight or three weeks after, I think—I was not able to attend before—I saw him at the police-court; he ran away, and I sent a policeman after him—previous</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 22, King's-road, Chelsea—on 27th December, I was called upon to see the prosecutor—I went to his house—I found that he had received two wounds, one on the scalp about two and a helf inches behind the the left ear; it was an incised wound through the salp—it had bled very profusely—there was another incised wound half-an<lb></lb>inch long, on the nape of the neck, and five or six small incised cuts on the hand—they were such wounds as might have been caused by a knife—he had lost a very great deal of blood; the bandages about his neck were quite soaked in blood—he was under my care nearly three weeks, up to 14th January, but he was not confined to his house during that period—on 14th 'January he was at my house—I considered the wounds dangerous at first, not in consequence of their actual nature, but form the probability of inflammation supervening on the wound of the scalp, which we always</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186001300092"></xptr>
               <p>consider dangerous—it was three-quarters of an inch long, and deep—it might have brought on erysipelas—he is now, in my judgment, quite weel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did he appear before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't remember the day—it would be about the 4th—erysipelas might supervene from a very small wound—it depends very much upon the constitution of the person who receives the wound—a small wound may kill a man, a wound with a knitting needle—a slight wouud sometimes produces an immense flow of blood—the flow of blood alone, is not altogether a test of the character of the wound—I had never seen the prisoner before—I only saw him before the Magistrate, as I see him now.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I followed him up the lane, and laid hold of him; I told him he had stolen these rails from Mr. Gosling; he said he did not steal them, he was carrying them for the old man. On my turning round within a few yards I saw some person; that person turned out to be Ironmonger. The prisoner put down the rails; we had a struggle. I took him to a public house about two hundred yards off. I immediately returned to the spot where I left the rails, I found them upon Ironmonger's shoulder, he was going off with them; I charged him with taking them, and desired him to put them down and go along with me; he did. The rails had been prepared under my direction, I know them to be Mr. Gosling's; they are the value of twelve shillings. I had seen them on the evening of the 23rd or 24th; they then were within the park; within a few yards of the lodge.</p>

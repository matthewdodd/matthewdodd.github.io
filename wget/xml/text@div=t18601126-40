                  </hi>: I am one of the senior clerks in the post-office—the prisoner was sorter at the South Western District office, Pimlico—in consequence of something which occurred, I made up, on 7th November, what is called a test letter—I enclosed in it two half-sovereigns, having previously marked them, and fastened them in a piece of adhesive gum paper, to keep them from tumbling about—I put them into an envelope addressed, "J. Longfellow, Esq., solicitor, Merrion-square, Dublin," and fastened it in the ordinary way with the adhesive gum on the envelope—I gave it to Willis Clare, One of the inspectors of letter carriers, with instructions; and if posted according to my instructions, it would, in the regular course, come to the office where the prisoner was employed, and thence to the General Post Office—it would be posted at Battersea, and would be taken in a bag—I Opened the bag on its arrival at the chief office, and it did not contain the letter addressed to Mr. Longfellow—I then'Vent to Pimlico, and followed the officer Smee into the Phœnix public-house, close to the South Western office (this was shortly after 7 o'clock), where Frances Mitchlemore, the landlady's niece, produced five half-sovereigns to me, among which I found one of the two that I had enclosed in the letter—it had my mark upon it—I then went to the South Western office, and through the sorting office to the adjoining room—the prisoner was not there, and I directed Newman to fetch him—he did so, and I said to the prisoner, "Did you assist with the general sorting at 3.50 to-day?"—he said, "Yes"—(the general post sorting is sorting for the provincial towns)—I told him that a money letter addressed "J. Longfellow, Esq., Dublin," was missing, and asked if he knew anything</p>

               <p>about it—he said that he did not—I directed Smee to search him, and saw Smee take from him a purse containing 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some coppers—he told me that he had saved that from his wages last Saturday—I asked him if he changed a half-sovereign at the public-house round the corner to<lb></lb>day—he said, "Yes"—I asked him where he got it from—he said that he had received it for his wages on Saturday—I think this was Wednesday; I am not certain—I told him that I was in possession of a half-sovereign which I had obtained at the public-house, and which had been enclosed in the letter addressed to Mr. Longfellow, and that the letter had been seen in his posses<lb></lb>sion at about 4 o'clock—he said that he knew nothing of the letter or the half-sovereign—I sent Upfold, an officer, to search his lodgings, while I remained with the prisoner—Flicker showed me three half-sovereigns at about twenty minutes past 8, among which I saw the other one with my mark upon it—the prisoner was then given into custody—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two half-sovereigns.</p>

               <p>District office—on 7th November I opened the letter-bag which I received from the Battersea-bridge office—I had previously communicated with Mr. Gardner to know what he was doing—when the letter-bag arrived, I found a letter addressed, "J. Longfellow, Esq., Dublin"—it was still fastened—I felt it, and it appeared to contain coin—the prisoner was employed in sorting letters, and I placed that letter before him with others to sort—I saw him take it to the scale and weigh it—he brought it back to the sorting table, and I afterwards saw him sort it up for the Irish division—it was the first letter in the Irish division—shortly after that the prisoner left the table, and went into the register room; he took something with him, and he also took some registered letters from the opening table, where the bags are opened—when he was gone I went to the sorting table to ascertain whether the letter was there; it was not there—that was about two minutes after I had seen it standing in the Irish division—I went directly—I examined the letters in the Irish division to see whether it had got mixed up with them, and am sure it was not there—I then tied them up, and sent them off with others—I afterwards made a communication to Mr. Gardner—the prisoner remained in the office till after 7 o'clock—I missed him shortly after 7—he was atten<lb></lb>ding to his duty in the meantime, but he went down stairs once, about 5 o'clock—down stairs goes to the water-closet—he remained below about five minutes—when I missed him at a little past 7, I went to the Phœnix public-house, and saw him there, having something to drink—I then returned to the dis<lb></lb>trict office, and he shortly afterwards came in—Mr. Gardner then came in, and Smee, the constable—Mr. Gardner then directed me to fetch the prisoner, but, instead of fetching him, I called out to him, and he said, "All right"—he was then in the road room, where the letters are sorted for the suburbs of London—it is an ante-room adjoining the sorting room—he came out of the road room and I told him that he was wanted—he went up to the letter car<lb></lb>riers' office up stairs, and as he was going up I called him, he said, "All right," but continued going up stairs—Smee and Gardner were in the adjoining room—I followed the prisoner up stairs, and found him in the act of getting a registered letter signed for—he was standing close by the seat of Henry Rice, a letter carrier—he came down stall's, and I followed him down and took him to Mr. Gardner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you call the prisoner in to sort the letters at first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I beckoned him in—that was about 4 o'clock—this was not his regular work, but it was work which he was accustomed to do—there were a great many sorters in the office—he took the letter to weigh it—I do not know whether several people saw him weigh it—the weighing machine is in the sight of all the others—the stamper was standing near the weighing machine, I and there was a sorter opening at the table—I missed the letter in two minutest—during those two minutes I was watching him as far as I possibly could—my duty is to superintend the sorting—I was watching all the sorters; not Hume in particular—I had no object in that—I did not see him take the letter up after he had put it in the Irish division, and yet I was watching him—I examined the letters for the Irish post only—the prisoner remained from 4 to 5 o'clock without going out—I do not think he even left the place—he might have gone down stairs if he had chosen—the Phœnix public-house is used by all the sorters—I had been there during the afternoon, and it may be more than once—I do not know that I changed any money there; I may have, but if I did, I know it was not a half-sovereign, I because I had not one in my possession—I remember saying to somebody, I laying my hand on ray stomach, "I shall spend a fortune in gin to-day," and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186011260049"></xptr>
               <p>most likely it was to the prisoner—when I got up stairs he was having a registered letter signed for—that was in conformity with his duty—I am not aware of a registered letter arriving open, containing a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I recollect some remittance coming loose, but I do not think it was that day—I do not know that the prisoner received a letter open, containing a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and that he handed it to the authorities at once—I remember a remittance from a post-office receiver, containing bank notes, coming open, and Hume showing it to me, but whether it was that day or not, I cannot say—he might have pretended that easily—he has borne a good character during the four years he has been at the post-office.</p>

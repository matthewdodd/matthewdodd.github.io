            </rs> By the Evidence to support this Indictment, it appeared that Mr. Carrent gave Carlile 15 l. and ordered him to prosecute the said Smith, and that he paid 5 s. to Mrs. Holiday in New Prison to keep her on, not doubting but she'd swear any thing against Smith, and order'd Mr. Carlile to pay 14 s a Week to Mr. Holiday and his Wife to keep them in the Prison, and that they were to give Evidence against Mr. smith for abetting and procuring the robbing the Bristol Mail, and if he was convicted they were to have the 40, if not Carrent was to pay all Charges: that Carrent should say to Carlisle, you know Smith to be a Rogue, prosecute him to the utmost Rigour of Law; and that if he was convicted he should not be pardoned for he would make interest to a great Nobleman; that about two Years ago Carrent said that smith was a Rogue had soft him a great deal of Money, and he would have him convicted if he could, tho' it cost him a Thousand Pound The Counsel for Carrent observed that even what was swore against him, supposing it to be true, would not make good the indictment and then called Mrs. Scott.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171904080008"></xptr> and Mrs. Holiday , by whose Evidence it appeared, that Smith had own'd, that tho' he did not rob the Bristol Mile yet he set the Robbery; and that he said if those who did it had not been Fools they had all been made Men. That Smith set Holiday, Williams and Cheshire to rob the Bristol Male, and that Mrs. Holiday going to Smith's House in Black-Horse-Alley near Fleet-Bridge to inquire after her Husband betimes that Morning, he came while she was there and said to Smith, we have done it; who reply'd, Have you by G - d? That she went with Smith to the House where the Letters were forting; that he told them they must separate their Horses or they'd betray 'em. that being desired to go up and help them he refused, whereupon one of them said G - d - d - n him, now he has set us on and drawn us in, he will betray us. The Counsel would have called many more Witnesses to have proved the Matter against Smith. But there having before been a Great deal of time spent in hearing the Counsel on both sides, the Court would not let them, saying there was no Occasion; and that it plainly appeared that Carrent had a very just and probable Cause for prosecuting the said Smith on the former Indictment of abetting, consulting and procuring Williams,&amp;c. to rob the Bristol Male.

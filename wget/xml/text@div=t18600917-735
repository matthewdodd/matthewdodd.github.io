On the afternoon of 28th August, I was on duty in Cheapside—I ovserved a crowd collected near Sir Robert Peel's statue, and went to see what was the matter—I found the prisoner and a carman fighting—the carman was on his back on the ground; the prisoner was standing about three or four yards from him in a fighting attitude—I went up to him and said, "You must go out of this we can have no bother here"—her answered me with a volley of abuse, and asked what the h—I I wanted with him, why not unterfere with the other man—he went to rush past me to the carman; I caught hold of him by the coat and told him he must go away—he said, "I have had twelve months for very nearly killing a policeman; you had better let go your hold"—I then let go of him and tried to persuade him to go away—he said, "You must be a much stronger man than me to keep me away from him"—I then caught hold of him again to hinder him from going—he then knocked my hat off with his hand, seized me round the neck with his arm and commenced kick<lb></lb>ing me about the legs—he kicked me once in the groin—he then put his leg between mine and tried to throw me—he continued to assault me till the arrival of Banham, another constable—he caught hold of him by the arm and persuaded him to come, but he still kept on kicking us both very violently—sometimes he walked and sometimes we had to drag him—when we got to the top of Bread-street he threw himself down in his back on the ground and continued to kick at us very violently—he said if he had a knife he would stick it into us; he would die for a policeman—in Cannon-street he threw himself down on his back again and kicked very violently—we did at last with the assistance of three or four others, succeed in getting</p>

Caldecott of Cheapside—about twenty minutes past 12, as I was going out to dinner, I saw the prisoner and a carman quarrelling—the prisoner came up to the carman in an attitude to strike him and the carman struck him as in self-defence—they struggled and fell—they got up to resume the fight—the constable came up and wanted the prisoner to go away; he refused several times—the constable said if he did not he should have to lock him up; he again refused—he several times requested him to go away quietly, and pushed him away from fighting—the carman went away; he had been delivering bales at our house—the prisoner resisted being taken very much—it took several policeman to convey him to the station—I saw him kicking very violently all the way they were going—there was a great crowd.</p>

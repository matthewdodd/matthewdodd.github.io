            , from the person of Thomas Roberts.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ROBERTS sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Thomas Hawley, a watch-maker, No. 120, Fleet-street: On Thursday, the 5th of May, Michael Tool, and George Jones, the prosecutor, came to our shop, and Jones delivered me the watch specified in the indictment, to be repaired; on Friday, the 6th, Tool came for the watch, but it was not ready for him; he said, he was come for Jones's watch; on Saturday, the 7th, he came again; I informed him the watch was done, and told him it came to six shillings and sixpence; he said, he would go and fetch the money; he went and fetched five shillings; on the receipt of the five shillings, I delivered him the watch; there was a metal chain, two keys, and one seal; I rather objected to taking five shillings instead of six shillings and sixpence, and he said, on condition of my taking it, he would bring a customer on Monday to purchase a watch.</p>

               <p>Q.When he came the second time, how did he demand the watch? - A. He said he came for Jones's watch, which was left to repair; and from his coming with Jones, I could not think but he had sent him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE JONES sworn. - I am a sailor: On the 5th of May, I was coming down Fleet-street with Michael Tool and John Owens; I had let my watch fall on board the frigate Cibber; says Tool, I will shew you a watch-maker's, and he shewed me Mr. Hawley's, No. 120; we went in, and I gave the watch to the watch-maker to repair; we came out, and went into a public-house, and had two pots of beer, and then I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, did you ever give the prisoner any orders or directions to get the watch when it was done? - A. No, he came to me on the 6th, and told me the watch was not done; I told him to go about his business, that the watch-maker would not deliver the watch to any person but me, George Jones; on the 7th, he came to me again, and told me the watch was done, and the price was five shillings; I told him again to go about his business, that he could not get the watch till I went myself; I went to the watch-maker's half an hour after for my watch, and was told the prisoner had got it; on the 11th, I went to his house, he was sitting by the fire up stairs; he asked me what I was come for; I told him for my watch, and he offered me his pension-ticket for a security; I told him I did not want it, it was of no service to me; I then took him to Mr. Hawley's, and Mr. Hawley sent for a watchman; he offered me his pension-ticket in Mr. Hawley's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any authority, at any time, to get this watch? - A. No, nothing of the kind; I saw it afterwards in the hands of the pawnbroker.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to a pawnbroker: On the 7th of May, the prisoner's wife brought this watch to our house, and pledged it for thirty-five shillings, in the name of Mary Tool; I gave her a duplicate; I had seen the prisoner and his wife several times, I understood them to be man and wife; on the 11th, a constable came and told us to appear at Guildhall with the watch. (The watch produced.)</p>
               <p>- JOHNSON sworn. - I am a watchman belonging to St. Bride's, Fleet-street: On Wednesday, the 11th, I was at Mr. Smith's; the constable's; Hawley came, and said he had a thief in his shop; I went and got a constable; the prisoner delivered the duplicate to Mr. Hawley, he gave it me, and I gave it to the constable, Hope; the prisoner produced his pension-ticket, and wanted Jones to take it to get the money and get his watch; the constable would not allow it.(- Hope, the constable, produced the duplicate, and Jones identified the watch.)</p>
               <p>Jones. I have had the watch three weeks; I had not had it in my pocket but once before I went to the watch-maker's, and then I was half stupified; I had come from Woolwich, I gave five pounds for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 5th of May, this man and a shipmate of mine were together; he asked me to go down to a watch maker's with him, to get his watch repaired; I went to the watch-maker's, and gave him the watch, and desired him to repair it as soon as possible; the next day he desired me to go and see if it was done, and said he would satisfy me for my trouble; I went to the watch-maker's; he said it would not be done till Saturday, the mainspring was broke, and it wanted to be cleaned; I went on Saturday, about two o'clock to Jones, and he was not within; I went to the watch-maker's, and got the watch, and went again to Jones's lodging, and they told me he was gone; I met a person I owed some money to, and I pawned the watch for thirty-five shillings; he came to me, and said he wanted the watch; I went to the watch-maker's,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250058"></xptr>and gave him the duplicate, and offered him my pension-ticket for the use, of the money for three hours; he had a man with him, who told the watchmaker to send for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Jones.) You have heard, what he has said - is it true? - A. No, none of it; I never saw him before we went together to the watch-maker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in liquor? - A. Not much, I knew what I said and what I did.</p>

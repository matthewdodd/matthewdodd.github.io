On the 12th of August, about half-past nine o'clock, I was by the side of Queen-street Chapel, down the Archway, and I saw the prisoner take the bundle from the boy, but did not suspect that he was robbing him; I was about twenty yards off; the boy was on the ground; the prisoner pulled him along, and snatched it from him; the boy cried to his mother, and both cried Stop thief! I pursued and took the prisoner, and took it from him, and gave it to Crawley; he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Are you certain of him - A. Yes. There is a gass lamp there. The moment I seized him, he said it was his brother, and that he took the bundle from him, because he should not go that road as he did not wish him.</p>

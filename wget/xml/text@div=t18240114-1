I was once Commander and Colonel in a battalion in which Serjeant Medley was ensign; I procured him that rank. He had a female child, who afterwards married the prisoner - after his death, I procured his widow a pension, and the child a pension of 8 l. a year. I had not seen the child from two years old till she was eighteen or nineteen years old; I think it was about December, 1822 - I have seen her perhaps seven or eight times between that time and the present, and have seen the prisoner three or four times - he desired me to get him some information respecting his wife. On the 1st of January, about four o'clock in the afternoon, she was sitting in my parlour with me, and about five the servant came, and said Mr. Reynolds was at the door; he immediately followed the servant in - the servant left, and shut the door, leaving us three together. I said,</p>
               <p>"Pray take a chair;" he sat down about two feet from the table, with his back against the wall - I sat on the opposite side of the table, which was between us; his wife sat at the opposite corner, by the fire. I said,</p>
               <p>"Shall I give you a glass of wine?" he said</p>
               <p>"Yes." I immediately took up the decanter (which was on the table,) in my right hand, and the glass in my left - I poured the wine out, and handed it over to him, keeping my eye on the glass to avoid spilling it; he had approached nearer the table and nearer to me. I was leaning over the table, handing the glass towards him; his hand was under the table. I heard a sort of tick, which I now suppose to be his cocking the pistol, and just as I sat the glass down he fired a shot at me, putting his hand across the table - I did not see the pistol, and felt no bodily hurt from that; the ball had gone through my coat on the left side; I have the coat on now; it was buttoned; the hole is near the waistband of my breeches. I immediately got up, went round to him, and put my hands on his, not to hold them - I merely said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Reynolds, for God's sake moderate your passion, or you will do something serious; consider what you are about, you will do something serious presently if you don't moderate your passion." My temper was not rough in the least. I thought at that time that he had fired at his wife, and not at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in the line of the pistol - A. We were at a triangle; he might have fired at either. I got up to pacify him, thinking he had fired at her, and while I was close to him, he fired a second pistol on my right side - I immediately felt that I had been shot; his wife at that time had pushed her chair about two feet further from the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. In the manner he directed the pistol, could it be intended for her - A. I do not think it possible. That ball perforated my coat, and went through my waistcoat. I went and sat down, and asked him if his pistols were loaded with ball; he immediately answered Yes, he was sure they were loaded with ball, for he had loaded them himself. I then asked where he got them - he said he bought them in Norton-falgate, on the Tuesday, (this was Thursday;) I asked of whom; he said he did not know - that he was sure the balls were in me, and he hoped they were in my g - ts or bowels and said,</p>
               <p>"I am very happy, I am now quite easy" - he repeated that three or four times. I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Reynolds, I think it was the second shot that hit me;" he said,</p>
               <p>"No, it was the first;" and then he added,</p>
               <p>"I took a very good aim at you;" I replied,</p>
               <p>"You certainly had a very good opportunity." The report of the pistols alarmed my servants, who came running up - his wife was alarmed, jumped up, and ran to find the bell, but could not. She opened the door and the servants came in - my man servant called a watchman, who came in. The candles were out when the servants came up, but I had not observed it before, and cannot tell how they came out. I sent oyer to Mr. Lock, the surgeon, who came immediately, and said,</p>
               <p>"Let me examine the wound;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Stop a moment" - I then said to the prisoner, (as he had only said that the pistol was loaded with ball before his wife)</p>
               <p>"Sir, were your pistols loaded with ball?" he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, I loaded them myself; they are in you, and I am very glad of it, I am sure they are in you." Mr. Brodie came in eight or ten minutes - the prisoner still sat in the same chair; he either threw the keys of the pistols down, or put them on the table, I do not know which; I was as collected as I am now. Mr. Brodie looked at my wound. We found the ball had gone through the wooden part of the fire skreen, hit the wall, and fallen down on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140004"></xptr>ground, where it was found. I got up, and felt something run down my side, and took the ball out of my breeches - it had gone through my coat and waistcoat, and lodged in my breeches. The prisoner took out a letter, and threw it on the table; his wife got up, seized it, and crammed it into her pocket. I afterwards said,</p>
               <p>"By the bye, where is that letter?" The prisoner immediately said, looking at her in rather a spiteful manner,</p>
               <p>"Oh! I suppose you have burnt it" - she said, No, and threw it on the table. I took hold of it, and said,</p>
               <p>"I presume I may read this letter;" she said, Yes. I took it up; it was rather dirty and torn; I could scarcely make it out; he looked across the table, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! No, to be sure you cannot read it, you never saw it before." I never had seen it before, so help me God. I gave it to Mr. Locke. He repeated several times that he thought the bullets were in me, and seemed mortified when they were found, and said he knew very well he should suffer for it. He said to me,</p>
               <p>"You are a serpent, you have stung me in the most vital part." I said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, you do me an injustice, I never did you an injury." I never had the slightest intercourse with his wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. However innocent you may have been, you are quite sensible that he was under the influence of jealousy, however improperly excited - A. From his observations I presume he was. I have seen his wife seven or eight times within the last twelve or eighteen months. I am now unmarried, and was so at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen her between Christmas-eve and the 1st of January - A. She called on me on the 26th, about eleven o'clock in the morning. I had told him before that if I saw or heard of her, I would acquaint him, and did so, and he came about five o'clock on the 26th - I said,</p>
               <p>"Good God, have you received my letter already?" he said, Yes, and asked me if she was inclined to come back to him; I said,</p>
               <p>"I really cannot say, she seems frightened." I did not see her from the 26th to the 1st of January. I live in New-street, Dorset-square, and he near Finsbury-square. He said he had got on the stage and come up. I was never at his house but once in my life; he was present then. His wife had left him twice I believe. I know of nothing to make him have any ill-will towards me. When I procured his wife the pension, she was between seven and eight years old.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was fetched, and got to the General's house between five and six o'clock; several people were then in the parlour. The General said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Locke, I am shot; that man has shot me," (pointing to the prisoner.) I desired him to sit down, for me to examine the wound; he said he wished first to put some questions to the prisoner, and asked him to be candid and acknowledge if the pistols were loaded with ball - he replied that they were; I then examined the wound, and found the ball had passed through the coat, waistcoat, and shirt, and considerably grazed the side, directly over the left ribs, for about an inch and a half - if it had struck a little above it would have entered the lungs and produced death. I was convinced that the ball had not entered the side, but the General said he thought it had, and the prisoner said he hoped it had. I proposed examining him to see if he had more pistols - he took out seven or eight balls, and declared that he had no more pistols; he had given up two to the watchman. Both balls were found while I was there; one had passed through the wooden part of the fire skreen. I have the letter.</p>
               <p>(Read.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Captain in the Royal Artillery, quartered at Woolwich. On Saturday night, the 21st of February, between half-past eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was in a street in Woolwich, which I do not know the name of, returning to my quarters—I was accosted by a man in the undress of the Marine Corps, who instantly knocked my hat off my head—I only observed one man at that moment—I was rolled up in my cloak, and in raising my arms to protect myself, or to save my hat, I fell, and at that time I saw two men, the one who knocked my hat off, and another man close behind—they both ran off—in about a minute, I saw the watchman, who asked if I had been ill-treated—I said I had—he said, if I would remain where I was, he would go in pursuit, and in a short time he returned with the hat, and said, "Do you intend to proceed against the parties?"—I said, "Certainly," and I gave him my address—I could not tell who the men were, but I noticed one was in the dress of a marine, and the other had a red jacket and a foraging cap on—I saw the prisoners, on the Friday following, in the Court at Woolwich, but I could not say whether they were the men I had seen that night, or not—at the time my hat was taken off, the man made some casual remark about the night, but I paid very little attention to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a parish watchman of Woolwich. I was on duty in Coleman-street that night, about a quarter to twelve o'clock—I saw three marines coming down Coleman-street—the prisoners were two of them—Wood had something which he was wrapping up in a black silk handkerchief—I saw it was this hat, and I asked where he got it—Rigby made the reply, "We found it"—I said, "I suppose you have picked it up to-night, in some of the fights between the civilians and the soldiers"—he said, "No," calling God to witness, "we found it"—I took it, and said to them, "If you come to the watch-house to-morrow night, if I do not find the owner, you shall have it"—in a minute or two, I saw the prosecutor with his cloak on, without his hat—I spoke to him, and I and my brother watchman went after the men—I saw Inch coming down the street with Rigby, and I said, "This is the man, where are the other par<lb></lb>ties?"—Rigby said, "I know nothing about them, I have just come from Deptford"—he was then taken to the watch-house, and the next morning,</p>

               <p>at six o'clock, he was brought out of the cell—he then stated, that two marines came after him in Coleman-street, and said, "We have got a hat," and he said to them, "Where did you get it?"—they said, "From a gen<lb></lb>tleman's head," and he said to them, "You have acted very wrong"—I then went to the adjutant, and, by his permission, I went on the parade, and saw the marines, but there were many absent—I went again the next day, and those who had been absent on Sunday were paraded before me, and I picked out Wood—I have no doubt whatever of his being the person—this is the hat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman, of Woolwich. I was with the last witness, and saw the three marines coming down Coleman-street—Wood had this hat, and was tying it up in a black silk handkerchief—Rigby was with him—I ran after him, and took him near the barracks—he said he was very willing to go with me—when we first met them, Rigby said they had found the hat, and there being so many fights at Mr. James's, the King's Arms, we thought they had found it there—when I ran after Rigby, I took him by the corner of the barracks—I asked him if his name was Rigby—he bad told us his name when we first met him—he said, "No—this was about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after we first met them—I am quite sure he said his name was not Rigby.</p>

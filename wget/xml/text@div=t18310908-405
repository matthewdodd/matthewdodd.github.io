I was at the water side till halfpast six o'clock, when a waterman landed two gentlemen and a lady; he made the boat fast - I went into it, and under the seat I found this handkerchief; on the day I was taken I got into a crowd - thinking I should have my hat knocked off, I took my handkerchief out of it, and put it into my pocket; the officer came and took me.</p>

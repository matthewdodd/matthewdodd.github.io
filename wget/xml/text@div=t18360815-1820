                  </hi>. I am shopman to Joseph Kaye, linen-draper, of Tottenham-court-road. On the 9th of July the prisoner came to the shop—I had reasons for desiring to examine his apron—after a long conversation I did so, and found this printed cotton—it is my master's—I had not sold it to him—I let him go to his master's house—I went after him, and asked him what he did it for—he said he did not do it—he then said he did not do it intentionally.</p>

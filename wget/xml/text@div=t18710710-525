I am an engineer, of 122, Drury Lane—on 26th June I had been to Margate, and arrived at Charing Cross Station about 11.15 At night—I was proceeding towards Drury Lane, and when near George's Court, which leads to the Adelphi, I made way for two ladies, and the prisoner Welsh rushed at me, and laid hold of my watch-chain and the strap of a sea-side glass, which I had under my coat—I had a stick, having been lame since I was three years old—I had a guinea on my chain with two split gold rings—Welsh shook me very much indeed, and I held him—he got on my left side and struck me on my left cheek, near the temple, with his right hand, and knocked me against the wall, making a wrench with his left with my guinea—the chain broke in my pocket, through having the strap, and the guinea slipped into his hand, leaving my watch in my pocket—I let go of him when he struck me, and he me down the steps towards the Adelphi—I was about to follow him when Williams laid hold of me and enquired if I had been robbed, and said "Have you lost anything?'—I thought my watch was gone, and said "I have lost my watch—I followed him towards the steps, in search of a policeman—a policeman came up, and I gave Williams in charge for stopping me in my progress, he did not attempt to run away—I described Welsh when the charge was taken, but he was in custody at that time—on 26th, two days after, I saw six or seven men in a room at the police station—I put my hand on Welsh, and told him he was my man; I recognized him directly—my head was bad, and I suffer from it very much.</p>

I am a sign-writer, of 5, Adam's Place, High Street, Borough—on 26th June, at 11.15 at night, I was crossing the Strand, near Charing Cross Station—I saw Flint and a man struggling—Flint said "You thief!"—I did not know the man at Bow Street—he got away, and another man went up; that was Williams—they were all three together, at the top of the court, struggling—Williams pushed the prosecutor, and</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On the 13th of July, about eleven o'clock at night, I saw the prosecutor laying down on the pavement, and the prisoner close to him - I saw him put his hand into his pocket; he said,"He has not got any money" - he pulled a bit of rag out of his pocket - he felt again, and pulled out some money and a tobacco-box, emptied the silver out of the box, and counted the money - there was 2l. 8s. in all - he did it openly, while I and another were looking at him. I said,"You must take care of the man and his money" - he went and got him a lodging. I told him to deliver the money up at the house - he refused, and I gave him in charge. The prosecutor had been drinking.</p>

The prisoner was in my house on the 23rd of December; he had not a lodging. He was in my house all night; I caught him in the house between five and six o'clock in the morning. I was the last person up, on the night of the 23rd of December; I had seen the prisoner the night before, before I went to bed. I saw that he was in the house between nine and ten o'clock, because I turned him from the fire. When I fastened up the house, I did not know he was in it. He did not call for anything to drink. When I fastened up the house, I thought he was out of the house. I saw him the next morning when I was awakened by my little daughter, before it was light; it was quite dark. I got up, my daughter was frightened with the noise. I struck a light, and went down stairs; my bar and till were secure, and locked the night before; I had taken the silver up stairs with me. I searched the room in which I lay; nobody was there, and then I went down stairs, and when I went into the tap-room, I found the prisoner behind the door; he had a cag of rum standing behind the back door; I presented a pistol at him, and told him, if he stirred, I would blow his brains out; and he surrendered himself. I had filled my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100052"></xptr>cags in the bar, the night before; the cag he had was not mine; but he had poured the rum into it, in the course of the night. He was searched by Morris, the officer, soon after, and fifteen shillings and tenpence in copper money were found on him, I found the bar was broken into by the shutter being forced up. He said, he pushed the shutter up. I went into the bar; I found a canvass bag of copper on the counter; the bag was not mine. My till was not broken open; it had been unlocked, and was unlocked then; I am certain I had left it locked. At the time I laid hold of this man, the back door was wide open; I had left it locked when I went to bed; it was fastened by two bolts and a bar. Upon examining the back door, there was no appearance of force on the outside. I can say with certainty, that the door was opened by some person withinside the house. There were none of the outside doors open at that time. I had no such cag in the house as I found with the prisoner; the rum to fill this cag was got out of the bar. I examined the rum in the bar, to see if there was any deficiency, and I found there was; that rum in the bar was in casks. When I laid hold of the prisoner, I asked him how often was he in the house. I made no promise to him; I did not threaten him, that I would shoot him if he did not tell me; he said he was three times in the house. I asked him what way he got into the bar, and he told me. he said, he pushed the shutter up. I found the shutter corresponding with the account he gave; it been had pushed up. He acknowledged he was concealed; he said, he concealed himself in the house. I observed that a large quantity of halfpence was gone; but I could not tell the exact amount I sent for a constable; when he came, he overhauled him; we found half a candle on him, and a few matches, also a quantity of tobacco; I missed the tobacco from the bar; it was found upon him lose, as mine was. Among the matches I found on him, none appeared to be burnt; I did not take notice if there was a match about the house that had been lighted. He had no shoes on when I laid hold of him; we asked him where his shoes were; he told Morris that they were under the water but in the yard. Morris went out, and I saw him find them where the prisoner said he had left them.</p>

             I am an officer of Shadwell. I was sent for to Mr. M'Cormack's house. I asked the prisoner if he had any thing about him, and he ststed he had not. I found nothing on him until I came to his hat, in which I found some matches, and half a candle, the wick of which was quite warm, for it had been lighted. I came to Mr. M'Cormack's house at about six o'clock; the tallow appeared to have been melted, and the tobacco stuck to it; it was put in the hat with the tobacco loose. I found this tobacco in his hat also. I asked him if a man of the name of George had been with him, and he said that George was to have met him at six o'clock. He did not tell me who the cag belonged to until afterwards, he told me it belonged to a man who was convicted of burglary.</p>

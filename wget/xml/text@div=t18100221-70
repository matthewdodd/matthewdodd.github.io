               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a pardon to go for a soldier in the York Rangers, laying in the West Indies. When I went from Newgate I went to the Isle of Wight, and there I went on board the prison ship, from there I was drafted on board the ship with troops to go to the West Indies, and from the Isle of Wight I went to the Motherbank, and laid on board this ship five weeks. During the time I laid there, I was picked out three or four times on board the launch to fetch beef and sometimes water; and the last evening we went the water was very rough, we could not come off. During the time we staid on shore we got very much intoxicated; the whole six of us, these men that were with me, made an agreement to go away, and I being intoxicated went with them. It was not my intention to leave the regiment by no means.</p>

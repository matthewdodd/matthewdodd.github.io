                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Curtin, a porter, and live at 28, Morgan Street—the prisoner lodged in my house—I had a child named Joseph William Curtin, about two months old—on the 24th October I had just come home with my husband and child and the prisoner was quarrelling with some neighbours and when I came to the door she said "Here is my b——y landlady," and struck me on the head—she struck again and the baby received the blow on the top of his head—I was going into the door and she jammed m? and the baby in the door, and jammed the baby's head in against the door post—I screamed out "Oh, my baby! my baby!" and a neighbour opposite came and took hold of the baby with her left hand and pushed open the door, the prisoner still holding it—my husband followed in the passage and said "You have done it last; you have killed my baby," and she ran upstairs making use of some very bad language—she said nothing about the baby then—the other woman took tie baby into the back parlour and it was stunned for a time—she stayed with me till after 12 o'clock—the next morning I took it to Dr. Ray and he gave me a lotion—it died about 8 o'clock on Friday night, the 30th—the Sunday after the baby died, the 1st November, I was taking my husband's breakfast and came out of the room crying, and the prisoner said "You have got a lot to cry for, you ought to go down on your knees and thank God that I have killed your b——y little bastard"—I made no answer—there is a young man who keeps company with my daughter and it was his mother the prisoner had been quarrelling with—there is no truth in the assertion that that young man kicked the prisoner.</p>

On the Sunday morning after the child died my son, who lives in the New North Road, asked me to dinner, and I went out of the place and stopped there all Sunday, and when I came home again they began abusing me.

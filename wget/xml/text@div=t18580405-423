                  </hi>. I keep the Golden Lion, No. 42, Wardour Street, Soho.

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to Her Majesty's Mint. These coins are farthings, beaten out till they attain the circumference of shillings, then filed round to make them circular, and then filed again to represent the milling—the Britannia is filed completely off; they are then rubbed over with mercury, and would represent shillings at first sight, but it would wear off in course of time—they are precisely like a shilling on one side, except that this particular head is never put on any shilling—(<hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">suggested that this was not a false or counterfeit coin, but a genuine farthing.</hi>

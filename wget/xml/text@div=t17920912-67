               <p>"Nail it down tight;" they stopped at the White Swan, and had some oysters and beer; I got upon the fore-wheel of the waggon, and looked in where the property was lying: the waggon then went on, and stopped at the bottom of Holborn Hill at Mr. Stafford's; and while they were getting out the boxes, I went in and told Mr. Stafford he had been robbed. Mr. Stafford said,</p>
               <p>"My lads, this box looks as if it had been opened;" they denied it, and Mr. Stafford had the box opened; I went then into the waggon, and brought this parcel and this bag out of the waggon. Juner was then sent to the Compter, and the other man drove the waggon to Mr. Hillice's; and then Mr. Hillice discovered that both his boxes had been broke open.</p>

On Sunday the 27th of March, I went church, returned about one o'clock, found my back door open, and the front door only single-locked - I had double-locked it at eleven o'clock, when I went out. All the drawers were out, and the property thrown about; a 200 l. bank note, forty-two small notes, and some plate and clothes taken away. I have found nothing but the 200 l. note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I stopped payment of the 200 l. note. I got the number of it from the banker's the same morning - I did not see it again for eleven weeks.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DYER. I am a clerk in the Accountant's Office in the Bank. On the 16th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner presented a 200 l. note to be examined, which is necessary before it would be changed. I found payment had been stopped by Brown. I asked him who he brought it from? he said he brought it from Mr. Phillips - pointing to the name and direction in front of the note. It being past the hours of business, the Secretary was gone; I told him to leave it till the morning, which he did, and went away rather displeased. Next morning he came, and I sent him to the Secretary's office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I asked him where he brought it from? he said from Mr. Phillips (pointing to the name). I told him it was a stopped note, and that he must come again in the morning.</p>

            . I am sexton of the New Synagogue, Leadenhall-street. On the 21st of December I buried the prisoner's mother, she had lived in Still-alley, Houndsditch. It is the custom to have prayers every morning and evening for seven days in the room the deceased died in. The near relatives always confine themselves in the house during the seven days. I attended the prayers every day - the prisoner always appeared very ill; he was obliged to be held up to repeat a certain prayer. I was there on Sunday, the 27th of December, it was the last time of the prayers; he was present, and appeared to be worse than before.</p>

His father told me to come at the expiration of the seven days, to make the boys some clothes. I called there on Sunday to measure them - the prisoner said he was ill, and could not stand to be measured; this was about ten o'clock in the morning. I called again about twelve, and found him on the bed. The house is nearly two miles from Stepney Church.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, &amp;c. I attended the prisoner's mother - she died the latter end of December. After the death of a parent, it is the custom of the family to keep together, and say prayers for seven days; they must not absent themselves. I called at the house during the seven days, on account of the prisoner's indisposition; he was in a general state of debility, and has been a diseased man for three or four years. He was not able to stand, or even attend to the compulsory duties of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he have walked two miles seven days after his mother's death - A. It was impossible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you there every day - A. No, my son, or assistant, attended occasionally. The prisoner lived in Cock and Hoop-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you attend his mother last - A. I really cannot say. I am so taken up with one branch of my profession that I seldom went - my son mostly went.</p>

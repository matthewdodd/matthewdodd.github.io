                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 1, Adam-street East, Manchester-square. I keep a silversmith's shop—I have known the prisoner twelve months—he is a tailor—his father keeps a fruiterer's shop in Park-lane, Piccadilly, opposite Gloucester House—his father has plate of me occasionally—on Tuesday, the 13th of February, the prisoner came,</p>

               <p>to my shop and asked for half-a-dozen table spoons, and half-a-dozen dessert spoons, which his father would want for two dinners—I asked when I could have them back; he said not till the latter end of the week—he came back in half an hour, returned the dessert spoons, and said the table spoons would be sufficient, and that I could not have them back till Saturday or Monday—the prisoner did not return to me—the father came to me, and gave me, a letter which contained the duplicates of the spoons.</p>

I do assure you I will, with God's assistance, repay you in a short time. Madam, I pray for you forgiveness, and call God to witness that I will use my utmost endeavours to repay you with all possible speed. Madam, I know not how to apologise further for what I have done, than by craving your forgiveness, and I again assure you that I am telling the truth.

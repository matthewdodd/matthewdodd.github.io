                  </hi>. I am a porter in the service of the Blackwall Railway Company. About two o'clock on Saturday afternoon, the 6th of August, the prisoner and another came there—the other delivered me this order—I compared the marks on it with the marks on the dock notes, and the goods—finding it corresponded, I delivered the goods, consisting of a tierce of coffee, to the prisoner and the other man—they had a truck, and took away the coffee on the truck—on the following Monday a gentleman from Tunley and Hodson, the canal-carriers, applied for the same goods—the foreman presented him the order I had received on Saturday, the 6th of August, and it turned out to be a forged one—last Tuesday week Goodwin called—I accompanied him to the police-court, Worship-street—I was shown one of the cells, with five persons in it, and among them was the prisoner—I selected him from among the five—I have not the least doubt that he is one of the men that came for the goods.</p>

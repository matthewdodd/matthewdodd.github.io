On 22nd July, about half past 10 o'clock at night, I was at the corner of Poppin's-court, Fleet-street, and spoke to a person and his wife; while I was speaking to them the prisoner and her companion came up, and spoke to me as if I was an old acquaintance, but I had never seen them before (the other two persons left me)—they each took my arm, one on each side—I touched my right hand trowsers pocket, and found my puree safe—I had 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—the prisoner was on my right side—they then left me, and I directly after that missed my purse, and followed them; they were about two yards in advance of me—the prisoner ran up Salisbury-court, on the other side of Fleet-street—I kept my eye on her—her com<lb></lb>panion ran up Shoe-lane—I kept after the prisoner, and saw a policeman catch her—I was about three yards from her, calling, "Stop thief!"—there were three or four half Browns, two or three shillings, and gome six<lb></lb>pences in my purse, and I think there was a florin.</p>

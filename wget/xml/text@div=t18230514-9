On Thursday, the 8th of May, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, six pair of trowsers hung over my door. I was standing behind my counter, (a woman opposite had given me information) I watched and saw the prisoner take down three pair of them; he gave two pair to his companions - I ran out, but could not overtake them; the prisoner dropped one pair, and his hat fell off with a red cravat in it. As I could not overtake them, I run back, and put on a pair of shoes; I only had my slippers on before. I then went after them again, and saw the prisoner coming down James-street, into Oxford-street, without his hat; his two companions were with him - I seized him, but his companions got off. I am sure he is the man who took them. I said,</p>
               <p>"You are the man who stole my small clothes;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Where is my hat?" I said it was in my shop. I was surrounded by a set of ruffians when I collared him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received charge of the prisoner at the corner of James-street, Oxford-street. Next morning I received the hat and cravat from the prosecutor's wife, which the prisoner claimed.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up Paddington-street, and met two lads; they stopped behind me. I saw them pull down a pair of breeches, and run off. The prosecutor came calling Stop thief! I run after them, and lost my hat; but never had the breeches. He says they hung over the door, but they were against a dead wall.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 11th of January, I went to chapel, leaving him and four of my youngest children in care of the house. I returned about eight o'clock, and found he had left contrary to my orders. I missed nothing that evening, but on the 22d, I found by an advertisement that some silk laid at the public office; I then looked at my winder's book and found the silk sent out had been returned, but on looking at my dyer's book, and again referring to my silk book, I found I was two bundles of 14 lbs. each deficient. I found it at the office, and can swear to it, because we skein ours very large, and very different to most manufacturers; I know it by the size of the skein, and the silk is more common them most that I manufacture. On the 18th, when I returned from chapel, Warren had absconded. I examined my silk drawer then, but it is so large I could not miss the silk without referring to the books - I have not got my books here; but I am positive that on the 9th, before I gave out work to the winders, there were two bundles of 14 lbs. in the trunk, knotted in the same manner; and on the 22d I missed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLHHUS. Q. When did you see the advertisement - A. I was informed of it about a week before I ascertained my loss - the prisoner was with me then. I could not tell that I had lost any thing till I referred to the books. My servant, who keeps the book, is not here. I always stand by while he makes the entries, and call the work over to him. I know it by my manner of knotting the skein.</p>
               <p>Q. I might make a knot by accident exactly the same - A. Perhaps you might - there is a thread tied round eight skeins, which, my dyer says, is quite different from any that he does for other people.</p>

I followed him, and when I got to the door he was gone out without his hat. I looked down Stewart-street, and saw some one talking - I do not know whether it was him or not; a person came and talked to me, and in the mean time Warren came running from Stewart-street; I asked him who it was - he made no answer.

I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180040"></xptr>have a bundle of the same silk, which the Jury can compare. I have eight or twelve work people.</p>
               <p>WARREN'S Defence. I have often found the door open of a night, and not long ago three men came in when it was open - I have found it open scores of times. People can prove they have had silk out of his warehouse unweighted. The books cannot prove his loss.</p>

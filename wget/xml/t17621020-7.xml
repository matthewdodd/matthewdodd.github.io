I had the money mentioned in the indictment in my pocket; I soon missed it, and directly charged her with taking it. She wanted to go down stairs.

There was nobody in the room but us two. I was not criminal with her.</p>

He said, he was a married man, and was afraid of getting a bad distemper. He offered me six-pence. I said, I would not take less than a shilling. Then he offered me six-pence half-penny. He wanted to use me very ill: I would not agree to it.

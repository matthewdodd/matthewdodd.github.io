                  </hi>. I went to Oporto in 1832, and remained there some years—on the 16th of Dec. last I obtained these orders from the Portuguese Com<lb></lb>missioners—on the 16th of Dec. I saw Jeremiah Healey on the subject of selling these warrants—he was recommended to me by a man—I saw him on the day I received them—he was attending the place where the Commissioners gave these warrants—he gave me his address, and said if I disposed of them to any one he would give me as much as any man—on the 19th of Dec. I went to his house with my daughter, between nine and ten o'clock, with these warrants—I was asked up stairs—I sat down, and saw the two prisoners—they asked if I had got the bills—I produced them—I said, "I called on you to ascertain the amount you will give for these bills"—Jeremiah Healey said, 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound—the gross amount of them is 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and there is five per cent, on them till they are paid—I did not agree to sell them—he handed them back to me, and to the best of my belief I put them into my pocket in my coat—I would not swear that I did—I was then coming out, and Jeremiah said, "I hope you will perform your contract to me, to let me have them sooner than any one else"—he put his hand on my shoulder, and we talked some time—I then bade him good night, and next morning I missed them—I went to him that day, and he said he knew nothing of them—I went again on the 21st—he said he knew nothing of them—I heard no more of them till Ben wood called—I went with him to Healey's—Jeremiah said he would not give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the chance of my payment, and I had better write to the Commissioners—in consequence of information I went to Mount-street—I found Jeremiah there—I called him on one side, and said I was given to understand he had these bills, and he had best give them up; I did not want to have any more to do with him—he said, "D—n your eyes, do you think you are going to <hi rend="italic">bounce</hi> me out of them?"—Catherine was with him—she said she knew nothing at all about them—I called a policeman, and gave them both into custody—these are the orders.</p>

            . I am a merchant. The prisoner came to my house, about six weeks back; he understood that there was a ship of my brother's going to America; he wished to go in her, and I told him what the lowest terms would be. He told me he had a very valuable watch, which he was endeavouring to dispose off; but he could not get any thing near its value for it. He shewed it to me. I asked him where he got it? he said, that instead of spending his wages, he had saved up enough to purchase it. I spoke to my brother about it, and then took, the watch to Mr. M'Laughlin, a watchmaker, near our house, who was to say what the full value of it was; he said, the watch was worth fifteen pounds. The passage money on board my brother's ship was to be thirteen pounds, and I gave the prisoner the difference of two pounds. The watch hung in Mr. M'Laughlin's window after that.</p>

               <p>HUGH M'LAUGHLIN. I am a watch-maker. I was asked the value of the watch. I told Mr. Fitzgerald he might safely give fifteen pounds for it. After that it hung in my window for disposal.</p>

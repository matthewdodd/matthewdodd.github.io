               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the 27th of July last? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - A. He knocked at my Lady's door, and the footman went to open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the time? - A. I was informed some body wanted me; I went and found the prisoner; he told me I had injured his character, and that if I would give him all I had, I could not make him amends; I told him, I did not know what he could mean by that, I had never injured his character, and desired he would go about his business; I shut the door, and as soon as I had shut the door, he began knocking violently; the door was not opened, and he went down to the area door, and began knocking there; I went with the footman to the area door, and opened it; he began repeating again, that I had injured his character, and called me a f-e and a b-r, upon that I went for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you should go for a constable? - A. I did; I got a constable, and found the prisoner at a public-house over the way; I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the constable, in the presence of the prisoner, the nature of the charge? - A. I do not recollect that I did; we took him to the Justice's, and waited till the Justice fat, at seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him before Mr. Conant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not at that time got any money from you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor had he demanded any? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He was afterwards discharged by Mr. Conant, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you see the prisoner again? - A. About a minute or two after; I had got home the same night, he knocked at the door again, and repeated the same kind of abuse; I took him again before the Justice, told him he had become troublesome again, and he discharged him again.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not, at that time, demanded any money? - A. He had not; the prisoner then went home with me, and kept threatening me all the way, that I was a f-e and a b-r, and he would proclaim it in the neighbourhood where I lived; he said, he would tear my Lady's house down but he would get at me.</p>
               <p>Q. He kept threatening you in that manner all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180058"></xptr>the way? - A. Yes; I was very much alarmed and frightened for my reputation, and for fear of losing my situation, in which I was very comfortable, and which I was sure I should, if he made a disturbance; he said, if I would make him a handsome present, he would not trouble me any more; I asked him what he meant; he said, if I would give him four guineas; after some hesitation, I consented to give him four guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you give him the four guineas? - A.Because I was so alarmed and frightened, I thought, in all probability, I should lose my situation if I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this conversation from your Lady's house? - A. About one hundred yards; I then went home and got a five pound note, and a one pound note; I went to the baker's to get change for the five pound note, and I could only get two one pound notes and a guinea in part; I then returned to him with the two one pound notes, the one I had before, and the guinea which I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q.That was three shillings short of four guineas? - A. Yes; I then went home, and mentioned it to my Lady's brother, and he advised me to prosecute him; I went to Mr. Conant again, and he issued a warrant to apprehend him; I did not know in what part of the town to look for him, and I did not find him till the 9th; I met him in St. Paul's church-yard; he said to me, you owe me three shillings; I took him by the collar, and he struck me several times with his hat; two young men came up to my assistance, and the prisoner was secured and taken before Mr. Conant.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that the prisoner is the man who so conducted himself towards you? - A. I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever done any thing yourself to work an injury to this man, in his character, in any way whatever? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. I hardly need ask you - did you part with this money willingly, or did you do it from fear? - A. From the great apprehension and fear I had of losing my situation in life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you know the place from whence the prisoner came? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Where is that place? - A.Bury St. Edmunds.</p>
               <p>Q.Besides knowing the place from whence he came - did you not know him personally? - A. I did know him slightly personally.</p>
               <p>Q.When he came, he enquired for you by name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And the first complaint he made was, that you had injured his character very much, and that if you were to give him all you had, you could not make him remends? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say where it was you had so injured this character? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately have you been at Norwich? - A. Not these seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not mention any place whatever, where he said you had been spreading reports injurious to his character? - A. He said, some person at Norwich had told him so.</p>
               <p>Q. You denied it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner became in a passion, and used the opprobrious expressions you have mentioned? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not, when he came down the area, repeat his charge, that you had injured his character? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any person here who heard what passed, besides youself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The charge made by him was utterly false? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.However, he did not believe your denial? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of those expressions, he and you went to Mr. Conant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not Mr. Conant tell you to go out and settle it between yourselves? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q.After he came back from Mr. Conant, did he not again repeat upon you the charge of having injured his character? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You still denied it? - A. I certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you still he did not believe you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.He then repeated those opprobrious expressions, and he again went before Mr. Conant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.After he came from Mr. Conant the second time, did he not repeat his charge upon you, that you had injured his character? - A. I cannot say whether he did at that time or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not demand this money of you as a recompence for the injury you had done to his character? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. No person but yourself was present at that conversation? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore we must take your account of it entirely - one of the first things he said, was, if you were to give him all you had in the world, you could not make him a compensation for the injury you had done him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not make this demand of four guineas, as a compensation for that injury? - A.He did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he not come to Clerkenwell Sessions last Saturday, in discharge of his bail, not in custody? - A. I saw him there.</p>
               <p>Q. He had given bail to answer your charge? - A. I did not enquire into the bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say there was any other charge against him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he not at Clerkenwell Sessions, perfectly at liberty? - A. I saw him there.</p>
               <p>Q. At large? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180059"></xptr>Q. When you first of all saw him, you knew him perfectly well? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You knew his name? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.You knew his connections at Bury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.When he came to Clerkenwell, he was not aware he was to be called upon to answer a capital charge? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever take away his character in any respect? - A.Never.</p>

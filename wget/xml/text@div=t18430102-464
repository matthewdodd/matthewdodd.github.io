About twenty minutes to one o'clock in the morning of the 22nd of Dec, I overtook the prisoner in St. Martin's-le-grand—she accosted me, and asked me to go with her—I told her 1 would not—she went on with me—when we got to Foster-lane, I stopped and talked with heir—I felt her hand in my left hand trowsers pocket in which I had a purse, containing a half-sovereign, and 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my purse—I told her of it—she denied it—I said unless she gave me back my purse I would call the police—she offered me another purse which was empty—I returned that, and told her that I would have nothing to do with it—I called the police, and gave her in charge—after that I put my hand into my left coat pocket, and found my purse—I examined it, and there was from 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. gone—I am sure it had been in my trowsers' pocket.</p>

               <p>GEORGE BYERS. I am the landlord of the Waterman's Arms. About half-past five o'clock in the morning of the 21st of November, I was awoke by the prisoner, who could not open the door - I let him out - He said he was going to the Docks. When the prosecutor got up he missed his watch. He was taken on the 22d, and the watch found upon him.</p>

As I was going home in Spun-yard, from Mr. Watson's Wharf, St. Catherine's, I was knocked down and lost all my money; I had three half crowns, sixpence and a halfpenny; they took it out of my pocket, the 28th of May about half after nine o'clock: I received the first blow in a place called the <placeName id="t17920704-17-crimeloc95">Dark-entry, Lower East Smithfield</placeName>

I was in the action of stooping; the place is not high enough to walk upright; that blow flung me forward, as I was coming out of the entry; the prisoner in the blue great coat (Davis) struck me in the stomach and brought me against the pavement, which rendered me insensible. I never saw the other man to my knowledge, nor Davis; I was not in liquor. I never got my money again.</p>

               <p>I saw the young man (Davis) use the prosecutor very ill, and hit him several times; he hit him with his fist: I did not see him take any thing from him; and I saw the other prisoner (Lightwood) kick him with his foot; that was after Davis was gone away.</p>

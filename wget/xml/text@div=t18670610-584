                  </hi>. I am town traveller to Kay and Evans, silk warehousemen, of Old Change—on Saturday, 18th May, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner in the warehouse—he did not tell me what his business was—I missed him out of the room, and next saw him going out at the warehouse door—he had a loose coat on, and I fancied there was something sticking out of it; so I followed him to Friday Street, went behind him, and felt it under his coat—I then touched him on the shoulder, and asked him to come back to see our silk buyer—directly he got into the room he pushed the silk between two bales of silk on the counter—I took it up, and said, "This is what I wanted you to come back for; I have every reason to believe it is my employers'."</p>

               <p>nothing about it"—at the station he refused his address—I saw him in the cell on the following Monday week, after the remand, and said, "Since you have been in custody we have found your address; it has been searched, and there are a quantity of things found there; I have also seen Mr. Newbury and Mr. Curry, a butcher and a pawnbroker, of Walworth, and received from them some duplicates which they say you deposited with them as security for money advanced"—he said, "The case looks black against me; I am in the habit of buying tickets, and I must have bought these tickets"—I said, "A piece of that silk I spoke of when I saw you last was found at your lodging, and the duplicate to which I referred relating to silk, the property of Messrs. Arthur, Kay, and Smith"—he said, "I sold it to a man at the European public-house, opposite the Court, with whom I have had many transactions in silk, but I do not know his name and address; it was an understood thing that I should not."</p>

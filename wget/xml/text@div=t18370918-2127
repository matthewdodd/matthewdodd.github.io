                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner fourteen or fifteen years On the 3rd of August I was at the back of Shoreditch church, at the Feathers' skittle-ground—I was not playing at skittles with the prisoner—we had a quarrel on this day, and it is very likely I irritated him—it was me that was in fault instead of him—we fell out about a half-crown which he owed me—I do not wish to have more to do with it—it was not my inclination to prosecute—I was made to come up before—it is not my wish—we quarreled, and fell out, and then had a fight—a regular set-to—taking our clothes off, and fighting—it might be between one and two o'clock,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183709180081"></xptr>
               <p>but I am not certain—I had the best of the fight, and we went inside the house and had a pot of beer together—we were not friends exactly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you say to him, or he to you, while you were drinking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I forget now—I own I am in fault—(I have come from Clerkenwell prison now—I am there for a case of uttering counterfeit coin—I have been there before)—after having the pot of beer I went out to go to the water-closet, and when I was coming out of there, he made an attempt to stab me—he was by the side of the water-closet, standing there—I cannot exactly catch the words he used, now—he had a pocket-knife in his hand—a clasp-knife—I do not know what size it was—I saw it—it was not very big—it was open—I called out, "Murder"—as I was coming out he made a thrust at me, at the side of me—I ran back into the water-closet—people came out and held him—I remained there, it might be twenty minutes or half an hour, and then went out to Sweet-apple-court, by the side of the public-house—when I went out I was stabbed again—I was talking to a man, and the prisoner came out and stabbed me—I did not hear him say any thing—he ran away—he followed after me, and fell down.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Attend, because you will not be let off in this way, we have got your deposition—did he fall down without having done any thing to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it was after the time he stabbed me—he stabbed me the first time, then ran after me, overtook me, and stabbed me again in the lower part of my back—I ran into a neighbour's house, and he was taken into custody, I believe, and I was taken to the hospital—it was when he ran after me, that he fell down over a mangle rope—I remained somewhere about three weeks at the hospital, and then ran away before I was well—I am well now—a day or two before this happened I had a quarrel with him about a half crown, and I went to his house, and beat him and his wife—I hit him with my fist—I had no knife—I hit him and his wife, and kicked them both—I was not asked about this before the Magistrate—I wanted to tell them—I wanted to have nothing to do with it, before the Magistrate, but they obliged me to come here—I did not go into their bed-room and kick them—they were not in bed—there were people in the house, up stairs, I believe—it was three days before the 3rd of Au gust, I believe—I live about a quarter of a mile from the prisoner—I had not seen him between the time I kicked him and his wife, and the day he stabbed me—he knew where I lived, and I knew where he lived.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On the 3rd of August I was in Sweet-apple-court, and saw the prosecutor running up the court, and the prisoner after him, with an open knife in his hand—it was a pocket clasp knife—I have one nearly the size of it—it was not quite so long as that I saw him stab the prosecutor—I was leading master's cart, and heard a screaming and hallooing—the prosecutor was running up the court and the prisoner after him, and just as they got to me, the prisoner stabbed him in the lower part of his back—I did not see the prosecutor give him any blow—the prosecutor ran into the next house but one, No. 8—the prisoner made an attempt to run after him, but fell over a mangle—I had not been with them before, and did not know any thing about the first falling out—when the prisoner was shutting up the knife, he said he would do for the b——if it <hi rend="italic">caused</hi> his life—I did not hear him say any thing else—I heard no conversation between them, and saw no blow given by the prosecutor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see a woman running after him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A woman and the prisoner both—I do not know whether she was his wife—they did not appear in company together—I saw the woman gnawing a hat to pieces in the court—she was in a great rage—I could not under stand what she said—she was two or three rods behind him—she was not running in the same direction—she was up the other side of the court, gnawing Brown's hat to pieces—I did not hear the prisoner tell Brown he had struck his wife—the direct way up the court is from the public-house—the prosecutor and prisoner were running—the woman was following them at a distance off, and a whole mob after her.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Sweet-apple-court, and saw the woman strike Brown over the head twice with a pot, and then throw it at him—I picked up the pot and took it in to the publican—when I came out there was a cry that the man was stabbed—I had seen the prisoner running out after the prosecutor, and he had something in his hand, which appeared to be a knife—I did not hear any thing said by any of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of St. Bartholomew Hospital. The prosecutor was brought there on Thursday, the 3rd of August—I examined him between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—he had a wound in the lower part of his back, on the right side, and a slight wound on the head—the wound in the back was from two inches to two inches and a quarter deep, and an inch and a quarter long—it was in the small of the back—it was such a wound as might be inflicted with a clasp knife—I did not consider it at all dangerous—there was a smaller wound on the scalp—I think that was done by a pewter-pot, or any blunt instrument might do it—it was of a very trifling nature—he left the hospital on the 18th of August, in a fortnight—it was necessary for him to remain—I wished him to remain till he was perfectly well—he was not discharged by myself or the surgeon.</p>

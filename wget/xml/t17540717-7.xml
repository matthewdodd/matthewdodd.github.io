She offer'd it me to sell; there being a gentleman's crest on it, a gentleman being in my shop desired to see it, I shew'd it him; she flew at him and took it, and put it in her pocket, it was then in two pieces. I said if she would leave it I would advertise it; after that she said I had got it, and used insulting language. I sent for an officer and stopp'd her. The other prisoner was with her; she had concealed the piece of spoon, and had deliver'd it to the other person.

            . I am constable, Perkins denied delivering the handle of the spoon, and owned she had it; she said she bought it of a woman in Wapping, after that of a beggar woman in the street, then of a man. They both agreed in their accounts. I took them to a public house, and searched Perkins, and found nothing upon her, and found the handle in Macdonald's shoe, and saw it pull'd out thro' the toe of her shoe, it was on her right foot. Mrs. Threlkill deliver'd the bowl of the spoon when I came there.</p>

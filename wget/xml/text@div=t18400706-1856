                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to James Coster and another, of Fountain-court, Aldermanbury. The prisoner came there on the 13th of June—he did not come to me in the first instance, but some goods were brought down to our entry-room for me to give to him—I asked him who they were for—he said, "For Clark and Musson, of Islington"—they deal with us—I delivered the goods to him—this was on the 13th—on the 17th he came again, and I delivered to him some ducape handkerchiefs—I said, "Who are the goods for?"—he said, "Clark and Musson"—he came again on the 22nd, and I got into an omnibus with him, intending to go to Clark and Musson, but on the way he said, "I am guilty, it is no use going any further"—I gave him in charge at the post-office—I had told him in the warehouse that I would go with him to Clark and Musson.</p>

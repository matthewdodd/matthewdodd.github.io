I keep the Bee-hive public-house, Christian-street, St. George's-in-the-East—on 6th January the prisoner came and asked for a pennyworth of gin—I gave it to him—he put down a bad sixpence—I said, "That is a bad sixpence"—he said, "I did not know; I will give you another"—he put down another, and I said, "That is another bad sixpence"—I said, "Where did you get this money from?"—he said that he had been round the highway, and had changed a half-crown, and that was how he got the change—I said, "Have you got any more money than these?"—he said, "No;" so I took the gin back and gave him the sixpences back, and let him go—my house is 200 or 300 yards from the Mallard Arms—I followed him out to the Mallard Arms—I heard the landlady say, "You vagabond! if I had got a polioeman here, I would give you in charge; you have got bad money"—that was as I was going in—I went in, and a constable was sent for, and she gave him in charge—I saw two bad sixpences on the counter there.</p>

               <p>I am porter at Mr. Walkers, in Mark-lane, and I went to Drake's; I was down at the watch-house, and Drake's boy came down; I went along with him, and he told me the prisoner had got two of their pots, and I stroked her down the side, and felt a pint pot upon her; I insisted upon her pulling it out, and she said there was nothing there, and then she pulled it out, I stroked her down the other side, and there I felt another pint pot, (produces two pint pots and a quart pot.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To Drake). Do you know any thing about the finding of that quart pot? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the woman been in your house that day? - A. I did not see her, she often came, (they were deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing at all about them; I went to the house, but how they came in my pocket, I don't know any thing about it, I was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mills). Was she in liquor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she seem to know what she was about? - A. I don't know, she knocked me about pretty well, when I charged her with it.</p>

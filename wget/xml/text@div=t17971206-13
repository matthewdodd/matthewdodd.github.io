               <p>Q. How far was this from Wilderness-row? - A. About four miles, as near as I can guess; I asked her to come home with me, and she said, she could not come home with me; I did prevail upon her to come home with me; I called to my little boy to give me the key out of the window, this was between seven and eight o'clock; I asked her to get a light, my little boy went out and fetched a light, and, upon taking the infant off the bed, I missed the sheets; I asked her where the sheets where; she said they were on the bed; looking further about my dirty linen, I missed a pair of white cotton stockings; I asked her for the new shift, if she had finished it; she said, no, it lay upon a chair in the parlour; I said, Molly, I am certain you must have taken these things, and if you will deliver them to me, I will not hurt you; she said she had got them, and she would keep them till I paid her her wages; I prevailed upon her to stop with me till morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any wages due to her? - A. No; I did not agree with her for any; she came to me as charity, and I told her I would satisfy her for her trouble; she came to me out of charity, for victuals and drink; she came to town with me, and said, when she came to town, she would deliver them voluntarily up; she would not deliver them when I came to town; I searched for them, and found them at a tea-dealer's, in Drury-lane, where she lodged; she lodged there a good while before; I found the things named in the indictment in her room.</p>

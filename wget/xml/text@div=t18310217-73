On the 31st of December we took stock, and discovered some deficiences; we heard something of the prisoner, and I went with the officer to his lodging -I think it is in White Horse-court; I there found these silver ornaments in a drawer - they are worth 8s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. There was plenty of time for him to have got rid of them? A. Yes - we had no difficulty in finding the lodging; the ornaments are silver shells in an unfinished state; they are articles on which he might have been employed; the men are not allowed to take work home - these are struck from a private die; there is no die like it in the trade - we may have sold one hundred, but these are not finished; he never sold small articles for us - he arrived at his lodgings while I was there.</p>

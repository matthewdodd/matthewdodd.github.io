                  </hi>. I live at 11, Martin Street, Blackfriars—on 2nd: November, between 12 and 1 o'clock a.m., I was in a fish-shop in Friar Street—there was a disturbance outside, and I saw Hawkins lying on the ground bleeding—I went to pick him up, and while I was stooping over him the prisoner struck me twice—after I had assisted Hawkins up; the prisoner challenged me to fight—I asked him what he meant, and he ran away—a few minutes afterwards I was going home with Hawkins, and the prisoner met me and threw this brick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at me—it hit me on my forehead—I staggered; Hawkins ran to catch me, and the prisoner knocked him down—I was taken to the hospital, and had an operation performed under chloroform—he was three or four yards from me when he threw the brick—I recognise the prisoner because I have known him a long time, but I never spoke to him before—I was in the hospital from 2nd November till 9th April—I had not been engaged in the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, I was only passing by.</p>

                  </hi>. On 2nd November I had a fight with the prisoner, and he knocked me down, kicked me, and ill-used me—Jenkins came up, and the prisoner struck him twice and challenged him to fight—Johnson asked him what he meant, and he ran away and searched for this brick, and came up from behind him and threw it at him—I went to Jenkins, and the prisoner struck me and said "Run, Johnnie, run"—I was not quite sober.</p>

I was putting up some shutters in Friar Street and saw a bother near the eel-shop—I did not see the prisoner then, but about 12.30 I saw him pick a brick up—he put it behind him, walked three or four yards, and heaved it at Jenkins—it struck him on his forehead, and he fell against the wall—the prisoner then knocked the other <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi> down, and then he walked a little way and ran off.</p>

                  </hi>. In November last I was house surgeon at Guy's Hospital—Jenkins was admitted there on the morning of February 3rd, suffering from a wound on his forehead about two inches long—I removed a portion of the bone, under chloroform—his life was in danger—on 18th. March, he was put under chloroform again, and another operation was performed for the purpose of closing the wound—this brick would produce' the wound—the bone there is divided into two portions, and the upper layer had to be removed—if the brick had alighted on another part of the skull it would probably have killed him on the spot, great force must have been used.</p>

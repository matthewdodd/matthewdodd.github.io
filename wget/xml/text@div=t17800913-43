               <p>On a Saturday, about the 17th of July, at about nine o'clock in the evening as I was going from Cheapside to Westminster a man followed me from St. Clement's church to the <placeName id="t17800913-43-crimeloc248">New Church in the Strand</placeName>

He asked me if he should see me safe there? I said I was going with a gown and he could not go with me. Going by the New Church he picked up an old woman's pocket, he said what there was in the pocket I should have part of. The first street we came to he was to see what was in the pocket. He opened the pocket; there was a green purse, and in the purse a ring, it was valued at six guineas by Malone, who was called to read a note that was found in the pocket. I was to have part of it, because I saw him pick it up; he said he had not the cash about him to give me the part, but he would go to a person's house and borrow it; he left me and came back and said the people were out at supper and would not be home till twelve o'clock; he asked me if I had any money about me or any thing I could leave in his hands for him to trust me with the ring. I told him I had not any thing about me but a lady's gown I was going home with to Westminster, which I did not choose to part with. He said he did not want the gown he only wanted the ring.</p>
               <p>Had you the ring at that time? - No, he had it; he said he wanted it to send to a person in the country he lay under great obligations to, and had nothing to leave in my hands, while he took it. I said I did not want the ring. He told me he had not the money about him; that he would take the gown and be with me in half an hour. He said the gown was not the value of the ring, and he took the cloak off my back. I gave him the gown but not the cloak.</p>
               <p>Did he give you the ring? - Yes, on taking the cloak, and went away, and promised to be with me in half an hour.</p>
               <p>He never came? - No. I went home, and the people of the house looked at it and said it was worth nothing. This is the ring (producing it).</p>
               <p>Which of the prisoners took the cloak? - Malone. The other took the gown; Kirvin spoke to me first, and Malone came up to value the ring.</p>
               <p>Did both go away together? - No, Kirvin went first; he put the cloak up in the napkin with the gown, and took both away and left me with the other man. They were taken by Sir

               <p>I met Kirvin and Malone in company in Hatton-garden; Malone had this gown tied up in an handkerchief. I knowing them asked him what he had got there? He said it was a gown Kirvin had just taken out of pawn and made him a present of to give to his sister. I thought it was a gown not come honestly by; I took them to the office, and it was advertised, and this girl came and shewed a piece of the same pattern before she saw the gown. She told the same story then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130046"></xptr> which she has now. Her mistress came with her. She is apprentice to a mantua-maker. About a week before this happened, I had Kirvin in custody; I searched him then, and he had a ring in his pocket wrapped up in a piece of cotton, and a receipt for six pounds or six guineas. I opened it before the justice and shewed it, but I cannot say whether this is the same ring, though it is very much like it.</p>

               <p>Kirvin lives in Little Wild-street; I live in Gravel-lane, in the Borough. I went up to his lodgings on the 15th of July at about twelve or one o'clock in the day, he was sick in bed; his wife was not within, he entreated me to stay till she came in. His wife came in about five o'clock. I staid all that night. I never left his apartment till between eight and nine o'clock next morning. All that time he was not able to get up.</p>
               <p>Do any other people lodge in the same house? - It is a lodging house; different families lodge in it; but I am not acquainted with them.</p>
               <p>How long was he confined to his bed? - I do not know, I did not see him for a week or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Did any body come backwards and forwards that afternoon while you was there? - Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it? - Saturday.</p>
               <p>How came you to take particular notice of the day of the week and month? - It was my son's birth-day, who is seven years of age.</p>

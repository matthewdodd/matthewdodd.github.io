                  </hi>. I am gardener and bailiff to Lady Fuller, at Ruyslip. On Thursday, 24th April, I received three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes at the Uxbridge Bank—on the following Tuesday I paid two of them into the Uxbridge Savings' Bank—the other note I put into my breeches pocket—I examined it when I got home, and put it into my pocket again—I cannot say how it got out—I did not examine my pocket again till the Wednesday afternoon—I went to chapel on the Tuesday evening, and got home about eight o'clock—when I went to bed I laid my breeches by the bedside, and put them on again next morning without examining them—on the Wednesday I was at work in the garden the whole day—there was no hole in my breeches pocket—the note was loose in my pocket—if I had not lost it I should have had occasion to have paid it away to the corn-man—I believe the prisoner lives at Ruyslip—I know but little of him—he never worked for me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stableman, and live at Uxbridge. I have seen the prisoner about—on Wednesday morning, yesterday fortnight, he came to me early, and said he wanted change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—I said, "Who for?"—he said, "For my master, Mr. Bowles"—I said, "On what bank?"—he said, "Uxbridge"—I said that bank would not be open till nine o'clock, but any one would cash it—I told him to go to Mr. Homewood's—he went there, and then to another place—I afterwards went with him to Mr. Tyler's public-house—he called for a pint of half-and-half, and said, "I want change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note"—Mr. Tyler asked him, "Who for?"—he said, "For my master, Mr. Bowles"—Mr. Tyler said, "If it is the bailiff, Mr. Bowles, the only thing I can do is to give him two fives for it," and he gave him two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes—I saw the prisoner give Mr. Tyler this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—it looked like an old note of the Uxbridge Bank—it was wet, and it looked as if it had been torn in two, and spliced together again with a bit of paper at the back of it—I made a remark that it was wet, and the prisoner said he pulled it out of his pocket in coming by Clark's pond, and it blew out of his hand, and he was obliged to put his foot on it to prevent its going into the water.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep an inn, at Uxbridge.

Bank of England notes for it—when he said it was for Mr. Bowles, Muross said, "I suppose it is right"—he told me the same in the market-place—I afterwards gave the same 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note to the policeman—I have not got my two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes back—there was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. found on the prisoner, and a new suit of clothes that he bad bought with the money.</p>

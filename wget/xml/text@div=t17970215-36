No; nothing of the kind; I told him I was very sorry for it, I did not think he was that kind of man; I took Mallard to the watch-house, and insisted upon Million going with me, which he did; and the next day they were taken before a Justice, and committed; they were together at the time that I came up to them; I have lost eight dozen of pots in two months; I have been in that house better than three years; my name is upon the pots; and one of the pots is numbered with this instrument.(Producing a tool).</p>

             sworn. - I am pot boy to Mr. Knight; my master sent me up to call the maidservant, on the third of this month, about six o'clock in the morning; and I saw a quart pot under the soldiers' bed, and one upon the stairs.</p>

Yes; there was a new quart pot marked No. 19, upon the stairs, and a plain one under the bed; I told my master of it; and my master sent me up again about a quarter of an hour after, because the maid servant did not come down; and then the soldiers came down, and had a pot of porter in the tap-room; when I went up stairs to call the maid again, there were no pots there; my master went out into the yard, and the soldiers went out at the door; as he came into the house again, he went up stairs to call my mistress, and then went after them.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the pots again if you should see them? - A. Yes; there is No. 19 among them; the pewter dish used to stand just within the kitchen.</p>

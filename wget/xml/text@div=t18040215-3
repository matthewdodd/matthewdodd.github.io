            , a man followed us; he came and passed us close on my right-hand side, and demanded my money; he had a knife in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a knife? - A. It was a middling size clasp-knife, open; he held it close to my breast.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the knife was pointed to you? - A. The blade of the knife; I put my hand in my pocket, he bid me be quick, and not give him the trouble of searching me; I said, take that knife away, and I will give you all I have; I then gave him my purse; he asked me if that was all I had; he took my purse, there was a one pound Banknote in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the other lady? - A. He demanded her money, and used the same language to her as he did to me; he presented the knife to her as he did to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this? - A. About four or five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150004"></xptr>minutes; he then bid us to walk along; we walked along, and soon after met a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you walked on, did you take any notice of him so as to know him again? - A. Yes; as soon as we met the gentleman, we immediately turned round, and saw him run across Ball's Pond fields. I told the gentleman what had happened, and said I should be much obliged to him if he would pursue the man. I saw the man running across Ball's Pond fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the gentleman pursue him? - A. Yes, he did; I saw him pursue him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take the man? - A. No; we lost sight of the man going across Ball's-Pond fields. I then went on.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did you see your purse again? - A. Never. I never saw the prisoner again till he was brought up to Bow-street last Saturday week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of his dress? - A. Yes; he was dressed in a dark-coloured coat; he had a linen apron on, very black; he had a silk handkerchief over the top part of his face, and had placed it down to the top part of his lip; he had it down when he demanded my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; is he the man you saw at Bow-street? - A. Yes; I was struck with the lower part of his face. I think it is the man by the lower part of his face, and his figure altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark? - A. It was not very light; it was between the hours of three and four; it was getting dark; when I was going up to Canonbury-house I noticed a man whom I believe to be the man who robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to see him running across the fields to some distance? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I suppose you never saw this man before? - A. Never before that day.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that it was getting dusk; that he had an handkerchief which covered his nose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your only observation was from the lower part of his face; merely from his nose down to his chin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A person coming and presenting a knife to you, would much alarm you? - A. Yes, I was frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had the good fortune to recover your purse, nor your note? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on the 3d of January; the prisoner was not taken up till about ten days ago; there was a period of above twenty days; and you say you think this is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. No other violence was used; only the knife put to your breast? - A. Only threats if we were to call out.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Were you in the field after that robbery? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the person that first met that lady? - A. No; I am a patrol of Bow-street; I had an information of another robbery, after that I heard of this robbery. I then went in pursuit of this man, and on the 31st of January I apprehended him, very near were he committed this robbery, in Canonbury-fields, at one o'clock in the day time; that is another robbery committed on the 6th of February. I saw him standing in the fields by himself. I went up to him, and said where are you going? He said to take a walk. I said where do you live? He said in Bowling-green-lane, Clerkenwell. I said take off your hat? He did; I found nothing in his hat. I told him he answered the description of some man that had robbed in that field. I searched his pocket; and in his left hand waistcoat pocket I found a knife, in his fob pocket I found four duplicates, and no money. I told him I must take him before the Magistrate, which I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I was stopped by that gentleman, he asked me where I was going. I immediately pulled out of my pocket some mallow-leaves I had been gathering. He immediately said I answered the description of a man that had committed a robbery last Monday week. He searched me; he took off my hat; he searched me about a quarter of an hour; not finding any thing, I thought he would never leave off. After taking every thing from me but the mallow-leaves, which I gathered for my legs, which are very bad, he said I must go with him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Cox.) Had he some mallow-leaves in his pocket - A. He had a few dead leaves; they were quite dry; and were not gathered that day.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I live in Rupert-street. On the 14th of September, about eight o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in <placeName id="t18331017-68-crimeloc382">Saville-row</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. JONES. Q. Are you married? A. Yes - I was quite sober; I did not stop with the prisoner more than a minute and a half - I did not speak to her first - I did not ask her to do anything - I did not lay my hands on her; I only put her hand away - there were four sovereigns in my purse, but no silver; I did not tell the prisoner I had no silver, or very little - I did not ask her to grant me any favour on the spot; I will swear I did not unbutton my trousers - I will swear I did not unbutton any part of my dress - she did not tell me she was not in the habit of exposing herself in the street, if I was - she did not say that I had acted very indecently, and very ungentlemanly towards her - it was not dark, the lamps were lighted - I did not ask her to take me home with her - she took hold of me; I could not have got from her but by violence - she had run forty yards before I overtook her - I will swear it was as far as that - she told me to give her into custody- I did not search her; I had hold of her till I got her to the officer - I distinctly swear I did not search her in the street, nor attempt it - when I took her, I said,"I know you have got my purse; if you will give it me I don't mind giving you a shilling to get something to drink".</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did she lay hold of you? A. By my coat; I suppose she saw the top of my purse outside my waistcoat pocket.</p>

             (police-constable C 111). I took the prisoner - I went to Clifford-street, and waited till they returned with a light; I then got over the rails of No. 19, and picked up this purse, containing four sovereigns - the prosecutor said he had lost his purse and four sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not a place where it might have dropped, if two persons had been standing there? A. No, it must have been thrown; it was six feet from the footpath.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. We stopped at several places, and he asked me to do several indecent things, which I cannot describe - he wanted me to take him home, and because I would not, he asked me to go to Shepherd-street, and said he would give me what he had; I would not - he then went about a yard from me, and returned and said I had robbed him.</p>

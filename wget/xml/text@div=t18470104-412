                  </hi> I am managing clerk to Mr. Charles Blake, a solicitor—I was at the Master's-office, in the Queen's Bench, on Saturday the 12th of Dec.—it was from half-past two till three o'clock—I had a lawyer's blue bag with me containing a number of papers in various actions—I left my bag in the outer-office—I had occasion to go into the inner-office, and I found the prisoner there begging of the Master's clerk, who gave him, I think, a sixpence, and he left the office—I came out into the outer-office, and the Master's clerk came with me—I missed my bag—I turned to the Master's clerk and said I had left my bag there not half a minute ago—I went after the prisoner, and overtook him in Fetter-lane, with my bag—I seized him by the collar, and accused him of stealing my bag—he muttered somethings, that he should have taken it home, and then afterwards he said he was a lawyer's clerk out of a situation, and he was requested to fetch it by a friend, who told him he would leave it there for him—I kept him in custody till a policeman came, and I handed him over to him—I think there were 110 sheets of paper in the bag, (I counted them at Guildhall) and a number of small papers, such as summonses, and other things-they were papers the loss of which would have created extreme inconvenience in the office-we do not know the inconvenience it might have occasioned—it. Was not unlikely a reward might have been offered for finding them—they were not of any value except to our house as attorneys.</p>

Yes, I did—I gave you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—it was a paper I lost very mysteriously in the same way—I was using an affidavit at the Judge's-chambers, I laid it down while I wrote the jurat, and on looking round it was gone—it was one affidavit—the prisoner seemed to understand the paper—I laid down my bag and was not absent more than half a minute—I was not absent two or three minutes—from the time I saw the prisoner till the policeman came it might be about two minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did I not state I was sent by a person who I Knew; that I met him, and asked if he had seen a Mr. Bissett, and he said he gone into the mas<lb></lb>ter's-office, and had a bag with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the second occasion you did—you stated the same to the policeman, and at the station—you did not state, that, not seeing him, you concluded he had gone away and left his bag behind him—I recollect perfectly well the whole conversation—you stated you were a respectable lawyers's clerk out of a situation, and I think I made the observa<lb></lb>tion, that if you were a respectable lawyer's clerk, you were not a respectable clerk to a lawyers—you did state you would have taken the bag home, but you was not in the right road to our office.</p>

The prisoners was given in charge to me by Mr. Philpot for stealing the bag and papers—the prisoners said it was not likely he intended to steal the bag; he was sent by a friend to the Master'sp-office for a bag, and he took this in mistake—I said, "Very likely you will be able to produce that friend"—on the Monday he said, it being near the time of the office closing, he took the bag with the in<lb></lb>tention of reading the papers and restoring them to the owners—I found on him a begging petition with some names on it.</p>

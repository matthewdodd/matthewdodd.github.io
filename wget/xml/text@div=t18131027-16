A woman run against me, and knocked some halfpence out of my hand; I gave her a push; Griffiths came up at that moment, and said, d - n your eyes, can you strike a man? I said, I did not want to strike a man or a woman, all I wanted was to take up my halfpence. I laid down my basket to take up the halfpence, I was hit on both sides of my head, and knocked down, by Griffiths and Durham. I rushed into the public-house to protect myself; I saw the woman and the two prisoners come out of the same house; they pursued me into the public-house; my watch was gone before I went into the house; I felt them pull it out. When I got into the public-house they both began to strike me, and I struck them, with that they knocked me down again. My wife threw herself over me to save me when I was down.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270011"></xptr>They went away, and I followed them to see which way they went, and I went to Lambeth-street office.</p>

The prisoners were taken in about twenty minutes, at a public-house in Wentworth-street; the officers accompanied me there, and we took them; they were then taken to the watchhouse, and searched: nothing was found upon them. I have never seen my watch since.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was called on by the last witness; I and Griffiths went up George-yard as the prosecutor said they went that way; we went into the Princess of Wales public-house, in Wentworth-street; the prosecutor there pointed the two prisoners out; they were sitting with some girls; we took the two prisoners into custody; we searched them, and found nothing upon them. They denied any knowledge of the prosecutor's watch; they said, they had been striking an Irishman. Denham said, see where the Irish thief has torn my jacket; they wished they had given him more of it.</p>

               <p>Griffith's Defence. I was coming towards Whitechapel; I met Durham; him and me went into a public-house to have something to drink, and as we were coming out the prosecutor came in; a girl with us ran against the prosecutor, and knocked some halfpence out of his hand; he struck the girl. I said, why do not you strike one of us; he struck me. Durham said, if you strike her I'll strike you; they got a fighting. The prosecutor pulled off his top-coat; they fought near a quarter of an hour; after that this man came back, and said, he had lost his watch; he never mentioned any thing about it before.</p>
               <p>Durham's Defence. The same.</p>

             sworn. - On Tuesday, the 5th of June, about half-past one in the morning, as I was going up St. Martin's lane, (I had been at my club on Monday, the 4th,) a girl took hold of my arm and asked me where I was going; I told her I was going home; she asked me, if I would go home with her; I told her no; I lodge at No. 16, Tottenham-street, Tottenham-court road.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the woman at the bar? - A. No; some other woman; I walked with the woman till I got to Drury-lane; I crossed Drury-lane into <placeName id="t18040704-5-crimeloc28">Charles-street, near Broad St. Giles's</placeName>

               <p>Q. What did the other man do? - A. He held my feet, and the other woman that I walked with from St. Martin's lane, was on the right hand side of me, holding my feet too, and

             went with me to Marlborough-street; he was bound to appear, but he would not come.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your watch on the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober at this time, after being at your club? - A. Yes, I was not very well; I had been sleeping there for almost four hours; I had a little beer before I went to the club, and two glasses of gin; I did not drink any thing at the club; I was no more tipsey than I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go with this woman to Drury-lane; why did not you go to your own house; had you ever seen this woman before? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the darkest part of the night, about an hour after midnight: was there any light in the street, that you could know a woman you never saw before in your life? - A. There was a lamp some distance from the place; the prisoner was never far enough from me to be out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had your watch about you at this time of the morning? - A. Yes; the watchman found the ribbon the next morning after she had pulled it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>- CORBETT sworn. - I am a watchman: I was in Brownlow-street, nearly opposite Charles-street; I heard about half-past one a cry of watch and murder; I run as fast as I could with my stick and lantern; as I was coming out of Brownlow-street, two men and a woman ran down Drury-lane, and the prisoner ran against me; I saw Dixon rising; his mouth was a little cut; I took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What state did Dixon appear to be in; was he in liquor? - A. He did not appear so at the time; his lips were a little cut; while I was in the watch-house there was another watchman went and searched, and found a ribbon; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never saw the man before in my life; as I was coming down Charles-street, I saw this man, with two or three more about him, and then they set off a running; I passed that watchman, and he asked me what was the matter; I told him there were two or three about him, and he was lying in the middle of the road when I was coming down the street; the reason I did not run as well as the rest did, is that I was only going home.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you information that your house was to be attacked - A. Yes. On the 28th of September I was informed of it by Sellers, applied to the Lord Mayor, and had officers put in the house. I left town about seven o'clock, Meeke drove me. The house was not attacked that night. The officers came again next day, and Meeke drove me to Peckham about seven o'clock that evening also.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. On the morning of the 28th of Sellers mentioned it to you - A. Yes, about twelve o'clock. Meeke drove me out of town that evening - he was not employed that day until then - he drove me to town about ten o'clock next morning. I believe he then drove the carriage to Islington to fetch my daughters; they came about one o'clock, and he drove me to Peckham about seven.</p>

            . I have been a gentleman's servant; my last master was Major 
               <persName id="t18191027-67-person755">Overshall</persName>
             - we used to travel; this was five or six months ago. Since that I have lived in Pancras-road.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first left your master where did you live - A. At Loughton, with a farmer, who is an acquaintance of mine. I then returned to the New-road, St. Pancras, and lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you become acquainted with the prisoners - A. About three or four months ago. I first met Meeke and Turnley at the Lion in the Wood, public-house, near Mr. Fox's; they were drinking with a man named Moore *, whom I knew before. Moore and I began drinking together. Turnley and Meeke were in the same parlour. Moore asked me, in their presence, if I would be in a good thing? I said I must know what it was. He said Meeke, Mr. Fox's coachman, had agreed with Turnley to rob his master's premises; then Meeke said he had taken Turnley into the premises, to look at the iron chest that stood under the stairs, to take the dimensions of the key-hole, to see if he could open it without a key, and if not, to make one to it. Moore said Turnley was a smith. They appointed for Meeke to take the key of Turnley which he was to make, at ten o'clock in the morning, after he returned from Peckham, to see if it would fit, and return it to Turnley in the afternoon. Meeke told me he expected there were 600 l. or 700 l. in value in the chest, and that he had given them directions where to find the plate and wearing apparel, and other valuable things, after they had been to the chest.</p>

               <p>* See No. 1442.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the key - A. Yes, when we met at different places - it was a flat iron key, and was waxed over at different times, when it was given to the coachman to make a mark of the wards. Meeke told Turnley at one time that he thought the key would nearly fit, and he wished to take Turnley in to try it himself. After that Turnley was out of the way, which prevented it. I did not see either of the prisoners again until the 27th of September, I then met Meeke by chance in Bridge-street, about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning; he said he heard Turnley was at liberty, and asked me to meet him at the King's Head, in Thames-street, at twelve o'clock that day, and Turnley also, if I should see him. I met him by himself; he said he had heard from Meeke, and was to meet him at the Crown and Sugar-loaf, in Fleet-street, at four o'clock. He said the family were coming home in a few days, and the job must be done if I meant to be in it - I said I would consider further about it, and meet them at four o'clock. I went at four to the Crown and Sugar-loaf, and saw Turnley and Meeke there. Meeke said he had lost his friend Moore, and there must be another one, and a good one. Turnley said he had got another, named 
               <persName id="t18191027-67-person756">
                  Charles

            , who was a good one, and he was at the door. Meeke said somebody should keep the servant-girls quiet - Turnley said they should be muzzled. Meeke said they must be muzzled, or murdered, rather<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270045"></xptr>than allow them to give the alarm, and he would find out whether they both slept together. They appointed to meet again at the same house on Tuesday, at three or four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Crowder that day - A. I saw him and Turnley walking together; he was not called in. I went and informed Sellers that it was fixed to be the next night - they were to fix the hour when they met again. I met them about four o'clock next day in the tap room - it was on the 28th.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the conversation managed - A. A good deal of conversation took place in the yard, and we walked in the street, as other people came into the room. I first saw them at the Crown and Sugar-loaf; Crowder and Turnley came first, and Meeke after them. They wanted me to go into the premises with the coachman, and to open the hatch-door at eleven o'clock that night, while they went to fetch their things. I refused, until I had made myself better acquainted whether I should be safe or not. I did not see them again till the Wednesday, which was the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that, did you make yourself acquainted whether you should be safe - A. Yes, I applied to Sellers. I saw them again on the Wednesday, at the Cross Keys, near Blackfriars Bridge. Turnley and Meeke were in the house, Crowder stood outside. Only a few words passed then; they came into the street, and wanted to know if I would go inside and undo the hatch-door, and if not somebody else would. I agreed to it, and we all four walked to the Glazier's Arms, in Water-lane - we went together, but as Crowder arranged the business with Turnley, he kept a little behind. We drank a pot of porter, and I agreed to go to the stable with the coachman, it was then five o'clock - we parted. Turnley and Crowder went off, and told me they should go for their tools. I and the coachman went to Mr. Fox's stables; the back of the premises open into a small street. Meeke told me to lay down in the hay-stall, I did so, and he shook the hay over me with a fork, and begged me not to disappoint in letting Turnley and Crowder in. He said I should hear the carriage go out in the course of a few minutes, and then I should hear the servant girl fasten the back gate after him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the back gate between the stable and the house - A. The gate was outside; it completely shut me in. I think it was about a quarter or twenty minutes after five o'clock when I heard the carriage go out - the servant girls were to fasten the gate. One of them wished the coachman good night and pleasant dreams, and in coming through the stable one of them said,</p>
               <p>"The hay seems to lay high here, as if some one might be under" - they passed on, and took no further notice. I laid there till I heard the watchman call eleven, and then heard a knock against the hatch-door - I got up and opened it - the key was in. Turnley and Crowder came in, and went up to the loft. I heard a door unbolt, which let them down by steps into the yard. I heard Turnley go down the yard and undo the stable-door, which goes from the stable into the yard - this was the door the girls had fastened. Crowder then went out of the stable into the yard to Turnley - it is only about three steps from the stable. I stood outside the door, and saw them lift up the kitchen window - they found the shutter bolted, which Meeke had told them was very seldom bolted. Crowder took the steps from the loft, and set them against the back parlour window, Turnley went up the steps, and lifted up the window; it appeared to lift very easy. He got his head and shoulders in, felt round with his hand, put his head out again, and asked for the darkey, which meant the dark-lanthorn; Crowder handed it to him, and he put the lanthorn in. His head was in, but not so far as before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any blind to the window - A. I saw none. He perceived somebody, as he called out</p>
               <p>"Oh!" and sprang from the steps - he and Crowder both ran off together; I also left the premises directly. The officers knew I was in the stable, and Sellers told me they were to be in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you run away - A. I thought I had no right to stop by myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How came you to run away - A. Because they should not suspect that I gave the information. I went before the magistrate directly they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not a fortnight after - A. No. I did not know where they lived. I did not intend the house should be robbed. Moore told me their names, and I told Sellers.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you live with before you went to Major 
               <persName id="t18191027-67-person757">Overshall</persName>
             - A. I lived at home in a public-house for three years, in a public-house at Harwich.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not get into trouble at Bury St. Edmonds - A. No, I was not in prison there.</p>
               <p>Q. What address did you give the magistrate where to find you - A. No. 26, Pancras-road. I had lived there five or six months. I believe Sellers was by at the time; I do not know whether he heard it. I have been living on money saved from servitude.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever gone by any other name - A. I never denied my name. I have been called other names, but never gave myself any other. I believe I told Sellers I lived in Pancras-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you known Sellers - A. Five or six months. I first saw him at a public-house next to Marylebone watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get acquainted with him - 
               <persName id="t18191027-67-person758">A. </persName>
            By drinking over a pot of porter. It was before this affair was talked of. I had no other business with him than this.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not introduced to him by a gentleman - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Fector, of Dover - A. I have seen him - he did not introduce me to Sellers I had some business with Mr. Fector, but Sellers was not present.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Mr. Fector and Sellers together - A. Yes, at Mr. Fector's house in the Adelphi. What he was I did not know. I had seen Sellers before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was 
               <persName id="t18191027-67-person759">Moore</persName>
             an acquaintance of yours - A. I had spoken to him; we were not intimate. I had seen Meeke with Moore before they proposed the burglary. I defy any one to prove dishonesty against me. It went off while Moore was in trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. In all this time did you mention it to Mr. Fox or Sellers<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270046"></xptr>- No, I considered it useless, until the time was appointed. I spoke of it three days before the 29th.</p>
               <p>Q. You met Moore by accident, and it was proposed that Crowder should be one of the party - A. Yes, that afternoon, I saw Sellers at the New Inn, in the Old Bailey, and told him what was going to happen, for him to tell Mr. Fox. I knew the officers were in the room, but did not know who they were.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not attempt to stop either of them, but ran off yourself - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not go to the magistrate, and tell their names - A. I was not asked to go. I told Sellers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever live in Johnson's-court or place - A- I do not know such a place. I might tell Sellers Johnson's-place, near Johnson-street; I told him I was going to live there about a week ago, after I had given the information, as I thought it best to move.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell him so in April - A. No, for I did not live there.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did you go before the Lord Mayor before you were sent for - A. No, it was in the hands of the officer. I only saw Sellers once at Mr. Fector's.</p>

            . On the 29th of September I lived servant with Mr. Fox On the morning of that day, I saw Meeke in the kitchen; after putting his horses up he came and sat in a chair as usual, and said he did not know what was the matter with him, but he had got a pain in his side; he went into the yard, and said nothing more to me, but came in and out frequently. In the afternoon I went up to my master's bed room - he came up; he had nothing to do there, and never came there before. I went into the next room, which is the childrens' bed room; he came in and asked me if my fellow-servant and I slept together there? - When he slept in town he slept in the room over it. I told him we were going to sleep together that night. He asked me if we were going to sleep up stairs? I said Yes - that was the room adjoining his. He went up stairs, and I saw him come down stairs with a bed winch in his hand - he took it down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. I was sitting at tea about five o'clock - he was at dinner at the same table. He said I seemed sleepy, and had not slept well that night - I said I had not slept very well, and my fellow-servant said she had not, for she had had the headach. He said that was because we sat up so late, and as we had not slept well we had better go to bed at ten o'clock; he went to get his horses ready about six o'clock - the carriage went away about half-past six o'clock. My fellow-servant and I went to lock the gate, she wished him a good night, and pleasant dreams. I staid by the stable-door, while she fastened the coach-house-door - we go through the stable to the house; some hay laid in the stable. I said to my fellow-servant,</p>
               <p>"Suppose he should be here" - it seemed as if some person was lying underneath; I had heard that the house was to be robbed. I fastened the door between the stable and the house, then went into the workshop to see if anybody was there, but found nobody; I went into the house, and fastened the kitchen-door; my fellow-servant fastened the kitchen-window; I saw next morning that it was fast, which is not usual. We both went to bed about half-past ten o'clock - the officers came before that. I heard a noise about ten o'clock when we were at supper. It came from the back-kitchen, and was like a window opening.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived there - A. Nine months; I once saw Moore with Meeke at the back of the house, about a fortnight or three weeks before Moore was taken up - Meeke told me Moore was taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had not Moore's sister lived in the house as servant - A. Not while I lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. Meeke was not the wisest man you ever saw - A. No.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Fox. On the 29th of September the coachman left the house with the carriage about half-past six o'clock. I and Fraser locked the yard gate; I wished Meeke a good night and pleasant dreams. As we returned through the stable, Clara said the hay was very high, and looked as if some one was underneath - I kicked it, and it seemed as if some one was underneath; we fastened the gate between the stable and the house. I went into the kitchen, let my master out, and fastened the house up; I fastened the kitchen shutters, which are not generally fastened - the officers came about nine o'clock; we went to bed just before eleven. Moore came to the house about six or seven weeks ago for a letter from his sister.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the 28th of September, by direction of Mr. Wontner, I attended with Drinkwater and Forrester at Mr. Fox's house; we watched there, but nobody came that night. On the 29th, about nine o'clock at night, we three went again, with Brown, and placed ourselves in the back-parlour. About half-past eleven or a quarter to twelve o'clock, we heard a noise as if some one was in the house, and saw a man come down the back steps, leading from the loft into the yard adjoining the house, then heard a noise like a window being let down - the kitchen window was let down and pulled up again; we then heard something go like a bolt. A very little time after that, the window of the room we were in was raised up, and the person who was at the window raised the Venetian blind up - it was a man. Nearly all his body was then put in; he leaned on the table under the window, and looked round the room - we had no light; it was not a dark night - I could see his form; he had a dark coat on, gilt buttons, and light breeches. I lost him for a moment as he drew back, but he returned in a moment with a dark lanthorn. He came up the ladder again, put the light into the room, and the moment he drew his hand back, Brown cut at him with a cutlass; he cried out,</p>
               <p>"Oh Lord!" and dropped from the ladder. I ran out at the front door to go round and secure them, but they had escaped - the doors were all open behind. I apprehended Meeke next morning in the stable, took him to his master, and then before the Lord Mayor. After he had been examined the second time, he said if the Lord Mayor would let him have an hour's conversation with me, he would tell me more than ever I knew. I said I did not wish to hear any thing he had to say - he said he particularly wished it. I said if he made any disclosure to me, it should be before a witness, for I would not hear it without - he agreed to that. I took him to Drinkwater, and we went into a private room in a public-house at the corner of Huggin-lane - we neither threatened or promised<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270047"></xptr>him. He said he had had dealings with a man, named Moore, who asked him if he did not want money? He said he did, and Moore said it might easily be had, for it would be a good thing to rob his master's house, that he should be in it, and whack along with the others - he said he agreed for it to be done. He then burst into tears, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh good God? what a dilemma I have placed myself in - I will tell you no more." We took him to the Compter, and as we went up stairs to the lockup-room, he said if I would go in, he would tell me the whole particulars. I went into his room - his wife was there crying, and he burst out crying. I left him, returned and said,</p>
               <p>"If you have any thing to say, say it." He leaned over the bed, and said,</p>
               <p>"I'll be d - d if I split, I'll be hung first."</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the man better when he brought the lanthorn - A. No, not so well - it was a man exactly like Turnley, but I should not like to swear to him. I saw him the morning he was apprehended, when he was dressed apparently as the man was at the window. We found the loft ladder placed under the window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When were Crowder and Turnley taken - A. I think about the 6th of October - I did not wish to get information from him. I asked the Lord Mayor if it was right to hear what he said? The Lord Mayor said if he wished to disclose his mind, I might hear it, but he did not like to hear any thing from him.</p>

            . I attended at the prosecutor's house with my brother officers, on the 28th of September - we went the following night about nine o'clock. About a quarter before twelve o'clock we heard the back kitchen window go up, and then down. I heard voices of more than one person, but could not hear what they said. Then a man pushed up the window where we sat - most all his body came into the room; he appeared to be dressed in a blue coat, yellow buttons, a dark waistcoat, and light breeches; he was a tall slim man - he leaned across the table, withdrew himself, went back, and produced a lanthorn; he held it in the room, looked round, and withdrew himself directly. Brown made a cut at him - he made some exclamation, and disappeared in a moment. My brother officers ran round, and found he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he got up - A. By a ladder from the stable. When Turnley was apprehended he was dressed like the man. Crowder was taken the same night. I was present with Meeke and Dyer, at a public-house at the corner of Huggin-lane. He said he had some dealings with Moore, and that he was a smuggler. This man asked him if he did not want money? and said he knew of a good thing, and that was to rob his master, and he should be in it, and have his whack of it. He then burst out crying, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have I done! I'll say no more."</p>

               <p>"O Lord!" He fell from the ladder and escaped.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the 6th of October I apprehended Crowder at the Rose and Crown public-house, in Goswell-street, and apprehended Turnley at his lodgings in Clerkenwell. I found a skeleton key in his coat-pocket, and on the mantle-shelf I found a key with wax on it.</p>
               <p>MR. FOX re-examined. The key does not correspond with my iron chest at all - the hole would not go on the pipe.</p>

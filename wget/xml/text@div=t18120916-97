            . I am a constable. On Sunday night, the 23d of August between nine and ten, I saw the prisoner at the bottom of Holborn, he appeared to be alone; I watched him. I saw him sounding peoples' pockets; he went up Holborn; when he got near Leather-lane he put his hand in Mr. Tipper's pocket, and drawed the handkerchief out; he then put the handkerchief into his right-hand pocket; I then catched hold of him, and called to Mr. Tipper, told him he had been robbed. I took the prisoner into the porter's lodge. Furnival's Inn, and searched him, and found this handkerchief in his right-hand pocket. I have kept the handkerchief ever since.</p>

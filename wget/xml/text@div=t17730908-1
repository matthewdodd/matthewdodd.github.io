            . I know the glasses found on the prisoner are our property; they were lost out of the warehouse; I can tell they are mine as well as any man can tell his own hand writing; they were found upon him. My son is blind: his house had been robbed, and his desk broke open last Saturday fortnight; the prisoner had been <rs id="t17730908-1-deflabel4" type="occupation">footman</rs>

I was not present when the things were found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale clothier, of Nos. 14 and 15, Aldgate, High-street, in partnership with two others. The prisoner was a clerk in our firm—on 12th July, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was marked in my presence with a small cross on the face of the coin—it was then handed to Mr. Emanuel, the col<lb></lb>lector of the Jews' Orphan Asylum—on my arrival at my office on the 13th, about half-past 9 o'clock, the prisoner came to me, and said he had received some money from Mr. Emanuel—I told him to keep it till my son arrived—he did not mention the sum—I made an arrangement for a policeman to be in the counting house, and previous to the prisoner leaving at 1 o'clock, I called him into the counting house, and asked him how much he had received from the collector; he said 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him if he had received any more; he said, "No"—I then turned round to the policeman, who was in uniform, and told him that a larger sum had been paid to him that morning—I asked the prisoner if he had any silver in his pocket; he put his hands in his pockets, and produced between nine and ten shillings—I had not allowed him for the payment of a railway ticket—I examined the change he produced; it was part of the money which had been marked on the previous day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 31, Goulston-square, and am collector for the Jews' Orphan Asylum. On 12th July, Mr. Moses' son marked 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my presence, and I paid that identical money to the prisoner about half-past 9 o'clock, or not quite so late, on the morning of the 13th—he signed my cash book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is his signature—I swear that this entry is in his writing—I saw him write it—as I was counting out the cash he began to take it up, and I said, "Leave it till I have counted if—I counted it over, and he said, "Shall you be here again to day?" I said, "No"—I paid him the cash and went about my business—I am sure that I handed him the whole of the marked money—the mark was on the head side.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Duke Street, London Bridge—I was formerly in the Marine Artillery, stationed at Portsmouth—on Wednesday night I came up to London—I got to the Waterloo Station about 8 o'clock—I saw the prisoner Fryer there with another man, not Carr—I had a bag with me—I asked them the way to London Bridge—I did not speak to either one, I asked them both—Fryer offered to show me the way, and asked whether he should carry my bag—I said yes, he might, and we all went to London Bridge—I had stopped at a coffee house, 10, Duke Street, before, and I wished to go there again—we went in, and I engaged a lodging for the night, and paid for it—we came out again, and Fryer went with me to the Monument—I was to have met a friend there—Fryer then asked me if I should like to hear a song—I said, "Yes," and he told me that the Cambridge Music Hall was the nearest—I agreed to go—we had a glass of ale before we went in, and I gave the man 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for carrying my bag—at the bar of the music hall I gave them some more refreshment, and 6 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I should not require them any more—I left them at the bar and went into the hall—I stayed there till 11.30—I saw the prisoner Carr there, leaning over the rails about ten yards from me for about twenty minutes—I spoke to him, and asked him if he would have something to drink—he said, "It is very poor drink you get here, I can show you a place where you can get better"—we came out, and went into a public-house—I gave him a glass there—we then went into another house, and had some more—I felt rather hungry, and asked him if he could show me where there was an eating-house—he said he would—just before that Fryer again met me, and we all three went to the eating-house together—they had something to eat; I paid for it—it was very near 12 o'clock when we left—I told them I wished to go to my lodgings—they told me that as they were going that way, they would show me a nearer road than what I should find myself—as we went along, Carr was on the left-hand side of me, and Fryer on the right, a little in advance—Carr put his arm round my neck and squeezed my throat very tight—I was choked for a moment—Fryer stood in front, and I felt Carr's hand put into my pocket—I felt it withdrawn, and was then violently pushed on the ground, and my head came in contact with the stones—I got up, called "Stop thief!" and the two prisoners ran away directly—it was in the centre of the road where the robbery took place—one ran on one side of the street and one on the other—I followed Carr, the one that had the money—I lost sight of him down a street, but he was stopped, I believe, by a constable—I saw him in custody—he was taken to the station, and I charged him with the robbery—Fryer was brought in after we had been at the station a few minutes—when Carr put his hands into my pockets I had some loose silver, and three sovereigns in a piece of paper—I have seen the paper and the three sovereigns since.</p>

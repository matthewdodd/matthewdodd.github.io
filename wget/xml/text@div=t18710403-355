                  </hi>. I am a grocer and cheesemonger, at 14, Buckingham Square, New Kent Road—on Monday, 2nd March, about 11.45, I was going along Blackfriars Road, towards the "Elephant and Castle"—when I got to Little Surrey Street I met four men—they separated, two on each side, so that I had to go through the centre—as I went through; I received a blow which knocked me down—the prisoner caught hold of my watch, and</p>

               <p>ran away in the direction of Blackfriars Bridge—I jumped up—I was not down a second—I followed them—I saw the prisoner throw down the watch—I picked it up, and followed him, calling "Police!" through Friar Street—I was about ten yards behind him—I never lost sight of him till he ran into the arms of a policeman—the other three men went in a contrary direction—I have not the slightest doubt that the prisoner took the watch.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. I live in Peter-street, Friars' Mount, Bethnal-green. On the 20th of June, about half-past 1 o'clock at noon, I saw the prisoner in Brick-lane, and watched him into Brown's-lane, where I secured him, with this clock under his arm; I asked him what it was - he said a clock; I asked where he was going with it - he said he could not tell me, but he would show me - I asked where he brought it from - he said from Mr. Matthews, of Dalston. I found two ladies' gowns in his trousers, they were wet, and I asked how he came by them - he then said he would tell me the truth - that he met a man at Dalston, who said he would give him 1s. to carry them to Spitalfields church, where he would meet him; he was about a mile and a half from the prosecutor's house. I have had the property ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go with him to Spitalfields church? A. No; he said if I would I should see the man there; I locked him up, and then went - he was about ten minutes walk from the church. I took him to the watch-house, which is about ten minutes walk, in White Lion-street, about a quarter of a mile from where I took him; the church might be about a quarter of a mile from the watch-house - it might be twenty minutes before I got to the church. I saw nobody waiting there; he was going in a direction from the church when I met him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know it? A. The handle is a very particular one, which I ordered myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger at 162, Drury-lane—about a quarter-past 1 on the morning of 17th March I was going home through Long-acre—I was at the corner, at the Queen-street end, and I went into a cigar shop—just before going in I saw the prisoners and two others outside the door—I bought a cigar, paid three halfpence for it with a shilling, and put the change, 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket, and the cigar in my mouth—as I came out of the shop I heard one of them, I cannot tell which, say, "Put it on him," and Williams put his arm round my neck, and lifted me up on his belly—I felt the violence at my throat choking me—he said, "Kick him in the guts"—then he and three others threw me on my. back, and Webb put his hand in my right pocket, and tore my trousers from top to bottom—that was in the struggle—I struggled with them—I did not cry "Police;" my wife did—she was not with me at the time, but being opposite the house where I live, she heard my voice, and came out, hearing a disturbance—nothing further happened to me—as soon as I got released I cried "Police," and when the police came they wished to make off, but I detained Williams—I was bruised from head to foot—I could not tell who kicked me; I received so many—I held Williams, but was obliged to let him go—that was after the kicks—he was so violent, I could hold him no longer—I did not know either of the men before; they were perfect strangers to me—after I was kicked they made off—Williams made off after I let him go—I lost my cap and handkerchief—I could not swear they took them—I do not know that they robbed me of anything.</p>

               <p>behind them when they were stopped—I pursued—I saw the other two ran down Wild-street, and these two kept on in Queen-street—I chased them—there were some women there—they were not running likewise—there were not two women running, and calling "Police," to my knowledge—there were some women there, not calling out "Police"—I heard "Police" being cried the whole time I was on my back, but I do not know whether it was by women or men—when Webb was stopped, I said to the constable, "Bring him with you"—I charged him with being one of the men who had assaulted me—he said in reply, "I had nothing at all do with it"—I have since made inquiries as to Webb—I believe him to be under control by Williams—I believe him to be of very respectable parents, and has borne in good character up to the time he was taken in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Williams. Q.</hi> What is your name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Henry Hughes—that is the name I gave at Bow-street—the tobacconist's shop I went into is two doors from the corner of Long-acre—I did not say, when I made my statement at Bow-street, that you were the person that said, "Put it on him"—I said I believed it to be you, but I did not swear it—I gave Webb in custody—I saw him with you at the same time—I have suffered bad consequences from the pressure of the throat—I was not asked the question before—I was asked if I had any more to add, and I said, "No"—the trousers that were torn are at home—I did not produce them at Bow-street—I do not know who kicked me—I showed the marks where I had been kicked, to the constable and the inspector—I did not show them to the Magistrate—he said there was no occasion—I have not got the tobacconist here.</p>

About 1 o'clock on the morning of 17th March I was in Long-acre—I heard a cry of "Police," and saw the prosecutor—I saw these two prisoners together in Drury-lane—when I got up there the prosecutor had got hold of Williams—they were standing up, and Webb was standing by—as I got up to them both of them ran away down Great Queen-street—I was about fifteen yards from them—I heard the prosecutor call after me—he said, "Stop the man with the hat on"—that was Williams—Webb was running down the street at the same time—he stopped, and I passed him—he was running down Queen-street—he was before Williams—I passed him, and caught Williams—I took him to the station, and told him he was charged with assaulting Hughes, and attempting to rob him—he said he had nothing to do with it—Berwick came up at the time I took Williams—I saw Webb standing under a lamp-post in Great Queen-street after that—that was about twenty yards from where I took Williams—Berwick took Webb in my sight—I am quite sure Webb was one of the persons running as I have described.</p>

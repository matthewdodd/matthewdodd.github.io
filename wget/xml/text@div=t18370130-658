                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. Frogley, a fisherman, living at Barking, he is the owner of a smack. The prisoner had charge of the vessel—on the 26th Jannary, about five or six o'clock in the evening, she laid in the Thames, off Barking Creek, two Woolwich boats came along side of her and boarded us—the men asked the prisoner whether he had any fish to sell for money—he said, "No, he would not sell for money"—the man said he had some run in—the prisoner said "Hand out a bottle of rum, we will have that, but we won't have any money"—the man said be would go ashore and fetch some—he went ashore and brought some rum, and the prisoner gave him some plaice and homely maids—they were all dead—they were in bushel baskets—one was full of plaice and the other of maids—the man took them ashore in the beat when they fetched the rum—it was pact of master's cargo—I drank some of the rum—"all hands "Had it—they afterwards went and fetched some porter—no money was given to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old and am apprentice to Mr. Frogley. I was on board the smack on the 26th January, with the prisoner—after master went ashore, two boats boarded us, and the men came into our vessel—when the waterman took us ashore I saw plaice in the boat's well—they had been shot out of the basket—they came from on board our vessel—the maids were in the other boat—they had been shot out of a basket which came from our vessel—when we were going to get into the boat the men said to us, "Don't get into the well, go forwards in the boat's head," that was away from the fish, so that we should not tread on them—the prisoner came down the hold and sent me for a bit of rope—I saw him give Tomlinson and another of our men a bottle—I did not see what was done with it—when the men were going on shore with the bottle, the prisoner said to them, "You can come back, and we will give you some supper"—we then left, and I do not know what happened afterwards—I saw master when I went home, and directly told what I had seen.</p>

                  </hi>. I left the prisoner in charge of my smack when I went ashore—I had a stock of fish, among which were homely-maids and plaice—he had no authority to dispose of them—Key informed my wife of this at soon as he saw her—I did not authorise any body to pay for mooring the vessel with fish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Then had you left money for that purpose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We always employ a bobber—the bobber had put me ashore—I never authorised the prisoner to give any body fish—it is not usual to give per<lb></lb>sons fish for mooring vessels—the prisoner had just returned from a voyage with me, and I wished him to accompany me another, but he declined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say, in consequence of his declining to go with you another voyage, that you would sell the bed from under you but you would do something for him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not at that time nor any other—it was at the time a row took place at another part of the voyage, about allowing him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and his not doing his duty—I had forgotten all that until this time—I said, "If you don't keep your place, and do what is right I must do what I can for you"—he came for his wages on the after<lb></lb>noon of the 26th of January. I was at home the last time he came—I did not seize the poker when he came in—I said, "Just allow me a few minutes to get a little refreshment, I will be much obliged to you; it is the only time I have to enjoy myself"—I had just returned from market and sat down to tea—he came and opened the door in less than five minutes, and I said, "Mr. Headlin, this is from my house, don't you enter the door"—with that he came and stuck his back against the door, and would not go out—he went before the Justice next morning to complain of it—the vessel was not moored when the bobber took me ashore—it was his duty to moor it—he was paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for doing so.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mrs. Elizabeth Beatrice Alsager, the widow of Captain Alsager; she lives at Balham-hill, in the parish of Streatham. On the 8th of February the family left town, and I left on the 19th—I left fifteen sovereigns in a small drawer in a chest, in my bed-room, at the top of the house—I locked the drawer and took the key with me—the prisoner had been left in charge of the house, and had Willis, her niece, with her—I returned on the 12th of October, and went to my drawer next morning—I found it still locked, but had a difficulty in getting it open—I found the things in it all turned about, and my money gone—I called the prisoner up, and told her I had been robbed—she said she did not know any thing about it—(she was merely a charwoman left in charge of the house)—I told her the drawer must have been undone, I thought by a key—I asked if there could be any key in the house which would undo the drawer—she then fetched a key, which I tried to the drawer—it un<lb></lb>locked three of them, one of which my money had been in—next morning I noticed marks of a chisel on the drawers all over the house, and on my drawer also—they could be seen without opening the drawer—two chisels were found in the house—the police were called in.</p>

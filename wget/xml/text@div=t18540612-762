                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Crane, a labourer, at West Ham. I knew the deceased child, his name was George Drew; he was six<lb></lb>teen months old—on Whit Monday, 5th June, it was left with me by its mother, who was going out somewhere—she lives in the same house as I do—a short time after she was gone out I went up stairs, leaving the child with a little one of my own—I left them against the door, outside—there is a large green in front of the house—the road lies to the left of the house, and about ten yards from the house; it is a newly made road, not much frequented; it is not very wide—on coming down stairs shortly afterwards, I could not find the child, and he was almost directly afterwards brought in dead by a police constable.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 283). On Whit Monday, a little after 4 o'clock, I heard several persons calling out and shouting at this place, which is called Canning New-town, in the Barking high road—I turned my head, hearing some one hallooing, and saw the little child between two horses—the horses were drawing a cart loaded with sand—the prisoner was sitting, or rather lying, on the sand at the back of the cart; he was appa<lb></lb>rently quite drunk, and lying quite still, with his head back, partly on the sand—the horses were going at a slow foot pace; the child seemed to me to be trying to get out of the way of the horses; the fore horse seemed to knock the child down, and the wheel went over its head—my brother constable, Puddifoot, immediately ran and picked it up; it was quite dead, the whole of the top of the head was torn off—the cart was heavily loaded with sand—I know this road by being down there a few times; it leads round to the back of some houses that are building there—it is a public thoroughfare, and is about eighteen feet wide—the cart was in the centre of the road—if the prisoner had been awake, and facing the road, he could have seen on both sides of it—there were several persons a little distance off, but no one was near the cart at the time, except the child—the prisoner said he was drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Rippingal, a labourer, at West Ham, and live at Canning New-town. On this Monday afternoon I was standing near where the child was run over—I heard a cry, looked round, and saw the child close up to the wheel—it was not in the middle of the road, but at the side; it is not a very wide road—the wheel knocked the child down, and went right over the head—the hones were going very steadily—I did not see any one with the child—I did not see the prisoner at all.</p>

               <p>about half past 4 o'clock on this day, and saw the cart; it was loaded with sand—I heard some shouting, and followed the cart, intending to awake the prisoner—he was lying sideways behind the cart, apparently asleep, his face was sideways, and he was nearly at full length—I shouted to him, but it did not seem to attract his attention at all—I got within about a yard and a half or two yards of the cart, when I saw the child lying in the road—I picked it up, and ran and stopped the horses—the prisoner rolled off the cart; he was very drunk indeed—I said to him, "Do you see what you have done?"—I then had the child in my arms—he reeled away from me, as though to make his escape—I put the child on the grass, and took hold of him; he said, "I was drunk, and asleep; I never saw the poor little dear at all."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, living at Bromley.

I live at 12, Southborough Terrace, Carlton Road, Peckham—I am a dealer principally in hops—I know the prisoner by sight, and knew him before this transaction through meeting him in the Borough and various other places—on Friday, the 27th August, I saw him in the High Street, about 11 o'clock in the morning, in Queen's Head Yard—there was no one with him at the time—he nodded, and then asked me if I had seen some gentleman—I said I had not—he showed me a sample of hop packing—I do not myself know much about this material—he asked me if I thought the packing was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I could not say, but might find out the price within a little—I then went to inquire—on my return I asked him what he would take for the lot, and he replied 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had not seen the bulk, and asked him if it was the regular hop packing in rolls of 50 yards each, and he said he did not know—I know now that there are—104 yards in that one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he did not tell me how many yards there were in it—he said within a little it weighed about 1 cwt.—I subsequently agreed to take it for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—previous to my paying him the money I drew up a bill—before making the purchase I inquired of him as to the proprietor, and he said he was selling it on commission for another party—he never introduced me to the party for whom he stated he was selling it—I never saw him or them at any time to my knowledge—he said the canvas was properly come by—I paid him the same day opposite the Queen's Head Yard, in a public-house,</p>

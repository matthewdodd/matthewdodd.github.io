I saw the prisoner on the day of the robbery in Osborn-street, Whitechapel, about nine o'clock in the morning; when I went to get a pint of porter: she said she knew two lodgers that were in the house where I lived; I gave her some refreshment. and she asked me to go with her to her lodging; when I got up stairs she snatched my book and ran down again: I gave information, and she was taken - I am sure she is the woman.</p>

I went into the public-house, and this man was there very much intoxicated, and several women were with him: he asked if I would have any beer: I said I had some of my own; he then got some gin, and gave some to everybody there, and went out with some women, then came back and said I had robbed him.</p>

            . I am a constable; one of my watchmen stopped the prisoner at the bar with some lead, and brought him to me to the watch-house between eleven and twelve o'clock on the 15th of April at night; I asked the prisoner how he came by it? he said he bought it in St. Giles's of two labouring men that night. I carried him the next day to justice Fielding, the justice asked him how he could be guilty of such a thing? he answered, it was the first time he ever had been guilty, but said he did not steal it, but there was another man with him that did.</p>

            . I am a watchman; about half an hour after eleven at night, on the 15th of April, Roberts and I were standing together at the corner near Brounlow-street, Drury-lane, there came the prisoner with this lead on his shoulder, we stopped him, he flung the lead down, we took him and carried him to the watch-house.</p>

I said, I don't know, let me look at it. I had about half a crown and two-pence in my pocket; I said, what do you ask for it? he said, three shillings; I said, I have no more than half a crown and two-pence, I'll give you half a crown; one of them said to the other, let him have it, so I bought it, and the watchmen stopped me. I am a tiresmith, and have worked with a great many masters, which, if they were here, would give me a good character.</p>

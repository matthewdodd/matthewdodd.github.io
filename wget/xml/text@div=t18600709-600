               <p>I then told her that the shilling I had paid her for the gin was one of the same kind, and it must be bad also. The man had told me before that there had been fault found with the money at the baker's. I can only account for the shilling being in my pocket, by saying, that it came out of the parcel he gave me; the paper was torn. I had no money."—<hi rend="italic">O'Connor says</hi>, "I met the woman, and asked her to have some beer; she gave me the shilling to pay for the bread; I saw it was bad; I paid for it with a good half-crown of mine; she then proposed to have some gin, and I returned the shilling to her she paid for the gin, and I had some beer, and paid for it with a good 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece."</p>

I am a partner in the firm of Phillips &amp; Co. and live at The Cedars, Mortlake—I have a study in the garden—I locked it up, on 22nd May, about 6 p.m., when I left, and fastened the window leaving these books safe, and this antimacassar, book-marker, gold pencil-case, silver pencil-case, ivory paper, knife, and photographs of my sisters—next morning, I found a pane of glass broken in the window, the fasten<lb></lb>ing had been drawn back, and the room entered—I missed these articles, and gave information—the policeman showed me these books last month—the prisoner is a stranger to me.</p>

I am a widow, and live at 19, Marshall Road, Kennington Road—the prisoner is now my son—In-law, but in May he was courting my daughter—he was employed at Kew Gardens—he brought these things about 24th or 25th May, and gave them to my daughter as a wedding present—he said that he had them as a present from a school fellow—he said that the photographs were lady friends of his—he brought the autimacassar the next night, threw it at my daughter, and said "Here, Jenny, here is something to keep you warm for the winter"—he said that he made it himself—he was not in the Army then—he has enlisted since—I believe he lived with his mother, at Mortlake, at the time this happened.</p>

I received information, and went to Mrs. Silwood's house, and her daughter, Jane Whitethorn, gave me these things, including these four photographs in frames—the other eight photographs she gave me the next day, as she had placed them in a book—I took the prisoner at Woolwich, and told him the charge—he said "All right; I could bring others into it, but I shall not do it. I shall stand it all myself"—he told me next morning that he saw a man a few hundred yards from Mr. Phillips, and saw a man under a tree with a writing desk, a paper knife, and some other articles, which have not been recovered, and he asked him if he would have the things, and he said "Yes," and hid them; that he pawned the desk and table cover, and tore the ticket up, and that he knew at the time that the things were stolen.</p>

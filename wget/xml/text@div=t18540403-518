                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Robins; he keeps a beer house at Kensington. On 8th March the two prisoners came to the house together, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—Webb asked for a pint of ale—I served it, and he threw down a half crown—I took it up, and saw it was bad—I did not say anything, but took it in the parlour and showed it to my husband, and gave it to him—he came out and spoke to the prisoner, and a constable was sent for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness. I remember her bringing me a half crown, and the two prisoners were there—I saw the half crown was bad—I went out and spoke to Webb—I said to him, "Tom, is that you?"—I mistook him for another person—I asked him if he had any more money to pay with beside that—he said, "No"—I asked M'Donald if he had any more money, he said "No"—Webb said he had taken the half crown over at Pimlico at a public house, but he did not name any house—I directed a lodger to look after the prisoners, and I fetched an officer, gave the prisoners in charge, and gave the officer the half crown—this is it, I marked it.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody at the last witness's shop—I received this half crown—I asked the prisoners if they had got any more money about them, and they each said, "No"—I found no money on Webb—I found on M'Donald a counterfeit shilling in his waistcoat pocket—Webb gave his address, as No. 14, Snow's Rents, Westminster—I went there, but did not learn anything of him—M'Donald gave his address, No. 9, Regent-place—I went there, and found he had been living there, but had not for the last three weeks.</p>

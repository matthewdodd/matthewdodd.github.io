                  </hi>. I live in Artillery-lane, Bishopsgate, and keep a grinder's shop: I sell nails. On Wednesday, 8th Oct., Cousins came in and asked for a 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of nails—it was about 6 o'clock—I had a candle alight in my shop—while I was getting him the nails, my kitten cried out, which induced me to look round, and I saw Wilmshurst come out of my room, which is on the same floor with my shop, with my watch and stand in his hand—I had seen my watch all day—I had left it in the room when I came out to serve the nails—Wilmshurst went out—I followed him to the end of the street, but did not catch him—I did not cry, "Police!" as there was nobody about at the time—I went back home, and found there was no one there—the nails were in the scale as I had left them—I went to the station—I did not leave my shop above a minute or two—my daughter was up-stairs—I knew both the prisoners before, by seeing them about the neighbourhood—I had not seen them together before—I had seen Wilmshurst about with fruit.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live in Yawl-street, Gravel-lane. On that Wednesday evening I saw the two prisoners in a house in Field's-place, two or three doors from where I live—it was from 7 to 9 o'clock in the evening—Cousins offered me a watch for sale—he asked me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he said he was a tradesman out of work—I bought it; and on the Saturday, when I came home, about 12, I heard that a watch was stolen, and I took it to the station, and gave it to the policeman—this is the watch.</p>

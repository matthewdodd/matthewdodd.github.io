On the 13th of August, I lost upwards of 30 l. from the bureau, in the bed-chamber. The door was locked, and the key was in Mrs. Litchfield's pocket. I went to bed first, on the night of the 13th. When I unlocked the door, I found a board, which was under the window, pulled down, and put on a table. I had not seen it down for two years before. I missed the money on the 14th. I went to the window immediately. I saw the pointing of the tiles disturbed. I had a suspicion of the prisoner. I went round to his master's, which was the next door, and found him there. I looked out of the window there, and saw another tile disturbed, which I could not see out of my own window. I told Mr. Wright, his master, that I had been robbed, and suspected<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120075"></xptr> the prisoner. He was by. I pointed out the tiles to him and his master. He was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>When you found the board down, did not you suspect you was robbed? - No: I thought my wife had taken it down, to dust or something. The key was in the bureau. I saw the money the day before.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner any access to your house at any time? - He used the house in common.</p>

He came to work between four and five o'clock the afternoon before, and staid about two hours, but did not do half an hour's work. Upon Mr. Litchfield's saying he was robbed, I looked at the tiling. Our business makes the top of the tiles very black. The mortar was broke, and appeared white. I could trace a foot from my window to the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Was there any other person that worked in that room? - Not that day.</p>

               <p>Upon the 13th of August, the prisoner came to work between four and five o'clock in the evening. I was in the room one pair of stairs above him, cleaning up the shop. The window of the shop where he works was shut when he came; but just before seven o'clock I missed him out of the room. I suspected he was in the necessary: but as I was going up, I pushed the door open; and he was then in the room, putting his coat on. He wanted to play with me all the afternoon, to drive me out of the room up one pair of stairs, where he was at work. I came down stairs again; and the prisoner came down and asked my mistress for 1 s. and went out. Then, when he was gone, I went in, and found the window was wide open.</p>

               <p>(He is sworn.)</p>
               <p>I have not known the prisoner long. He works at Mr. Wright's. Upon the 13th of August, I saw him upon Mr. Wright's tiles. He got out of the window. I saw him getting out, and getting in again. I saw him near Mr. Litchfield's window. Mr. Litchfield's window was open.</p>
               <p>Did you see him in Litchfield's window? - No; I saw him get out of his master's window, and get in again. It was about a quarter after five o'clock. I was going to speak to him, and he doubled his fist, and said, Hush! He was on the tiles, returning to Mr. Wright's window.</p>
               <p>Where was you when you saw him? - In the yard where I live, three doors from Mr. Wright's.</p>

               <p>This shed, that belongs to Mr. Wright, is situated near the window I generally used to work at. It is hardly to be thought a person, such as I, who have but one leg, should get out on the tiles.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Could a man get from Mr. Wright's to your window without danger of falling? - Yes; there are but seven tiles from one to the other.</p>
               <p>Do you know where the last witness lives; could he in the yard see a person go from one window to the other? - Yes, very plain; he could see a cat.</p>

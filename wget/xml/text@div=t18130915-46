            . I am a constable. I went by this house about ten minutes after three in the morning. I was looking after the watchmen; I heard a creeking in the house, which induced me to stop; in about twenty minutes I saw the prisoner coming out at the back gate; I told him to stop or I would shoot him; I took him by the collar, and took him to the watchhouse, a young woman followed me out of the gate; I told her to follow me; after I had taken him to the watchhouse I went back to the house; I found two planes in a handkerchief that I had heard drop, and I found these two sashes, they had been taken out of the back parlour, and were taken up into the front bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gissing. How was this house left - A. The front door was locked, and the back door bolted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. There was a young woman taken up with him - A. Yes, she was discharged by the magistrate.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel; and called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

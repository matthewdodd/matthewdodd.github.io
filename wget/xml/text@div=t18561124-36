I have known the prisoner twenty years, or more; I was never particularly acquainted with him, more than "How do you do?" but I knew that he lived with Mr. Bryant, the job and postmas<lb></lb>ter, in Oxford-street—on 13th Oct. last I met him in Queen-street, Edgware-road, a little before 6 o'clock in the evening—he asked me how I was, and said he had not seen me for some time, and he would give me something to drink, but he had nothing but a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and asked where he could get it changed—I said he was very lucky to have such a thing, and there was Mr. Sculls' public house, where he could very likely get it changed—he said, would I get change for it, for he was not known—he took this note out from under his coat, and said he had it given to him by a gentleman for whom he had sold a horse—he gave the note into my hand, and we went into Mr. Sculls' public house—I asked Jones, the barman, if he could change it—he said he would try—I gave the note into his hands—he asked my name and address—I told him, and he wrote it on the front of the note—he then went into the bar parlour, came back, and said he could not change it—he gave it back to me—I gave it to the prisoner, and we went out—he put the note in his pocket—he said, "Don't you know anywhere else where you could get it changed?"—I said, "I know two or three houses here, but they don't know much of me," and walked on—we afterwards went to the</p>

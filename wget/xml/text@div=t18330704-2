               <p>Slater's Defence. I own it is true I was in the house a little after eleven o'clock - we were in great distress, and are so now - we walked by the house, and saw the door open; we went in with no good intent, but the things now produced never did belong to us, and never were in our possession - we had hardly shut the door before it was opened, and we flew up stairs - I must leave myself to the mercy of the Court, it was done through want.</p>

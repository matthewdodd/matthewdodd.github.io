                  </hi>. I am a labourer to Mr. Sherman, at the Bull and Mouth Inn. On the 18th of November, I was going home about half-past two o'clock—I am married, but my wife does not live in London—the pri<lb></lb>soner spoke to me while I was knocking at my door—she asked if I would go with her—she rushed up to me, and undid my breeches, and at the same time picked my breeches pocket of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had two half-crowns and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in this pocket—she took the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and went away—I followed her two or three yards down the court I live in—I took her by the arm, brought her back, and gave her to the officer—I know my money was all safe when I came out of the Bull and Mouth yard—I had not stopped any where, and no one but her could have taken my money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I heard the prosecutor call out—I went up—he said the prisoner had robbed him of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in her hands and pockets—the prosecutor was sober.</p>

I told the officer it was my own money, and I took it out of my pocket, when he accused me of stealing it—I had been to my husband's club to have him superannuated—as I was returning, the prosecutor accosted me—he took liberties with me—a young man came up, and pushed him away, and he was talking with me for ten minutes—the prosecutor then came up and said I had robbed him—he gave several dif<lb></lb>ferent accounts of what he had lost before the magistrate.</p>

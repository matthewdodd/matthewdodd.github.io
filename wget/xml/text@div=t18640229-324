                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Bank of England, and live at Pentonville—about half-past 6 on the evening of 17th February I was in Cheapside, looking in at a shop window—while there I felt some one endea<lb></lb>vouring to take my watch from my pocket—it was in my left-band waistcoat-pocket—I saw my watch safe only a few minutes before—I put down my hand and felt a man's hand—I took hold of his wrist and then heard some<lb></lb>thing fell on the ground—I looked down and saw my watch lying between my feet—it was tie prisoner I took hold of; he was close to me—as soon as I touched him I heard my watch drop—I collared him, and held him till a constable came up—I gave him into custody, with my watch and chain.</p>

               <p>took hold of it; it was then just by my side, by the pocket—it all took place in a moment—he did not attempt to escape; I should not think any one else saw this—some one went to the police-court, but they said they only saw the watch on the ground—I saw a man at the police-station; I did not speak to him.</p>

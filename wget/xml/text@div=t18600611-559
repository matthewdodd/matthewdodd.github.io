                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Little Portland Street; I have known the prisoner four years—on 1st May I met him accidentally in New Oxford Street, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening—Sarah Sayer was with me; having met him, we walked to Cheapaide, and went to a street near Cheapside and went in a public-house—the prisoner said I had come to meet a young man—I said, yes—he said I had made an appointment with the young man—I said, yes—I then left the prisoner and went to Cheapside where I was waiting for a young man—Sayer went with me—she left me for a few minutes, and while she was gone the prisoner came up to me again and asked me to go and have something to drink, which I refused—he then said he would not leave me till I did, and we went into a public-house near the Bank—Sayer was with me—I was then going away, and the prisoner came and walked with me to 8, Portland Street, and we had supper there—Sayer was with me—the prisoner said that I had been telling false<lb></lb>hoods about him—I said I had not, and I got up to go out—he stood before me—I sat down again, and he asked me if I would be there the next evening at 7 o'clock—I said I did not know—he then sat down, and he had his right hand on my breast—I don't recollect anything more till I found myself in the hospital, and I was wounded over the left breast.</p>

I am staying where the last witness lodges—I went with her that night to New Oxford Street, then to Cheapside, and then to another public-house near the Bank, and returned to 8, Portland Street—I saw Hetherington get up to leave the room, and the prisoner stood before her—she sat down again, and after that he asked her if she would be there at 7 o'clock the next evening—I then saw his two hands were on her breast, and she said "Oh," and fell on one side—I caught her, and another person caught her in their arms; she was put in a cab and taken to the hospital—the prisoner did not appear excited, he was not at all intoxicated.</p>

I am house surgeon at Middlesex Hos<lb></lb>pital; about a quarter past 12 in the morning of the 2d May, the prosecutrix was brought there—she was partly in an insensible state—I examined her person and found a punctured wound just above the left breast, about two inches and a half deep; it had penetrated her clothes—it might have been produced by a knife—from the direction it took it was not a dangerous wound, if it had taken another direction it would have been a very serious wound—I should think there must have been considerable force used.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a broker, and at the time in question lived in James-street, Marlborough-road, Chelsea. In Sept. 1844 I had a warrant against the prisoner's goods, at No. 3 or 4 Colchester-terrace, Old Brompton—I went there with the warrant—the servant was going in with some bread—I went in and found the prisoner there and his two sons—when I got up to the door in the first instance the maid servant screamed out, when she saw us rushing in at the door—I had a man with me—the maid servant then pushed against the door, to stop us from going in—the two sons immediately rushed to the door—I had got myself partly in, and my man was pushing me—the son William Paul Rogers took up a large broom-handle and struck the man on the top of his head—the man ran away directly, leaving me there—I told the father, directly I got into the parlour, I had come to distrain for a year's rent due to Mr. Colchester—he said, "You will just see how we will serve you then"—he struck me three or four times—they had got sticks—I told them they had better not use violence, but see Mr. Colchester, and see what terms they could come to with him; they could do better by mild means than force, but the father said no, he would pay me—he struck me three or four times with a large stick—they had each large sticks, and one had an iron bar—the prisoner had a stick, and struck me across the lions—I was</p>

               <p>standing at the side of the table pulling out my inventory-book, but before I had time to take it out, I was beaten on the loins a very violent blow indeed—I then hallooed out "Murder!" for some one to come to my assistance—it is a very bye place, and very few people there—the prisoner called on his sons to give me a d—d good <hi rend="italic">hiding,</hi> and turn me out of the house—at last I got from them and ran up stairs and pushed up the window—both sons laid upon me with their sticks as hard as they could—William Rogers used an iron bar—I was struck on the head with the iron—the two sons have since been tried—when I was up stairs the prisoner called to his sons to turn me out of the house, and to d—d well pay me—after I got up stairs they forced me from the window—they shut the window and pulled the blinds down, and then forced me down stairs again—on the foot of the stairs the father struck me on the head with a very heavy stick, and I did not see him afterwards—after I got down in the passage, the elder son called out to bring the Turk's knife and cut the b—g—r's throat—one of the sons got it—the prisoner took a way the knife and said, "Oh no, do not use that"—he took the knife away from them with great force, and in the act of taking it away he very much cut his hands—after that I was thrown over the garden wall—I found myself over the wall when I came to my senses—I was laid by, and feel the effects in my head when the weather is bad—I took some physic, and had some plaster on my head—the prisoner has been out of the way till he surrendered.</p>

I signed a distress warrant, and have not seen it since the last trial—the prisoner owed me more than a year's rent—be is an artist I believe—he did not pay regularly—he sometimes gave me half a sovereign—he owed me seven or eight quarters—certainly above twelve month—I authorized Spicer to get it from him.</p>

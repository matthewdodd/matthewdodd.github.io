               <p>Richard Baker, Senr. We have a Ware-house which belongs to me and my Son; we make Lines and Twine in that Place, and these Iron Crows, we stick into the Ground to fasten our Lines to. All I have to say is, on the 23d. of last Month at Night, or the 24th. in the Morning, I know not which, we were robb'd. The Iron Crows I can swear to, the Lines I cannot, tho' I believe I might swear to them. I could have been very willing the Grand Jury should have found the Bill against the Persons where we took the Goods. We miss'd our Goods the next Morning, but could not find them, 'till some Days afterwards.</p>

I knocked my Mother up, and staid half an Hour with her; then I went in the back Yard, dug a Hole, and buried one Bottom of Line in the Yard; the other Bottom, in single Lines as I could spare Time.</p>
               <p>Beshaw. Did not you call me from the Brandy-shop?</p>

Whom we believed to be concerned, and we agreed to have a Penn'orth of Gin together, whereof we turned up to Bigg's again, and there we desired Biggs to stop the Man that brought those Lines; he said he had no Business with it, the Man that brought them should have them. I left one of my Mates there, while I stept down to Justice Philips; and while I was there, word was brought down that the Man that brought the Lines was in Bigg's Shop; he (Charnock) was brought down, and there he told us, the Bolts we should find at Webb's, a Smith's, against Spittle-fields Church, and that some of the Lines were at his Mother's; we went, but the Hole in the Yard was dug up, and the Lines were gone; whereof we searching farther found a Ball of Line buried at their Vault-door, and the Line was my Master's; we found Part of the Hemp in the Cellar, and the best had been spun up.</p>

            . Robinson and I, Beshaw and Tame, went out of the Brandy-shop (I believe 'tis 5 or 6 Weeks ago last Sunday Night) we went down to Hounsditch, and got a Hat from a Gentleman in Liquor; Beshaw went about Bishopsgate street, to Pick Pockets, but could get nothing; D - m me, says Beshaw, let's go into Spittle fields, where I have had many an old Frenchman's Hat: We agreed, and going down Buttermilk-Alley, Beshaw took the old Man's Hat, and cry'd D-m me, I have got his Hat; then Will Tame went thro' an Alley into Phoenix street, and went away.</p>

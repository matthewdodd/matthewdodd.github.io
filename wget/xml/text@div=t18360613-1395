                  </hi>. I keep a cutler's shop in Marchmont-street. On the 13th May I was in a passage behind my shop-door, and saw the prisoner, through the crack of the door, which was half open, come into the shop—he had four pots of geraniums in his arms—I saw him put one pot on the counter, and get his pocket perfectly ready to receive the articles—he took the penknives off the counter, and went out of the shop-door—I went out of the private door, collared him, and brought him back—in begged me very hard to let him go, but I was determined not—he fell on his knees, and said he would give me the four pots of geraniums if I would let him go—he put his hand into his pocket, brought the penknives out, and laid them on the counter—these are them—seven of them are marked with my own name.</p>

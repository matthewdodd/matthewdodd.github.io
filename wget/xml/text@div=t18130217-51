            . I am a parish constable. On Saturday night, the 23d of January, I saw two men under the gateway; they were talking together. I took particular notice of them. One of them followed me. I went through Justice-walk, and just about the centre, I saw the prisoner put something under her petticoats. I said, holloa, mistress, what are you at there. She said, sir, I dare say you are a family man, women cannot do as men can; as if she was making water. She had a green gown piece under her arm. I asked her, what she had got. She said, she bought it; she would go back with me, as I seemed to dispute it. Oh, no, said I, good woman, I do not wish to go back with you upon that business. I kept by the side of her, and followed her all the way down the town, and a man and another woman passed her. I kept on until I saw my brother constable. I said to him, there is something going forward. They went on, and this gown piece was brought to me. They said, it was thrown into a butcher's passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her do any thing with it - A. No. I did not. I went and brought the man back, and we took all three before the magistrate. This is the thirteen yards of printed cotton, a pink ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that thirteen yards of printed cotton brought out of the butcher's shop - A. No, I did not. I was going after the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to the shop did you see the woman - A. She had past it. I saw her just near it. She was taken in custody when she had passed the butcher's shop, and the other man and woman too at the same time. I had gone forward to apprehend the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you the cotton - A.

            . On the 27th of January, I was in Simmonds's shop, at the corner of Lamb-street, and saw the prisoner; he followed this cart to White Lion-street; we stood at the corner, and saw him attempt to take the coat, and in Glasshouse-street he took it, and ran away with it under his arm; he dropped it in Blossom-street. I went and told Pratt.</p>

            Yes; I noticed him before he took it, and know his features. I saw him in custody on the Thursday following - this was on Tuesday.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street; Skelser was in my shop - I saw the prisoner standing opposite my door for twenty minutes, watching another cart - we followed, and saw him make several attempts to get this coat, and at the corner of Blossom-street - he took it, and ran off with it, and I after him, calling Stop thief! he dropped it; I picked it up, and secured him in Lamb-street; I had lost sight of him for a moment, but am sure he is the man. He was not running when I took him.</p>

The prosecutor's house is in Marchmont-street, he is a tobacconist—his house is in the adjoining beat to mine—at two o'clock in the morning, on the 8th day of January, I was there, and saw the prisoner Broadwater standing on the foot-pavement, op<lb></lb>posite the prosecutor's shop—I was about ten yards from him, on the other side—I kept my eye on him, and saw him walk to the area, put his hand down the grating, and receive a white parcel, which he put into his pocket—he stooped again, and received a second parcel, and put that into his pocket—I could not see who handed them to him—I then went up, and saw the female prisoner down the area, talking to him—I heard her wish him good night—there was no one else in the area—there was a gas-light very nearly opposite the shop—I spoke to Broadwater, and asked what he had received out of the area—he said, "Only a few cigars"—he put his hand into his pocket, and gave me a paper, containing twenty-seven cigars—I then told him he was my prisoner—the female prisoner, begged me not to take him to the station-house—I asked how she came to be up so late—she said she had not been in bed—my brother officer came up, and I told him to stop at Mr. Peters' while I took the prisoner Broadwater to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house—on the way he said he would give me all the money he had about him if I would let him go—I told him I could not—I then took him, to the station-house, and there be took out the second paper from his pocket, which also contained twenty-four cigars, and I found on him three cigars, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 101/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I gave him back—I went back, knocked up Mr. Peters, and told him what had happened—I then took the female prisoner in the kitchen—that was about a quarter of an hour after I first saw her—she was still up, but she then had a white night-gown on—when I first saw her, she was quite dressed—Mr. Peters asked what was, her meaning for robbing him—she said, "Master, I know I have done what is wrong, let him go, and transport me"—I was examined twice on this subject, and there was one or two words I did not state the first time—in one of these parcels is a printed paper of Mr. Peter's name—when Broadwater was at the station-house, he said he was going to Bristol the next morning.</p>

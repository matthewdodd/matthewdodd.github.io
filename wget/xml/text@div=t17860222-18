               <p>On the 24th of January last, in the evening, coming home past the prosecutor's house, I heard a glass give a smash, and I saw the two prisoners at the window, there was no one else near it, I was about six yards from them when they dropped the property; there were handkerchiefs, and some aprons, one or two, I picked them up in a hurry, the handkerchiefs were either sewed together or pinned together, but the apron was separate from the others; these are part of the things that I picked up, but whether they are the whole I cannot tell, I am sure they are the same that I picked up, I delivered them to the prosecutor directly; stooping to pick the things up, I lost sight of the prisoners, and in the course of ten minutes or less, I saw them again, a woman apprehended them.</p>
               <p>Had you any knowledge of the prisoners before this time? - No; I did not cry stop thief! there was a woman before them, she clapped hold of the youngest of them, and called out for the prosecutor, the prisoners never offered to stir, they said, they were going to the White Raven, to get a pint of beer; I will venture to swear they are both the people that broke the window; there was light from the window and the lamp, and they were under it.</p>

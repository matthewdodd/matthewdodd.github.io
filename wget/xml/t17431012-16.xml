He was then acquainted that he had a Right to insist on half the Jury to be Aliens; he was indifferent as to that as he knew no body, but at last desired it; and accordingly on his Trial, Raptale Jurquet,

            . On the 16th of September I lost six Guineas and an Half, and eight Shillings; the Money was in a Purse; I lodged in Mr Copenal's House in Suffolk Street, and the Prisoner lodged in the same House. - I had no other Reason to suspect the Prisoner than the Money being found in the Bag of his Wig, in his Room, and in my Purse; I had a Piece of Rhubath in my Purse, and I am sensible this is the same Piece which I had in my Purse; here are six Guineas, an Half, and eight Shillings, and a Farthing, which were all in this Purse when I left it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They found in my Room just so much Money as the Gentleman says.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner being asked what he had to say for himself; he said it was Necessity that obliged him to take this Money in order to pay his Landlord that he owed some Money to, for Fear he should not be able to get out of the Country; that he is a Stranger here, and knows no body.</p>
               <p>Mr Copenal. The Prisoner was recommended to me by a Person in Holland for a Lodger. I never heard he had any Business here; he has been with me these eight Weeks all but two Days. I took him for a Gentleman, and he has had his Living with me all the Time.</p>
               <p>- Hughes. I had a Warrant brought me by Mr Fitzgerald to search Mr Copenal's House for some Money that he had lost, and I found this Wig hanging up against the Wall in the Prisoner's Room, and in the Bag of the Wig was this Purse, with six Guineas, and an Half, and eight Shillings in Silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the Prisoner wear this Wig?</p>
               <p>Copenal. I cannot say that I ever saw him wear a Bag-Wig, I have seen this Wig in his Room, to the best of my Knowledge it does not belong to any body else, for no body went into his Room that I know of. <rs id="t17431012-16-verdict70" type="verdictDescription">

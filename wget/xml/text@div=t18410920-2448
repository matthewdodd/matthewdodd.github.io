                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Hancock, and live at No. 4, Thornhill-street, Islington—the prisoner lodged at our house. About five o'clock, on the 10th of September, I saw her come in with another female to go into her own apartment—I did not see her go in, but I heard her directly she had come in, go up to her own apartment—a few minutes after I saw the other female come down, and go out—I was afterwards crossing the passage, and saw the prisoner come out of my bed-room, and go into her own room, which joins it—I went up stairs to my bed-room, and missed two boxes out of a drawer—I found the door open, with a key in it, which I had left locked, and I missed these two boxes—I immediately went to the prisoner's door, pushed it open, and saw the boxes on her table—I asked what she was doing with them, or how she got them—she said she found them on the table—I called my husband—he called a policeman, and gave her into custody—the boxes contained the articles stated in the indictment, except the rings, which were taken out of another box in the same drawer—one of them was found on the prisoner's mother, and the duplicate of the other also.</p>

I was sent for, and took the prisoner into custody—I found this property on the table in a room occupied by the prisoner—after searching the boxes, and finding they contained what the prosecutrix said, I asked the prisoner if she was aware what she was charged with—she said, "Yes, I will go with you; I wish I may get seven years."</p>

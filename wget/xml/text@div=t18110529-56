               <p>Q. Did you see this unfortunate circumstance, and when was it - A. On last Saturday, the 18th, I was in my parlour drinking tea, I saw the deceased dragged from under the cart after it was turned over, he was almost dead.</p>
               <p>Q. He died afterwards, did not he - A. Yes. I did not see how the accident happened.</p>

            . I live in Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in Drury-lane at the time of the accident - A. I was sitting in the cart behind, I could not see plainly how it was; I saw the waggon coming with three or four horses, the prisoner had the whip in his hand. I believe he was driving his own waggon. We saw the waggon coming up Drury-lane, the deceased drew the horse off and the cart to the curb.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the waggon and the cart come in contact - A. Not till the cart was drawed to the curb to give the waggon room.</p>
               <p>Q.They were going in separate directions, one was passing the other, were not they - A. We were coming down the hill, and the waggon going up, and as we were coming down the lane the coal waggon struck the cart wheel; I believe they were going as quiet as they could go.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was driving the waggon, was not he - A. Yes, I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us whether he was careless, or intended any injury - A. I should not think he intended any injury to the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to intend coming in contact with the cart - A. He did not stay when he was called to. I called to him to mind his horses, and directly as I called to him the cart was overturned.</p>
               <p>Q. What I want to know is, was it his fault, or could he get out of the way - A. Yes, there was room for the waggon to get out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the deceased - A. He was sitting by the side of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he reins - A. Yes. The cart was throwed over. I jumped out of the cart, and the deceased fell under the shafts.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether the prisoner intended to do it for the purpose - A. I could not see it plainly whether he did or not; he did not offer to stop the waggon when he was called to.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he heard you - A. I dare say he heard, because one answered.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it carelessly done - A. He did not appear to draw the waggon of one side when he was called to.</p>
               <p>Mr Gurney. This was a coal waggon full of coals - A. Yes, and it was drawn by three or four horses.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sitting behind at first, you did not see how it was - A. Yes; I was sitting behind, I did not see it till afterwards where the coalman was. The deceased called out four or five feet before they met.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say the deceased's cart was stopped before the wheels met - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the two wheels meet in an instant after the deceased called out - A. No; the small wheel struck first, and then afterwards the large wheel struck and overset the cart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Might it not be done by accident - A. I think it was through neglect it was done.</p>
               <p>JAMES GILLAM. Q. Were you with the cart - A. Yes, I was sitting by the side of the man that was driving the cart. The cart was on the left hand side of the lane, and the waggon on the right; they were both going a regular pace, we met the waggon, the carman called out to the coal waggoner to give him room, the waggoner did not draw up at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How much more room could he have given him - A There was a great deal of room on the other side, our cart was close to the curb, we could not give more room than we did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Corey. What is the width of the road there - A. I have measured the road there, sixteen feet eight inches from curb to curb.</p>
               <p>Gillam. The small wheel struck the cart, and the large wheel over turned the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Now how much was there to spare from the side of the waggon to the curb-stone - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know what the prisoner could have done to prevent that - A. He might have drawn off.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was there to have drawn off - A. I cannot say. The deceased cried out to him, and he made no answer.</p>

            . I was in Drury-lane; I saw the cart coming down the lane, the waggon was going up, I saw the waggon very near the cart, I thought it would turn it over, I stopped and looked, it did turn it over. I did not observe whose fault it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in fact could the prisoner have avoided it - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>JAMES HEATH. I am a surgeon. I saw the man after he was brought to the hospital, the man died before he reached me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>

On the 8th of November I put a dozen spoons into the kitchen cupboard, and saw them there at eleven o'clock in the morning, and missed them at half-past one - I was at home all the time - the area gate was not locked; a person could come down there to the kitchen. I found them at Hatton-garden on the Saturday week following; they were four table, two dessert, and six tea spoons.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 8th of November, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020060"></xptr>in Wilderness-row, Clerkenwell, in company with another person; I suspected him - I followed them, and took the prisoner; he ran away, leaving his hat in my hands, and in it were these twelve spoons. I followed him two hundred yards, and he was stopped. I asked him where they came from - he said I should soon find out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You met him a great way from Mary-le-bone? A. Yes, three miles - another person was with him.</p>
               <p>SARAH EMMETT. I know these spoons to be my master's, by the initials M. M. C., which are on all his plate; I do not know why. I have lived five months with him.</p>

            . I am a silversmith and jeweller. These spoons appear to be silver, but I would not swear that they are so - (breaking one.) - Yes, they are silver, but of a very inferior sort. I suppose them to be made abroad; we dare not sell such; they have not got the hall mark. I should think them worth 4 s. an ounce; the largest weighs about two ounces; the dessert spoons about half an ounce, and the tea spoons about a quarter of an ounce.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Which is there most of, silver or alloy? A. Silver. I must assay it to tell the exact quantity of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked them up - the officer immediately came and laid hold of me.</p>

I went to the solicitor's office, and saw the bond. (looking at it;) it was executed as it is now. In consequence of suspicion Faulkener was sent to, and introduced to the prisoner at the solicitor's office, and Faulkener was asked if he had executed that bond - he said he did not: the prisoner said nothing, and was taken into custody.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Parkins, solicitor to the Post-office; I received a paper with the names of the sureties from the prisoner, upon which I prepared a bond for execution; the prisoner executed it in my presence, on Saturday, the 17th of July, and stated that as Mr. Faulkener and his father resided at some distance, he would feel obliged if I would allow him to take the bond to them for their signatures; I gave it to him for that purpose, he said he would bring it back as quick as possible; and if I recollect right, he said he would bring it in the evening, and if I was not in the office, he would drop it into the letter-box, and on coming on Monday morning, I found it in the box - our office is in the General Post Office; it appeared to be executed by his father and Faulkener. Woods came in about two o'clock; I asked the prisoner if he had got that bond duly executed - if it had been signed by his father and Faulkener. The bond was then before him; he said he had, and pointed to Faulkener's signature, and said it was done in Faulkener's parlour, in the presence of

               <p>Q. I believe you rather led him to understand that you would - A. I believe he went away under that idea, but my wife disapproved of it, in consequence of which I afterwards refused. I said to him,</p>
               <p>"I will not sign it, but anything I can do in your favour I will" - that I was very sorry to refuse him, and would do it with pleasure, but for family affairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say, that having promised your wife, you could not sign it, but if your name was signed by him you should not object to it - A. I gave him to understand to that effect.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Do you swear positively that you said that - A. I believe I did.</p>

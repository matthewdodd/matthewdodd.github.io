            . The prisoner employed me to sell an hundred pounds of 3 per cent. annuities on the 8th of November 1765. This was in the gateway in the Bank of England. I was talking to a gentlewoman. The prisoner asked me what the price of stocks was. I asked him what stocks; he said, consolidated 3 per cent. I told him the price was 91 5/8 a 2 3/4 per cent. he told he wanted to sell one hundred pounds. I was going to take that gentlewoman's direction that I was to sell for her, and if he would go along with me I would take his directions that he proposed to sell. We went all three together into the 3 per cent. reduce room. As soon as I had taken the gentlewoman's, I took his for an hundred pounds: the use of taking the direction is, to explain the stock, the name they have, the trade, and the place of abode, and the sum they intend to sell out. When that is done, it is delivered into the ticket books and alphabetical books.</p>

            , that I saw the prisoner sign. There was no transfer made, because it did not answer to the name in the books. After I had seen the prisoner sign it, I went away, and when I came up again, I found an obstacle arose between the prisoner and the clerk, I think it was Mr. Edwards. I asked the reason why the transfer would not pass. I was told there was no such account, or to that purpose. I went away again, and when I returned the prisoner was gone. The difficulty arose in spelling the name, and Gent. instead of brandy merchant.</p>

After I had talked with him, and described the prisoner, I went to the Bank, and told the gentlemen what I had discovered. Mr. Melling told me who he thought it must be. Then Mr. Helstone, Mr. Cooper, Mr. Plumpton, Mr. Edwards, and I, there were six of us in all, went to see for the prisoner, and met with him at the Blind Beggar, on Bethnal-green. I think this was on the 13th of November: he was coming out of the back part of the house with a pipe in his mouth. I asked him how he could use us so ungenteel: he said; in what. I said, in withdrawing yourself, and not paying me my commission. His answer was, there was nothing done. I said, that was his fault and not ours. Then he asked me what the difference was. I said, almost every body knew my commission was half a crown, and as to Mr. Plumpton, he had sold out stock to pay me, (Mr. Plumpton had informed me he had sold outan hundred pounds stock to pay me) and the market went against him. I told the prisoner we could not settle it till we went to the Bank, and we would settle it by that day's market price. He agreed so to do, and came along with us. When we came to the Bank, Mr. Edwards charged an officer at the Bank with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this in the presence of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Plumpton. No, it was not. I saw him soon after. Mr. Trobridge said, write your name upon it to have the transfer for it. I wrote my name upon it, and put it forward to the letters M. to R. and Mr. Edwards the Bank clerk wrote that letter. Mr. Trobridge desired me to fill up a receipt, which I did (he looks at a paper). This is it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him sign it?</p>
               <p>Plumpton. No, I did not. There was no transfer made. The prisoner and I went in order to make it, and the Bank clerk said there was no such account.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to that?</p>
               <p>Plumpton. He said there was stock there, or he knew there was stock there, or words to that effect. Mr. Edwards said, he must be wrong, there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190027"></xptr> was no such description. The prisoner repeatedly said, he was not mistaken, he was sure there was stock there, and Mr. Edwards was mistaken. Upon its not being found, Mr. Trobridge had the receipt, but Mr. Edwards gave me the receipt that I had wrote my name on. I said to the prisoner, it was very strange he should come there to sell stock, and not know how to find it. He said, he knew there was stock there, but he wanted the ticket again. He said, give me the ticket again, and I'll call upon you. I said, I will give you no ticket; I have to do with your broker. Then he said, well then, I'll go with you to the broker. I prepared to go down with him, and in turning round to speak to somebody or other, the prisoner dropped me, and I could see no more of him. I concluded he was gone to the reduce. I went and called for the name Malling. I found the broker, but he was gone.</p>

             since?</p>
               <p>Plumpton. I have. On the Tuesday following I went with others to Bethnal green. We did not meet with the prisoner. We went six of us the next morning to his lodgings, and found he was just gone out. We were directed to the Blind Beggar. Mr. Trobridge and I went there, and found him coming from the back part of the house. Mr. Trobridge told him it was very unhandsome of him to go away, after he had employed him to sell an hundred pound stock, and said, if every body was to serve him so he should starve. I said, with respect to myself, I sold out stock, and it is a loss to me, which I cannot at present ascertain, therefore I am come to know if you are willing to pay me the difference. He said there was nothing done, and asked what was the difference; he said he was not against paying that: he offered to pay Mr. Trobridge half a crown. We proposed to have it settled at the Bank, which he agreed to; then we adjourned to the Bank clerks, and came all together to the Bank; he said nothing at all tending to shew he was not the man.</p>

               <p>Q. What countryman is he, for some found the letter was others do a?</p>
               <p>Melling. I do not know. His father was a tenant of mine at Islington: he has been to sea: his father died, and left him 600 l. in the Reduced. He was with me once when a broker bought me 400 l. in the Consols, that is 5 years ago. The broker spent the evening with me. I was possessed of 500 l. on the 8th of last November in the Consols, of 3 per cent. I never knew before but that he was a very honest man.</p>

I am assistant to George Russell Miles, of 1, James Street, Covent Garden—on l9th December I was called up at a few minutes after six, and found that an iron trap in the cellar had been forced up which is flush with the pavement, and which was safe the night before—you can get from the cellar into the shop—I missed about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver and copper from the till in the shop—the prisoner was in my master's employ two years ago—I also missed this padlock and two keys belonging to the trap—they were inside—they were my master's property.</p>

I was on duty on this morning, and found that the iron grating had been forced open—I went to the station for assistance, and the prisoner unlocked the cellar-flap, opened the doors, and came up with the lock and keys in his hand—I asked him what he was doing there—he said that he was cellar porter there—I asked his name—he said "Smith"—I asked where he lived—he</p>

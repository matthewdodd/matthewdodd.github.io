                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Millard, a trunk-maker, in Skinner-street, Snow-hill. On the 4th of February, a strange man called at the shop, and ordered a trunk to be sent to No. 14, Queen<lb></lb>hithe, for him to take down to Camberwell-grove in his own chaise, for his daughter's approval, and if she liked it he would have one at three guineas and a half, for his son to go to college with, and a trunk a-piece for his two daughters—I sent one trunk that afternoon by Mr. Millard's son—on the following day the same person called, and said the trunk was hardly good enough, but he would make it do, and a trunk like it was to he sent down that morning, with a portmanteau at three guineas and a half, to be there in time for his cart, which was going down to Camberwell-grove with some wine—in consequence of inquiries my master had made, I went with the porter with the things, and saw the prisoner James—I said I had brought the trunks down—he said Mr. M'Carthy had gone to the Docks, he would be at home in. half an hour—we said we would wait—he said it would be useless to wait, as it would be very uncertain what time he would come in, and then we took them back—next morning I went again, and saw James—he said Mr. M'Carthy had just gone to the Docks, and while we were there the stranger who had given me his name as Mr. M'Carthy came in, and said in the presence of the prisoner James that he had just seen my employer, and made his arrangements with him, and I might leave the goods with him, for it was all safe, and he would call at three o'clock in the afternoon, and pay for them—I did not leave them, as I had received information—we never got paid for the one trunk—I asked for the money on the Friday and Saturday, and on the Monday following—I saw the prisoner James on all those occasions—he told me it was all right, and we might leave them, that Mr. M'Carthy was very much surprised we did not leave them on the Friday, and if we had left them Mr. M'Carthy would have called and paid us—I never saw the prisoner John.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Mr. Millard. I went with a trunk to Queenhithe, and delivered it to the prisoner James—I said I had brought a trunk for Mr. M'Carthy—he said it was right, and I left it—I went afterwards with Kempstead to get the money, but never could.</p>

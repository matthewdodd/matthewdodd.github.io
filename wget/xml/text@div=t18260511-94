            . I am porter to Mr. Fallows. I saw the prisoner in the shop on the 14th of April; my master directed me to take this fender and fire-irons with the prisoner, and to receive 3l. 2s. 6d. or 2l. 12s. 6d., according to which set of irons was kept - he told me to bring the money back; the prisoner heard that. I then went with the prisoner, and he took me to King-street. Westminster, then to Princes-street, where we went into a public-house, and he called for a pot of porter; I took some of it - he then took up the goods, and said he would take them up to the lady, to see which she would have, but he went out of the house the back way; I had some suspicion, and asked the landlord if he lived there; he said, No - I then went out, and saw him running with the goods; I cried Stop thief! he threw them into the street, and was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you say I took the things up stairs? A. You said you would - I did not give you leave to take them; you said you would take them to show the lady, and instead of that you took them out.</p>

                  </hi>. I occupy a room with my sister, at No. 54, Red Lion Street. I went to bed about 1 o'clock on 20th Dec.—the room door was shut, but was not locked—the house belongs to Mrs. Charlotte Stevenson—after I had been in bed I heard a noise on the stairs; it was about half past 2 or a quarter before 3 o'clock—I was going to get up, but I had not the courage to do so, as the key of the room door was outside—I got up about 5 o'clock, when I was roused by the landlady, and then the things were missing—I had seen the dresses safe the night before; I put some of them on the bed myself—the watch was on the small dressing table by the side of the bed.</p>

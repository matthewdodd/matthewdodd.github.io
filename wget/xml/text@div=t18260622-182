On the 3d of June, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I heard a knock at the door, and, on coming down stairs, I saw the prisoner going out with these two mattresses; I called him back - he put down the mattresses at the next house, and was going on - I collared him and brought him back - he said a gentleman had told him to take them.</p>

            . I am a journeyman baker. I knocked at Mr. Henman's door - the prisoner passed me with these two mattresses - I made room for him to pass; Mr. Henman came down and called to him to stop, two or three times, and then he was secured.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I tell you a gentleman desired me to carry them? A. No; you said it would be all one a hundred years hence.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A gentleman called to me, and said "Will you carry this bundle to No. 45, Old-street, and I will pay you?" I took it up to follow him, and then this gentleman called to me to stop, and I did - the gentleman had gone forward. I am a poor man in the work-house - if I was to die this very minute I came by it innocently.</p>
               <p>JOHN LORD re-examined. Q. Did you see any gentleman near the place? A. No; the prosecutor asked his reason for taking them, and he kneeled down and begged a thousand pardons for him to let him off.</p>

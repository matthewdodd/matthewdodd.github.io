            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Heron and Co. About three weeks ago the prisoner came and delivered some goods from Eastman and Co., and after he brought them in, he was standing in the warehouse, his hat fell off, and I perceived a great many nutmegs falling about in different parts; I looked into his hat and saw some more nutmegs, and two pieces of ginger - there might be a pound or a pound and a half of nutmegs; he said it was a parcel he got had to deliver, and the paper or bag had burst - he said who he was to take it to, but I forget the name; I sent to Mr. Eastman's about it.</p>
               <p>MR. EASTMAN. In consequence of a message from Mr. Heron's, I saw the prisoner soon after seven o'clock in the evening, and asked what he had done with the nut-megs which fell out of his hat; he said "What nutmegs?" I asked him again, and he said "I had no nutmegs;" I put the question to him a third time, mentioning Heron's,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040081"></xptr>where they had fallen from his hat - he then said if I would step aside, he would tell me all about it; I said nothing to induce him to confess - I retired behind the premises with him, he fell on his knees, begged I would not hurt him, and said he had taken them away, and that he had done it through distress; he had 18s. a week - he said, at that time, his wife and child had not bread to eat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is he a married man? A. I suppose so; I saw his wife and child that night.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you go and look into his cart that evening? A. He told me they were in his cart, and I saw the officer find above 2lbs. of nutmegs there - they are worth more than 11s.; he repeated his statement before both my partners - we had missed 2lbs. or 3lbs. of nutmegs from a cask that day; they were such as these,</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Not any of these can be sworn to- I used to deal in pices in a small way; those in the cart were my own.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 28.</p>
               <p>Recommended to Mercy by the Jury, on account of his character.</p>

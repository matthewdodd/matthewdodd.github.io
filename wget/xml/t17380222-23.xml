'Twas about seven o'Clock in the Evening, and I was in a Hurry, but however, I went with her into Oakley's House, and there we had a Dram of Something, - I don't know what they call'd it. When they ask'd me for the Money for it, I told them I had no less than half a Guinea about me, so I left a Pair of Silver Buttons in Pawn with them, while I went to a Baker's in Drury-Lane, to get my half Guinea chang'd. When I came back to redeem my Buttons, they demanded a Shilling for the Dram, which I gave them, and then desired they would let me go; but they refus'd and lock'd the Door, swearing they would have my Heart's Blood if I would not give them a Shilling a-piece. Rather than loose my Life, I gave each of them a Shilling, and seeing a Back-door open, I ran to it, to escape that way; they pursu'd me, and got hold of my Coat, but I got over a Wall into Mr. Hind's Yard, and begg'd of him to let me through. I was not above seven or eight Minutes in the House, - no longer than we were drinking the Dram, and all the three Prisoners were in Company together. I never meddled with any of them, but they threaten'd my Life, and I had no Civility at all from them.</p>
               <p>- Hind. I know nothing of the Robbery, only the young Fellow got into my Yard, and offer'd me six Pence to let him through my Backdoor; he told me he got over the Wall from a Parcel of Women, who threaten'd his Life.</p>
               <p>Mr. De Veil. The Man appear'd before me, and complain'd of an Assault: I committed them for an Assault and Misdemeanor, and had no Thoughts of seeing them here, indicted for a Felony. All <rs id="t17380222-23-verdict105" type="verdictDescription">

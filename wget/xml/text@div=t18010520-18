               <p>Q.What is the value of them? - A.The full value of them is not more than 1s. or 1s. 2d.</p>
               <p>CHARLES SHAVE sworn. - I am apprentice to Mr. Tweed; I fastened up the shop window on Wednesday, the 27th of April, in the evening, in the usual mode of fastening; my master was the last person up; I was called up by the watchman about two o'clock in the morning, and found the shutter, between the bar and the window, broke; the shutter was not forced at all; I saw the shoes in the watchman's hand; I only know them to be my master's by the look of them.</p>
               <p>JOHN M'CARTY sworn. - I am a watchman: On the 28th of April, about two o'clock in the morning, I was sitting upon a butcher's stall, and heard some glass fall; I stood up, looked round me, and presently heard another piece fall; I looked across the way, and saw the prisoner standing at Mr. Tweed's window; I ran across, and when I was a most half way to the door, the shutter dropped down when the shutter dropped, she rather sell back from the window; I do not think she saw me till I laid hold of her, for I had no light; it was moon-light; she drew forward again towards the window before I laid hold of her; I laid hold of her, and seeing her hand all over blood, I said, good woman, you have been doing a nice job; she said, what did I mean, and asked me if that was Mr. Tweed's house; she said she knew Mr. Tweed very well; she asked me if I did not see three men pass by; I told her I did not; I called the patrol to my assistance, and we called Mr. Tweed up; when I took her to the watch-house, she was searched, and she dropped the bolt of the window,(produces it); there was nothing else found upon her; these shoes were found close to her upon the pavement, but I did not find them upon her, (produces them); here is her own handkerchief, (produces a pocket-handkerchief stained with blood); she pulled cut a shilling, or a sixpence, I cannot say which, and said, here is something for you to drink, and let me go about my business, but we detained her.</p>
               <p>Tweed. I had a great number of little shoes in the window; I believe these to be mine; they have no mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Between twelve and one I was coming home from Stepney-green, and when I got to Mr. Tweed's window, there were three men standing; one of them struck me with the pin of the window, and my hand was very much bruised; I immediately called for the watchman, and then one of the men hit me immediately on the side of the head, and ran away; I took up the pin of the window, and offered to give it to the watchman, but he would not take it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To M'Carty). Did she call out, watch? - A. No; no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she make you any offer of the pin, and did you refuse it? - A. Not in the least; it drop ped from her at the watch-house.</p>

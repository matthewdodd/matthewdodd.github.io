                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Phillips, a carpenter in the Dock-yard; we also keep a cheesemonger's shop in High-street, Wool<lb></lb>wich. On the 21st of November, between eight and nine o'clock in the in, I was serving in the shop, and saw a soldier go by the window a tub of butter, which had been in my shop—I ran out, and my son-in-law and my husband after me—they got before me, and went up an ✗ by the side of our house—I followed them—I went into a neigh<lb></lb>bour's, got a light, and saw the tub of butter—I waited till my husband up, who took it back to the shop—there was then a cry out, "We got him"—my husband ran out, and the prisoner knocked him down, and splintered his right leg—he has never been out since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shipwright in the Dock-yard, and live in Queen-street, Woolwich. I was in the parlour adjoining the shop, looking through the window—I saw Mrs. Phillips serving a customer—somebody said something to me—I ran up Goff-yard, which is a public thoroughfare, and got a light—I saw the prisoner—he turned to the right instead of con<lb></lb>tinuing the thoroughfare—I questioned him as to the propriety of his being there—he said he went to make water—I asked him where the butter was—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183711270170"></xptr>
               <p>made no reply directly, but, a short time after, he said, "Gentlemen, I know I have done wrong, but I had no ill-intention "—he was dressed one of the artillery great-coats—I left him in charge of two young me and went for an officer—when I came back he was at Mr. Phillips's door, and the butter was found in Goff-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> My reason for saying I had done wrong was, because I at<lb></lb>tempted to run away, which I was very sorry for—my officer could give me a good character, and I would not have risked that for twenty tubs of butter. What could I do with a tub?—I could not conceal it—the place; a public thoroughfare—any person might be there without my taking notice of them. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Not above three minutes elapsed between my coming out of the shop and taking him—the prosecutor's is the corner house I the court, and I took him about thirty yards up the court—I did not see any other soldier there.</p>

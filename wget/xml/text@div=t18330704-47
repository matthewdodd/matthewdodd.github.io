On the Wednesday before I lost the watch, I saw Wilson, who came to buy her child a frock - on the Saturday after, the (15th of June,) she came again, about six o'clock, to know if a shirt, which she had ordered for her little boy, was done; she stayed about two minutes, and when she was gone I missed the watch from the mantel-piece; I am certain it was there when she came in, as I looked at it to see the time - she was tipsy- I gave information - she had come towards the mantelpiece - this is it.</p>
               <p>Wilson. She was not there. Witness. No, not at six o'clock; I was there when she came at five o'clock, to ask if the shirt was done; she then went away, she was tipsy at that time - I did not see her afterwards - I then went out at five minutes before six o'clock, and saw the watch there then.</p>

             (police-constable D 117). On the 15th of June, I went with Mrs. Grange to different pawnbrokers to stop the watch - in going down Crawford-street we saw Wilson standing at a door, about half-past seven o'clock - Mrs. Grange said,"That is the woman;" I went and caught hold of her, I said I wanted her for stealing a watch from Mitcham-street - she turned and saw Mrs. Grange, and exclaimed, "O my God! I have done wrong, I know I have done wrong, but I did not pawn it" - she was rather tipsy - I saw something shine in her hand, which I thought was the watch, but I found in her hand four half-crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence - she said "I did not pawn it, Matthews pawned it" - I went and got the watch, and took Matthews.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You knew him before? A. Yes, he gave his right name and address - as he was going out of our shop he met the other prisoner, and gave her something, which, I believe, was the money.</p>
               <p>Wilson's Defence. I took the watch, and was going to take it back, when I met this prisoner, who said he would take it to pawn in his own name, and it would not be found out.</p>

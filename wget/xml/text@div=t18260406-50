               <p>JOHN MOULTON. I live at Friern, Barnet. On Saturday, the 11th of March, I was at Colney-hatch - I had been at the Orange Tree public-house, in company, for seven or eight hours, and left about half-past eleven o'clock; I was not drinking all the time - I was perfectly sober - I was going home, and the two prisoners overtook me - I had not seen them at the public house: Neadon accosted me, and said, "We have been at Taff's, to get some beer,(Taff keeps the house I had been to,) but the bar was shut up." I said, "Have you?" he said, "We have been into the country to meet some sheep, and there are none up." I said "Have you?" I was then on the road leading from <placeName id="t18260406-50-crimeloc266">Colney-hatch</placeName>

I said, "For God's sake spare my life, on account of my wife and six children" - one of them pinned me down with his thumb and fingers in my throat - he squeezed my throat - I don't know which of them it was exactly. - he used one hand to do that, and had the other in my left hand pocket - I had from 10s. to 15s. in that pocket; the other man rifled my right hand pocket, in which were two sovereigns, at the same time; Neadon was at my right hand pocket, where I had the sovereigns, and he was fumbling round the waistband of my breeches, and asked for my watch; I was still on the ground flat on my back - I said, I have have no watch;" he said "Let me have none of your lies,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060026"></xptr>if you don't give it up easy I will shoot you;" the other did not speak a word - they left me flat on my back for dead.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they left you for dead? A. They walked away quietly - when I was able to get up, I followed and saw them about one hundred yards before me - they went over a gate into a field, and I lost sight of them; it was not moonlight - there are no lamps there - I returned into Colney-hatch village, and came to Mr. Ely, a carpenter; I described their persons; I was very much bruised about my head - there is a wound there now; I bled a good deal - here is the smock frock which I had on (producing it) - it is covered with blood; on the following day (Sunday) I was going along a private road belonging to Mr. Bensley, on the other side Colney-hatch - I saw the two prisoners there; I could have sworn to them a quarter of a mile off in a straight line; I was within two hundred yards of them - they saw me - my head was bandaged up at the time - when they saw me they turned out of the road and walked across the fields - that was a different direction to what they appeared to be in when they saw me - they appeared to be going across the fields towards the Swan public house, near Whetstone; I went out at the New Road round by the Old North Road to meet them; I had them in my eye within about two fields of the road directly opposite the Swan, and met them exactly at the gate opposite the Swan - they had then two men with them - the two men had each a bundle of turnip tops - one of the two men asked me "Where are you going, are you going to the doctor's?" (I knew those men by name and by sight.) I said, "No, I am not going, but I have more need to be at the doctor's than here; I was stopped last night and robbed by these two men," and asked them to assist me, and we secured them, and took them to the Swan and delivered them to Simmons and Curry, the horse-patrol; I never saw the prisoners before that night to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. You had been at the public-house several hours? A. Yes; I drank some porter part of the time; I was dealing there with graziers about taking cattle on my land - that is my business; I tossed up for dry money, not for liquor - that took about three quarters of an hour; I went to the house between twelve and one o'clock, or perhaps later, and left at half-past eleven; I did not dine there - I had some bread and cheese; I took some roast beef about half-past ten, or not quite so late.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you see one hundred yards before you? A. It was star-light - I could see their persons one hundred yards before me, not to distinguish their faces; I was quite sober; I returned to the village and described them by their dress and stature.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not told that Neadon and Leech had been in the house that night at that time? A. Not exactly at that time - I was told so.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them next day did you not ask whether their names were Neadon and Leech? A. Yes; I said they were the men who robbed me before I asked that - Peat and Smith were with them; I wanted no assistance to take them - they said they did not rob me, and would walk quietly to the public-house, and did so - they were searched - about 6s. was found on one, and 4s. 6d. on the other.</p>

            . On the 11th of March, about a quarter to twelve o'clock, Moulton called me out of bed and said he had been stopped by two footpads, who robbed him of all he had got, and ill used him - he was all over blood - he had this smock frock on all over blood - my daughter washed him - he had a bruise on his head; I took him home - he described the men to me by their dress - he was as sober as ever I saw him - I have known him twenty years; I had been in bed about two hours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The dress he described was I suppose common? A. Yes; he described their height - the prisoners are as near the height as possible - he said they were five feet three or four inches high.</p>

            . I am ostler at the Orange Tree public-house. Moulton frequents our house; I saw him there as late as half-past ten on that night - the prisoners were both there this night; I knew them both before by their coming to the house - they came in at a quarter before ten o'clock, and sat on the same side of the room as Moulton - about four persons from him - they had a pint of porter; I took Moulton a plate of beef before they came in; I left him and the prisoners there when I went to bed - he was sober then; I am sure the prisoners were there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say he was as sober as you are now? A. Yes, I am sure of it - I went to bed at half-past ten o'clock; Moulton did not show his cash about in my presence.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol of Bow-street, and am stationed near Whetstone, two or three hundred yards from the Swan. In consequence of information I went to the Swan with Currie, and found Moulton there with his head glutted in blood - the prisoners were there - I took them in charge and searched them - they had trousers on - Leech's trousers and coat had several marks of blood - here are marks of blood on the sleeve of his coat, and here are his trousers - there was blood on the wristband of his shirt on the same arm as his coat - both legs of the trousers are bloody near the bottom in the front part; I did not observe any blood on Neadon's clothes; I had seen them several times before - one lives at Whetstone; Neadon's father and mother lives in the village, and Leech's mother lives in the village.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you be positive the stain on the trousers is blood? A. Part of it is blood - some of the stain is oak bark, but there is a stain on the back of the trousers and in the front, with blood and oak bark; I saw these marks about eleven o'clock on the Sunday morning, but did not take their clothes off till we brought them to Bow-street; the shirt was not clean - it had been worn before.</p>

            . I am a licensed slaughterer of horses, and keep a slaughter-house in Buck's-row. Whitechapel. On Monday, the 13th of March, between 5 and 6 o'clock, the prisoner came to my premises with a gelding, and asked if I would purchase it; I said, Yes, and asked his price; he said 2l. I walked round the horse, examined it, and put several questions to him, where he got it, and whose it was - he said it was his own, that he had brought it from Brentford that morning. I said it was a long distance to come so early, and this circumstance excited my suspicion, for the horse was cool, and if it had come that distance it would have been warm. I then asked why he wished to part with it, as it did not ail any thing - he said, because it would not draw. I detained him - advertised it, and on the Friday following had it led about Smithfield, with a label on its forehead, stating that the owner might have it. Gunn saw it, and claimed it.</p>
               <p>JOHN GUNN. I am a <rs id="t18260406-70-viclabel375" type="occupation">carman</rs>

On Sunday, the 12th of March. I turned it out in the field at <placeName id="t18260406-70-crimeloc376">Limehouse</placeName>

I saw it safe at seven o'clock in the evening, and missed it next morning, the 13th. I found it at Smithfield with a label on its head, and knew it to be mine - and Monk shewed it to me in his stable afterwards. I know nothing of the prisoner. It is worth 3l. 10s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I came on shore from Mr. Kates' barge at the Regent's-canal-basin, and in the road to Whitechapel I was accosted by two men, one dressed in a woollen cap, smock-frock, and trousers, and the other in a brown coat and top boots; they asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060036"></xptr>where I was going - I said towards home, Brentford; the one in the brown coat asked where I lived; I said, "With my father, near the Salutation public-house, at Brentford"- he asked if I would assist the other man to dispose of the horse, as he had another to dispose of, and as he was coming towards Brentford he would pay me. I was desired to ask 40s. for it, and say I brought it from the Salutation. I assure you I am totally innocent.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

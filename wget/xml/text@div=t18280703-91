I lost twelve pairs of upper-leathers on Sunday, the 8th of June out of a box - I had seen them on the Friday before; I did not miss them till the Tuesday after - the box was in the room where I sleep and work; it had no lock on it - the prisoner's son has worked for me twelve months, and I took her in out of charity; I took my bed out to oblige her and her three children - these are my upper-leathers, but since they were taken nine pairs of them have had soles put on them.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker, and live in Spitalfields. The prisoner came to my shop on Sunday the 8th of June, and brought a number of upper-leathers - I did not see them particularly; I looked at one or two, and refused to buy them - but I firmly believe these are a part of them; I said, I manufactured my own work in general, and what I did not, I bought of Mr. Stokes - she said, she was in great distress, and her children were starving.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my house that Sunday, and asked me to buy these upper-leathers; I said, I never bought things in that way - she said, "My husband died in great distress, and my four children have been two days without food, if you would let me have 2s. on them, I should be very much obliged to you," and out of humanity I let her have it, as I could not get rid of her; a man who works for me, came to my house - I gave them to him to put soles to them; I gave them to the officer.</p>

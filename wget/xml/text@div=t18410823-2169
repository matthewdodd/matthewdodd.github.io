                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 174.) Between six and seven o'clock last Thursday evening, I stopped the prisoner in Devonport-mews, Paddington—he had a coat in front of him, and a basket behind him, and</p>

               <p>the cord over his shoulder—I felt the weight of the basket, and said, "What have you got here; iron?"—he said, "Yes"—he then knocked me on the arm, and said he only took it to get a drop of beer—he said it was all right—I said I should like to see what was in the basket—he said, in fact he did not know what it was, or who put it there—I then searched the coat, which was in front of him—I found a ladle full of lead in one pocket, and in the other pocket three smaller pieces—they weighed 48lbs. —I said I should like to see what was in the basket—he said, "You can look over it, if you like, I shall be back in half-an-hour, we will have a drop of rum together"—I took him to the station—in going down Hamp<lb></lb>stead-road, I saw some ladles and melting lead, and in one of the ladles there are four marks, which correspond with marks on this lead—I have no doubt this lead came from that ladle.</p>

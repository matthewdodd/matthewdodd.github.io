                  </hi>. I lay down iron plates on railroads, for the carriages to run on—I live at Sellinge, about six miles from Ashford, in Kent. On Saturday the 7th of Jan., I came to London, and was walking in St. Paul's churchyard—a strange man spoke to me—I accompanied him to a public-house in Beer-lane, Thames-street—we went into the parlour, and found the prisoner sitting on the right hand, by himself, taking a glass of ale—that was the first time I saw him—it was about two o'clock in the day—I am con<lb></lb>fident to the time—a glass of brandy and water was sent for—I had some, and the stranger had something—I and he sat together in front of the door, near the fire-place—not at the same table with the prisoner—he sat on the left hand going in at the door—after the stranger and I had been drinking brandy and water, the stranger said to the prisoner that we were two strangers met—the prisoner said he was a stranger also—they did not appear to know one ano<lb></lb>ther—the prisoner said he was just come to London for a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi> as he had a large property left him—that he was a saddler, and worked at his trade till within the last few days, and then he came into his property—that his lawyers had given him a note to receive 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had received it at the Bank of England—he showed me a roll of notes which he took out of his pocket—they might be of the value of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say—he said he was then going to have a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi>, and he did not mind a great deal where he went to—he said he would go with us for a walk if we were agreeable, but before that he would treat us with another glass as we had been so kind to him—he proposed to treat me and the stranger—I told him I was not in the habit of drinking much myself—we all three walked out together—we had been in the public-house perhaps twenty minutes, or half an hour—we walked somewhere near the Black wall railway—we passed the Tower shades, and went into a public-house down by the side of the Black wall railway, near Limehouse—drink was called for, and the prisoner proposed to pay for it—he said as we had been so kind to him he would pay for what drink we chose to call for—I declined that, and paid for what I had, which was threepenny worth of brandy—the others had something to drink—in the course of conversation I said I had come from Ashford, and was going back that evening, and had not much time to waste, I was going by railway—the prisoner said, if I had no objection he would accompany me, as he wished to see the coast of I Kent—I walked out of the public-house, and the prisoner came out with me—we walked as far as Gracechurch-street—I had left a hat box, and carpet bag at a house opposite the Spread Eagle—I went and got them out—I had proposed to go into the Spread Eagle—the prisoner objected, as it was so thronged a place, and proposed we should go to someplace where there was a private room—there is a tap at the Spread Eagle—they asked me to go and take a glass before I went to the omnibus to New-cross, as the train was going off at four o'clock—we walked on together till we came to Rood-lane—I intended to be at New-cross at four o'clock, but as it was I could not be there before five—it was after three when I got my carpet bag—we all three went into the parlour of a public-house, near Tower-street police station—the prisoner asked if they had a private room—he took hold of the parlour door, opened it, and there was nobody there, he said, "This will do"—we went in—he asked what I would have—I said, "A little brandy and water, as I should not change my liquor"—I had sixpenny worth of brandy and water hot, as it was a Cold evening—he told me I had been so kind to him, and the other gentleman, and had given him such good advice, he would give us a new hat apiece if we would accept of it—(I had persuaded him to keep his money safe, and not let any one see it, as London was such a place)—I re<lb></lb>fused</p>

               <p>to have the hat—the stranger advised me to take it, as he said the prisoner had plenty of money, and he should take one if he would buy him one—I said I did not wish any thing of the sort, and declined—I took a small empty bottle out of my pocket which would hold about three half quarterns—I set it on the counter which we sat against—I said I would have a little brandy put into it to drink on the road—at that time I took out my purse, and laid it on the table—I took a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note out of my purse of the London and County Joint Stock bank, Ashford branch—I folded the note up, and laid it on my purse, saying I must get it changed, as I had not money to get my expenses paid to Ashford without—I said I must change to pay for the brandy, as I had but 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner took the note up, and said, "Well, I don't know that I ever saw such a note as this, what bank did you get it from?"—I told him it was the London and County Joint Stock Bank—I took it out of his hand, and laid it on my purse again, which still laid on the table—the prisoner said I need not change it, as he would pay for my liquor, and pay my expenses down to Ashford, as I had been so kind to him—I said I had only 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in Silver—my hat-box and carpet bag were standing on the seat on my right hand, and the prisoner sat on my left—the note was in my purse on my right hand—I turned round to my left to unlock my hat-box—I took out a travelling cap and a pair of strong gloves—I observed the door of the room closing—on turning round, I found the bottle, and the note, and the prisoner, were gone—instead of my note was a bit of a hand-bill, folded up, and laid in the same position—the other man was still in the room—I instantly rushed to the door, and said "The thief has robbed me," and ran out of the door—I could not find him—I returned to the room, and the other man was gone—this was about half-past three o'clock—I went home the same evening—I had but 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to take me home—on the 17th of July I was in London, in Gracechurch-street, passing a few yards from the Spread Eagle, at about a quarter after four o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, and met the prisoner coming along the street—I knew him as soon as I saw him—he turned his head another way, and began to rush by—I ran to him, round another gentleman, seized him by the collar, and told him he was the man that robbed me just after last Christmas time—he said, "I do not know what you can mean, taking hold of a gentleman like me, in a large way of business, calling me a thief in the public street"—he said I had better let him go, or I should get into trouble—I said I did not mind what trouble, he was the thief that robbed me, I would not let him go—he snatched himself out of my hands, and ran away along the street—there was such a quantity of per<lb></lb>sons, he could not get along very fast—I cried, "Stop thief," and ran as fast as I could, till I caught hold of him again by the collar—he told me to come on one side with him, there were so many people about, and any thing I said to him he would listen to—I told him I would not, I should give him in charge to the police—somebody assisted me, and he was taken into custody by Storey—I was sober the whole of the time—I have never been intoxicated for the last ten years or more—I have named what drink I had on the day in question.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a half-pay officer in her Majesty's service, and live in Swallow-street, Birmingham. I know the prisoner—I am no connexion of his—he came to lodge with me on the 22nd of Dec., 1842, and remained till the 20th of Feb., 1843—during that time I did not leave Birmingham at all, nor leave my house to sleep out—the prisoner never slept out of my house during that time—he might have left for the course of a few hours—he never slept out of my house during that time—I have a son-in-law, named John Den<lb></lb>ham, living in Linch-street, Birmingham—I married his mother—his birth-day is on the 7th of Jan.—he dined with me at my house, on the 7th of Jan. last, at one o'clock, as near as possible—there were seven or eight more dined at the table—the prisoner was one of them—he dined at my house, keeping my son's birth-day—Richard Boyce did not dine with me, but he came several times in the course of the day—when I heard the prisoner had been taken into cus<lb></lb>tody I came up to London, and gave evidence at the inquiry at the Mansion-house—there was another person at the dinner party, who is now ill at Bir<lb></lb>mingham—I gave my name and address at the Mansion-house—I have not seen any one at Birmingham on this matter since that—the person who is ill fractured his skull last Saturday fortnight.</p>

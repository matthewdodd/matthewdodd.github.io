                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Morley—we live in Stepney parish. On Thursday, the 4th of December, my husband's coat was hanging by the parlour door in our shop—I saw the prisoner going out of the shop with the coat under his arm—I followed him—he went down a court—I spoke to one of my neighbours—I went down another court, and met the prisoner with the coat—I snatched at it—he dropped it, and ran away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 14, Cannon Street Road, St. George's in the East—I was a domestic servant in the service of the deceased until his death—he was a licensed victualler, and kept the Duke of Wellington public-house—on Saturday, 11th July, he returned home in his pony and cart between 3 and 4 o'clock—he went up stairs first to ask where the boy was—he afterwards came down and went into the bar-parlour, where my mistress was—I heard a noise, but being deaf I could not distinguish the words—after a time I went into the kitchen—my master came in and washed his side underneath the tap—he washed blood off—he said something to me—my mistress came up and said, "Conrad, Conrad, let me attend to you, I will attend to you"—be said, "No, go away, don't pull me about, leave me alone"—she then put her arms round my neck, and said, "Jane, Jane, may God forgive me, I did not mean to do it"—I went for a doctor—she did not tell me how it happened, she said there was a few words between them—I afterwards looked under the counter, opposite the bar-parlour door, and found this knife stained with blood—I had missed the knife when I cleared away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Charlotte Street, Fieldgate Street, Whitechapel—on Saturday, 11th July, I was at the Duke of Wellington with four of my shipmates—the deceased came home, put up his pony, and went into the bar-parlour, and while he was there I went to the counter for change, and saw him raise his arm towards the prisoner—I can't say why that was done—I did not hear any talking—the door was just ajar.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector K</hi>). On 12th July, about 12.15, I went to the house and saw the deceased in bed—in the prisoner's presence I said, "Mr. Vanderhalven, it is a very serious affair"—he said, "Yes, Mr. Gee, it is; it was my fault, it was my fault"—the prisoner said, "No my dear, don't say it was your fault, tell the gentleman (or Mr. Gee) the truth"—he did not answer, and she said, "I will tell him, and if I am wrong you correct</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170027"></xptr>
               <p>me. As I was sitting down to dinner, Mr. Vanderhalven came in; we had a quarrel, and he struck me a severe blow. We continued our quarrel, and he gave me another very severe blow, which gave me a black eye" (and she pointed to her eye which was then very black) "I said, 'If you do that again I shall do something;' he struck at me again another violent blow, and at the moment I picked up a knife and struck at him; I did not know that I had hurt him until I went up stairs to the kitchen, and then to my horror I found that he was stabbed. I immediately sent for the nearest surgeon, and Mr. Morrison came and dressed the wound"—turning round then from me to her husband, she said, "Have I not told Mr. Gee the truth"—about two seconds elapsed, and he faintly said, "Yes"—I said, "Well, Mr. Vanderhalven, this is a very serious matter"—he said, "It was all my fault"—I said, "Do you wish to charge Mrs. Vanderhalven with this"—he said, "No, certainly not, certainly not, it was my own fault"—he died on the following Sunday, and I then took her into custody.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 57, Cannon Street Road—on Saturday, 11th July, about 3 in the afternoon, I was sent for, and found the deceased standing at the kitchen door—he walked with me up into his bed-room—I then examined him, and found a wound on the right side, such as this knife would make—I did what was necessary—I did not apprehend any danger; it had stopped bleeding—Mr. Comley, the family attendant, after<lb></lb>wards took charge of the case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to my father, a surgeon, of 71, White<lb></lb>chapel High Street—about 3.45 on the afternoon of the 11th, I found the deceased under Mr. Morrison's care—I saw the wound, and stitched, dressed and bandaged it—I apprehended no danger at that time—about 8.30 the same evening the wound began to bleed—I then began to think it serious, and called in Mr. Hutchings, a surgeon—I visited the deceased two or three times a day—on Thursday hemorrhage again set in—my father then took up the case—he died on the Sunday week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I made a post mortem examination by de<lb></lb>sire of the Coroner—the external wound had perfectly healed, but on exami<lb></lb>nation, I found it had penetrated between the sixth and seventh ribs—that was the cause of death—the knife, after entering, must have directly turned down, for it went through the pleura, the diaphragm, and on to the liver, so that he must have turned his body round; he must have been making a lunge at her at the time—she never had the power to</p>

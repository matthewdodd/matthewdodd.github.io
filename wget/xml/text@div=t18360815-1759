                  </hi>. I live at Hackney-wick, Homerton. The pri<lb></lb>soner is my husband—we have been married eighteen years—he is a day-labourer—we have lived together in the same house all long—this happened last Wednesday month, from nine o'clock, when I left my work, to eleven—I do not remember the day of the month—it began in the last field, going home—my husband had been to the Spread Eagle public-house that afternoon—I saw him there the first time at bout a quarter after nine o'clock at night, when I left my work—I went to him, and asked him if he was coming home—he said, "No, when I please"—I said, "Will you stop here, till I come back from the butcher's to buy you some meat for your supper?"—he said nothing to that—I went to the butcher's and bought a beef-steak for his supper—I came back, and met him in the road—he was going in a direction from his home—I said, "Turn home, and come home along with me, and I will cook your supper"—he said, "I will," and we walked together, side by side, across three fields, going home to Hackney-wick—when we got into the last field, he hit me on the right side of my head with his first, and almost knocked me down, but not quite—he said."Go home, and I will let you see when you get home what I will do"—I said, "What do you mean, do not go to hit me, pray do not knock me about, you have hurt the side of my head, I will go in, and sit down, and I will cook your supper"—he used expressions not fit to men<lb></lb>tion—he said, "Bloody into you, I will have your life, or you shall have mine"—we were close to our house at that time—I said nothing to it—I went in doors, and he came in after me, and locked the door after him, locking me in—he then turned round with a broom, and hit me on the head—no harder than the broom could go on my head—the broom was behind the door—I saw him take it—he hit me with the top, the end you sweep with—he hit me across the head with it, and every blow he hit fetched blood—he hit me with it four or five times, and used many very wicked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183608150006"></xptr>
               <p>words—he said, "B----y into you, I will have your life, it is no use your thinking of any thing else, for I will have it"—I fell once from the blows he hit me with the brook-stick—I got up again, and he hit me again with the broom, and after he had done that, he put his two thumbs to my throat, and squeezed them as hard as he could to my throat, against the front of my neck, in the middle of my neck—he then left go, and put a rope of my neck, which was in the house—it was his garden rope—it was on the drawers, he reached it from the drawers—it was nearly as thick as my arm—it was a good thickness—he put it round my neck, and made a loop knot, and said he would draw it tight, but he did not, for I put my two hands to prevent its tightening, and he swung me with the rope against the door, and kicked me on the ribs—he then directly up with the hatchet, threw it across his shoulder and said, "I will have your b----y life, as I have split this table"—the table was split in halves—he got the hatchet from against the door where it always stands—he did not touch me with it—he put it down and went to the door—he said, "Ten b----y policemen shall not hinder me, for I will have your life, "and while he was gone to the door I got our of the little window, over the pales, out of the back gate, and met the policeman on his duty—I made complaint to him—he was very near the house when I got out of the back-gate—I begged of him to take me to the station-house, and after leaving me at the station-house, he went and came back with the prisoner in about half an hour—a surgeon dressed my wounds, at the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Wednesday, the 20th of July, I met the prosecutrix in my rounds—the blood was running from her head in a desperate state—she complained to me of having been ill used, and begged me to take her to the station, for fear her husband would mur<lb></lb>der her if I did not so—it was near twelve o'clock at night when I got her there—it was between eleven and twelve o'clock when she met me—after leaving her there, I and my brother officer went after the prisoner, and found him in the house, lying on his bed, dressed—my brother officer spoke first—he said, "Come, we want you to go along with us"—he said, "Wait a bit—go on; I will come presently"—we told him</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called in, on Wednesday, the 20th of July, to see the prosecutrix, at near twelve o'clock at night, at the station-house—she had on the clothes produced when I saw her—I examined her, and found a wound in the head, in the upper and back part of the head—it was very severe contused, lacerated wound—it was so irregular in its shape there is scarcely any applying dimen<lb></lb>sions to it—it was very severe, on account of its being so much lacerated—it was not a clean cut, but a lacerated, contused wound, with many angles in it, and went to the bone—there was another slighter wound near it, but not near so severe—it was the same description of wound, but very much smaller indeed—it was very near the former one—I did not examine further then—I found no other severe wound externally—we conveyed her home—an examination then took place, and I found there were two ribs fractured—there were several bruises on the arm on the left side—I do not remember any more appearances of injury—the blood on the clothes produced was all from the two wounds on the head—I imagine it was done by driving a comb into the scalp, because part of a comb was taken out of the wound—the comb had been forced in by a blow—I thought there was very great danger at the time—I feared erysipelas might supervene, and there was danger from her extremely exhausted state, from loss of blood—I did not see the prisoner that night.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable P</hi> 98.) On Sunday, the 31st of May, I was on duty in Bowyer-lane, Camberwell, about two o'clock, and saw a man put his head over a hedge—when he saw me he drew back again—I stood a few minutes for another constable to come up, but he did not, and I went round into the field to see what the man had got there—I saw the prisoner and another man laying under the hedge—when they saw me they ran away—I followed, and overtook the other man—I asked what he had been at there—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "You must go back to satisfy me what you have been at, or have got"—I said I was a constable—he said he would go back, but all the time kept trying to get from me—I had hold of him—he struck me several times—I told him to be quiet but he would not-the prisoner was in the lane full 100 yards of£ but could see what was going on—the man called out, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>"—the prisoner then came back and picked up my hat, which the other man had knocked off, and held it out to me—I took it with one hand—the other man was striking me all the time—directly I took the hat the prisoner struck me—I begged him to be quiet—I said they had better be quiet and go with roe to the place where they had been laying to satisfy me what they had been at—I took out my policeman's staff—the prisoner saw it—I used it and broke it asunder—they were very violent indeed after I broke my staff—the prisoner rushed on at me—I drew a pair of hand<lb></lb>cuffs from my pocket and said I should strike them with them if they did not keep away—they both flew in at me, got the handcuffs away, and got me down on the ground—the prisoner stamped on me several times—he had his shoes on—he stamped on my stomach—I warded it off with my hand and begged them to keep away—the prisoner went away, leaving the other man there—he returned and said to the other more than once, "Let us kill the b----r," and he kicked me on the bead while I was on the ground—I showed that wound to the doctor—my head was cut very much—they both kicked and beat me, but the other did not kick me to hurt me—I believe the prisoner kept on kicking me, saying, "Let us kill the b----r," kicking me on my head and body several times, and cut me under the chin with his foot—I became senseless—I saw two women standing at a distance before I was knocked down—the prisoner and the other went away—I saw him again next morning crossing Camberwell-green and gave him in charge—I have been under the doctor's care ever since—I afterwards searched the field aud found a woman asleep under the hedge fifteen or twenty yards from the spot where the man peeped—she was drunk, quite senseless, and about twenty-two years old.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Love-court, Camberwell-road. On Sunday morning, the 31st of May, about three o'clock, a niece of mine was out—I was looking after her with my daughter in a field at the side of Bowyer-lane—I heard a great noise in the road like fighting—I went to see what it was—I saw Baker on the ground in the road—two other men were about him, and seemed to be beating him—the prisoner came towards me—I said, "What is the matter down there"—he said, "It is only me and my mate having a few words," he was not one of the men who were fighting, he bad come away from them—I said, "Go back and try to make it up"—the other man who was beating Baker called to him several times—I think it was, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> why don't you come this way?"—the prisoner went back directly, and as he went said, "D—n him, we'll kill him out of the way at once"—I then looked round again and saw the prisoner stamping on Baker—he jumped on him—as I went towards them I saw him jump on his belly two or three times, and the last time he slipped off him—I heard them swearing—I and my daughter ran away calling, "Police"—we returned in five or six minutes—Baker was still on the ground—the prisoner and the other man had run across the fields—I saw them run different ways—I went to Baker and saw his head bleeding—he appeared hardly able to stand—I saw one of them throw something out of his hand just before they run away—I am certain of the prisoner.</p>

On 27th April I lived at 19, Short's-gardens, Drury-lane, on the second-floor back, in the same room with the prisoner and his wife—they had three children living in the room—the wife's name is Ann—on Sunday, 28th April, I went home, about a quarter to one o'clock in the morning, and found the prisoner, his wife, and a little boy, in the room—the prisoner was sitting in a chair, and she was standing in the room—they were quarrelling—I understood they had been drinking together—they were drunk, but he was the most so—I said to her, "Let him go to bed; have no words with him; you know what an awful tem<lb></lb>per he is"—she went to make the bed, and made him some improper answer—he got over a chair, and struck her with his fist on the side of the head, as she was making the bed—she fell on her side—he kicked her several times, when she was down, in the side and back—he continued beating her half an hour before 1 left the room; she called out, "Save me! do save me, Mary!" I said, "Mr. Donovan, pray don't hit her any more; consider what hour of the morning this is!"—he said, "Keep out from me, I will serve you the same;" and pushed me aside—she kept crying out, "Oh don't, <hi rend="italic">Dan,</hi> pray don't hit me any more!"—and the more she begged of him, the worse he hit her—I went out of the room for a policeman, but went some distance before I could find one—I returned in about twenty minutes, and found she had been thrown out at the window, and taken to the hospital—I saw a great quantity of blood in the yard, and on the floor of the room.</p>

I remember some policemen coming on a Saturday night, and taking my mother to the hospital—I was sitting up in the room, and my father and mother came home—they quarrelled, and he said, "If you give me any more words I will cut your jaw"—my mother was making the bed; it was on the floor, and he broke the leg of a chair by beating it round my mother's back six or seven times—she said, "Pray let go me," but he did not stop—when the leg came off the chair, he took it and beat her on the side—Mary Burke and my sister came in together, before the chair was broken, and my sister said to my father, "If you leave go of my mother I will give you a quarter of an ounce of tobacco in the morning," and he gave my sister a punch with his hand—my sister and Mary Burke went down together—my mother then said to me, "Show me the stairs"—my father was then looking for the pound weight, and he sent me down for a three-farthing candle—he asked me for the weight and the poker, and I would not give them to him—my mother went to the stairs—he said, "Come in," and she came in—she thought he was going to let her be, but he locked the door at the top, where I could not reach it, and then beat her with the leg of the chair, and held her down, and punched her with his hand—she was lying by the cupboard, and he took her to the window; she did not go there of herself—he opened it; it draws in like a door—she said nothing, but I saw blood on her face—he put her on the ledge, and then <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> her out; she fell into the court below—he then put on a clean shirt, dressed himself, and told me to lie down and go to sleep, and then a policeman came and took him—I am sure my mother did not jump out; he lifted her on the ledge, and she held by the ledge—he said to me, "If you tell I <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> her out I shall beat you, and if you don't pretend to be asleep I shall beat you"—they were singing when they came home; the window was shut then; it was opened after Burke went out.</p>

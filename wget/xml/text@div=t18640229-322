                  </hi>. I live at 58, Palace-road, Wells-street, Hackney, and am working at Mr. Gilbert's, bookseller and stationer, Gracechurch street—on 19th February I saw the prisoner in St. Paul's-churchyard, and he gave me this envelope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not open it—he made me understand I was to take it to Mr. Charles Thompson's, St. Paul's-churchyard, the address which it bears—he spoke broken English—I went there, gave it to one of the assistants, and received from him a parcel—I then left the warehouse—when I went out first I could not find the prisoner—I came back, and on going out a second time I saw him beckoning to me—I followed him and gave him the parcel at the corner of Newgate-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I manage the business of the prosecutor—on 19th February I received this envelope from the last witness—I opened it, and found it to contain this order for three pieces of black taffeta, of different qualities, for Peter Robinson—our firm have been in the habit of transacting business with Peter Robinson—I gave directions for the parcel to be made up, and I saw it delivered to the boy—he did not tell me where he was going to take it—I went out before him, and watched the door to see him come out—I kept him in sight till I saw him return to the warehouse, having previously spoken to a police-constable—I then returned to the warehouse, and the constable followed me in—we sent the boy out a second time; I followed him, lost sight of him for a moment, but saw him again going towards Cheap<lb></lb>side—I ran after him, and opposite Peel's statue I saw him give the parcel into the prisoner's hands—I followed the prisoner to the corner of Newgate-street, brought him back, and gave him in charge to the constable—the parcel made up was worth about 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk-mercer, and carry on business in Oxford-street—this order is not in my handwriting, or written by my authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the day in question I was in Regent-street, near where the fountains play, and a young man accosted me, and asked me if I would take this letter to Mr. Charles Thompson, and promised me half-a-crown for doing so. He told me I should receive three pieces of silk, and I was to bring it to the Strand; I, not speaking English, asked the boy to go there with the letter, and told him I would give him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I waited on the same spot, and he came back to me, and I was taken into custody. I afterwards went to the Strand with the policeman, but I could not find the young man. I am not guilty of writing that order. Out of the four months I have been in London, I have worked all the time, except nine days, at a confectioner's shop, and I then commenced buying small pieces from tailors for tailoring, in proof of which the scales which I used to weigh them were taken from me at the station. I come from Berlin, and came to London with the intention of afterwards going to America.</p>

I took the prisoner to the station; two policemen in private clothes went with him to the Strand to find this gentleman—the prisoner went up the Strand, round Trafalgar-square, and back to the station, and never spoke to any one the whole way.—

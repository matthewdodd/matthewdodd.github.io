                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-police-sergeant,</hi> 36). On 11th April, between 7 and 8 in the evening, I stopped the prisoner Booth in Fenchurch-street, with this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under his arm, done up as it is now—I asked him what he had got there (I had received some information)—he said, "A piece of cloth"—I asked him where he got it—he said, "A man gave it me over there in that house," pointing to the Angel public-house, in Fenchurch-street—I said, "Come with me and point him out"—we went and opened the door, and he pointed out the elder Dingley—I called him out, and asked him if he gave Booth this parcel—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "I don't know"—I then took him into custody—on the way to the station he said that he had bought it of a man, but did not know who he was—I have not watched at that public-house more than that night—another witness will give evidence of that—Booth had the parcel in his hand in this manner; he was crossing Frederick-street, towards Northumberland-alley.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, at 28, Dorset-street, Spitalfields—I was deputed to watch on this occasion—I stood next door to the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's premises and watched—on 11th April, shortly after 7 in the evening, I saw the younger Dingley come out with a parcel under the flap of his coat; I could only see part of it—this is the parcel—he first ran across Bishops<lb></lb>gate-street, opposite his employers premises, and went down Bishopagate-street</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186205120092"></xptr>
               <p>under an archway; he returned in a minute two, and then went up the opposite side, at a shuffling trot—he met the elder prisoner and took a parcel from under his coat and gave it to him, and he put it under his arm, and then the younger prisoner ran back across the road towards his master's premises again—I lost sight of him, and followed the elder one to the Angel in Fenchurch-street—he entered, put the parcel on the bar, and leaned his arm on it, like this—Mr. Booth came up, and he gave him the parce—as he was leaving the place to go to Northumberland-alley, I saw the Sergeant Trew, and told him.</p>

There was nobody in the house but my wife and myself. When I got up, between two and three, I found all safe, except one window: they had cut the bottom of the groove away in which the shutter slides, taken the shutter out, and got in at the window. I missed above five pounds worth of things, besides the things which were taken upon the prisoner, and laid in the indictment.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 31st of July, about a quarter before one in the morning, I stopt the prisoner in Turnmill-street, with these things in two handkerchiefs, ( producing the things laid in the indictment ); he said he had them of his mother over night. My partner went to his father in Charterhouse-lane, who came to the watch-house, and declared the things did not belong to him nor his wife. We took the prisoner to Clerkenwell Bridewell. After that, hearing Mr. Cann's house had been robbed, we let him know of the things, and his wife came and owned them. We took the prisoner before Justice Girdler: he there owned there were four others concerned with him in taking the things.</p>

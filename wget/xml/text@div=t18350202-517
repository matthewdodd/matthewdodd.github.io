                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in York-street, West<lb></lb>minster. About six o'clock on the evening of the 12th of January, my shop was perfectly safe—there was a crack in one pane of glass in the window, but no part of it was out—the window was full of women's shoes—it was safe at half-past six o'clock—I was at work in the room adjoin<lb></lb>ing—my attention was called by a customer coming in, to inquire the price of some shoes in the window, about seven o'clock—I then saw the window, which was cracked before, had been broken, and six pairs of shoes were missing, which were close to the glass—the gas was lighted in the shop long before this—I gave information to the police directly, and on Tuesday morning, Ford the policeman gave me information—I saw two odd shoes at the station-house about half-past eight o'clock the next morning—I am positive they had been in my window the night before, and I had not sold them—I went with the policeman to a pawnbroker's in Vauxhall-road, and there saw another pair, which I am certain had been in my shop at six o'clock the night before—I had sold none of that description—the selling price would be 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pair, or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., some at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am sure the window was not broken at six o'clock—when I found it broken, a hand could be put in and take the shoes out, it was quite large enough for that.</p>

               <p>nine o'clock my sergeant gave me information of the robbery—I went to York-street, but the shutters were shut, and I did not go into the house, as the prosecutor was gone to bed—I went and made inquiries, and in con<lb></lb>sequence of what I was told, I went to No. 4, Almonry, about one o'clock, in the morning, and apprehended Akers—I told her I wanted her for shoes which had been stolen from York-street—she said she knew nothing about any shoes—I asked her where she got the shoes she had on—she was lying on the bed with her clothes on—I took her to the station-house, and took her shoes off, and afterwards she said, if the shoes had been stolen, she knew where she got them from—she did not tell me where—I then went and apprehended Dalton, as they both lived together—I told her I sus<lb></lb>pected she knew something about some shoes stolen from York-street—she said she did not know any thing about it—I took her to the lock-up house—when she found Akers was in custody, she said Mackay had brought two pair of shoes into her room, and she gave him 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for one pair of them, but she had no money to buy the rest, and he took them away—I then apprehended Preston—I asked if he knew any thing about the robbery—he said he did not—I told him I had seen him standing in York-street, at a quarter before seven o'clock that evening, and that Mackay was with him—he said he was—I told him of the robbery—he said he did not steal the shoes—I took him to the watch-house—I am sure they were both there about a quarter to seven o'clock, standing opposite the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's window—I apprehended Mackay about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, at his father's, behind Tothill-fields prison—when I told his father I wanted his son for a robbery committed in York-street, about seven o'clock or a quarter before seven, he directly said in his presence that his son had not been out so late that night; but after his son got up and came down stairs, his father said in his presence, that his son had been out crying muffins, between seven and eight o'clock that night—he denied all knowledge of the robbery—I went round to several pawn<lb></lb>brokers' shops, and at Cotton's, in the Vauxhall-road, I found a pair of shoes, which Walford claimed—Mackay said he was with Preston, in York-street, about seven o'clock, standing by the theatre, but had not been nearer to Walford's shop, than the Westminster theatre, which is in York-street, about fifty yards from Walford's.</p>

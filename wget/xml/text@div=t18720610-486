                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and have offices at 5, Gray's Inn Square—I practice there under the firm of Stuart &amp; Massey—the chambers are on the first floor, and no one resides there—after business hours the chambers were locked up and the key left in charge of the bead porter—that is not so now, it was at that time—I was at my chambers on Saturday, 17th February—I left a few minutes before 2 o'clock—I closed the outer door ass I went out, and left the place all safe—I had there a little iron box, 11 in. by 6 in., which contained securities to the value of over 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. United States Bonds, Great Western Railway Bonds, Metropolitan and other Railway Stock, and also my pass-book, cheque-book, and some loose papers—I did not go to the office on Sunday—on Monday, 19th, I came to business about the usual time, and missed my box—I considered that one of my clerks had put it in the safe—I afterwards wanted the box, looked for it, and could not find it—I then issued handbills offering a reward of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is one of them—it is dated 20th February, that was the Tuesday, and says "Apply to Messrs.</p>

S. &amp; M. have instruc<lb></lb>tions to pay over 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the contents of the lost box being handed to them"—I afterwards received this letter, which is in the same handwriting: "If Messrs.

Do not think to get us in a trap, as all move<lb></lb>ments <hi rend="italic">is</hi> watched in a way that you little think"—upon that I advertised: "Messrs. S. &amp; M. desire to say that Messrs. Scott, Stratton, &amp; Co; have instructions to pay over 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the contents of the box being handed to them"—I received after that a letter, which is missing—the series of letters is not perfect—after I recovered my papers I burnt some of the letters—the letter was in the same handwriting, in which he said he was not satisfied to put himself in Scott &amp; Co.'s power, and that he would not take the letters there; that I must send the money first, and he would send my papers, and that he meant to keep good faith—on 23rd February I wrote this letter—it was sent to the post by James Lambert, who is in <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "As H. W. objects to go to Messrs. Scott, Stratton &amp; Co., Mr. Massey makes this proposition: that if H. W. will deliver here by parcel or otherwise half of each document in the box, cutting them evenly from corner to cross corner, so as not to deface them, Mr. Massey will send a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note or four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes by post to H. W. to any address he may give, and he binds himself to do it at once, and before he gets the second halves of the papers, if H. W. will give him his promise to keep good faith and send the second halves of the documents to-morrow. Their numbers are all known, and they are all stopped")—The good faith was that I was to send the money if he sent me the papers, what intention I had rested in my own breast—I them received this letter: "As I do not like to spoil the papers by cutting them in two, I send you one half of the contents of the box, and as soon as I receive the four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank notes you shall have the remainder,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187206100061"></xptr>
               <p>without fail, within two hours after receiving. Please address to the same place in Gray's Inn Road; I send you a list of remaining papers I still keep. H. W."—The list is an accurate schedule, containing about half the securities, bonds, and so on—it is a very accurate schedule, drawn by a man who was not familiar with the wording of such documents—I received half of the securities with that letter—on 26th February I wrote this letter, which was sent by Lambert in the ordinary way to the same address in Gray's Inn Road: "Mr. Massey acknowledges the receipt of the parcel sent by H. W., and encloses four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in the confidence that H. W. will keep faith and send him at once the whole of the rest of the contents of the blue box—Mr. Massey will really feel obliged if he might have the box also, even if it be broken"—I enclosed four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in that letter—the numbers were 09026, 7, 8 and 9—I did not receive the remaining portion of the deeds in two hours—my clerk waited till 10 o'clock at night—I stopped the payment of the notes, as H. W. had broken faith—on 29th I wrote another letter, but I advertised before that, offering an extra 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the remaining half—I then wrote this letter to the same address as before and sent it by Lambert: "Mr. Massey wrote to H. W., enclosing bank notes for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at 11 o'clock on Saturday, and did not stop those notes until noon on Monday—the interval was sufficient to allow H. W. to fulfil his promise and return the box with the contents, and had he done so he might have had the money. The stop shall be removed from the notes on Mr. Massey receiving the box and the papers which H. W. retains."—Neither of us trusted the other then—the securities then came in this envelope—the post mark is "London, W.C.," and it was delivered at 4.30 p.m.—in the mean-time I had taken off the stop, but I asked the bank to let me know who presented each note—on 5th March I received the remaining securities, addressed in an envelope to "Mr. Massey, 5, Gray's Inn Square," in the same handwriting—on 15th March I advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> in say that there was a letter waiting for H. W. at the poet-office, Gray's Inn Lane—on 18th March I received an answer in the same handwriting: "In answer to your letter of 13th instant I write to say that I am deeply grateful to you for the interest that you take in me, and rest assured that your advice will not be lost upon me; dear Sir, I can assure you it was the first time of my being tempted to steal, and it will be the last, by the help of God, as I have not had a moment's peace since. The box you shall have without fail; I give you my word that you shall have it back before I leave this country, which I am trying to do to go to Australia; I have some friends out there, and if I succeed in going I will endeavour to forget and lead a new life, with God's help. P.S. If you wish to write to me again, address to the same place. H. W."—That was in answer to a letter I wrote giving him some good advice—I have not received the box—this is a letter which I received earlier in the proceedings—it is in the same handwriting: "Messrs. Stuart and Massey, your advertisement in to-day's <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> is not very plain, as you wish to have the papers without giving the reward, and I consider I should be a fool to send them; therefore, I have one more suggestion to make; if Stuart and Massey wish to get the papers back, and if they send four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, to be left at the Post-Office, Gray's Inn Lane, as soon as you receive this, and upon receiving the same the whole of the papers that is in the box you will receive at Gray's Inn, even to the small key.

               <p>receive the things that was in the box if no one is sent to watch. H. W."—That letter convinced me that I was dealing with the thief—the carte-de<lb></lb>visite was my wife's, which was in the box—it was sent to me to show that he had the things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I got everything back with the exception of the box—the documents were all in that box, a bright blue box—the box and contents was all that was taken—I locked the outer door when I went out—the inner door was never locked—my laundress has a key, but it was left in the possession of the head porter.</p>

W.," to Gray's Inn Road, containing bank notes—on that same day, half the securities had been received by Mr. Massey—the first time I saw the prisoner was when I was taking the notes—I saw him in Verulam Buildings—he asked me if we still communicated with the thief at the post-office—I can't tell you the exact words, but they were to that effect—I told him "Yes," I said "I am going to take a letter there now;" but I did not tell him that it contained the notes—he asked me if we had the post-office watched, and I said "No, Mr. Massey does not have it watched"—he then said that he wished he could find the thief; that he would give 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of his own pocket to discover the thief, and that if he caught him he would break his neck—he said we had had Mr. Lansdowne to find out the robbery, and he should have thought that Mr. Lansdowne would have been able to find it out, for he was a very sharp detective—I think that was all that took place; there might have been a few remarks more—he spoke about the woman having brought Mr. Massey's documents to the head porter's lodge that morning—he said he had followed her, and stated the reason he had lost her was because he was afraid to keep too close to her, being in uniform—he said it would be very different if it was anyone in plain clothes; but being in uniform, he was afraid to keep too close to her and so he lost her—on the same afternoon as "H. W." had promised to return the documents within two hours, I was to wait to see if they came to the head porter's, and when I was going over between 2 and 3 o'clock to gee if they had come back, so as to take them to Mr. Massey's bank before it closed, I saw the prisoner by the lodge, and then he said something about his being there to watch in case the remainder of the documents were brought back, and he asked me if Mr. Massey got all his documents back, whether he intended to prosecute the thief if he found him out—I told him I did not know—on the morning of the 24th, he said that he thought Mr. Massey had gone the wrong way to work to find out the robberies, they should have been kept a good deal darker than they had been, and if it had been his robbery, he should have called in a policeman from the Inn.</p>

W," by Lambert, Mr. Massey's clerk, but I don't recollect what the dates were—two females used to fetch those letters away—the younger woman, Edwards, came the most—I recog<lb></lb>nise her although she is very much altered—I am able to say that she is the woman who fetched the letters addressed "H. W."—I can't speak to Hopkins—to the best of my belief she called for some of the letters, but the other one called the most.</p>

W.," and in my judgment the writing corresponds—I have no doubt that they are written by the same person—on 9th May I went in the evening to his lodgings again—I found him there with his wife—I said "Good evening, Edwards." and he said "I suppose you have come to arrest me"—I said "Yes, I have, and your wife also"—he had been kept at the police-station more or less, but not in custody—he was not allowed to go on duty—Edwards said to his wife "Never mind, my dear, it will all be right" and he protested his innocence—the husband of Hopkins was also in the room—there was a little dog there, and the wife said "Take the little dog home and tell mother where we are gone"—I took them to the station and</p>

                  </hi>. I was an engraver, and for many years I have made handwriting a study—I am the author of the book about "Junius's Letters," and I have very often been examined in Courts before—I have had placed in my hands thirteen pieces of paper, numbered 1 to 13, and have also had a number of letters signed H. W.—in my judgment they are in the same handwriting—I have no doubt of it whatever—the letters are not written in a disguised hand, but the writing is a little more upright, which is very common, but is really no disguise at all when you come to examine the habits of writing, which are rather peculiar in this case—the capital letter "I" is very peculiarly formed in No. 2 of the letters of H. W., and in the thir<lb></lb>teen pieces of paper—there is a capital letter "S" in the word "Stand" at the beginning of the document, and the letter "S "in the word "Station" on the fourth line—I confine most of the comparisons to the letter marked 2, and on the fourth line you will find the word "station"—in the document 7 the letter "D" occurs several times in the word "David," in the document 6 you will find the word "Dollars" at the second page, 7th line, and in the document I, the word "Dear," the lower part of the "D" is rather unusual, being joined to the next letter—there is a remarkable peculiarity about the small letter "d" which is formed very much like the letter "a"—in the word "David" the "d" is like a large "A"—the stroke does not go beyond the round part—there is an instance of it in the word "restored," it would be read for the letter "a"—there is a peculiar formation in the small letter "s," if you look at the word "saying," in the letter No. 2, and the word "same" which occurs in the letter "I" on the 8th line—it is detached from the next letter in both cases; then the letter "r" is formed with a loop at the top, so as to make it look like an "e"—in the word "Mr." in the letter No. 3, and in the admitted writing, the letter "r" is continually occurring—you will find it in the word "Norfolk "in the 4th line, in the word "rod "in the 7th line of letter No. 3, and "Port" in the first line; that form of the letter "r" pervades the whole—then the letter "f," the upper part does not extend above the top of the ordinary letters, it is not higher than the "o" in "of"—you will find that in the admitted writing, and in document 2, you will find it on the 5th and 11th lines—there is also a peculiarity in the crossing of the "t," which occurs three times in the letter No. 2, and you will find it also in document D—there is a peculiar formation in the numerical "7"—in document 5, in 1871 you will find that, and in several others as well—take "5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." which occurs twice in the admitted document No. 8, you will find that also in letters "I" and "G"—the general character is the same—take the whole writing of the word "going," it occurs in the 8th line of the letter No. 2, and in the letter marked "6 "on the 8th line—independently of the instances I have given, by comparing carefully the handwriting in the two sets of documents, I have not the remotest doubt that they are written by the same person.</p>

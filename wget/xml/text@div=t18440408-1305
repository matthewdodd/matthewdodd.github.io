                  </hi>. I am a broker, and live in Exmouth-street, Spa<lb></lb>fields. On the night of the 2nd of April, I saw all the prisoners—Burgess came first to my shop about half-past eight o'clock—I knew him before—he said, there was a double gun, and part of another gun to be sold—I asked whose they were, and where they were to be seen—he said, "Never mind that; if you will come with me I will shew you them "—I said I had not bad my tea, I could not go then, and said, "I don't like to go out after these things; can't you bring them to my house?"—he said, No, the land<lb></lb>lord of the place where they were, had advanced 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them, and therefore he could not bring them to my house—I agreed to meet him opposite Day and Martin's, in Holborn, and I met him about nine o'clock—he told me to follow him—he took me to the Archers public-house, in Newton-street, Holborn, which, I believe, is kept by Oldham—I saw him behind the bar, serving—I saw Conner there, and two other persons, who have escaped—Burgess intro<lb></lb>duced me, and said I was, the person about the guns—after waiting some time, I went to the front of the bar, and stood there about two minutes—the other two men spoke to Oldham about showing me the gun—he said, "Presently, presently "—I waited about, and at last Burgess and the two men not in cus<lb></lb>tody asked me to go into the tap-room—I sat there some time—at last one of the other two men told Connor to get a light—Connor got a light, pulled the tap-room door to after him, and shut me in the tap-room with Burgess and the other two men—I felt rather uneasy, and I opened the tap-room door, as if I was going out—I then saw a gun-case wrapped in a bit of serge come up through a trap-door in the passage—Conner took it up stairs—Burgess and I and the other two went up stairs to the back-room on the first floor—the gas had just been lighted—Conner brought the gun, and put it on the table—he then went and waited outside the door—I remained in the room with Burgess and the other two men—I examined the gun, and said that would do—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it was then wrapped up in the same piece of serge, and given to Conner—I and Burgess and the other two men walked downstairs—Burgess said, "Come on "—he and I and the other two men went to Parker-street, Drury-lane—one of the other two men tapped at the window of a room there—he said his mother was out, but he would go and get the key—he went to another house, next door but one, and brought down a key-bugle—we went into the room, and there they showed me part of a double gun in a mahogany gun-case, a gun-stock, and part of a lock—we then all went back again—Burgess wished me to purchase the things that night—I said I could not that night—I was to give twelve guineas for the key-bugle and the two guns—next morning, at nine o'clock Burgess came to me and I appointed to meet him again at Day and Martin's, which I did—he asked me what was the most I would give for them—I said I should not give more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or ten guineas—he said he would go and see—he then went to the Archers—the other two men came out, and were walking up and down for some time—Burgess then came and told me it was finally agreed; they were all ready, and I was to give these other two men 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "What about the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that Oldham has lent on the guns? I am not going to pay that "—he said, "You must, or you won't have them"—I then agreed to give the other two men 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Burgess was to ride home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with me, and take the difference of the ten guineas—I was to give him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his trouble—he then went to the house, and came and told me every thing was ready—I said, "Well, I had got the money"—he said, "Come up stairs"—I and he and the</p>

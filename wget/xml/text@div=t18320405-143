The prisoner was in my service for five weeks: I had some guineas, a 7s. piece, and some French coins and others, some of which we had had for twenty years, in a little tin cash-box, in my bed-room; no one had access to that room but the servant, to make the bed; in consequence of missing some other things, I searched, and missed this money from the cash-box; I had the prisoner searched - this was on a Monday: she had asked to go out on the Sunday, but I would not let her.</p>

            . I am a glass and china dealer, and live in Old Compton-street. On Monday, the 5th of March, I went to the station, and got an officer; the prisoner was given into custody at Mr. Smith's - she was searched, but nothing found on her; she then desired the officer to leave the room, and then she voluntarily said she would tell me all about it - she pulled up her clothes, and from under her garter she produced, in a glove, this coin; here are two guineas and some silver - she said she had taken three guineas from her master's box, and one of them she had changed at Sewell and Cross', to buy a plaid cloak, which is now here.</p>

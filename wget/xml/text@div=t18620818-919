                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 62). On Sunday morning, 10th August, I was on duty at New-cross, in the parish of Deptford, in plain clothes, about 5 o'clock—I saw the prisoner going from New-cross towards London, with a bundle under his left arm, tied up in a hanker<lb></lb>chief—I stopped him and asked him what he had got there—he said,. "My wife's dress"—I asked him to let me look at it, and I found one dress, three shirts, and an apron—I asked him where he got the shirts from he said his wife bought them at Deptford—I asked him where he lived—he said, "In King-street, Borough"—I told him I was not satisfied with that account as the bundle was tied up in a handkerchief—he said that they got drunk and undid the parcel, and tied it up in that way—I took him in custody—I searched him at the station, but found nothing on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Rutland-villa, New-cross—on the morning of 10th August, I came down about a quarter-past 6, and found the door open leading into a passage in the garden—I went down stairs and found a window, opposite the breakfast parlour, leading into that passage, open—two squares of glass were broken, and an iron bar forced out—that was large enough for a person to get in—I should think it was about a quarter to 1, or a little after 1 that morning, when I went to bed—I went down stairs and looked at the fastenings, and into the breakfast parlour, and looked at the fastenings there—they were all right then—next morning, I missed the dress, and these three shirts from the breakfast parlour—I saw them lying on the table when I went to bed—there was also an ornament moved off the mantel-shelf, and the clock had stopped at twenty minutes past 4—these are my things, and were safe the night before—I saw them at the station on Sunday morning, 10th August, about a quarter past 7, a few hours after they were lost—they consist of three shirts, a dress, and a black silk apron—they are mine—my house is in the parish of St. Paul's, Deptford.</p>

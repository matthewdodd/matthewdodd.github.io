               confess'd themselves guilty of the offence
            </rs>, and submitted to the Mercy of the Court.</p>
               <p>Whereupon Mr. Lane, Comptroller of the Chamber of London, being of Counsel for the King, opened the Cause, to give the Court satisfaction in the matter: That one Sparks being Arrested by Newton, told the Officer, he ought not to be Arrested, because he was a Soldier. The Officer told him, he had some reason to doubt it, because he had not on the Kings Cloathing; but he should have the liberty to send to such of his Officers as he thought fit. Upon which he sent a Porter to the Serjeant of the Company of Granadiers, who not being met with, the Note was delivered to the Lieutenant; which when he had read, with great Passion and Swearing he demands to know the Officers name, and cursing himself, said, If he could meet with him, he would cut off his ears. He then gets his Company together, acquaints them with the business, leaves the main body of the Company in Cheapside, over against Woodstreet, selects a dozen out of them, and coming down Woodstreet with Muskets, and Daggers in them, and with Oathes and Arms would have stormed the Counter, demanding the Prisoner. It was with great difficulty that they persuaded him he was not in the Counter, but in a House near by. Thither he goes cursing and swearing he would pull the House down, fire the House, and make that Rogue the Officer an Example for daring to Arrest a Soldier. The Serjeant told him, Sir, I am not throughly satisfied he is a Soldier, and desired to see the Muster-Roll: But he would not vouchsafe to let him have that favour; take him away he would, and did, in triumph to the Offenders, and to the terror of all Civil Justice. The Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen being acquainted with the matter, order Mr. Recorder and the two Sheriffs to wait on the Lord General the Duke of Monmouth, to let him know the whole business, and to desire him to deliver up the Offenders to be punished. His Grace did immediately concur to it; and having Casheer'd them from the King's Service, hath sent them hither, where, said he, we hope they will be satisfi'd now, as we are all well assured that, by the blessing of God, and the care and courage of our Magistrates, Soldiers, though they may and ought to assist, yet they shall never be permitted to be Arbiters and Comptrollers of Publick Justice.</p>
               <p>The Lieutenant would have excused and palliated the matter; but the Council having Affidavits, and Viva voce to prove his Accusation, and it having been examined before the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, they were committed to the Gaol in order to their Judgment.</p>
               <p>Proclamation of Attendance being made, the Lord Chief Baron called for the Granadiers, who were in custody, and told Mr. Recorder, That he being, by the custom of the Court,, to give Sentence upon Offenders there, the Judges did give him their advice, That the Peace of the Kingdom was so nearly concerned in this Cause, that it deserved an exemplary Punishment; and the lowest Fine they would counsel him to set, was 200 l. upon the Lieutenant, 50 l. upon the

            , and 20 l. a piece upon the Common Soldiers. Which was by Mr. Recorder Sentenced accordingly, with this Reproof.</p>
               <p>You that are the Prisoners at the Bar, the Court and the Government are sensible of the great affront by you put upon the Authority of the Nation in general, and this City in particular, and what danger you might have brought your selves into. For you gave such a Provocation, at such a time, within the very heart of the City of London, that might have proved the occasion not onely of bloodshed to others, but utter ruine to your selves. The Court, I say, and the Government, and your own General being sensible of this, and satisfi'd of your Guilt, have brought you hither, where being under the Power of Justice, you ought to receive the Sentence of Justice for your great Offence; and because your Crime is great, such must be your Judgment. For though you are Soldiers, Gentlemen, and ought to have all due encouragement, yet you must not think, by the Authority of your Arms, to control the Authority of the Civil Magistrate. And because the Lieutenant should have known better his duty, and taught it to them under his care, his Fine must be the greatest, because his knowledge was, or should have been so, and deserves the highest resentment. The Serjeant, who should have also known better, must recive a Punishment according to his Degree. And the Common Soldiers, though under their Command, yet being great Offenders, must receive an exemplary Punishment. And I do in the name of the Court, and the Court doth Order, That the Lieutenant pay for a <rs id="t16781211e-28-punish139" type="punishmentDescription">

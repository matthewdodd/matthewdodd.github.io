               <p>Q.Were his pockets searched? - A. His coat pockets were searched; there was one farthing, a tobacco-box, a pair of spectacles, and a pocket-handkerchief, a linen one; the body was carried to the Cherry Tree, at Bromley; I helped to fatch it out for the corner to sit upon it; I have lived there ever since, and work at the same place I did then.</p>
               <p>Q. So that, in all probability he was not a man known in the neighbourhood? - A. Not that I have heard.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you happen to know the prisoner? - A. Yes, I knew him very well, I knew him a boy; I knew him when he lived at Mr. Atkinson's, on the Green, at Stratford.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course, finding the body under these circumstances, was very notorious? - A. Yes, the field was soon full; it was given out to be Mr. Phillips's collecting-clerk.</p>

About twenty yards from the lane we found him, he was lying on his right side, in a very putrid manner, his eyes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140078"></xptr>were eat out, his nose off, and his tongue out, and all full of vermin; I perceived nothing of violence except a mark just under his right ear, and a penknife lying by his side; he had a mixture coat on, it was a lightsh colour, it was rather more a brown than a green, a kerseymere waistcoat, a whire striped one, a flannel waistcoat, and a pair of breeches about the same sort of mine, but rather lighter, I cannot tell what they are called.</p>

No, they were velveteen, of a very light colour; he had a pair of good boots on, a very good hat, only the under side was rotted off, it was a round one; he was carried to the Cherry Tree, and it never was discovered who this man was that ever I heard.</p>

               <p>Q. There were no means of tracing who he was? - A. A clerk of Mr. Phillips's had at that time absconded with a large sum of money, I knew the clerk well, which made me more particular in the examination of the body, a rumour had gone abroad that it was him, his name was Dickinson, he is since returned, and is now in Mr. Meux's brew-house; I directed the officers of the parish to make every possible enquiry, but it has not been discovered to this day who the person was.</p>
               <p>Q.In all probability it could not be any body in the neighbourhood? - A.There was no person missing at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to know any thing about the prisoner at this time? - A.No, I did not; the Jury found the murder to have been committed by a person or persons unknown, on the body of a person unknown.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. FORD sworn. - Court. Q. Mr. Ford, when were you applied to with respect to the prisoner? - A. I was at the Secretary of State's office, I believe, when the letter came from the West-Indies.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the letter coming from the West-Indies what was done? - A.Having read one of the inclosures in that letter, I directed an enquiry to be made, respecting the persons he had charged with the murder, in order that I might have them apprehended; when the prisoner came to England, I found one of the persons was a gardener, his name was Stephens, and another person of the name of Davis, who was a coachman to a gentleman in Kent, but I could not discover any thing at that time about it; I then wrote to the Mayor of Portsmouth, desiring him to keep the prisoner till I sent for him; when I heard he was arrived from the West-Indies, I sent down an officer to bring him to London, and another officer to apprehend Stephens, Stephens was apprehended before the prisoner came to town, I examined him, and he denied it; I then examined the prisoner, his examination your Lordship has got.</p>
               <p>Q. That, of course, was carefully taken, and contains the account he gave of the transaction?(The examination produced.) A. Yes, it is in my own hand-writing, and signed by the prisoner, I saw the prisoner make that mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of these men produced before the prisoner? - A.There were three shewn him, Stephens, Davis, and Skinner, they were shewn to him at different times; Stephens was shewn to him at the first examination; I had Stephens put into a yard, among other persons, and I made the prisoner look out of a window, to see if amongst there persons any one of the murderers wee assembled, he said no, none of them were there; I asked him to look again, to see if any body was there that he knew, then after some time, he said he knew one Stephens that was there, upon which I had Stephens confronted with him; he then said, that was not the Stephens that had been concerned with the murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that Stephens answer the description he had given of him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other Stephens answer the descrip<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140079"></xptr>tion in his information except him? - A. No; no, other person came.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no other Stephens answered the description but this Stephens, and when shewn to him, he said, that was not the Stephens? - A. He said it was not. - In regard to Davis, nearly a similar circumstance took place: he was put into the yard with the others, and he said, there were none of the persons concerned in the murder, but that he knew a man there whose name was Davis, but that was not the man he meant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, after that, give any other account of any other, Davis or Stephens? - A. No. - With respect to the otehr, he was shewn a man answering the description of Skinner, he said he did not know him, that was not the Skinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he acknowledge this was what passed upon his examintion in the West Indies? - A. He acknowledged it was the substance of what passed in the West-Indies, except he had never said, that Stephens had cut the man's throat.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in fact, he did not deny that person was said to be Mr. Phillips's clerk? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that paper transmitted from General Taylor, in the West-Indies? - (The paper produced.) A. Yes; they were given to me in this manner,</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner has deposed that Stephens and Davis were concerned in the murder, did he admit before you that part of his deposition? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He understood, and admitted that he had said the person that was murdered, was the brewer's clerk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And that that was the account he had given of it in the West-Indies? - A. Yes; there were no other persons to be found of that description, and he said, they were none of them the persons that he meant.</p>

            , and Thomas Skinner, they went to a public-house called the Three Drovers, where they had three pots of beer, when Davis proposed to him taking a walk with them to a public-house at Oldford; that they all went there, and stopped there eating and drinking till three o'clock in the afternoon; that none of them then said a word about robbing or murdering any body; about half past three, Davis proposed taking a walk across the field, which was agreed to; that, in a field, they met a gentleman coming towards them in a blue coat and bucks-skin breeches, the gentleman passed them all, except Davis, who was behind, and believes Davis knocked the gentleman down, for when he turned round, he saw the gentleman upon the ground, and he and Stevens, and Skinner, then went up and asked Davis what was the matter with the gentleman, if he was in liquor? upon which he replied, he has plenty of money, let us have some of it; Davis then took out a small pen-knife, and while skinner and Stephens laid hold of him, Davis cut the gentleman's throat, the gentleman struggled, but did not say any thing; Davis then took some notes out of the gentleman's pocket, and some cash out of his breechest pocket; that he took out a great deal of cath, and put it into his own pocket; he then dragged the body into the corn, the field having either wheat or rye in it, he thinks the latter, that it was pretty high, and that it quite hid the dead body. - This examinant says, that when Davis first saw the gentleman, he said, he believed that he knew him; that after they had so committed the murder, they went to whitechapel, and from there to Red-Lion-street, where they had some beer, and afterwards to a public-house in Holborn, where they had some beer, and went into a private room, and Davis shared the money amongst them, and gave the examinant 150l. 50l. and 10l. in notes, and the rest in guineas; Davis said, the murdered gentleman had been gathering money from public-houses, and was a collecting clerk; after they had shared the money, the examinant went away, and got home about two o'clock in the morning; the examinant lodged at Stratford; he carried the money generally about him, and about a fortnight afterwards, he changed the 50l. note at the Coach and Horses, at Stratford, that he had in change a 10l. note, and the rest in cash; that the landlord changed it, his name was Gibson; the examinant lived on at Stratford, and worked labouring work as usual, and in about twelve months had spent all the money; that he had drank a good deal, and was a good deal troubled in his mind, so much so, that about a year and a half age he enlisted as a soldier with serjeant Jervis, at Stratford, and six months afterwards, was sent to the West-Indies, with three hundred men, to recruit the troops at Matinique; he says, once after the murder, he met Davis, Stevens and Skinner, and drank with them at a public-house in Whitechapel; that he had seen Davis at a public-house in Red-lion-street, about two months after the murder; he afterwards saw him driving a hackney-coach in Holborn, and drank with him; and he has never seen Stevens or Skinner since; that when the murder was committed, Davis left the knife near the dead body, it had a black handle. Examinant says he thinks he was born near Saffron-Walden, in Essex, and is about thirty years of age, and that the prisoner now shewn to him, Stevens, was not the person who was with him, when he committed the murder aforesaid.</p>

Davis, mentioned in the former examination, is a coachman, thirty years old, rather lufty, about five feet eight inches tall, wore his own lank hair curled at the sides and short behind, had on a blue coat, round hat and boots; that after he had cut the gentleman's throat his hand was bloody, and he washed it at a ditch; that he does not know where he is now. - Examinant further says, Stephens is about five feet eight inches high, longish nose, older than Davis by a few years, and wore a drab coat; that examinant knew him where he lived, five or six years before, as gardener at Mr. Cooke's, the distilers, at Bow, but does not know where he lived when the murder was done. With regard to Skinner, he never saw him till the day of the murder; he looked like a labourer, about forty years old, black hair hanging over his shoulder, flourish made, black eyes, and full thick nose. - Examinant was in liquor at the time the murder was done.</p>

             called again. - Q. Were you, in consequence of the examination of the prisoner, employed to inquire after either Davis, Skinner, or Stephens? - A. Yes, Stephens.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him? - A. Not the Stephens that was first apprehended; Sayers is here who apprehended him first.</p>
               <p>JOHN SAYERS sworn. - I apprehended Stephens; I made the first inquiry in Red-lion-street, Holborn, after Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to inquire there? - A. I believe, it was in consequence of the confession of this man, that first led me to inquire there.</p>
               <p>Q. what was his name? - A. I am not sure, I believe, John; I found that he lived with a gentleman in Mark-lane; in consequence of that I went there, and learned that he was in the country, and the gentleman said, he would produce him on any day at Bow-street, when the prisoner was examined again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he produced? - A. Yes; he came to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you go to Red-lion-street to inquire? - A. In some part of his confession, he said he was a coachman, and he had lived with a Mr. Atkinson, in Red-lion-street, there I learned that Mr. Atkinson was gone away; I told them I wanted to see his coachman, that I was just come out of the country; in consequence of that, I found him in Mark-lane, and he was produced at Bow-street; I went to one of the India Warehouses and apprehended Skinner; Warren had described him as a coachman too; from the description of Skinner, I made inquiry among the Hackney-coachmen how many Skinners there were Hackney-coachmen, and there I learned there were three brothers; I asked if there was any one of them that had long carrotty whiskers; and they said, yes, there was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner described him as such? - A. Yes, but not in my hearing; I learned that two of them were dead; I apprehended the one that was living, and took him to Bow-street; the prisoner, to the best of my knowledge, said, that he knew that man, but he was not the man that he meant; I afterwards went to Hendon, and apprehended Stephens, and brought him to Bow-street; the prisoner knew him but said he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Ford.) Did he give you any better information where these men were to be found when they turned out not to be the men? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Fugion. When that Stephens was produced, he said there was another Stephens that lived with the same master before this Stephens came there, but upon inquiry, we learned that there had not lived any other Stephens in the family.</p>

             sworn. - In the year 1794, I lived at the Coach and Horses at Stratford; I had lived there seven years before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, did you happen to know him while you lived at Stratford? - A.Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he? - A. I never knew he had any constant employment; I took him to be a labourer with Mr. Atkinson, I did not understand him to be a yearly servant, he was among the coachmen.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have remembered the story of a person having been found apparently murdered in the corn-fields? - A. Yes, I do recollect the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. It was very notorious, was it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever frequent your house? - A. Sometimes he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Either before or after the time of this person being so found dead had the prisoner ever changed any note, with you? - A. No, never in his life.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever make any application to change any Bank-note, or other note? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible that you may have changed a note for him, and that it had escaped your memory at this time? - A. I do not think it possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Could such a thing, as changing a fifty pound note for him, have escaped your memory? - A. It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you regular in the accounts you kept of your cash? - A. Once in twenty-four hours I know to a penny, or thereabouts, what I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Have your referred to your memorandums, or accounts? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. And nothing of that kind appears? - A. Nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore, it is impossible that any thing of the kind can have happened to you? - A. Cer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140081"></xptr>tainly; more especially as coming from such a man; such a thing as a fifty pound note does not very often come by me.</p>

               <p>Court. Prisoner. If it had not been that the laws of this country will not suffer the life of a man to be take away, even upon his own confession, without a close examination of all the circumstances of the case, in all probability your life might have been forfeited, and I don't know whether it would have been much to be lamented or not if that had so happened; you have been guilty of a gross falsehood, probably with a view of evading the service of your King and Country in that part of the world in which you happened to be; it is to be hoped, however, that your intentions will be frustrated, and that you will be sent back to the same, or a similar station, where you may be in a condition to serve your King and Country.</p>

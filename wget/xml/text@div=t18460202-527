                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe maker, and live in Hare-court, Aldersgate-street. On the 10th of Jan. I went to the Castle, in King-street, Cheapside, to have refreshment, after being at Guildhall—the prisoner came in there with another man, and after the other man had left him, the prisoner came across and sat by my side—I asked him to drink what I was drinking—he said he would prefer a drop of porter—a friend of mine gave him some—the prisoner then said, "I feel hungry"—I said, "I will give you a slice of bread and cheese"—I gave him a half-crown—he got the bread and cheese and brought me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he gave me—I put them in my pocket, and my purse was then safe—I had two sovereigns and four half-sovereigns in it—in a quarter of an hour I got up to go away, and missed my purse—the prisoner was then out of the room—I said I had lost my purse, and a young man said, "The man that was by your side took it; I will fetch a policeman"—the prisoner then came in again and sat down—I told him I had lost my purse in that room, and every man should be searched—he said, "Your purse is all right; don't make a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, come with me"—he took me up stairs to the water-closet, undid his trousers, and in his pocket, tied in a knot, was my purse—he gave it me in my hand, and said, "There is your purse, it is all right"—I gave him in charge.</p>

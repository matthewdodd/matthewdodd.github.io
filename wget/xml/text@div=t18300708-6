I know the prisoner - his mother is a laundress, in master's employ; the prisoner brought the clothes home, and took others away to be washed. On Wednesday, the 2nd of June, I remember his coming with some clothes, which he delivered to me; there was a bill due to his mother - I desired him to wait for his money; I left him in the hall, and went down into the kitchen; the watch at that time hung on an image in the back parlour - he could not see it where I left him in the hall, but he came to the head of the stairs, and told me he was going a little further, and would call again; I had desired him to wait for the money, and expected he would do so - I should have detained him probably ten minutes, but he called out to me, saying he was going a little further, and would call again for the money; he was not to carry away any clothes that day, he went away, and did not return - I went up stairs in about ten minutes after he left, but did not miss the watch till evening; no stranger had been there who could have gone into the parlour after he left - nobody could have come without my knowledge, and I am quite sure nobody did come; when he called out to me the second time from the head of the kitchen stairs, he could see the watch hanging up, as the room door was open; the watch has never been recovered.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH COLE. I am a serjeant of the Police. I received the prisoner in charge on Thursday afternoon, on suspicion of taking this watch: he was asked if he knew any thing about it, and denied knowing any thing about it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080012"></xptr>- I took him into a back room, and searched him; he had got nothing about him - I took him to the watch-house, and then he told me if I would take him back to the lady he would say something to her; he said, "I will state to her"- I said if he wished to say any thing a young woman was there, and he could speak to her; he said he had nothing to say: Mr. Giesler's mother had given him in charge.</p>
               <p>JOHN RICHARDSON. I am the prisoner's father - his mother is a laundress employed by Mr. Giesler; after this charge was made, I questioned him about the watch - he at first denied knowing any thing about it; I took him to Mr. Giesler, and delivered him up myself - he denied taking it, and not being satisfied with that, I questioned him about it, and he said he did take it - I told him if he would confess that he did take it, it would be the better for him; he said he did not make away with the property himself, but another one, named

             well, and the whole of the family: he said it had been disposed of to Moses Marks, in Field-lane, for 10s., and he had 2s. of the money - I afterwards heard him give the same account to Limbrick and others.</p>
               <p>JOHN LIMBRICK. I am an officer. In consequence of information from the last witness, I had some conversation with the prisoner - the father asked him about the watch; he said he took it, but did not part with it - that another boy sold it, but he did not know his name; I fetched him up on the Thursday, and took him to where he said he had sold it, and the man denied it - the man was brought to the office, committed for two days, and then discharged.</p>

            . I know the prisoner by sight: I saw him on Wednesday, the 2nd of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock; he asked me to pledge a gold watch for him - I told him no, I would not; he said he would show it to me; he took up the tail of his jacket, and said he had it there, and I could see the form of a watch in his jacket pocket, but I did not see the watch; I heard a watch tick - I saw him at Brompton, between four and five o'clock; he crossed over to me, and said he had sent a person to pledge it, and he got taken into place - I thought he meant taken into custody; I gave information to his father: I was not present when he made a statement to Limbrick.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAM GIESLER. I live in Upper Woburn-place, and am a <rs id="t18300708-6-viclabel39" type="occupation">furrier</rs>

I had seen my watch the day before it was lost; I had wound it up and left it in my back parlour - I have not seen it since: I was from home when the prisoner came for the clothes - the watch originally cost me about 38l.; I had had it seven or eight years - I imagine it to be worth 20l. I keep the house, which is in the parish of St. Pancras.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) The evidence against me you have heard; I beg in the most humble manner to inform this honorable Court that I am innocent of the commission of the offence for which I stand here before you: it is most painful to my feelings, as well as heart-breaking to my unfortunate mother,(who has six small children) to whom I was a great assistance, to see her ill-fated son placed in such a degrading and perilous situation; on the morning laid in the indictment I admit I went to the prosecutor's house for my mother with some linen - I also admit that I was desired by some person in the prosecutor's house to call again in the course of the day, but I omitted to do so, in consequence of my having more pressing occasions for my time elsewhere, which I thought would turn to more advantage towards the support of my mother, brothers and sisters, whose interest I always preferred to my own; the two above circumstances alone have been the cause of my being committed on the present charge, without any further shadow of guilt attached to me, and I solicit in the most respectful and humble manner that the very slight grounds of suspicion which attaches to me - I trust that my youth (being scarcely eighteen years old) and my general good character, and this being the first and only offence with which I have ever been charged - this honorable Court will in its great humanity condescend and weigh minutely the evidence of the witnesses against me with mature deliberation; I await with humble submission your decision.[Friday, July 9.] <rs id="t18300708-6-verdict40" type="verdictDescription">

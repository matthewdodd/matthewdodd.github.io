                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor in this case; I keep the One Tun, in Chandos-street, Covent-garden. On Saturday night, 4th June, a person named Edwards purchased a quartern of gin at my house—his landlord, I believe, was with him, Wheeler, the defendant—Edwards tendered me a sovereign in payment for the gin—I gave him change, and among it was two crown pieces—it was 19<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in amount—there was two crown pieces, 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—they left together—this was towards 9 o'clock in the evening—on the Monday morning Edwards came to me again, and laid what appeared to be a crown piece on the counter—it was a bad one—after some conversation, he said it was a bard thing for him to lose it, he being a working man—I told him I was likewise a working man as well as himself—my wife suggested, that being a neighbour I should give him half a crown, which I did, and he went away—after he bad left I obtained some information with reference to a crown piece from a man named Taylor—that was about 1 o'clock—about 3 o'clock Edwards came again, with his master, as he called him; not the prisoner—on that occasion I got the crown piece, and next day I got back my half crown—on 7th June I received a summons, and attended the County Court on 22nd—Edwards did not appear then, and the cause was struck out—I afterwards received another summons, and the case came on for hearing on 7th July, before Mr. Bailey, the Judge at the County Court heard Wheeler sworn and examined as a witness—he said the counterfeit coin produced was the one paid to him by Edwards, and that he bad no other by any other means whatever during the week—he was questioned by Mr. Norton as to whether he had purchased it from Taylor, and he swore that he had not, and threatened an action against anybody that said so—he said on his sacred oath that he did not buy it of Taylor, and that if Taylor dared to come and say so, he would indict him for perjury—I did not give Edwards a bad crown piece on the Saturday, I gave him two good ones—the crown piece produced at the hearing was not the one I had given Edwards on the Saturday.</p>

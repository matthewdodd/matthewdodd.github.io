                  </hi>. I am a cloth-manufacturer, carrying on business at Leeds—my father is partner with me—I have an agent in London for the sale of cloth, Mr. Isaac Hainsworth—his warehouse is in Aldermanbury, next door to the Axe Inn—I was in town at Mr. Hainsworth's on the 30th of Nov—amongst other goods in the warehouse there was a piece of rifle green cloth, and another piece of double milled brown—the green was twenty-nine yards long, and the brown was twenty-seven yards—I saw them safe on the 30th of Nov.—I was at Mr. Hainsworth's again on the 1st of Dec., and about one o'clock that day Mr. Hainsworth and I went out of dinner together—the prisoner was in the warehouse and boy named Sykes, whose father is commission-agent Mr. Hainsworth said to the boy, "John, come, are you not going to dinner?"—he said no, he had dined, he was going to the West end for his father—Mr. Hainsworth said, "You must leave the keys of the warehouse at the Axe tap, John"—Mr. Hainsworth and I went to dinner—in about three quarters of an hour we returned and found the ware-house locked, and the key was at the Axe tap—on the following day Mr. Hainsworth and I took stock, and the rifle green cloth and the double milled brown were missing—they were gone out of thr warehouse—on the 5th of Dec. I saw the prisoner—I did not give him into custody, as I had not found the cloth—I did not know positively who had got it—I went out of town on the 5th of Dec. and returned on the 1st of Jan.—it is the course of my business to go round to customers to show them samples, in order to effect sales—on the 6th of Jan. I went to Mr. Morgan's shop in cloth-fair—while I was trying to effect the sale of some cloths there, Mr. Morgan said I could not sell him any as cheap as he had bought some—I saw two six yards remnants of rifle green cloth on the counter—I knew them directly I saw them, and I made inquiries of Mr. Morgan how he got them—in consequence of what I learned from him I went to the police-station, and gave information—I went with the officer to a beer-shop in Milton-street, I found the prisoner and gave him into custody—here are the two pieces of cloth of six yards each which I found at Mr. Morgan's—they formed a part of the twenty-nine yards which were at Mr. Hainsworth's on the 30th of Nov., and which I missed in taking stock on the 2nd of Dec.—I have another piece of cloth which is my manufacture, and which I sent to Mr. Hainsworth's—it is the fellow-end to that twenty-nine yards—they were woven together at my father's house—in colour and shade they are the same—there are two of the red threads in the middle of the list of it which are thicker than the other—the number of threads in this cloth is twenty-nine, and there is the same number in that found at Mr. Morgan's—it is worth 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard at the wholesule value—I knew it by the colour and the thread, and the mark in the list.</p>

               <p>Aldermanbury. I am agent in London for the house of Mr. Wade, a cloth<lb></lb>factor at Leeds—I remember Mr. Wade being in London on the 30th of Nov.—I recollect seeing two pieces of cloths, one rifle green and one double milled brown—I saw Mr. Wade the next day, and went with him to dinner—the prisoner was in the warehouse with young Sykes—I gave directions to Sykes to leave the keys at the Axe—on the 2nd of Dec. I took stock, and the pieces of green cloth and the pieces of brown were both gone—I did not find what had become of any of them, till after these two pieces of rifle green were traced to Mr. Morgan's—I have looked at these two pieces, at the texture, the make, the shade, and the list—I have no doubt they are a part of that twenty-nine yards that was the cloth of Mr. Wade, and was missing from my premises—we sold the fellow piece to it at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard to whole<lb></lb>sale houses—I suppose it sells retail at ten or fifteen per cent. more.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I live at No. 37, Cloth-fair. I am by trade a tailor and piece-broker—I have known the prisoner four or five years, or it may be more—I purchased these pieces of cloth of him last Christmas, at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—I defy the best judge in Court to say what such cloth is worth—I considered it was a fair price—when the prisoner came to me he asked me if I wanted to buy any cloth—I told him I did not, particularly as I could not sell common cloth—I said I would make him an offer, which I did—he said he would inquire of the party is belonged to whether he would take my money—he said it was cheap, as in general dealers do, and it would be worth the money—I told him to call at my shop at his leisure—he left the cloth with me—he asked me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, and I made him an offer of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he came again on the morrow or the next day, I am not certain which—he agreed to take my money—he did not bring the person with him that he said he had it from—I was aware he sold for Mr. Sykes—Idid not ask him where he got it from—I went to the public-house and got change, and paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

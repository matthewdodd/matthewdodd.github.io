                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Jeremiah Chapman. I was working for Mr. James Chapman on the 26th of November—the pri<lb></lb>soner came there, and said he had two rum-puncheons for sale, they were 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. apiece—he went into the house for the money, but my master called me to go with him, and gave me a sovereign and four half-crowns—I went with the prisoner for them—when we got to a certain place, he said, "Here is the public-house; my father is cellar-man; give me the money, and I will let you have the puncheons"—I said, "No, if you show me them, if they are good, I will give you the money"—he said, "No, I want to borrow some money of my father, if you will give it me"—I said "No"—I bad a hole in my pocket, and had the money in my hand—he snatched it out of my hand, and ran away down a court, and was out of sight before I could cry out—I had to pay the money, and I have lost my place through it—my mas<lb></lb>ter thought I had <hi rend="italic">done</hi> him out of the money—I mentioned the transaction to the police directly it was done—I have seen the prisoner once or twice since, in Farringdon-street, and before I could stop my truck he got off—I saw him with a sugar-hogshead—he left it, and ran off.</p>

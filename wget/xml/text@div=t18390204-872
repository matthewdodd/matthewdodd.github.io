                  </hi>. I am a broker's assistant. On the 21st of January I was employed by Mr. Turner, of Friar-street, Blackfriars-road, to make a distress on the prisoner's premises, No. 2, Hebden-court, Pearl-row. Blackfriars-road—I went there about half-past two o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon—I met Prettyman the landlord at the door—the prisoner was only a tenant—I sent the landlord up first, and then went in myself—I went up to the prisoner's room, and found him sitting on a stool at work, conversing with the landlord—he is a shoemaker—the landlord was saying to him, "I wish you to settle this little thing without putting me to the trouble of putting a distress on your goods—I wish you to do it"—the prisoner said he had no money to settle it—I then said to the prisoner that a duty would devolve on me which I was very reluctant to perform on a man in his situation, but without he and the landlord could settle it, I was there with a warrant to distrain his goods—I held the warrant in my hand, and showed it to him—on my doing so, he said, "You are not going to rob my poor children of my poor bits of things?"—I said, I was very sorry, but I had a duty to per<lb></lb>form which I could not help—he immediately turned round to the left side of him, and snatched a knife from the seat on which he was at work—it was such a knife as shoemakers use—he rose up from his seat, swore a tremendous oath, and requested me to leave the room, holding the knife up in an attitude to plunge it at me—I said, "My good man, do lay such a dangerous instrument as that down, I have not come here to do you any harm"—I requested him two or three times to lay it down—he then turned</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183902040272"></xptr>
               <p>to his seat again, and snatched up a hammer—in the interim I looked round to get something—I saw a child's cradle, and just as he was coming forward to strike me with the knife, I got it up and put it between us—he got hold of the other side of the cradle, lifted it up, and instantaneously sprang under the cradle, and made a plunge at me—I put my arm down to keep the knife from my side, and received it just above my elbow—it was a <hi rend="italic">job</hi> under the cradle—I did not know the knife had entered my arm at the moment, till I perceived the blood flow—I then immediately felt a pricking pain—I turned the cradle round, and said—"You have committed a very serious act upon me,"—he made no reply—I moved the cradle round, went and seized him by the shoulder and the back of his trowsers, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him out of the room, and shut the door against him—I did not observe what he did with the knife—he came back again after I had closed the door, and requested to have his coat—I opened the door a little way, and perceiving he had not the knife or hammer, I allowed him to take his coat—he was in the act of going—I said he had no occasion to go, I should certainly give him into custody—he went away—I followed him, and he made a sudden rush into a house to escape—I went after him—a lad went for a policeman, who came, and I saw the prisoner taken in a water<lb></lb>closet, about twenty minutes after I had received the stab—I did not hear precisely what he said to the policeman, as the person in the house rescued him from me, but he said it was a very bad job, or something like it—Mr. Staddon, the doctor, has attended me—I was obliged to have my arm laid open—I am not well now, but am getting better.</p>

I took the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody, between three and four o'clock, on the 21st of January, in a privy—I Galled Hodgson, and asked if he was the person who committed the assault—he said, "Yes"—the prisoner said nothing—as we were going to the station-house, I said he was a foolish man to get himself into that trouble—he said it was a foolish thing, but in the irritation of the moment, seeing his children crying round him, and he having not a mouthful of victuals to eat, it so irritated him, that he did not think for the moment that the knife touched the man's arm, and it must have been in the scuffle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was requested by Mr. Jeremy the Magistrate to examine Hodgson's arm, between four and five o'clock on the afternoon of the 21st of January—I discovered a wound near the elbow<lb></lb>joint of the left arm, produced by some sharp instrument—it appeared to have been a stab or thrust—I did not examine the depth of it then, but after it became necessary to lay the wound opts, it was discovered to be three inches deep, or more—it was above the elbow, and had passed be<lb></lb>tween the integuments up towards the shoulder—I think it was such a wound as might have been made with a shoemaker's knife—it is getting well now.</p>

I was in the prisoner's room when Hodgson came in—the prisoner was at work at his bench at the time—directly Hodgson came in he seized the cradle—the prisoner jumped up at the moment, with the knife he was at work with in one hand, and a boot in the other, and seised hold of the cradle—I did not observe whether he dropped the boot—I saw them struggle for the cradle—I think, from what I saw, that the blow was quite accidental—the prisoner has four children—there were three there—they were crying—I have known the prisoner eight or nine years—he has always borne the character of an honest, peaceable, unoffending man—he has been a long time out of work.</p>

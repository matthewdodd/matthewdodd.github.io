In consequence of something I heard, I and Thomas, the officer, searched the prisoner's room at my house; the officer found 4l. 18s. 6d. in the fire-place - I never knew of the prisoner dealing in straw, or being any thing but a soldier.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you any other soldier lodging in your house? A. His comrade, Carter, lodged in the same room; he is still in the regiment, I believe - he left me directly this turned out against Currie; the serjeant took them both away - the prisoner had the key to lock the room whenever he chose; the chests were not locked - he had no business in the part of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180020"></xptr>house they were in; he would pass that landing to go to bed - I have also a female lodger who would pass the place. I am not a manufacturer of plait; I have lately lost my wife - she had nothing to do with the business - the letter G. is my own mark; it denotes the price I bought it at; I have bought thousands of bundles at that price in my life - I put it away for the Spring trade, and did not miss it till I found it was all gone; it was all safe the beginning of October - some was marked G. and the rest E.; three bundles here have not my mark on them -I had two of them from York-street, and the other I brought from home; I believe them to be the quality I had from the manufacturer, but these two have been untied, and then the private mark would drop out; the prisoner was billetted on me till he was apprehended - he was very troublesome in the house, and went to the next house, because my wife would not let him have salt and things three or four times a day - he did not take me before a Magistrate, it was my servant.</p>
               <p>GEORGE STROUD. I keep a straw bonnet shop, in Milner-place, Lambeth. The prisoner called on me about three weeks previous to his apprehension, and offered some plait - I bought a small quantity of him for 8s.; it is here - I gave it to Mr. Austin about a week after; I am sure it was the same - I was about ten minutes making the bargain with him the first time; he came again next day, but I did not buy of him - he had some more plait; I do not know what quantity - what he brought the first time was in a red handkerchief; he had some in a handkerchief the next time, but I do not know whether it was red - it was tied in a handkerchief and put into a knapsack; he told me he had got more plait to sell me, and asked 10s. for it - I then asked where he got it: he said his sister and mother who made it sent it up to him from the country - I said, being a stranger to him, I should like to have some further account of it, as he asked me considerably below its value; I asked where he lived - he said in Oxford-street; he was in soldier's clothes - I asked where in Oxford-street; he said that was a matter of no consequence, if I had any doubt of him I had no occasion to purchase it - I then told him I had no reason to doubt him, but he asked me so much below the value, if he could prove to me how he came by it, I would give him 2l. for it - he had asked 10s.; I thought it worth full 2l. - he made some answer; I asked if his serjeant knew he dealt in straw - he said he did; I said if he would take me to where he lived, or to his serjeant I would purchase it, but that he also declined - I would not purchase, and he left; this interview lasted full twenty minutes - I have not the slightest doubt of his being the man; I did not see the private mark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you keep an open shop? A. I do; my wife was present on the first occasion, and my brother on the second - they are not here; they were not required at Bow-street - I have not been long in the trade: I stated to him on the second occasion that I was a large dealer, and knew every one in the trade; that was not the case - I do not consider myself a very good judge of plait; I gave him 8s. for two bundles - he was in his undress with a cap on, and was a stranger to me before.</p>
               <p>MARY BROWN. I live with my father, a bonnet cleaner, in Litchfield-street. The prisoner came to our shop to offer plait to my father for sale about three weeks ago; I was present - he bought none; the prisoner was in the shop five or ten minutes - I had never seen him before, but he is the man; he was dressed in regimentals, and had the plait in a red handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not seen other soldiers at your shop? A. No; he did not speak to me - I am positive he is the man; he was in his undress.</p>

            . I live at No. 47, York-street, Westminster, and keep a straw bonnet shop. I have bought plait of the prisoner; I am certain he is the man - he came several times; the last time was about a month ago- I have seen him four or five times, but did not purchase every time; the quantity altogether came to less than 1l. I have not the slightest doubt of his person - he was alone; he had it once in a white wrapper; I do not know what it was in at other times - I asked where he got it; he said he was a native of Dunstable, that his friends sent it to him, and he could serve me as cheap as the dealers as that was the case; that satisfied me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was that at the first or a subsequent time? A. I cannot be certain whether I bought any of him first - I always buy of dealers; they call at the shop - his being in soldier's clothes was the reason I asked him about it; I gave Austin what I had left - the rest was manufactured; I gave him 4s. for each bundle - I delivered up two bundles.</p>

             THOMAS. I am superintendant of the Police. I apprehended the prisoner - he was not searched; I searched his clothes which were at his lodgings; I have a handkerchief which I found inside one of his jackets, and inside the handkerchief are some small particles of straw not large enough for plait; I took him on the 28th of January, in St. James'-park, at the military station.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to JOHN AUSTIN. Q. Besides the person you have named was there a boy and a man lodging in your house? A. There was a little boy eight or nine years old and his mother, but no man.</p>

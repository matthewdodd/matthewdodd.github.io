                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Newell; he keeps the Feathers public-house, at Bayswater. On 10th April the two prisoners came to the house, about eleven o'clock in the morning—Keefe asked for a pint of porter, and gave me a sixpence—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and put the sixpence in the till, with a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece that was there; but I am quite sure there was no other sixpence—I went to the till a few minutes afterwards, and found only the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece and sixpenee there—I then saw that the sixpence was bad—I wrapped it in paper, and put it into my pocket, separate from other money—the prisoners came in again, soon after twelve o'clock—Keefe again called for porter, for which he again paid with a sixpence—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I put the sixpence on one side—I had two little girls come in at the same time, and I was obliged to serve them, and while I was doing that, the pri<lb></lb>soners went out the back way—I discovered that the sixpence was bad when they were gone, and put it into some paper—about five in the evening the prisoners came again, and Cooper then asked for a pint of porter and half a screw of tobacco, which came to 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a sixpence—I put it into my mouth to try it, and Keefe ran away directly—Cooper stayed there, and I told some men there to take care of him—he tried to get away—Keefe had run down the back stairs—I ran after him, and brought him back myself from the back yard—there is a way out that way—he struck me across the arm, I had not said anything about bad money then—an officer was sent for—I gave both the prisoners into custody, and gave him the three sixpences.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Thomas Roberts—he is a short hand writer—I know the prisoner—I was introduced to her where she was lodging at my mother's, No. 14, Water-street, Blackfriars—she called herself the Baroness Cushteen—I asked her to pay me a visit—the first time she came to see me was with my mother on the 17th of May—on the 4th of June she came alone—on that afternoon I went into my bedroom, I had to put something into a box—the prisoner went in the bedroom with me—there was a small tin box in the other box—the prisoner asked me what I had got there—I told her it was new silver—there was another small box there, and the prisoner said, "Let me see what there is there"—I told her there was gold in it—she asked me how much—I told her it was not to be counted—I said that because I thought she was too curious—we then went into the other room and had some coffee together—she said "Will you let me look at your keys, as I have lost mine"—I showed them to her, she said they would not suit—she then went home—during the period she had been staying in my room, I had to go out for something, and I left her alone for about ten minutes—I left her in the parlour which communicates with the bedroom by folding doors—I took my keys with me when I went out—on the following morning, Saturday the 5th of June, I had occasion to go to the box about eleven o'clock—I saw there were twenty-six sovereigns in gold—I took one sovereign out—the prisoner came that day about quarter after one o'clock—Mr. Roberts was at home when she came—he went out at half-past</p>

               <p>three, and left the prisoner with me—after Mr. Roberts was gone, the prisoner said to me "Will you fetch me some port wine"—I told her I never fetched port wine, but the servant could get it—I sent the servant for it—the pri<lb></lb>soner gave me the money, and I gave it to the servant—after the wine was come, the prisoner asked me to get her some ham to eat with the wine—I did not consent at first, but she said I could get it so much better than the servant—I at last went and fetched some—I was gone about twenty minutes—I cannot tell whether I took my keys that time or not, I do not remember—when I came back with the ham the prisoner did not eat any of it—she drank two glasses of wine—the last glass she drank standing, saying she wanted to go home, and she would take the ham with her—she then left—we got into a cab together—directly she got out she wanted to take a drive round the park—I went home with her, and then returned to my own home between seven and eight o'clock—Mr. Roberts came home a little after nine—he had some money which he wanted to put away, and he went to the box—he made a communication to me, I went to the box, and found the lock was strained—Mr. Roberts turned it with a gimblet—he brought the box in which the gold was kept, into the parlour—there were then only fifteen sove<lb></lb>reigns in it—I am quite sure there were twenty-five sovereigns in the morning—the silver in the other box had not been touched—I went with Mr. Roberts to the prisoner's lodging—we got there between ten and eleven o'clock—we found the prisoner in bed and all her clothes packed up—she had not said anything to me about leaving her lodging.</p>

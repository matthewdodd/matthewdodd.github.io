                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Smith, and am housekeeper to Mr. Forbes, at 115, Rood-lane—on 1st February, a little before 8, two persons came to Mr. Forbes's office—the prisoner was one of them—they came to the street door and asked me what time Mr. Forbes came—I said, "About half-past 9"—they said, "We have come to examine the gas-burners, as they do not burn very bright"—I said it was very strange Mr. Forbs had not mentioned it to me when he went away on Saturday—the other man then aid, "Oh! we received a letter late on Saturday night, or else we ought to have been here before"—I went up stairs with them to the second floor, where Mr. Forbes's office is, and the other man took off his coat and put it on the desk—he then took a small instrument out of his pocket, and undid one of the gas burners, unscrewed it, and took it off—the prisoner stood by the iron safe, close to the door—whilst there my little girl came in and said the street door was not closed—I went down to shut it, and when I came up again the other man had the two burners in his hand—he said, "Tell Mr. Forbes the gas burners are only corroded, he won't require new ones; we will bring them back in an hour"—I then let them out of the street door—after that Mr. Ritchie, Mr. Forbes's clerk, came, and then it was discovered that two desks and a cabinet had been broken open—I next saw the prisoner at Seething-lane about two hours afterwards—I knew him to be the same man in an instant—I am positive now that he is the man—I knew him the moment I saw him.</p>

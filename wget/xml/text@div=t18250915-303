               <p>CATHERINE SWEENEY. I am the wife of John Sweeney, and knew the prisoner before she was a year old. On the 12th of June I saw her in the parish of All Saints, Poplar - I was looking for my husband, who was in a public-house, and had the key of our house. I was coming home, and met the prisoner with

            ; she asked me to go and drink a pot of beer - I said I would not. I had left my husband in the public-house; she and the two men wanted me to go and have the beer; I refused, and Brown said I must go, and put his hand round me - I said I must go home. The prisoner came and put her hand under my arm, and said I must go; I went with her - she took me across the road, out of my own road, and by the water; she wanted me to go into a public-house; I said, "Goggen, I won't go into the public-house to night;" she said, "We shall both get home sooner by going this road than the other, because we can cross the fields" - she went to a public-house, and called for a pot of beer at the door - it was refused her, as she owed for some. I said, "Goggen, you have had too much liquor" - upon which she struck me a blow in the face; she turned round to the two men, who were standing behind us, and talked to them - I heard them whispering, thought there was something bad going on, and went away, and when I got into the fields Goggen called me, and said she would be with me; I waited in the field for her till she came to me - the two men came after her - she turned and talked to them - I ran away, and the first words she said were, "There, she is gone;" then the three followed me. I was knocked down by Brown - he fell himself at the same time - I was not long enough with them to know whether he was drunk or not; I was sober. I got up; I had the key of the street door in my hand, and when he came close to me to catch hold of me, I struck him in the face with the key - I got up before him; he caught hold of my pocket, tore my gown, and took the key of my box and two sovereigns out of my pocket - Sullivan came directly, and took my shawl; he whipped it off, and took it to Goggen, who stood about three yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try to prevent his taking it? A. No; I did not see him till he pulled it off - because I was struggling with Brown. Goggen said to Sullivan, "D - n you, why don't you take the gold ring off her finger" - he came back, and knocked me down - and took the ring and beat me; I was more than half dead - he left me there. I would rather have lost the last drop of my blood, than he should have the ring. I resisted, and would not let him have it until he knocked me down, and took it and the key of the door away - all this was in the field. I went back to a man named Charley Brian. I was more than a quarter of a mile from home, and thirty or forty yards from the public-house. I went to Brian, he was in bed. Next morning I went to Goggen's house, and asked what was the reason she took and robbed me, along with two men, and why she went drinking with men, whom she did not know; she said, she would drink a pot of beer with any one who would pay for it. She said she did not know the men, but I have since found out that they lodged with her. She sent for me the same evening, and said she would give me my property up before to-morrow evening - but did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this, had you told her she had better confess? A. I do not know what I told her - I was really out of my mind - I was three weeks in bed - I have found none of the property. I advised her twenty times over to give up the property, and if not, I would make her. I told her to give me my own, and bring the robbers up - she said she would not give Pat Brown up, if she was twelve months in Newgate. I said, if she did not give the property up, I would put her where she would not get out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What business is your husband? A. A poor labouring man; he worked at the gas-works, or wherever he could get work. I go out with apples and fish.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was this? A. Between eleven and twelve o'clock; the public-house, is the Eeel-pie-house by the canal, in the Merchants'-field - if I had screamed out, nobody could have heard me. I did scream and call murder. I knew the prisoner, but did not know where she lived. I went to her at six o'clock the next morning; a neighbour told me where she lived. I went to Lambeth-street about three days after, and had a warrant for Brown and Sullivan as well, but they were not taken. I had known them for two years, they are bricklayer's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150114"></xptr>labourers. I went before the Justice, who dismissed the charge - I did not speak much against the woman, because she had promised me my property. She took my shawl, and I told her to give it me up, when I went in the morning. I went to Hicks's-hall, and preferred this bill, and then had her taken again, as the Justice told me to indict her.

               <p>JOHN SWEENEY. I am the last witness's husband. On Sunday night, the 12th of June, I went out and took the key in my pocket; and as I came home, I saw the prisoner in Gunn-lane, Limehouse - my wife and Sullivan were with her - it was about eleven o'clock. I did not see Brown. I left them talking to her at the corner of the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time of night did your wife come home? A. Not till seven o'clock in the morning; she said she was robbed by Goggen, Brown and Sullivan; that the prisoner decoyed her out of her way - it happened in the centre of a field, which is a thoroughfare - there are no watchmen; she could not be heard if she called out - the place is noted for robberies.</p>

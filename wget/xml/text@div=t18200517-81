            . I live with Mr. Wise, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in Broad-street, Bloomsbury. On the 28th of April, between two and five o'clock, the property was pledged by the prisoner - she asked particularly for 1 l. 14 s. on the clothes and 12 s. on the counterpanes, which she received; I made them in separate duplicates by her desire. I asked her if they were her own? she said No, that they belonged to Mrs. Wilson, No. 25, Red Lion-street, and that she knew them to be her property. The prosecutrix redeemed them afterwards, and shortly after an Irish girl called with the duplicates of the counter-panes - I detained her. I afterwards saw the prisoner in Newgate, and asked her, by the Magistrate's desire, if she gave the duplicate to a man? she said she did, but still insisted that she pledged them for Mrs. Wilson. I went to No. 25, Red Lion-street, but found no such person there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Elias Moses and son, Aldgate—the prisoners were employed to distribute pamphlets and papers for them. On the 29th of June I missed about 2500 pamphlets—I received information, and found the prisoners at the station—these pamphlets had not been delivered to the prisoners—it was their duty to wait till I came, and then to take them of me—they said that Mr. Moses, the night before, had told them that they should take out more books—Mr. Moses is not here.</p>

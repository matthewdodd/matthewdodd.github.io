            . I live at 38, Long-lane, Smithfield. On Wednesday evening, the 10th of May, the prisoner Addison came into my shop, to buy a pig's foot, price two pence, for which he tendered a three shilling Bank token, I gave him the change; immediately Mr. Johnson came in, and looked at it, and in consequence of what he said, and told me to do, I laid it by, and Mr. Johnson called for it the next morning.</p>
               <p>LYDIN HARDY. I keep a chandler's shop in Golden-lane. On Wednesday evening, the 19th of May, a man came in for a twopenny loaf about half past eight; he put down a three shilling piece; Mr. Johnson then came in, and said be careful, that is a bad one; Mr. Johnson told me to mark it; the man was mothe shop at the time. Mr. Johnson took him into custody I believe, I was so frightened that I don't know what mark I put upon the three shilling piece.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WARWICK. I keep a fishmongers ship in Carthusian-street, Charterhouse-square. Addison came to my house, on the evening of the 10th of May and purchased a pennyworth of shrimps, he immediately began eating of them; he gave me a three shilling token, which I refused as it was bad; he said he had no other; and I asked him how he came to eat my property when he had nothing but a bad three shilling piece to pay for it; just then Mr. Johnson came up, and he was secured afterwards.</p>

            . I am an officer, On Wednesday, the 10th of May in the evening. I saw both prisoners together in Giltspur-street; I observed Addison, go into a baker's shop, Coyle went right across Smithfield and waited for him. I saw Addison through the window tendering a three shilling piece and heard it ring; he then came out and joined Coyle's. He went then to the pork shop, and Coyle went down the lane, Addison came out directly and I went in; Mrs. Macbeath shewed me a three shilling token which he passed to her that is it. The force shilling piece shewn to the witness. I went out and saw them join company again, and saw Addison give Coyle something in Charterhouse-square. They then went to Warwick's shrimp shop, Addison stopped and Coyle went into Greville-street, my brother officer, Matthews, who was with me, followed him, and I watched Addison. They then went into a chandlers shop, Addison alone, and got some bread for which they tendered a three shilling piece Coyle went away and left Addison in the shop; I saw him give her a three shilling piece, which I afterwards told her to mark. I secured Addison with a good deal of difficulty, and took him over the way where I searched him; I found the pig's foot upon him and the things he had bought, but not a halfpenny in money; I saw Coyle searched.</p>

            . I have heard all Johnson has said it is perfectly true; my pursuit was after Coyle, whom I took; I searched him, and upon him found two bad three shilling pieces, a good eighteen-penny piece, and tenpence in halfpence; also a sixpence, which looked very well then, but which is bad.</p>

            . I see the tokens, they are counterfeits, and appear to be quite fresh, they are merely washed, and wont bear rubbing.</p>
               <p>MR. HARVEY. I make the same observations, those tokens proved to have been tender by Addison are exactly of the same manufacture and both struck with the same die.</p>

I am quite a stranger in London, I have not been here ten days, I merely went out to walk with Addison; the three shilling pieces that were found upon me, I did not know were bad, your lordship might be equally liable to take them. I have a wife and four small children, I hope the court will be merciful.</p>

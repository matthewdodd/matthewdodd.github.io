                  </hi>. I am a seaman belonging to the American ship, <hi rend="italic">Sir Robert Peel—on</hi> 28th June, she was lying in Shadwell basin—about 3 o'clock that afternoon, the deceased, Patrick Doyle, the prisoner, and some other seamen were in the forecastle (we had had a drink before we went aboard)—the prisoner took a bottle of rum, out of his pocket and gave it to Doyle to have a drink—Doyle took a drink and put it in his bunk—the man asked him for the bottle back, but he would not give it to him—some angry words passed between them and Ryan, and the prisoner had a fight—Ryan ought the prisoner on the cheek, and just knocked the skin off—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180104"></xptr>
               <p>the fight only lasted 5 or 6 minutes—after that they shook hands, and Ryan and a man named Welch went and laid down in a bunk, the rest of us sat down on deck, I sat on the forecastle, and Doyle a yard or two from me, and the prisoner on the furthest side about three yards off—we were all dozing, and the first thing I heard was Doyle and the prisoner having a ew words—he was eating a piece of beef, and he threw a small piece of it and hit the prisoner in the eye, saying, "I will make you <hi rend="italic">loom</hi> before the week is out;" <hi rend="italic">"loom"</hi> is to make you climb, to go aloft—they were both ble seamen—Doyle sat there about five minutes, and the next thing I saw as Doyle leaning in a corner, like this, stooping down on his knees—I put my hand on his breast and found blood coming out—I endeavoured to stop the blood by keeping my hand upon it—the prisoner then cut me through my coat and shirt into my arm with a sheath knife, which he had in his and—it was a slight cut—he inflicted it by making a slash, and then the other men came up and knocked him down, or he would have done for me as well as the deceased—my back was turned to him, but I saw the knife in his hand—I sang out that Doyle was killed, and the other men jumped out of their bunks—me and the prisoner and McKeeghan were not in the bunks—I held Doyle in my arms and stuck to him, but the life was out of im in about three minutes, he must have died instantly; he had two cuts on his breast, and one on his side—the Thames Police came on board.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We had been drinking all day before we went to the ship, at the Paddy's Goose and other public-houses—we were about half drunk—there was no one to order us to our berths when we reached the vessel—when I found Doyle, he was down on his hands and knees, about three yards from the prisoner—he never moved, I had him in my arms till he died.</p>

I am a seaman, and belonged to the <hi rend="italic">Sir Robert Peel</hi>—on 28th June, when she was leaving Shad well basin for sea, seven or eight of us were on the forecastle about 3 p. m., and after the rum had been produced by the prisoner to Doyle, there was a quarrel between me and the prisoner, and we struck three or four blows—I understand that Doyle endeavoured to separate us, but I do not know, as I was the worse for drink—we shook hands, and then three of us went to the same bunk—I was in my bunk a short time, and heard a man sing out "Patsey Doyle is killed"—I saw the prisoner with a knife in his hand, and asked him what he was going to do with it, he made no answer—I got a billet of wood, and rushed in, and told him to put down the knife; he said "No," and then me and Michael O'Brien and another man rushed in and knocked him down; he struggled very hard to keep the knife, but it was got from him and given to the second mate, who stood outside the forecastle and told us to fetch him out—we dragged the prisoner out, and gave him into the second mate's and carpenter's charge, who took him aft and made him fast to the main mast, and in a short time the Thames Police came on board.</p>

On the afternoon of 28th June I was called to the <hi rend="italic">Sir Robert Peel</hi>, which was going down the river—I went on board, and the carpenter gave me this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), there are red stains on it, which were then wet—I asked the carpenter what the deed was done with, and the prisoner, who was made fast to the mainmast, said "I fear I took my knife out of the sheath, and stuck it in him"—I had the knife in my hand, and he said "That is my knife; they were all beating</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is usual for them to drink a good deal before going on board—when he said that he drew his knife from the sheath he did not say "He came at me," but he wanted to say more—the prisoner was smothered with blood; he had a severe cut on his head, and was bleeding fast—his two statements were not continuous, there was about a minute between them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am divisional police surgeon, of 171, East India Road—on 28th June I saw the deceased at the dead-house in Poplar—there was a punctured wound an inch long immediately over the cartilage of the fifth rib, two inches inside the nipple; it divided the cartilage, and went completely through the heart, puncturing both ventricles, and the septum also—that would account for death, and this knife fitted into the wound—there was also a small wound at the side, which was quite superficial, it was just through the skin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In my opinion a stab like that would cause instant death—I think it probable that a man might jump up afterwards—it is a most vital part; in fact, the man was killed immediately it entered his heart—the prisoner was depressed when I saw him—he had lost a large quantity of blood—I attended to him.</p>

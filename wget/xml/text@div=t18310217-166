            . I am the wife of John Drake. On the 21st of January, about five o'clock, I received a half-crown from Griffith - I had received no other that evening; I remarked in a minute or two that it was very had, and put it into a corner of the desk on a book - there was no other half-crown near it; I was particular in keepit by itself - in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour Masters came to change a half-crown; I thought it looked like the one I had from Griffith - I called my husband, who went away with her, and in five or ten minutes Collier brought the prisoner in; I gave him the same half-crown as I had from Griffith - I took it off the book where I had put it; I can swear it is the same.</p>

            . My husband is in the Guards, and I keep a green-shop at No. 25, Lambeth-hill. On the 21st of January, at a quarter-past five o'clock, the prisoner was outside my window - I was in my room; he said, "Halloo, mistress;" I went out to him, but in the mean time two other men passed, and he said to them, "Two or three?" they said, "Get three;" they went on, and he stopped, put his hand on a savoy, and asked the price - I said 1 1/2d. - he only asked for one; I served him - he had 3 lbs. of potatoes for 2d., which made 3 1/2d.; he gave me half a crown, which I could not change, and went two doors below, to Mrs. Buckle's - she weighed the half-crown, and it was light - it never went out of my sight; I then went to Drake's, and in consequence of what passed there, she called her husband, and the prisoner was apprehended by Collier, to whom I gave the half-crown, but cut a piece out of it before I parted with it; Griffith said, in his hearing, that he had given him a half-crown - the prisoner said he had not been near his shop.</p>

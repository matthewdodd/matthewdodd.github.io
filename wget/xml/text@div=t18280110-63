            . I am a watchman. I was on duty on the 15th of December; at half-past nine o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in Fashion-street, and followed him to Red Lion-street, Spitalfields; he had a bundle in a green baize; I asked what he had got; he said paper, and was going to a printer's, in Paternoster-row, and had brought it from Spitalfields, I took him to the watch-house; when we got to the door he shoved back, and said, "Stop, I will give you something to drink to let me go;" I took him in, and asked where he got it; he said a young man gave it to him to make a shilling or two of, he being in distress.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the watch. I asked the prisoner who Gray was; he said a little man, who went out with bills; I went to the prisoner's house, and found this jacket, which I know belongs to Gray; he is a man who carries bills about for Lamert.</p>

             sworn. - On the 24th of May, in the morning, one of our beadles of the parish of Hackney came to inform me there was a man in the cage for stealing fowls; I had not then missed my fowls; about two or three hours after I missed three hens and a cock, I had seen them the day before; I went to the guard-house, and knew the fowls to be mine; I kept them in a sort of hen-house, about fifty yards from my dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>JOHN RUDLEY sworn. - I am a patrol of Hackney: On the 24th of May, about four o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner with a bundle under his arm in the fields, about half a mile from Mr. Amor's; I saw one of the fowl's necks out of the handkerchief; he said he bought them at Mr. Allen's, a tailor, at Homerton; he said he kept them there, and they used to run in the road; we took him to the guard-house, and I enquired after Allen, but could find no such person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been bathing in the river Lea; I met a man with these sowls, and I bought them of him; I never resisted, but went very quietly to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010701-46-verdict257" type="verdictDescription">

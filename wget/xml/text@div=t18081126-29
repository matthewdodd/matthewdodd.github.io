               <p>WILLIAM ADKINS. On the 16th of September last, I found the prisoner on board the Enterprize, a King's ship, it lays off the Tower; it is a receiving ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it on the Middlesex side of the river - A. Yes, on this side. I knew he had been convicted, I never knew of his having a pardon; in consequence of that I apprehended him and brought him to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the certificate in your hand - A. Yes; I saw Mr. Shelton sign it; Mr. Shelton is the clerk of this court. (The copy of the record of conviction read.)</p>
               <p>- SALMON. Q. You assisted the last witness - A. I did, in apprehending and bringing this man from the tender.</p>

            . Q. Were you present in September sessions, 1806 - A. Yes; when the prisoner at the bar was tried.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the verdict pronounced upon him - A. I did, and I heard the sentence passed upon him. I am sure it is the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the sentence passed upon him - A. Sentence of death, but by the indulgence of his Majesty he was ordered to be transported for life; he went away in January, 1807; he went down to Woolwich.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at the bar - A. I did, at the same place where he stands now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. After I was convicted at this bar my friends petitioned to colonel Frazier for my pardon; colonel Frazier got me a free pardon, it was not a conditional pardon. I after that went into the loyal York rangers, that afterwards went to Trinidad in the West Indies; I had liberty to go on shore at Portsmouth to see some of my comrades, but staying on shore too long I was afraid of being punished by the regiment, and by his Majesty's proclamation every deserter was to be accepted on board as a deserter; captain Read of Woolwich, can prove I had his Majesty's free pardon.</p>

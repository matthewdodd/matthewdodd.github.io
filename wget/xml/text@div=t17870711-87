               <p>Were that man and the prisoner in company together? - I never saw them till the other man turned me round by my handkerchief; I told him I had no money; he told me if I did not give it him he would blow my brains out; I said I had none; he said don't hesitate; I had a bed blanket tied up in a silk handkerchief; he snatched that out; says I, it is not worth your while to take it; it is only a rag; he snatched it away; and made me give him my money; upon that he called to a man, the prisoner I believe, to bring a pistol or pistols, I do not know which; I heard a step coming, and directly cried out murder; a man came up, and I said directly, he has robbed me; upon that the man crossed the road, and I followed him; between us we took the bundle from him; I saw him stop my brother; I saw him before he called the other man.</p>
               <p>You did not take a vast deal of observation; did you? - No; my brother left the bed, and I staid by it.</p>
               <p>Do you know what the prisoner said to your brother? - No; I did not see the prisoner taken; I did not hear the prisoner say anything to my brother.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man that came up to your brother? - I did not take notice of the prisoner; I cannot say either what he said or what he did.</p>

               <p>Did you pursue the prisoner some distance? - Yes; afterwards he got away from me; at the same time he made a stroke at me with a knife, to prevent my coming at him, he run away, and the boy pursued him; as I was running, the prisoner dropped the bundle, so I drove it into a ditch, and before he could get up again I was up with him; he rather run too hard, and got over a gate into a field; I could not get up so soon as him; I rather fell with my head against a stone, then he took over a gate into a field, and the boy got over the gate into the field, and I followed him; the boy never lost sight of him to my knowledge, because it was all in an instant; I took him in the middle of the field nearly; the boy was with me, and the man, and the woman; and the woman's husband, whose name is Cooper, came out and lent the stick, the other man made his escape.</p>
               <p>Are you very sure you saw the prosecutor down on the ground, in the way you describe, by your account that was the first situation you saw him in? - The very first before I came up to him, about ten yards I saw him, and the young woman against the pales, and the man holding her up; and to prevent disturbing him I was going round, for I thought it was a young woman and her sweetheart.</p>
               <p>How long might he stand over her? - I did not see him not half a minute.</p>

               <p>Court to Wood. Did you see any thing of a feather bed during this time? - Yes; I saw it lay on the road, and the boy on his face; it lay close to the boy.</p>
               <p>Had the boy any hold of the bed? - No; not to my knowledge; after it was over, the sister returned me ten thousand thanks, and said I had saved both their lives by coming up.</p>
               <p>Did Dunn never tell you what had happened? - He told me the man told him to lay the bed down, and to lay down on his face, and if he stirred he would shoot him.</p>

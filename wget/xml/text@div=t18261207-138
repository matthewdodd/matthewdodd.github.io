               <p>JOHN VAUGHAN DUTTON. On the 21st of November, at near two o'clock, just at the time the King was going to the House, I was at the bottom of the <placeName id="t18261207-138-crimeloc815">Haymarket</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was any body taken into custody, presently after your loss? A. Yes - a man; I have no idea who took my property.</p>

            . I was at the corner of the Haymarket; I saw the prosecutor there, with a lady; I saw his right arm held up, and a man put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket - it was not the prisoner, but I saw the prisoner close behind his back, and his coat-pocket was lifted up; I heard some keys jingle, and saw the keys, and something yellow, come from the prisoner's hand; I made a grasp at the prisoner's hand, but there was nothing in it - the man, who I saw with his hand in the prosecutor's pocket, escaped; I was close to the prosecutor, and there were eight or nine persons round him.</p>

            . I was with Waddington; I saw some persons surround Mr. Dutton - the prisoner was behind him, and was stooping; I saw the coat held up, and heard something rattle, but I did not see any thing; I cannot say whether the prisoner was holding up the coat or not - he was close to him.</p>

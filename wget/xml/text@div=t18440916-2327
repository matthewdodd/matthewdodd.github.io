                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Humberston, and live in Exeter-street, Portman-market. About eleven years ago, I was pre<lb></lb>sent at St. James's Church, Piccadilly, with the prisoner and Mary Pennell—they were married—I was bridesmaid, and saw them married—she was alive last Wednesday week at Brighton—I knew her—I had lived two years fellow servant with her.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 16th of Aug.—his second wife went into the shop with me—I said to the prisoner, "Do you know Emma Lee"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "She gives you in charge for bigamy, having another wife alive"—he paused about a minute, and then he said, "That has to be proved."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he not say that he did not know that his wife was alive? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he had no other wife living but Emma Lee—that was the person who gave him into custody—I found out Mrs. Humberston by a letter which I received from the first wife—Lee met me in Richmond-street, and I went with her and took the prisoner—I was reproved by the Magistrate for asking one question.</p>

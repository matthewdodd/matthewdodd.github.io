                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 275). On 27th May I was taking charge of some premises near the Country Dock, Rotherhithe, and about half past 4 o'clock I saw the prisoners in the adjoining premises, which is Mr. Freeman's stone yard; they crossed there, and I saw them both go into Mr. Ferguson's premises, which are unoccupied—they are in the parish of St. Paul, Deptford—I went round to the front, waited there half an hour, and saw both the prisoners come over the wall together—they appeared rather bulky about the waists, and I went with Fordham and asked M'Carthy what he had got—he said he had nothing—I searched him, and found this piece of lead (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) inside the waistband of his trowsers—I asked how he came by it—he said he found it near George's-stairs—that is close by where I took him—I afterwards examined the roof of Mr. Ferguson's premises, and found some lead missing—I took this piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the roof, and it corresponds with what I found on M'Carthy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Patrick M'Donald. We live in Morris-court, Essex-street, Whitechapel—I went out on a Monday night, about two months ago, and left my gown in my room; when I came back, my window was open, and my gown was gone—in about a week afterwards I went to the pawnbroker's, where I found my gown—I went to Hartican and apprehended him—he said he would give me the half-crown that had been taken for the gown—I had taken Hayes before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Sowerby, a pawnbroker, in Brick-lane. This gown was pawned by Hayes, I believe, on the 10th of March.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hayes.</hi> I certainly did pawn the gown, but I gave Hartican the half-crown and the duplicate—a week afterwards the prosecutrix called, and asked me about the gown—I said I had pawned one at the corner of Booth-street—she then had me taken—she could not find the boy, and I was remanded—she then said, if I would give her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. she would find the rest herself—I was taken to the House of Correction for fourteen days—I was then detained at the gate, though I had the money in my bosom to give her.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 62.) On the 28th of March I went to Turvey's-court, Essex-street, and took the prisoner Hartican—he said if I went with him to his father's, he would get the money and redeem the gown—I ascertained that Hayes was in the House of Correc<lb></lb>tion—I pointed her out, and had her detained—she said, "For God's sake, what am I wanted for?"—I said, "For Mrs. H'Donald's gown"—she said, "I know all about it"—and when the came out, the said to the pro<lb></lb>secutrix, "Here are 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., are you satisfied now?"</p>

On the 5th of April, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner and a boy came into our shop; she said she wanted to buy some printed cotton for a bed-gown; I shewed her some; I shewed her three or four more pieces; she asked the boy what he had done with her garter? he said he had put it in her pocket; she said, she would put it on, but, she said, it was very rude to put it on before me; therefore I turned my head; in the mean while, she concealed this piece of cotton under her petticoat.</p>

               <p>Did you turn round so as to see her do any thing? - No; I did not miss it directly; after that we bargained for three yards of this (producing it) she agreed to buy it, but had not money enough; she said she wanted a shilling; she bid the boy fetch her a shilling, and sent him out; a little while after the boy was gone, she said, she recollected she wanted four shillings instead of one, and she went after him to tell him she wanted four shillings; then I missed the cotton; I looked after her; and as she went from the door, I saw it hang about a quarter of a yard below her petticoat; I followed her as fast I could; before I got to her, I saw the watermen plying at Westminster-bridge, stop her, and take it from her: our shop is in Bridge-street, the third door from the bridge.</p>

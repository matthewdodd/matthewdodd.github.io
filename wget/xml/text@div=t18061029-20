I was coming down St. John street, I saw a man dressed like a cooper, he said he had bought this puncheon, and he would give me a shilling if I would roll it down to his house at Clerkenwell Green, facing the church; he told me he should be at home as soon as me. Accordingly I rolled it away from Mr. Butler's door towards his house.</p>

On the 10th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming from Kensington, and was passing within one hundred yards of Gloucester-lodge - I saw a gentleman and lady before me - from an observation they made, curiousity induced me to look into the hedge, and I there saw some lead; I knew it immediately, because I had been employed at Gloucester-lodge, and put this lead up myself - it is stamped with my name. I took it to the gardener - he said two men had been seen on the premises, and that he could swear to them; I pursued the prisoners, and challenged them. Adams attempted to run away; Grove said he knew nothing at all about it. I took them in charge. I found a trowel on Grove, and a line on Adams - it did not appear that the trowel had been used on the occasion.</p>

            . I hold a government situation. I was in my garden opposite to the prosecutrix's house, on the 10th of April, between four and five o'clock - I saw Mrs. Evans on the grounds of Gloucester-lodge - she said that there were two men on or about the stables; I went, and saw the two prisoners there - it is an old building, from whence the lead was taken. I saw one of them take something up - I followed them up the lane, and they divided; I went back, and down another lane, where I met Grove. I saw Mrs. Hyndman's gardener, and told him what I had seen. I then saw Mr. Draper, who said he had found some lead in the hedge. There is a field round the premises. I said I had seen two men - they were strangers to me, but I am sure of their persons.</p>

            . My husband is gardener to this lady. I went out about four o'clock, and saw Grove on the stable - I am sure he is the man. The other man stood near, and was looking up; I saw something handed down, long and flat, but I could not see what it was; Adams picked it up, and went away, into Gloucester-road. I am quite sure these are the two men.</p>

            . I am the gardener at Gloucester-lodge. This lead is part of the covering of a sky-light - I had seen it before. We lost lead on the 2d and 8th of April, and have since watched the premises very narrowly - I have sat up with a man for several nights. I swear that this lead was secure, and affixed to the building in the morning.</p>

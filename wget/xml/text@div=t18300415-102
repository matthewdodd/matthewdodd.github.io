William had settled for them, by which I understood he meant Cherry, who goes by the name of William - I told him I did not think that he came by them in a right way; he said he did not know, but he did not think it was right himself - I told him not to say any thing to William at that time respecting it; I came out and the door was locked - I overtook the cart, and asked Bremire if he were going to take the hay to the Hay-market; he said "No. to his master's stables in Westminster, opposite the Abbey" - I then returned, and asked Cherry what he had given for those two trusses, and who he bought them of; he said of a person named Ballard, who was in the tap-room of the Bell, and had given three shillings a truss for it - I asked if Mr. Ballard would come and satisfy me of that; he brought Ballard to me - I asked him if Cherry had bought two trusses of hay of him; he said "No, not of him, but he might of his brother' - I asked which way his brother's cart went; he said towards Edgware - I then took Cherry and Anstead, and went and took Bremire at the Boar's-head yard, Westminster; I do not know how many trusses were on the cart - I went to the stable and showed the same trusses to the prosecutor, who said he believed them to be his.</p>

               <p>MR. RIGDEN. I received thirty-six trusses, a regular load.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you missed any hay? A. It is impossible for me to miss hay; there is a great quantity of hay like this - I would not swear to it.</p>

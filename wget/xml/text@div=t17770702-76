               <p>Was there any body else in company any part of the time? - No, the valet de chambre came in to deliver a message, but did not stay. When we were on the steps the prisoner spoke something loud; but I could not comprehend what it was; I went into the hall, and desired her to be quiet; that, if she could not be quiet, she must go somewhere else to make a noise; she was then rather raised from her seat towards the deceased; she immediately sat down; the deceased sat on the table, she was in the porter's chair; the deceased's left side was rather to her.</p>

               <p>Were there any knives and forks? - There was a green-handled knife, which is here; when I went in and checked her, the deceased said to the prisoner, why don't you go? the prisoner said, will you come? upon which he answered, why don't you go? this passed while I was there; then I went out again: in about four or five minutes the prisoner came out and called somebody, I cannot say who it was.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any noise after you had been in, till the time she came to call you? - Not the least.</p>
               <p>Was you near enough, if he had given her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177707020043"></xptr> a blow, to have heard it? - I think I was; I was not three yards from the door. I went in first; they followed me in. I saw the deceased sitting in the position he was before, leaning against the wall, with both his hands on his betty; I asked him, what was the matter? he made no answer, but seemed to be in agony; he fetched two deep sight; he raised his hand higher on his belly, I then saw the cut in his waistcoat; I turned to the prisoner and said, you blasted bitch, you have stabbed the man; she answered, God forgive you; and immediately said, I have done it, I have done it; if I go to the gallows for it, I have done it; I will die by the gallows for him sooner than that other woman shall enjoy him. I looked for the knife, but could see only a green-handled fork; I had seen a knife there before; the deceased raised himself up a little, and said, take that woman away from me. I put my hand on her shoulder to force her away; she dropped on her knees and laid hold of his strap, and said, I will not leave him, or I will never leave him, I cannot be positive which of the words she used. I asked the deceased, if I should send for a surgeon; he answered, no; he then opened his upper waistcoat, and I saw some marks of blood on an under flannel-waistcoat faced with blue sattin; he unbuttoned that waistcoat, and I saw a large quantity of blood on his shirt. I requested him again to let me send for a surgeon, but he answered, no; don't make a noise, don't be frighted, I am not much hurt. He walked out into the street, the prisoner followed; she appeared to be troubled, and cried: I followed him about twenty yards; then I was called back by

             is my lady's footman, I am my master's. When I came back I searched after the knife; there was nobody then in the hall; I found the knife on the hall-table, just behind where the deceased sat, rather to his right side: it was bloody; the blood appeared to be very fresh upon it; it had not been wiped.</p>
               <p>How came you not to see it before the deceased went out? - I believe the flap of his coat bid it from my sight.</p>
               <p>Was the fork on the table too? - Yes; the knife and fork belonged to the steward's room.</p>
               <p>[The knife was produced in Court.]</p>
               <p>Did the cut appear to be made with a round or sharp pointed knife? - I cannot say; it was a slanting cut.</p>
               <p>What was the prisoner? - Sometimes she sold nosegays and sometimes oysters, I believe.</p>
               <p>Was there a connection between the prisoner and the deceased? - The deceased told me, he had a connection with her, but had left off.</p>
               <p>He was not a married man, was he? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>He never had a child by her, had he? - I recollect her lying-in, and heard him say, he had a child by her.</p>
               <p>Do you know of his having any new connection? - I heard him say, since the child died, he never would have any more connection with her.</p>
               <p>Did you know how long the child has been dead? - I cannot say with any degree of certainty.</p>
               <p>Do you know of his keeping company with any woman at this time? - I have heard him say, that since he left this woman he went to see another, and that this woman was very jealous of him, and he could never have any peace wherever he was, she was always haunting him about.</p>
               <p>Do you think this was the effect of her jealousy? - I do think it was such; for I have heard her threaten the deceased.</p>
               <p>How long before this happened? - I think the space of two or three months; it was at the house of

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon at St. George's hospital: the deceased was brought to the hospital on Friday night; he was delivered to my cure; one of the apothecary's people saw him first; I saw Pearce in the ward afterwards; he came to enquire about him.</p>
               <p>PEARCE. I went to see him; he was under that gentleman's care.</p>
               <p>GRIFFITHS. I saw the deceased about seven or eight at night; he had a wound above the navel, it appeared to be made by a round pointed instrument; it was on the left side of the navel, about three inches deep; it passed obliquely downwards, I cannot say how broad, because a wound contracts, it was about an inch in length; I thought it mortal, as all wounds penetrating the cavity of the abdomen are generally mortal.</p>
               <p>Did any other surgeons attend? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the deceased appear to be a porter? - Yes, he had straps about him.</p>
               <p>Did he answer to any name? - Yes, that of Randal Perry.</p>
               <p>That was the man Pearce came to see? - Yes; the omentum or caul was obtruded about a handful; it was returned into the abdomen; which is frequently fatal.</p>
               <p>How soon did you despair of his life? - On Sunday morning; he died on Sunday night; every thing was done for him that was proper.</p>
               <p>Did he die of the wound? - I am certain of it; he said a woman gave him a stab with great force back handed; he said he had two children by her, and she was jealous.</p>
               <p>Did he say there was any provocation given at the time? - No, that was all he said.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was he in liquor when he was brought to the hospital? - He appeared to be so, but that appearance might be occasioned by the omentum obtruding the nerves, which is frequently the case.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say whether he had given her any provocation that day? - He said no, he had given her none; I asked particularly whether he had given her any provocation that day; he said he had given her none; that was the same night he came in.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The deceased used me very ill for a long time; when the man was gone out for the porter, there was nobody there but him and me; he gave me a kick on the hip; when the three men were on the steps, after Pearce had been in to tell me not to make a noise, he gave me a blow on the temples with his fist; I had a knife and bladebone of mutton in my hand, which I was picking; I threw the bone and knife out of my hand and said, D - n him, I would never eat with him any more; I did it without any intention to hurt him: there are the marks of his blows now.</p>
               <p>'The surgeon examined her hip and temple,</p>
               <p>'and said there was a confusion on her</p>
               <p>'hip; that by its appearance the blow might</p>
               <p>'have been given her that night; that it</p>
               <p>'appeared to be a kick, and that there did</p>
               <p>'appear to be a mark on her temple.'</p>

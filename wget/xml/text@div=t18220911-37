I found my watch at Bow-street on the Thursday following, when the prisoner was in custody.</p>

            . I am watchman of Wych-street. Watkins called Watch, at the top of the street, near Drury-lane. I came up - he said he had lost his watch, and was enquiring of the prisoner where the other woman was, who was with her. He did not appear to suspect the prisoner then. She said she would take him to the house where she was, which was the Artichoke, White Hart-yard. I asked her to describe her, and from her manner I suspected her, and said,</p>
               <p>"I must search you." I found the watch in her breast - Watkins described it before he saw it. When I first felt it in her bosom, she said it was only the bones of her stays.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Owen, and live in Wormwood-street, London-wall, in the parish, of All hallows; we keep the Ship public-house. On Thursday, the 3rd of December, I was sitting with my husband in the bar, at tea, and heard a noise over my head—It was a little after six o'clock in the evening—It was dark—I could not see a person's countenance in the open air, without some light—I heard the noise a second time; I took a candle, and went up stairs; and was astonished at finding my bed-room door unlocked—I had left it locked—I cannot say exactly the time, but I think it was about an hour before—I went up, in about two minutes after I heard the first noise—I opened the door, and saw the prisoner standing by the side of my bed, with a light proceeding just by the side of the bed, where he was—I did not know him before—I am sure he is the person—he rushed towards me—I took him by the collar, and held him; and screamed, till the people in the tap-room heard my screams, and came to my assistance—I never lost sight of him till I and said, "That is the thief; hold him safe," and he was secured by the men in the tap-room, and a officer sent for immediately—I found the lock of one of the drawers forced open, which contained property; but I lost nothing—I always kept that drawer locked, because I keep property in it—there was a mark on the wood-work of the drawer, something like a</p>

                  </hi>. I am a patrol of Bishopsgate-street. I went to Mrs. Owen's between five and six o'clock—a person of the name of Lewin came to the Watch-house, and I went there, and found the prisoner in the tap-room—It was dark—I could not see a person's countenance in the open air without the addition of some light—I searched him and found on him eleven skeleton-keys, two picklocks, one chisel, one jemmy, or crow-bar, and a lucifer-box with matches—I found in his pocket 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a pair of shoes—he had a pair of pumps on his feet—he asked me to let him exchange the pump he had on his feet for the shoes he had in his pocket, and I allowed him—this lantern was brought to me at the station-house by Lewin, quite warm.</p>

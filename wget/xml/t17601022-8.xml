               <p>Prosecutrix. This sheet and saucepan are my property; the prisoner had lock'd up the door, and went away with the key.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. About a month or six weeks.</p>

               <p>Dixon took the lodging, and afterwards us'd me very ill; and I left him in the lodgings, and all the things were in the lodgings when I went away.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. She was gone three weeks before him.</p>

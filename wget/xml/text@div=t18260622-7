               <p>JOHN ROGER RUSH. I live in the Kent-road, and have an office in Crown-court, Threadneedle-street. The prisoner was nine or ten months in my service, as groom. On the 10th of April I gave Mrs. Rush a 10l. note, to take to town with her.</p>

            . On the 10th of April, about eight o'clock in the morning, Mr. Rush gave me a 10l. note at our private house; I put it into my pocket-book, and came to town in the gig; the prisoner rode post to town; the pocket-book was safe when I was in Berner-street; I had it in my pocket; I took it out in Berner-street, to put a bill into it, and cannot say whether I then returned it to my pocket, or put it into my muff; I kept my muff in my hand; the prisoner was by the side of the gig. I got into a shop on Ludgate-hill, about two o'clock, and missed the pocket-book and note. I have not seen them since.</p>
               <p>Mr. RUSH. Mrs. RUSH came and informed me of her loss, and on the 22d of May the prisoner was going to leave my service, having had notice before; on my going to town on the 22d I told him I wanted information about a watch and seals which I had seen in his possession a few days after the 10th of April, and said I suspected he had got the note which Mrs. Rush had lost - he said, "Oh! Sir, I hope you don't suspect me;" he said he had got the watch from one Button, who lived on Snow-hill; he was in the chaise with me, and soon afterwards said Button lived in Hatton-court, Snow-hill; between twelve and one o'clock that day I went to Snow-hill, but could find no Button, nor any Hatton-court - he drove me home that afternoon - I called him in, and asked how he could deceive me in saying Button lived in Hatton-court; he then said he had told me Cock-court, and would put the horse in the chaise and drive me up to the man immediately; I told him to stop at home - I drove to Cock-court, and inquired at every house in the place, but could find no Button. In consequence of what Winsled told me I went home with a constable; I told the prisoner I would forgive him if he would confess having the note; he told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220007"></xptr>I could not compel him to confess, and he would say nothing; he left my service that night; I had asked him to let me see the watch and seals, which he did, and I refused to return them till he gave me an account where he got them. I traced the watch next day to Mr. Frodsham. He called for the watch three days afterwards - Mr. Frodsham was present, and he said he had paid Mr. Frodsham a 10l. note for it.</p>

            . I am a watch-maker, and live in Gracechurch-street. I sold this watch to the prisoner on or about the 11th of April, for four guineas - he paid me a 10l. Bank note; he called on me in about a month, to have it regulated, and asked if I had got the 10l. note, which he had paid me, for he had found it in the Park, and he should not like it to come to his master's ears - I had parted with it; I saw Mr. Rush in about a week, and afterwards saw the prisoner at his house - he said he had paid me the 10l. note, and burned the pocket-book.</p>

            . I live in Cock-court, Snow-hill. I know nobody named Button; I have lived there two years. The prisoner called on a female in the court, whose child I had the care of - she had asked me to take in a message for her; the prisoner called and told me to tell her he wished her to say her name was Button, and that her husband was a watch-maker, and she would come forward if required, and he would give her 5s. - and in order to make her understand who he was, I was to say he had treated her on boxing day, with a glass of spirits. Mr. Rush called to inquire for Button, and I told him this.</p>

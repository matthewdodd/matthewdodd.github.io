                  </hi>. I am an errand-boy to Mr. Read, a surgeon, in the New Road. On the 27th of January, between five and six o'clock, I was going down North-street, to take home some medicine, and saw the prisoner standing with about fourteen more boys—I passed them as I went, and, in my way back, the prisoner laid hold of me, and said, "Hallo, little fellow, I want a penny of you"—I said I had not one to give him—they then all laid hold of me, laid me down, kicked me behind, tied a hand<lb></lb>kerchief over my eyes, and felt in my pocket, and took out a bottle of oil and a penny-piece—they kicked me all about my back—I feel it now—I returned with a policeman, and before they saw him they said, "Hallo, little fellow, where is your bottle and your oil?"—I laid hold of the prisoner, and he ran away—the policeman ran after and caught him—the others all ran away.</p>

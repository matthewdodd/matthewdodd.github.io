                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. James Sherman Spering, a farmer at Wanstead. The prisoner was in his service. On the 28th of November, some beans were sent to Barnard Gay, the miller, by another man—the next day I sent the prisoner to the mil<lb></lb>ler's, to bring the meal back—he brought twenty-six sacks—he told me the miller had given him twenty-six—I made inquiry respecting another sack, and he told me the miller had given him an empty sack, and he took it to the stables with the horse-cloths—after a bit he brought it to me—I found there had been bean-meal in it, the same as the meal I had received—that meal was the property of my master.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a miller at Millwall, Poplar, about five miles from Wanstead. On the 28th of November I received some beans to grind—the next day the prisoner came, and I gave him twenty-six full sacks, and half a sack more—I am quite sure that the twenty-seventh sack was half full—it weighed 1 cwt. and 14 lbs., with the weight of the sack.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. It rained very hard—I stopped at the first watering place, and took this sack out, gave some to the horses, and took the re<lb></lb>mainder home with me, and gave them some there—I showed the foreman the sack—I did not say I had the empty sack from the miller.</p>

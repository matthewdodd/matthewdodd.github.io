I purchased goods at the premises of Mr. Denham, to the amount of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I paid for them either the same day, or the day after, to Thomas Denham, who gave me this receipt—on the same day I paid a fur<lb></lb>ther sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the prisoner for more goods, for which he gave me this receipt, on the same paper on which Denham had receipted the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had purchased the first parcel of the goods of the prisoner, but I paid Denham.</p>

               <p>I am a collar maker, I live at Acton , on the second of June the prosecutor sent his servant to my house for me to go with him to Norwood on some particular business, and he would serve me as much another time; I went with him to Mr. Woodstock's house, the farmer's, it was about nine or between nine and ten, Mr. Fisher asked me if I understood whether a harness had been worn or no, because he had seen one there, and he was pretty sure it was his, he was partly sure that was the word, and whilst we were disputing upon it, the servant came, and Mr. Fisher sent for me, to consult me on this harness; I never saw this harness before to take notice of it, I have seen it go past my door, this is the same harness, and it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>What is the use of a ring if applied to this harness, is not it a common thing to put these rings to harnesses? - I never saw it in my life.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that this ring is a singular thing? - Yes, I never saw it in the trade before.</p>
               <p>Is it so singular in the trade that a man may very safely swear to it? - It is quite uncommon in the trade.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You said, you had seen this harness? - I saw them go by my house.</p>
               <p>How many harnesses have you seen go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290115"></xptr> by your house to Acton ? - Only three at one time of Mr. Fisher's, some are made with rings, and some are not.</p>
               <p>If I desired you to take off the rings, would not you take them off for me? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Would not you cover it then? - I should not put it into your hands for a new harness.</p>

               <p>I was hostler to the prosecutor, my master lost on the 2d of June, on a Tuesday, a leather cart back-band and crupper, I missed it about nine in the morning; on Monday night the prisoner said to me, will you go to London tomorrow, the prisoner lives the second door from our gates, he keeps a shop there, he asked me if I went to London with the team the next day, Tuesday, I said yes, and he desired me to call him up between three and four in the morning, I called him up about half after three, and I went to London with the cart and two horses, we had only two horses, I had no occasion for this crupper; I set off about four, when I came back which was between two and three that afternoon I first missed this, I thought my master had lent it, till Wednesday morning doing the horses, I found the chains and leather were gone off, I went and told my master, he said, I must know something about it, says I, I will be upon oath it will be found out, I saw it afterwards at Mr. Woodstock's in the stable, and I saw the prisoner and the farmer that evening, I was there when he came out of the house I saw him there between eight or nine at night.</p>
               <p>Did he say anything in your hearing? - Nothing that night, I saw nothing there that night, the next morning we got up, and I went over to the farmer's with my master, and there I saw the leather cart back-band, the maid servant shewed it me, I knew it by having sweat upon it, that came from off the horse in several places, there was no other mark upon it by which I could know it; I went into the prisoner's shop on the Tuesday, when he was making a bit of a halter about eleven, and I asked him who it was for, and he said for Mr. Woodstock, that he was going to send over a horse harness there, and there was no other harness in the shop (The harness deposed to, and the crupper.) I swear to the drupper by the hole where the hinge of the crupper went through it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live about a mile from the prosecutor's, I bespoke of the prisoner a harness for one horse, he brought me a complete harness on Wednesday the first of June, I was to have a new harness, and I paid for it as such; it was brought home in the day light publickly, it laid open then on the dresser not in any brown paper, I had no doubt but it was a new harness, it laid in the kitchen which is an open room where we live.</p>
               <p>Did you see anything like the sweating of a horse on any part of them? - I did not at that time, I did not examine it minutely because I had no such thought.</p>
               <p>Was it pointed out to you the next day or did you perceive it yourself that there was any sweating of a horse upon it? - It was pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>By who? - By Mr. Fisher, I was gone to town when Mr. Croxford came.</p>
               <p>Is the harness now produced, the harness that was taken from your house? - I believe it is, it is like it, I would not go to swear to the harness, because other harnesses may be like it, I was not at home when it was taken away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fisher. I went for a warrant, and he said you must bring the harness with you, so we took the prisoner up, and I went round and fetched the harness from Mr. Woodstock's wife.</p>
               <p>Court to Woodstock. Had you any other new harness but this? - No.</p>
               <p>Fisher. I put it into a sack, and carried it to Mr. Lamb's, then Lamb gave it to Croxford, I saw it given to him.</p>
               <p>Croxford. I kept it in my possession ever since, till I brought it into Court now.</p>
               <p>Jury to Woodstock . Did you think it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290116"></xptr> sweated? - I cannot think about it, it did look as if it had been put on a horse, but I will not swear it had, and Mr. Fisher pointed out a hole in the crupper, as if it had been made to fit his buckle.</p>
               <p>Court to Croxford. What is the fair charge for these several articles? - Six shillings for that back-band, and with crupper and straps about nine shillings, the belly band two shillings and sixpence; the prisoner is a collar maker, and I have often dealt with him, I know no harm of him.</p>
               <p>Croxford. I never saw a crupper so made before, but it is possible that a collar maker for his convenience or his customers, might make such alterations as is made in that harness, the leather is put on with single thread, and the other is put on with double thread.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The man heard Mr. Woodstock speak for them.</p>
               <p>Seymour. I was present when he ordered them (looks at it) it is the same that hung up there, I know the crupper but nothing else; I am sure of it by this place, this hole, I told him, says I, Mr. Clarke, this is one that you cut out for your father.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My father lives in Essex, he spoke to me for a set of harnesses, and he did not like the crupper.</p>
               <p>Do you keep house at Southall ? - Yes, I was to make a pair of wooden hames for Mr. Woodstock , and I went in to see how forward he was, as I had not made them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who all gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Jury to the Currier. How long do you think it is since that leather was curried? - I do not think it had been curried a vast while, and might perhaps about three months, but I do not think it had been worn.</p>
               <p>Court to Currier. Can you say with any certainty, or can you not? - I can.</p>

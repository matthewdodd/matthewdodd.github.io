I am a chemist of 93, High Street, Homerton—I have known the prisoner nearly four years—on Wednesday afternoon, 12th May, about 2 o'clock, I was with the prisoner and Coleman—we first met at Mr. Newport's public-house, and after that we walked as far as the Poplar Sick Asylum—the prisoner went into the asylum and Coleman and I waited for him—when he came out we walked to the corner of Fairfoot Road—I saw a piece of paper pass from Coleman to the pri<lb></lb>soner, I did not see what it was, it was like a cheque, it was folded—the prisoner opened it in my presence, looked at it and put it into his pocket—he then left us and went towards Mr. Newport's—he returned in about twenty minutes and joined us—he said something to Coleman, expressing that it was all right—Coleman did not make any answer—wo went into a public-house in Camberwell Road and had a glass of rum—Coleman said he had some business with the prisoner and I then left them—I can't say the exact words he used, I believe it was "Come along Charlie, wo want to talk over this affair for an hour or two."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). On Thursday night, 13th May, I saw the prisoner in the parlour of the Duke of Edinburgh—I told him I was a detective officer—I showed him this cheque, and asked him where he got it from; he hesitated, and then said he got it from Mr. Coleman, of 3, Ravensworth Terrace, Fulham—I asked him if he would go with me to Mr. Coleman—he said he could not go that night, it was toe<lb></lb>late—it was about 9 o'clock or a little after—I then took him to Bow Lane station—next morning I went to 3, Ravensworth Terrace, and the found Coleman—he accompanied me to the City, to Mr. Mullens office—he did not go to the police court—the hearing took place on the 14th—prior to that I had searched the prisoner, and found on him this printed paper marked "B"—before the Lord Mayor the prisoner called attention to that piper, and requested its production, and he said it was Coleman's writing,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187506050020"></xptr>
               <p>and if it was compared with the cheque, it would be seen it was the same writing, the signature—Coleman did not attend the Court—I served a summons at his house—I did not see him—a warrant was granted for his apprehension; I traced him as far as Hull, and there lost him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> What the prisoner said was that the body of the cheque was like Coleman's writing—I arrested the prisoner at Mr. Newport's, the very place where he had changed the cheque—when I asked him to go to Coleman's, he said it was too late, he should not be able to get back that night—he has given me as much information about Coleman as he possibly could—I saw Coleman on the following morning, after I had taken the prisoner—I believed at that time that the cheque was a forgery, and the prisoner had told me that he got it from Coleman—Coleman went with me to the solicitor's office; he said he never gave Wolf the cheque—I did not think there was sufficient to detain him at that time—I left him with Mr. Mullens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I only knew from what Wolf told me, that he had got it from Coleman—it was at the examination after that that the prisoner asked for the production of this paper—I never saw Coleman afterwards.</p>

I am solicitor to the bankers' association, and am conducting this prosecution—about 10 o'clock on the morning of 14th May, Coleman came to my office with Flinster; that was before the examination at the Mansion House—I conducted the case there against Wolf—I looked for Coleman there, but he did not appear—the prisoner asked for the pro<lb></lb>duction of this paper B, and said that anyone who saw it would see at once that the cheque was in the same handwriting, and he said it was Coleman's—at that time I had not found Mr. Miller—the prisoner said at the examination that the cheque had been given to him in the presence of another person—I told Flinster to ascertain who that was, and then we found Miller.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Griffith Humphry, of Oxford-street, linen-draper. I missed this flannel a little before four o'clock on the 26th of January, from near the door—I went to the station, and found it there, half an hour after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to a gentleman in Oxford-street. I was in the shop, serving a customer—I pulled out a handkerchief, and did not know the price—I went to my master, who was at the door, and saw him fix his eyes on the prisoner, who was carrying the flannel—he went and asked him where he got it—he threw it down, and ran off—I ran after him—I was going to take him, and the officer took him. (Michael Lane, of Frederick-court, Clerkenwell, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

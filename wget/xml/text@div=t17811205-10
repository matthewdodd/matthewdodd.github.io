             deposed to the same effect, but was positive as to that piece being there when he shewed the lawns to her, and the reason of not stopping her, was, they did not miss it before the prisoner was gone, the last time that she came there, three times in all, might be in the shop half an hour.</p>
               <p>The prisoner's defence was, she went there to buy a neckcloth for a postilion, her husband's fellow servant, that she did look at things and might be there half an hour in all, that she went and bought two bunches of turnips and left them there, and went to buy other things and then went back for her turnips; and why did not they take her then; instead of which they made her a bow, and asked her whether she would buy a gown of them? Said her witnesses had been there all day waiting, but were tired of staying so long, and were gone.</p>
               <p>Foreman of the Jury. Mr. Recorder, the gentlemen of the jury are of opinion, they would not give you the trouble to sum up the evidence, as they think there is nothing to affect the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. I will state what the evidence is; you will draw the proper inferences from it. The prisoner was indicted for stealing ten yards of lawn, value 37 s. privately in the shop of BLANCHARD COWARD: the value being above five shillings, privately in the shop, makes it a capital offence.</p>
               <p>After Mr. Recorder had summed up the evidence, the jury brought in their verdict <rs id="t17811205-10-verdict57" type="verdictDescription">

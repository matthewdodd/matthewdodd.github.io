            ; last Monday night about twelve o'clock, I heard a great lumbering in the stable, I went up to the door, and it was wide open, it was shut in the evening, and was latched, not locked; I stopped there a minute or two, I heard nothing; I shut the door, and the window was broke by a person attempting to get out, and presently the prisoner looked through the window; but when I went to the window he drew back and came out at the door, I took him in the yard against the house: I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know any thing about the shed that adjoins to the barn, was that open? - That was broke open, I nailed it up myself; and there was about half a bushel of potatoes put into a bag, they were not carried off, they were laid on the outside of the door: after I had taken the prisoner and put him into a house, I saw a shovel, and pick-axe, and spade laying at the door, they used to lay behind the door; the prisoner said, he only got into the stable for a lodging; I asked him whether he broke open the door, he did not deny it, but said, he got in for a night's lodging.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did this man work for your master? - Last summer in hay-making, I know no more of him than that.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did he lay in the house, or any whereabout the house when he made the hay? - No, he lives about two fathom off, at Smallberry-Green.</p>

About five o'clock in the afternoon, on the 13th of December, I missed a tea-spoon from the tea-board - I ran up stairs, and missed two tea-spoons and a pair of sugar-tongs off the drawers - they were all safe on the 11th; I asked if she had not mislaid them - she said, "Do you mean to say I have got them?" I said, No, we could not find them; she said she would go away; I sent for one Marks; I saw the prisoner take a key from her bosom and put it under the ashes - I found it would open my drawers where the spoons were kept.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did she not conduct herself well? A. Yes, very well - I never asked her to pawn any thing for me; she stood by the cupboard when I missed the spoon; I was sober, and had not been drinking except at dinner - I might have had a glass of gin in the morning; I swear I did not give her the spoons to pawn; I swear I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you was not at a public-house drinking gin from twelve to seven o'clock? A. I was not.</p>

            . I live at Pentonville. On the 13th of December, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon the prisoner brought me three tea-spoons and a pair of sugar tongs, to pawn for her; she said she was in distress and wanted a pair of shoes and stockings - I had not an opportunity to pawn them, and on Friday I heard she was in custody; I took the spoons to Humphreys.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew her before? A. Yes; there was no concealment about it - she said she lived at Humpreys.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. About seven o'clock; the prisoner said she knew nothing about it; not that she had been desired to pawn them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The day before this happened, she was very drunk indeed, and on this day she told me to pawn these spoons in my own name, unknown to her husband; we went to several public-houses, and she sent me out for several glasses of rum.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 203.) On the morning of the 13th of Sept., about a quarter past five o'clock, I went outside the prose<lb></lb>cutor's garden—I found a quantity of peaches and nectarines tied up in an apron, and a handkerchief with apples concealed in some nettles—I let them remain and watched them; and about six, the prisoner came over a fence between five and six feet high, came towards them, and lifted the bundle up—it could not be seen from the other side of the fence—he lifted the bundle of peaches and nectarines with one hand, and the bundle with the apples in the other—my brother constable and I secured him—I asked what he did there—he said, "You have got me at last;" and on his person were found one peach and part of another—the bundles were in the rear of a cart-shed—I had received information which led me to find them there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener at Wimbledon, near the church. On the 12th of Sept. I packed up some peaches and nectarines with scarlet bean leaves, and left them in the cart-shed ready to go to London—there was some paper among them—I have seen those found on the prisoner—they had scarlet bean leaves and paper—they had all the same appearance as mine—I do not know how to swear to the fruit or leaves—I missed a quantity from my shed—those found on the prisoner make up the quantity as near as I can judge—I believe them to be mine.</p>

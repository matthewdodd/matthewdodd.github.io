            . I work at Mrs. Read's. On Saturday the 1st of November, about 7 at night, it was quite dark, I was standing upon the threshold of the door; I heard something crack: I looked on the outside, and saw the parlour window shoved about half way up. I cried out, Thieves. Eliz. Bedford said, she saw a man get out at the window. I looked and saw him too.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man?</p>
               <p>Ray. I am sure the prisoner is the man. He ran down the street, and I followed about 20 yards; but I did not see him stop'd. I do not know how he was taken. He was brought to the door about an hour afterwards, to ask me, If he was the man. I said it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched?</p>
               <p>Ray. I do not remember he was. There was a capuchin, somelace, and a tea-pot missing. The prisoner was carried to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. By what do you know him to be the prisoner? You say it was dark.</p>
               <p>Ray. I saw him walk up and down the street several times that evening before, with another man. He was dressed in a sort of a claret colour'd coat, a red waistcoat, and white wig.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see another man with him, when he was getting out at the window?</p>
               <p>Ray. I did; he stood at the window to receive the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain this is the man?</p>
               <p>Ray. I have no doubt about it; I am quite certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window fastened down?</p>
               <p>Ray. It used to be fastened; but I do not know that it was then</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was shut down?</p>
               <p>Ray. I am sure it was; for we have things hung at the window to shew what we sell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stand near the window the man got out at?</p>
               <p>Ray. I stood on the outside, on the threshold: there were two sashes; he got out at that farthest off from me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you heard something crack. What was that?</p>
               <p>Ray. That was a looking-glass in the room; the cord was cut, and the top of the glass turned downwards. They had not time to take that away.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. How far was you from the window, when you saw me, as you say, come out ?</p>
               <p>Ray. I was at the end of the window, at the door. The window goes out with a sort of a bulk from the threshold of the door; and there is about the breadth of a large shutter, which parts the two sashes.</p>
               <p>Q. How large is the room in which these two windows are?</p>
               <p>Ray. It is not very large.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a lamp at the door.</p>
               <p>Ray. No; but there is one opposite our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you observe the prisoner's face ?</p>
               <p>Ray. He got away so quick that I could not. I saw his cloaths as I ran after him, and as he got out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you did not see his face, pray what do you know him by ?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040036"></xptr>Ray. By his cloaths, his height, his shape, his make, and his wig.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he walk'd by the door, did you see his face?</p>
               <p>Ray. Yes, I did several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the same man, by his face, you saw that afternoon?</p>
               <p>Ray. Yes, I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask her another question.</p>
               <p>Court. You seem to hurt yourself by your questions. You had better leave it to your council.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would only ask her. At the same time she saw me come out at the window, whether there was any body with her?</p>
               <p>Ray. There was nobody with me. I saw a man standing on the outside of the window, as I said before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same man you saw with the prisoner in the evening?</p>
               <p>Ray. I think it was the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that man?</p>
               <p>Ray. He went away presently after I came to the door. He had a light coloured furtout coat on.</p>

            . I live next door to Mr. Read. Upon Alhallows day at night, about seven o'clock, I had done my business, and was sitting down, minding my mistress's shop. The last witness was standing at the bulk, at her mistress's door. She call'd to me and said, Pray Betty come out, for I believe there is a man in our parlour, robbing us. I told my mistress. What! she said, and ran out in a great surprise; and saw a man shuffle himself from off the seat of the window; but, it being dark, I cannot swear to him, nor to the colour of his cloaths. He jump'd from the window, and ran to the opposite side of the way, towards Cripplegate. I call'd stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Whether I had a white wig on or no?</p>

            . On the 1st of November, about 7 o'clock, as I was coming down Jewin-Street, I heard the cry of Stop thief. A man stood by me. I turned my head round, and saw a window open, and directly a man came running by me, as fast as he could. I ran after him, and took him at the first butcher's shop, near Cripplegate church.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man ever out of your sight till you took him.</p>
               <p>Hughes. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Hughes. There came another man to my assistance. We told him there was an outcry of thieves, and he must go back with us. He said he would not, but he would go with us into a publick house. We brought him by the church, and when he came to the butcher's shop he pull'd out his watch, and look'd at it by the light there, and said I'll make you pay for detaining me, and that he'd go back with us; but when we got to Jewin-Street end he ran down Redcross-Street, and down the Bowling-Alley, and got over same pretty high pales. I ran to the door that belongs to the yard, and told the people there was a thief backwards [the prisoner in getting over the pales lost his hat.] The people let me in; then I saw the man run up a long narrow nook in the yard. I got hold of the stump of a birch broom, but was afraid he might have something about him to do me a mischief, if I followed him there in the dark. I went on, and a man followed me. Then he got over some other pales. I heard the pales break. I look'd over where the pales were broken; there I saw him lie close under the pales; it is an old ruinated house. I said I was afraid to get over, fearing a dog. There was a link gone for; we cut the link in pieces, and lighted them up, and hunted about, but could not find him; then we gave him over; and in about a quarter of an hour after I heard he was taken, and in Barbican watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dress'd?</p>
               <p>Hughes. He was in a light wig, and a chocolate colour'd coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the other man that was with you?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I don't know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that man's face you took near the butcher's shop?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I did, and to the best of my knowledge the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first lose sight of that man ?</p>
               <p>Hughes. When he was lying under the pales in the Bowling-Alley, when I said I was afraid of a dog; then the prisoner started up, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was the prisoner taken?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I believe it was very near seven o'clock when I took the man I suppose to be him; and I heard he was in the watch-house about a quarter of an hour after. When I heard a man was taken, I went to the watch-house; there was the prisoner without his hat, and a sort of a white cut wig, such I had seen on the man before. I took him to be the same man I had taken before in the street.</p>

            . I live in Whitecross-Street. We had an alarm of a man coming over the pales into our yard. My mistress sent for me; I came. She told me to go and see if I could see any body; I went and look'd about, but saw no body. In about half an hour after a child said there is a man coming out of an empty house. The man ran as soon as he heard the child say so. I saw him. He ran up some part of Whitecross-Street, and down Beech-Lane, and into Redcross-Street; and either by knocking himself against a post, or by his foot slipping, I don't know which, he fell down; I went and took hold of him, and brought him to Mr. Read's house; and there the young woman said that was the man that she saw get out at the window. Then we carried him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the Bowling-Alley was it where you first saw him?</p>

            . I live in Russel-Street, Convent-Garden, in King's Court, backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a housekeeper ?</p>
               <p>Biggs. I am. The prisoner has lodg'd with me going on about four months.</p>

               <p>Court. 'Tis impossible what you have said should be true, because he was taken up at a distance from that place before the time you mention. Was it on a Saturday, or any other day?</p>

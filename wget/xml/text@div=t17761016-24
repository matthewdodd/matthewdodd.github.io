               <p>Was any body with you? - Only my own child, which is about seven years old; I endeavoured to fasten my door; as I pushed the door I felt them pushing the door against my face; I saw a great light, I heard many feet, I turned to go into bed again and there was a man close behind me, when I got into bed he covered the cloaths over my head.</p>

               <p>You did not distinguish that man that followed you? - I did not see either of them; the man spoke to me, I begged of him not to use me ill; he said he would not, and bid me lie still; that man asked me how many maid servants we had? I told him one; he asked me where she lay, which I likewise told him; in a little while after that I heard my uncle cry out, murder.</p>
               <p>Was this man in the room all the while? - Yes; as far as I can guess by his talking to me; then more people entered the room, I saw none of them because I still kept under the cloaths; they brought the maid down and made her get into my bed; when I heard my uncle cry murder three times, I begged they would not use my uncle ill; the man promised that they would not, but money they wanted, and money they must have; he asked me where the money was kept? I told them my uncle was a very close man, and I did not know where he put his money; they all but one man left the room, and I did not hear any thing of them for some time; they came into my room a second time and searched my drawers; they took a canvas bag out of my bureau with half crowns and other pieces to the amount of 8 l. they are not mentioned in the indictment; then they went into the back room, and broke open and searched all my boxes: my lord, I forgot one thing; just after my maid came into the room, I saw that my watch was gone from my bed; the man that stood by my bed had taken it; I had desired them before not to take my watch, and he promised me he would not, but he did; after they had been searching some time I heard a great noise in my uncle's room; I again begged that they would not hurt him, for he was an old man; the man told me they were only a tying of him; a voice in the passage asked us if we lay still, the man had stept out of the room at that time; I said we did; they said, if we put our heads out at window they would blow our brains out; they endeavoured then to lock me into the room, they fastened the door between my room and my uncle's, but I pushed the bolt of my own door, which prevented its shutting; they turned the lock and left it so, then they left the house; a very few minutes after they went my uncle called for assistance; I went to him, his hands and legs were tied so tight I could only get in the points of the scissars to cut them; I found his head was very much cut and bruised, and he had lost a great deal of blood; I gave information at Sir

               <p>Then you saw nothing further, did you? - No; I heard my master call out; I heard them come and search the drawers, but I saw nothing; after they were gone I went to fetch a candle, and Mrs. Dicker in the mean time got my master untied; it was almost three when they left the house.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in Brentford is your master's house? - The first house on the right hand from Kew-bridge.</p>

               <p>Did you ever hear any thing of any money? - I heard of the shilling; I stood in the room behind Mrs. Dicker when she took it; I heard Mrs. Dicker say, here is a very remarkable shilling, and Mr. Bean said, don't shew it me for I cannot see.</p>
               <p>How long was this before the house was robbed? - A very little while, I cannot say how long.</p>
               <p>Did any of you recollect it? - Yes; my mistress when she heard there was a remarkable shilling found said, that she should know it; if it was Mr. Bean's shilling, she said there was a name on one side and three letters on the other; I do not remember that she said what the name was at that time.</p>

               <p>When was this? - We received it on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>That is near Brentford? - Yes; I went on the Monday morning, the 9th I think it was, in the left hand room up one pair of stairs was one Harris, and in the right hand room was the prisoner in bed.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning was this? - When we got there it was near six; after we had searched his cloaths we were willing to secure him before we did any thing; he was obstreperous and knocked one of the officers down, he was knocked down and then secured; in his fob I found a piece of string, I pulled it out, there was a piece of lead at the end of it; in his breeches pocket I found nine shillings; one being marked, the magistrate ordered it to be kept and the rest delivered to him again; the shilling that has been produced here is the marked shilling I found upon him; in the side-pocket of his breeches were these six picklock keys (producing them); in his coat pocket I found this cord with a piece of lead at the end of it about a pound weight, which would knock any body down (producing it); in the same pocket, I believe, there were eight or nine, or a dozen balls, besides gunpowder; in the closet which he wanted to make to, I found three pistols (producing them); one was loaded with three balls, another with two, the other pistol was not loaded; in the same closet I found a bunch of picklock keys, (producing them); this is the contents of the two pistols (producing the charge as drawn).</p>

               <p>(The piece of brass found in Mr. Bean's room, which was the guard of a pistol, did not appear to belong to any of the pistols produced.) And here are the rest of the things (producing them); I can say nothing further.</p>

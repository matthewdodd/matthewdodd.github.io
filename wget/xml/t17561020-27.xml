               <p>Benjamin Skingle. I live at Mr. Chavat and Limber's, in Crispin-Street, Spitalfields, who are in the handkerchief trade; on the 22d of September we lost a dozen of silk and cotton handkerchiefs out of our warehouse.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175610200015"></xptr>Q. What were they worth?</p>
               <p>Skingle. Twenty-four shillings; they were taken off the counter behind the door. I had sold them to a person but about half an hour before I missed them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you miss them?</p>
               <p>Skingle. I missed them about three in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the prisoner do business in your warehouse?</p>
               <p>Skingle. No, he used to do business at the printer's.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he there?</p>
               <p>Skingle. He came to get a petition sign'd, and I bid him stay a little; he went out to a publick house, but did not come back: This was a little before two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take them?</p>
               <p>Skingle. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they ever found again ?</p>
               <p>Skingle. No, they were not; he was taken up, and being charged with them confessed he took them, before Peter Turquend.</p>

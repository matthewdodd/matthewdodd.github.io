On 18th February I was housekeeper at the Ship, Ken<lb></lb>nington Road; Mr. South is the manager—between 9 and 10 o'clook that night I served the prisoner with some whiskey cold and some stout and mild ale—they came to 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.——he gave me a bad florin—I said "This is bad. I wonder you could not see it before you tendered it"—I passed it to Mr. South, who broke it, and said "Have you any "more about you of that sort—he pulled out some odd silver, and. I detected another one, which Mr. South broke also—some of the pieces were given to the prisoner and some to the constable—after the second florin was broken the prisoner went away; he was not sober—he returned in an hour and insisted that the money was good—he was not sober then, and demanded to see the man who broke the coins—Mr. South was called, and the prisoner was given in custody.</p>

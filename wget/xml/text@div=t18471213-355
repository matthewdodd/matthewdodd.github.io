                  </hi> I am a clerk in the Bank of England. On Wednesday, 1st Dec., about one o'clock in the day, I was at the Dudley Arms, Paddington, and saw the prisoner—I had nineteen sovereigns, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, some silver, and two memorandums—I had some dinner, and as Grimes was out of work I thought he might be hungry, and I gave him some—we then all three had some-thing to drink, and then left, and went to another public-house, and had more to drink, for a about ten minutes—Grimes then said, "If you were to have a game at skittles it would do your cold good; you would get into a perspiration, and work that hoarseness off—we played, and had more drink—I was rather the worse for what I had—they told me I wanted shaving very badly—I asked where there was a hairdresser's shop—they showed me one—we went in—I sat down and fell asleep—I believe the hairdresser a woke me—I did not see the prisoners then—I examined my pockets, and my nineteen sovereigns, the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and the two memorandums were gone—they were buttoned up safe when I was within twenty yards of the shop—I went into the road, and saw Collins—he said, "Where is my mate?"—I said, "Where is my money that you robbed me of; I have half a mind to knock your d—d head off"—he said he did not know anything of it, he had not robbed me—I afterwards saw my memorandums produced by the policeman—these are them.</p>

I saw the prisoner there, between one and two o'clock—I saw Turner there—the three were drinking rum and water at the bar—they staid about half an hour—while Turner was there, I saw a Bank-note in his hand—I could not tell the amount—he put it into his pocket, and they all left together—Grimes came back to the bar in about an hour, and called for a glass of rum and water—a man joined him, (not Collins,) and they had a quartern of rum—Grimes called for "Pickwick"—he afterwards said, "It is not often I go to work; when I do, I like to work for something"—while he was drinking the policeman came and took him.</p>

                  </hi> I am a hair-dresser at White Lion-passage, about five minutes' walk from the Dudley Arms. I knew Grimes by his coming to the shop on the Sunday morning before this robbery—on 1st Dec. Turner and the prisoners came in—Turner appeared half drunk, the prisoners were very nearly sober—they asked me to shave Turner—I was engaged, and said I would in a few minutes—Turner sat down, and fell asleep—Grimes sat near him, and seemed asleep too—Collins was on the other side of the shop, reading a newspaper—I was obliged to go up stairs for hot water—I was away about three minutes—when I came back I told Grimes to wake Turner up—he said, "Let him sleep, it will do him good"—I made them wake him up—they</p>

On Wednesday, 1st Dec., Grimes came to my master's shop, between two and three o'clock, I think it might have been—he looked out cap, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a handkerchief, which name to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he threw down a sovereign, then took it up, and threw down a half-sovereign—a person went for the change; and while he was gone, he took a handkerchief from hi neck, and took from his pocket a number of sovereigns—I should think, from the bulk of them, there were twelve or fourteen, or more—he tied them up in the handkerchief, and shortly afterwards left the shop—I asked him if it was wages for work he had done, and told him to take care of them—he said he was going to place them in some one's hands—I have since seen a cap and handkerchief, which I believe are what I sold him—I believe this is the handkerchief he had round his neck, and he spread on the counter.</p>

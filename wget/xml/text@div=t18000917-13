An old man that works there; upon that being said, Barrett went out; when he came in again, they took the side of bacon from under the wrapper and cut it through the middle; then they sent Barrett back again to tell him they were going to toss for another, Barrett then went back again; Wall then said to Neatt, here, take your whack, meaning his share, and he took one half under his smock frock; Wall put the other half under his, Neatt went foremost, and Barrett said to Neatt, how does your score stand now.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that mean? - A. About what they were tossing for; Penn was within hearing; I then jumped out, and ran before them, says I, I will tell, you how your score stands, if you do not put down the bacon I will score your head, I had a cutlass in my hand; Neatt was very civil, and laid it down before my feet, from under his smock frock; Wall put his down from under his smock frock, upon the wrapper from which he had taken it, and said, this is the first time, I am not off the premises, and you shall not hurt me now; Barrett came towards the door, I shoved him in; says I, you are all concerned, if you attempt to get away I will blow your brains out; I then sent for Mr. Milward, and they were taken before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Mason—on Saturday 29th, I went to the General Abercrombie public-house, Friar Street, with Mary Ben<lb></lb>ton, the deceased—the prisoners were there and Benton said to Richards, "I could do very well with 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I had stolen from me"—she did not say "that you stole," but Newberry said, "And you accuse my mother of taking it," and struck her very juicily at the side of her head or in front of her face—she then put her child on the floor and caught hold of Benton, and they fell together—I assisted Benton up, and then Richards struck her, I can't say where, and she fell backwards—we were ordered out, but Benton and I remained in; we left together and went over to the Bell; she seemed right enough, but she complained of her head next day to me, and said it was very bad—she was sober on the Saturday night, but she had had a little drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 17, Blunt Street—I Was in the General Abercrombie, the deceased was there when I went in; she said to Mrs. Newberry and her mother that they were drinking at her ex<lb></lb>pense with the money they had bested her of—Newberry said, "If you are talking to my mother, I am talking to you; you accuse my mother of robbing you of the money?"—Mrs. Benton said, "I was not talking to you, I was talking to your mother," and she put the baby down and struck her on her face with her hand or her fist, they struggled and fell—I saw no hair in Newberry's hand—they were taken up, and when they were trying to sit Mrs. Benton on a seat, Richards reached across and hit her on the nose, but it only knocked her on to the seat—I did not see Benton kick anybody—I saw her next on the Monday afternoon at 3.45 in her own room, with her hands up to her head—she appeared suffering—they were all sober.</p>

On 1st April I was called to the de<lb></lb>ceased, and found her unconscious and incapable of being aroused—her breathing and pulse was slow—there were a bruise at the back of her head, and handfuls of hair were missing which had been torn out from the roots—two places, about the size of a crown-piece, were almost bald—I saw her three times, and she died the next day from blood being between the skull. and the brain—I made a post-mortem examination—violence of the sort described would account for what I saw, but I cannot say whether it was caused by a fall on the back of her head or a blow—the effusion of blood could only arise from violence, not from any internal cause.</p>

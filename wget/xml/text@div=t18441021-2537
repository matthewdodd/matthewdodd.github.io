                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Wilson; he is a seafaring man; I live at Mill-wall, in the parish of Poplar. Last Saturday night three weeks I went to a raffle, about nine o'clock, at a beer-shop right oppo<lb></lb>site where I live—the prisoner Michael Cocklin and his wife were in the beer<lb></lb>shop, and several other persons—a man of the name of Carvell, who was there, went to the bar and brought a pot of beer into the tap-room—he gave it to me to drink out of—I drank out of it, and put it on the table—Michael Cocklin drank out of the pot, and likewise his wife—there was some of the company sat at the opposite table, I took the pot of beer, and drank to a young man who sat at the opposite table, and 1 handed the pot to another young man—Michael Cocklin said, "Hallo, young woman, where are you going with that beer?"or "What are you doing? bring that beer back, it is not yours"—I said, "It is not yours, it is Mr. Carvell's pot of beer, for he just gave it to me"—Michael Cocklin said, "You are a liar, you b—w—; it is mine, I have just paid for it"—my mother, hearing the noise, came in</p>

               <p>to see what was the matter, and Michael Cocklin hit her a stroke with his fist in the lip—it looked as if there was a bit right out of it—the doctor sewed it up—my mother and I then came home directly—then all the pri<lb></lb>soners, soners, and a man named Ragan, came throwing stone at our door and win<lb></lb>dows, and calling names—I told my sister to go for a policeman, and she did—after that my father opened the door, to know what they wanted at that hour, and as soon as he opened the door, all the prisoners, and the other man, rushed in—they got us out before our door, and Michael Cocklin hit my mother in both her eyes—he then caught hold of me by the hair of my head, and pulled me by my hair—then Dennis Mahony hit my mother a stroke with his fist, and he pulled me by my hair, and so did Margaret Mahony—I saw my mother down, and Margaret Mabony down upon her, close by the step of our door—I then saw Dennis Mahony with a fire-shovel in his hand—I do not know whether he took it from our house or not, but we missed ours the next day—I then saw William Cronin hit my father, and throw him down on the grating that is beneath our window—Ellen Cronin hit me on the head with a piece of stick that looked like a piece of railing—she then hit my mother, and cut her head with it—she then dropped the piece of railing, and took a piece of stone or a piece of brick, and kept hammering my mother on the head with it—my mother was cut in three different places on the head.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Mill-wall. I am fifteen years old, and go to school. On Saturday night, the 28th of Sept., I heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at Mill-wall, close by where I live—I was at home, and I came out—I saw Wilson, but I did not see anything in her hand—Mrs. Flynn had an iron poker in her hand, and I saw her hit Ellen Cronin with it—I saw Mrs. Ragan there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Mrs. Ragan by at the time you saw Flynn with the poker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see her at that time—I staid till it was over, and the policeman came and took them away—I did not see Wilson strike Dennis Mahoney at all—I saw Flynn with the fire-shovel, and Dennis Mahoney tock it from her—she had the shovel or poker in one hand—she went into her own house—I have not seen her since—I know the prisoners—I have never seen them do anything out of the way, and never heard of their getting into any disturbance.</p>

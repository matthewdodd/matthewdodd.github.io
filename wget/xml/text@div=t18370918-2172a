                  </hi>. I am a mariner, and belong to the <hi rend="italic">Exchange</hi> of St. Ives. On the 28th of August she was lying in Alderman's tier—I had been at Waterford, and there by accident I met the prisoner—I took her on board, and she was three weeks on board—I had some business on shore, and left her the key of the state room—I returned at half-past eleven o'clock at night, and then she was gone, and the state room was locked—I waited, and she did not come—I dropped asleep, and the next morning I broke open the door and found my drawers were all open, and this property and some Irish notes gone—I heard she had gone off for Cork—I came to London, and found her lodgings, and went for an officer and found this property in her box—one of my towels has my name on it—the other has not.</p>

             I am a patrol of St. Bolthop Aldgate. On the 7th of November, about half past seven, I stopped that prisoner in East Smithfield, he was carrying the tea in a leaden chest; he had taken the wooden chest off it. I asked him where he got it from, he was carrying it on his shoulder. He said he brought it from the Lord Nelson, a ship, laying off the London Dock, going out, laying off the London Dock; he said he was going to take it to the Captains house, I put the tea in the watch-house, and sent my two partners with him, to find out the Captains house. My partners came back very soon, with the prisoner. The tea remained with me, he told me, that he had stolen it. My partner told me so, I asked the prisoner where he had got it from, he said he had stolen it from the Lord Nelson, We went to see if there was any such ship there was no such ship laid there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell him that you could find no such ship - A. Yes; then he told us he stole it from a wharf, he did not tell me what the name of the wharf was. I asked him if I took him with me, could he find the wharf; he said yes. I took him with me, in company with

            , and Turnbridge the officer he shewed me Mr. Hoare's wharf at St. John's, Wapping. I have had the tea ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the case - A. Yes, we found the case that same night, about three hundred yards from where he had stolen it, from Hoare's wharf. We found it between some stones, where they are ma- ing an entrance to the London Dock. The prisoner shewed me the place where he put the chest,</p>

            . I am a patrol. After Simmons had stopped the prisoner, I went to find out the Captain the owner of the tea; I was sent by the other patrol. I questioned the prisoner going along where he got the tea; he still said he got it from the Lord Nelson laying off the London Dock quay. I asked him where the Captains house was; he said is was no use flattering me; he had stolen it; that is all he said to me. I went down to Wapping to find the ship, the Lord Nelson, I could find no such ship in the dock.</p>
               <p>JOHN TURNBRIDGE. I am a constable. I went to the watchhouse and found this prisoner in custody; I asked him where he got the tea; he said he did not know the name of the place, he would shew me, I took him with me and the two patrols. He shewed me Hoare's wharf, that is in Wapping; he afterwards shewed me where the chest was between some stones at the bottom of Nightingale-lane, where they are making a new opening to the Dock, I produce the tea,</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that chest do you know any thing of it - A. Yes, there is my mark on it; It is my marking I marked it and sent it by a man to Hoare's wharf he brought me back a receipt signed by Mr. Hoare's clerk. This marking shews that I sent it to the wharf. I never saw it at the wharf; I saw it before, and sent it there; I knew It was there, by having the receipt back.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know the quantity do you - A Yes twenty nine pound weight, it is about seven shillings the pound; here is the permit in the chest which specifies the quantity; it was given to a man of the name of Garrett of Aberdeen; this was in the chest and was among the stones.</p>
               <p>John Bull. I found the permit between the stones<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300053"></xptr>where the chest was.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr Hoare. Does the Aberdeen vessel go from your wharf - A. Yes; the chest of tea answers to the permit the gross weight; the tea is of more value then I have set upon it. I have set upon it seven pounds for the loss of it, we should have been answerable for it. It was through the prisoner we found it out; having the case knocked off, although he was stopped with it, we had nothing to prove it.</p>

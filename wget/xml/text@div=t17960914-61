               <p>I saw the prisoner at the bar about half past seven o'clock, with the two children in Ray-street, Clerkenwell; she was very much in liquor; she was very little able to take care of them; I was afraid she would hurt them; I offered to carry one of them home; she said she had no home; that her husband was dead, and she was obliged to get her bread how she could; she told me they were her children, and she stooped down and pretended to give the youngest suck; I blamed her for offering to suckle it, because she had told me she had weaned it a fortnight; I was with her two hours; she told me she lived in Holborn, at No. 5, Titchborne-court; and when it got late she would not go any where with me; I learned where the children belonged; a boy took one of them home, and came back for the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this was the woman that had the two children? - A. Yes.</p>

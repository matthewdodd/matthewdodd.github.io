                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker and jeweller, of 5, Barbican—on Saturday afternoon, 15th December, the prisoner came into my shop—I did not know him before—he wanted to look at some signet rings; he said he wanted three of a sort—I showed him a tray—he said there were none there to suit him—I showed him four more by themselves—he selected one from them—he then said he thought there were some more in the window that he could select from—I took out four more for him, and there was another he thought would suit him—he then got me to look out another from the window, and while my back was turned to get the ring, he abstracted one of the others—I did not see him do it, but when I came back from the window, I looked at the rings that had been placed before him, and one was missing—I immediately asked him for it—he said he knew nothing at all about it, that he was a respectable man, and I was quite mistaken—I said I knew I was not mistaken, I was as positive that he had got one as possible, for there was one missing, and unless I knew more of him than I did, I Should give him into custody for stealing it, which I did; but during the interim when I went to the door to look for a policeman, he tried to throw me down and get away, but I held him tight till a policeman came—there was a lady in the shop at the time, who had come in before the prisoner—she was waiting for a watch, I was altering the regulator for her, but I left her to serve him—after the prisoner was taken away, I searched the shop and in a corner I found these two brass rings, imitation wedding-rings, and these pieces of paper all bitten and torn up—I put them together, and it is, a bill of some goods to the amount of 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the missing ring was not found</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101070004"></xptr>
               <p>—I think he swallowed it, for he had a box of oil capsules in his pocket; or else in the struggle to get away, he must have thrown it away—I am quite satisfied that there was a ring missing—the value of it was 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner spoke English quite well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that I threw you down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I am lame—a finger would not knock me down; I had hold of the door<lb></lb>post, and I held tight hold of you—the woman who was in the shop had not the same opportunity of stealing the ring as you had—she came in before you, and waited after you were gone—I knew her well; she is a respectable person in the neighbourhood—she was not as near the rings as you were she could have reached them if she had liked—the woman was not standing nearer to the rings than you were—I was on the right, then the woman, and then you—the rings were nearer to you, especially the last lot that I took out of the window—I did not take the ring up in my hands and put it in the window, or anywhere else.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 284). I was called to the shop of last witness, and took the prisoner into custody—I searched him and found on him two glass saucers, a brass pin which he wore in his scarf, this brass Albert chain which he wore in his waistcoat, and two brass imitation wedding-rings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this bill for 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was partly destroyed by the prisoner—I did not find any money on him—he gave me his address, No. 7, Wood-street, Tabernacle-walk, Finsbury—I put it down at the time—there is such a place.</p>

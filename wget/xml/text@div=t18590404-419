               <p>the passage into which Newberry had gone before—I had been watching there for some days before, and had seen Richardson and Newberry in company, but did not interfere with them—I continued to watch Richardson till the 17th, but Newberry was taken. When I first saw Richardson, on the 17th, she was in the Walworth-road with a man—he had nothing in his hand at that time, but afterwards I saw him with another man, I believe, who had this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I followed them from the Walworth-road—they took a cab just by St. George's Church, in the "Borough, and took the bundle in with them—I followed them in another cab to Finsbury-square, where they discharged the cab, and walked towards Hoxton—I followed them to Beaumont's house, Bridport-place, New North-road, and when they were within one hundred yards of it, the woman took the bundle, and they proceeded to Beaumont's shop, which is haberdashery and hosiery intermixed with silk—it is something like a <hi rend="italic">leaving</hi> shop; there are shelves, and goods packed up with tickets on them. The man went in at the shop door, and the female, Richardson, stopped at the private door, and it was opened from the inside, and she went in with the bundle—Knight, who I believe was nearest, followed her in, and I followed him, and found Beaumont behind the door—there is a parlour behind the shop, which you can get into from the private passage—I went in there, and found the woman, the man not in custody, and Beaumont's wife—Knight was also in the parlour when I got in—I found the bundle on the kitchen stairs, tied up as it is now in this shawl—it contains 181 silk handkerchiefs—Richardson called for some water—the man went down to fetch it—I went down stairs with him, and when I returned again, he was gone.</p>

Beau<lb></lb>mont certainly did not send for one—on my oath, Beaumont did not go out, nor did he come back with an officer—he said in my presence, that they ought not to have let the other man escape—I told Knight that the other man had escaped, and he said that the man had been there a very short time—Beaumont did not say in my presence, "You ought not to have let the other man escape"—he said, that there was a lodger up stairs named Mack—Mack does not carry on any. business there—he said in my presence, that the man who had come there, came to see Mack, his lodger—there were no silks in Mack's room—we brought a cheat away next day containing trowsers and waistcoats—we waited for Mack till between twelve and one—I went next day to see whether Mack had come home, and took one of his cards—we were there two hours before we took Beaumont in custody—I went down with the man for the water, but left him to come up with it, as I did not know there was a back entrance—I left him there.</p>

I was engaged with Legg in endeavouring to trace the persons who were dealing with this property—I was with him on 15th February—I saw Newberry enter an alley from St. John's-lane, and followed him through—he had nothing with him then, but when he returned, he had a bundle—I followed him, and he was stopped in Victoria-street—I said, "What have you got in that parcel?"—he said "I do not know what it is"—I tore it open, and said "I see what it is; it is silk handkerchiefs"—I asked him where he got them—he said, that a gentle<lb></lb>man had given thorn to him to carry—Legg asked him where he was going to take it—he said, "To Regent-street"—he asked him what house, and he said, "I do not know"—I said, "I can hold you out no promise; but if you will take me to the person from whom you brought these handkerchiefs, I will represent the case fairly, and it may perhaps be in your favour"—he said, "I shall say nothing more about them"—I sent for a cab, took him to the station, and the charge was booked against him—he was asked by the Inspector, whether he wished to give any explanation, and he said that he should say nothing about them—on 17th February, the next day but one, Legg and I were in Walworth, and saw the female prisoner with a man who was carrying a bundle (we had seen her previously by herself)—they got into a cab, and we followed them to Finsbury-square—they got out, and walked up the New North-road to Beaumont's house—but just previous to their getting there, the female prisoner took the bundle—the man went to the shop, and the woman to the private door, which was opened immediately afterwards—I was on the opposite side of the road—I rushed across, to try to get there before she got in—the door was closed against me, but, as I went with great force, I forced it open—there was somebody behind the door forcing it, who turned out to be Beaumont, though I did not see him—I caught hold of Richards' arm just as she got inside the back parlour, and she directly dropped on the floor, and said, "Oh dear! we are all <hi rend="italic">lagged"</hi>—Mr. Beaumont and a man sitting on a chair were in the room—I said to Beaumont, "Is that the man who came in with this woman?"—he said, "Oh dear, no! that man has been here half an hour, or an hour, waiting for our lodger"—I said, "Where is the man that came in with the woman?"—he said that he did not see any man come in with the woman—there is a narrow passage, about six yards long, between the private door and the parlour, and it is about four yards to the parlour door—I did not fasten the door when I went in, I rushed in after Richards, passing the person behind the door; and I saw something go to the cellar stairs, which I took to be the bundle—I cannot undertake to say that anybody got out—after I had put those questions to Beaumont, Mrs. Richards complained of being faint and asked for some water—the man said, he would fetch some, and went down—Legg followed him, but came back to speak to me, and the man got away—I did not take notice of him, and could not identify him if I were to see him—I took the woman and the bundle to the station, and she was charged with receiving the silk handkerchiefs, knowing them to be stolen—Messrs. Vavaseur's name was mentioned, and the charge was read over to her by the inspector on duty, who asked her who she got the goods from, and if she wished to give any explanation—she turned to me and said, "I cannot say anything more about it than what you know; you saw</p>

Vavasseur and Co., of Watling-street, and that there probably would, be other charges against him—he said, "You are very candid; I will go"—I saw Legg bring the bundle from the kitchen stairs, but did not see him pick it up, and cannot say who did—here are a hundred and eighty-one handkerchiefs in the second bundle.</p>

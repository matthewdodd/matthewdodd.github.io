                  </hi>. I am an engraver and die sinker, at 24, Rathbone Place, Oxford Street—on 14th January Dubois called and made a small purchase, and on the 23rd January he called again and ordered three</p>

               <p>presses for endorsing stamps on bills and invoices, and on the 31st he called and took them away—on that occasion he gave the name of Paul; and said that he was sorry he had not given me his address before—he called again on 8th February and produced this piece of paper with "F. May" on it, and said that he wanted a stamp made for a <hi rend="italic">fac simile</hi>—the signature struck me immediately as that of the Dutch Consul in London—I am a Dutchman—I think he wrote on it in the shop "Pym," and I scratched it out and wrote "Pimlico" with an "i"—I said that part of the "y" in May could not be included in a No. 3 stamp, and produced a larger press—he took a small piece of paper out of his pocket marked 40 A, 40 B, 40 C and 41 C—40 A. was in pen and ink, and the others were in pencil—he wanted me to make blocks for them, and also blocks from this small piece of paper with a 1 and a 9—he asked me if I had figures to match those—I showed him several and in one the stroke ran up—he said that that would not do, he wanted them executed the same, and wanted me to make a block with "39" on it, and three extra sets of figures from 1 to 0, so that he could print 39,000, 120, 121, 122, and so on—he did not leave the pieces of paper with me—I told him the best thing he could do was to introduce a numbering machine to his customers, as those loose figures would be difficult to work, and if he was so parti<lb></lb>cular about the numbers I could not do it unless he brought a strip of paper with all the figures upon it—he said that when he called for the other press he would give me the order for the numbering machine, the price of which was to be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was to be the price of the stamp and blocks, leaving 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave no name or address—he wanted the work ready on Monday, 11th February, at 11 o'clock, military hours—I completed the order, but he did not come—a friend called my attention to the propriety of having the stamp with "F. May" upon it, and I communicated with the authorities of the Bank—on 19th March he came again with De Jongh, and said that he had not called before as he was ill, but it did not matter as, his customer did not want the stamp, and therefore I must let him have it a little cheaper—I said I could not let him have it for less—he said, "At any rate you must deduct the 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as I will give you another order"—he then produced these papers, Q and R, and asked me to make the figures on R the same shape and size as marked on Q, and asked what the price would be—I told him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per letter per block—he said that that would be too dear—I told him I could make loose types—he said that he wanted them by Friday, and De Jongh said, "No. Thursday night"—I said that I would let him have them if he would keep his time better—I told Dubois he must leave 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit for the numbering machine, and that it would take eight days making—he said that was all right; he would give me the order when he called for the others—he said that he would pay me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the press I had made, and leave it with me till Thursday evening—I said, "You had better take it with you, as when you have paid for it it is your property"—he said that he was not going home, and should prefer to leave it with me—I told him I was going to Paris to the Exhibition, and that if he left it with me it was likely to be mislaid, and it would be better for him to take it—he agreed to do so, and made a sign to De Jongh, who passed a sovereign to me, and the stamp and press were handed to Dubois—this bill was made out to Mr. Paul—I did not know any other name—the total was 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., less 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Frenchman and have been a lithographic printer at 21, Jockey's Fields, Bedford Row, nine or ten years—I have been in this country 22 years—I knew a man named Leroy for many years, but lost sight of him for three or four years—in August last he introduced to me a Frenchman named Martin, who wanted to practise on lithographic stone—I allowed Martin to use part of my shop and got a lithographic stone for him to practise upon—on 7th February this year Martin introduced Dubois and went to Paris the same day—he said "This is the gentleman I spoke to you about in the begin<lb></lb>ning of January; I have not kept my appointment to-day; he has come to my place and I introduce him to you"—Dubois took out a piece of paper in Martin's presence—it was in French, and was headed "Old England"—I did not read it—he said, "I want it very well engraved and well printed, as it is a particular job for a firm in Paris called 'Old England'"—he said that he wanted to get up a coupon—Martin said "You leave him alone, he is a good printer; look at the specimens around the room; he could do any branch of business"—Dubois said "Very well, I shall come to morrow and bring you some</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060045"></xptr>
               <p>other papers and bring you the information about this work," and as he left he said "I shall be here to-morrow at 3 o'clock military time"—Martin said "I am losing this job; I have been waiting all this time to work"—6,000 or 8,000 francs was to be given to me for the work, and Martin's share was 2,000 francs, and he would lose all by going away—I did not know the nature of the work, the details had not been given to me—they left together, and about ten minutes afterwards Leroy came with a gentleman named Dubert, and I went with them to Martin's lodgings but Dubois was not there—I had some conversation with Martin, and that was the last time I saw him—Dubois came next day punctually at 8 o'clock—(he had read the paper in French to me)—he asked me if I could furnish him with a sheet of paper; I gave him this plain sheet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and he took out a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, put it on one corner of the paper, and traced a pencil round it—he then put the note higher up and traced it over again, which makes it double—he said "I want you to engrave 'Old England' at the upper part in Old English, in the same writing as it is on a Bank of England note, and make a scroll alongside the same as they do in cheque books, and write in skeleton letters along it 'Old England'"—I wrote this "Old England" in pencil across the scroll when he spoke about it—I also wrote in ink these words, that was for the water-mark—he said "Make a perforation down the centre of the scroll work"—he also said "I want this bank-note put down at the bottom," and that I was to be sure to leave room for the Director to sign his name without it going into the lower part—the line at the top of where the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was placed was simply to show me the distance, but I was not to make a line between the two documents—he wanted them in books of 25 each, with sufficient space at the end of the counterfoil to have them bound up—he said that the part I was to print was to be a fair sample of this—I said "I don't think you can do that," because I saw that it was a bank-note—he said "Oh yes, you can, we are not going to do the signature F. May, nor the numbers at the side of the note, and in that way it will not be an imitation; we shall have the name of our chief cashier, who will sign it himself"—he said that the plan was to give away the coupons over the country to persons who would buy 1000 francs' worth of goods in one month, and at any time they could go and buy some more goods and give that as money, and if there was a few shillings change they would set the change out—he wanted me to let him have 12 or 20 copies by Monday—he wanted to send the paper to Paris as a pattern of Old England—I said that it was totally impossible, I must see my engraver first, and ask him how long it would take to engrave and the price—he said "You must set your engraver to work day and night. I will leave you this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; you go and see your engraver at once, and ask him the particulars, and when it can be done and the price. Is your engraver a good workman? because I want an exact copy of these. I shall leave you the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, please give me a receipt for it," which I did—he said that the firm of Old England would open on 1st February, and he must have some to go on with a few days after the opening—he asked if I could get some Bank of England paper—I said that I should try and get it as near as I possibly could—he said he wanted the water-mark "Old England <hi rend="italic">comptoir franco</hi> English, Paris," at the top, exactly the same as a Bank of England note, except the little square with the figures in it at the bottom, and he said "By</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060046"></xptr>
               <p>this we do not imitate this note"—the words "I promise" were to be there, and everything except the signature, the figures, and the square water-mark—the woman in this corner (<hi rend="italic">Britannia</hi>) was also to be engraved—I said that I should have to go to some paper-mills; he said "How long will it take to do that?"—I said "About a month or six weeks, I cannot tell exactly;" he said "Oh, that is too long, we can't wait that time; you must see if you can't get some paper sooner than that"—I said that I would make inquiries about it—he left the papers with me—I was to see the engraver and he was to call next day at the same time—he gave his name "Wattecamp, 23, Broad Street, Golden Square," and said "That is my office"—I received this letter the same night; it is his writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was translated thus</hi>: "London, 8th Feb., 1876. Mr. Fimbel. On leaving you I went to the lithographer who had been mentioned to me. He assured me that the mould of the paper could be made like the pattern without the help of the paper-maker. Mr. Martin having been recom<lb></lb>mended by an old friend, I am happy to give you the preference, but for the first proofs do not come and say to me 'I have not been able to get such paper.' It must be similar and irreproachable. I do not haggle, but be just. You have 4,000 francs profit with our house; but thirty proofs with their perforations must be ready on Monday. I have been told that this can be easily done.—Dubois Wattecamp. To-morrow at 3 o'clock without fail.") He came next day at 5 o'clock and asked what the price would be for engraving the plate—I told him ten guineas (I had sent to the engraver)—he still wanted it by Monday—I said "It is impossible, it will take the engraver ten days to do"—he said he would write to Paris and let the firm know that—he said "Can you come out in the City with me? I will show you where to get some paper"——I said "I don't think you can; it being Saturday the firms close at two "—he said "Well, will you come with me and I will show you?"—I said "I will"—before leaving he said "Give me that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note back again; I cannot give you the receipt till Monday morning, because I have left my pocket-book at Broad Street, Golden Square, and I live at Chelsea; give me a piece of paper and pen and ink and I will give you a receipt to discharge you of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he gave me this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and I gave him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note back, but in the mean time I had made this copy of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and had shown it to him on the Friday—I had put in the actual number of the note—he told me that Old England was a good house, and they would do a good deal of business with me, and that McClure were their printers before—he then took me to Queen Victoria Street to Mr. McClure's shop, but it was shut up—he told me to go there the first thing on Monday morning and inquire about the paper—he said that they were the printers before, but he gave me the preference, being one of his countrymen—he arranged to call on Monday between twelve and one o'clock, but he did not, and on Tuesday the 12th I received this letter from him—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that he was unable to come and requested to be informed of the particulars and price</hi>)—this is my answer—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that the witness had obtained a pattern of paper and enclosed an estimate for the paper, the engraving, and the printing, amounting to</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and requesting a deposit of</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—I received this letter from the prisoner in reply—(<hi rend="italic">This being translated was dated</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th February</hi>, 1878, <hi rend="italic">and signed Paul Wattecamp, It requested to have a proof by the</hi> 28<hi rend="italic">th, that the order would be for</hi> 10,000 <hi rend="italic">copies, but that he had not yet received any money</hi>)—on Monday morning, the</p>

               <p>11th, I communicated with the authorities of the Bank of England, after which I reported from time to time what I was doing, and acted under the orders of the police—on Monday, the 18th, Dubois called and said that he had not been able to call before, as he had not heard from the gentlemen in Paris, and was waiting for money—I showed him some samples of paper—he said that one was too blue and the other too thin; could I get it a little thicker?—I said that I would try—he requested me to get it all done by the end of the month without fail and to keep the engraver on it and not give him too much at once—that paper had no water-mark—it was arranged that I was to get some more next day—he said that as soon as he could get some money from the firm he would bring me some, as he had spent a good deal of money and wasted a lot of time—he asked me if I had heard from Martin—I said "Yes;" I had received a letter from him on 11th February—he asked me if I had answered him—I said "No"—that was true—on 25th February I went to 23, Broad Street, Soho, and saw Dubois—he asked me upstairs—it is a foreign restaurant, and he was lodging there—I showed him some other specimens of paper—he said "I think it is rather too thick; you had better keep to the first sample. If you will allow me to keep them till to-morrow I shall see them by daylight, and shall come to your place and give you an answer"—I said, "I hope I don't intrude, as you have company to dinner with you," and left them with him and went downstairs, and sat in the restaurant—Roi, who is not now on his trial, was there (that is not Leroy)—Dubois introduced me to Roi as "Mr. Fimbel, my printer"—Dubois said, "Pray take a seat," and I sat next him—there was a conversation at the table, and he said, "Have you seen your engraver about this job of Old England?"—I said, "I have"—Roi said, "Hush! don't speak so loud about your engraver"—I said, "Why did not you come to my place on Friday last, according to your appointment?"—he said, "I could not come, as this gentleman, my friend, had just arrived from Paris a few days ago, and I had to go about with him to buy goods for the firm of Old England which we could not get in France"—Roi said, "Let us talk about this mat<lb></lb>ter, because it is a very serious affair; the order will be 20,000; you will have 10,000 to go on with for the first"—Dubois said, "We will come to-morrow and see you"—Roi said, "No, not to-morrow; the day after, or the day following"—those goods were bought for the Exhibition—when I left Dubois said "We shall come to your place to-morrow to see you," but he did not come—he came on 6th March, and said that he had just arrived from Paris, and had been travelling all night, and had got a very bad cold and was very poorly—he said that I was to do a great "leap" for him; the expression was "<hi rend="italic">tour de force</hi>"—he asked if I had got a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I said "No"—he asked me to get one—I said that I would try—he said that I was to manage with the engraver to do the work, as he had not a penny in the world, but should have money to-morrow—he left, and returned about 6 o'clock—I told him I had not been able to get a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and he arranged to call next day, 7th March, which he did, and told me he had not got the money from France—he said, "There are two partners, and I am interested in the firm and must wait their pleasure"—I saw him on the 9th for a few minutes at the door and he said that he had got an Italian job, but would take it to McClure's—I saw him next on 18th March—De Jongh came with him, who I did</p>

E., near the Old Kent Road;" and said "It is too far for you to come, drop me a line and I will come and see you"—we then left together about 11 a.m. and left De Jongh at the corner of Gray's Inn Road, I and Dubois went to the City Road, and he said on the way "De Jongh is rather a suspicious man, that is why he came with me to pay the deposit, we are partners together"—we went on to the engraver's, and before entering Dubois said "Do not tell the engraver my name or address, it is no business of his, tell him it is for one of your customers"—I said that I would—he said that he would wait for me at the public-house, and I went into the engraver's, and afterwards went to the public-house, where Dubois said "Will you kindly give me a receipt for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I gave you?"—I tore this leaf out of my pocket-book and wrote "Received March 18, 1878, of Mr. Wattecamp, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account"—he said "When will the engraver get done?"—I said "2 o'clock on Friday"—he said "Tell him to get done about 12 o'clock"—he also said "I shall come this afternoon with 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and then we shall be able to get a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for a copy for the engraver"—in the week afterwards he showed me four sovereigns, and said that he would give me the other sovereign and we could go out and get a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—before I went out he said "Will you show me the samples of paper I returned to you"—I did so and he tore a piece like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) off one comer and put it in his pocket-book, and said "Will you kindly make me a receipt for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now, and I will return you the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. receipt?"—I drew out this receipt for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and gave it to him—I went to a public-house with the five sovereigns, but they had not got a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; Dubois asked me to go to another public-house, because he said "You can speak English and I cannot"—I went and got one—I afterwards wrote on this draft in pencil the date of the fresh note—I had put down the first one in ink—he took the paper out of his pocket-book and said that it was rather thin—I said that it would swell in wetting it to get the water-mark—he said he thought it would do very nicely—I said "Do I understand that you want the little square out?"—he said "No, do the water-mark just as it is on the note"—it would not be a true water-mark, only an imitation put on by block by</p>

               <p>means of wetting it—I asked if the engraver could keep that note as payment—he said "No, I shall want that note back again to see if he has made a true copy of it," and he took a piece of paper out of his pocket-book and put down the date of the note—he impressed me not to fail to get it done by Friday at 2 o'clock, and said that he would stop at my place and smoke in my parlour till it was done, as he wanted to send it by post to Paris—he asked me how long it would take to do 10,000 copies—I said "Perhaps four weeks to print them"—before leaving he said "If you don't fail I will reward you for it and the engraver too; I don't mind a few pounds more"—two days afterwards I heard that he was in custody.</p>

I also found in the portmanteau the same advertisement cut out—I found that the address given, 7, Belgrave Terrace, was correct, but when Dubois was taken he gave his address, 6, Percy Street—he had lived there but he did not live there then—I had some conversation with Mrs. De Jongh.</p>

I am principal of the Printing Department, Bank of Eng<lb></lb>land—all notes are printed in the bank itself—an impression from this stamp and these numbers would resemble parts of a Bank of England note—there are always five numbers this size on a Bank of England note and also a small number such as "48 <hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>" with a letter under it—we have several series of notes with the number 39, 120, and they run upwards to 39, 200—it would be possible to stamp the words "F. May" without the word "Pimlico"—the water-mark of a bank-note is made at the mill in the manufacture of the paper—an attempt could be made to stamp a water-mark on thin paper, because it has been done, but it is a very rough imitation—our notes are printed from the surface, not from a plate but from a raised character.</p>

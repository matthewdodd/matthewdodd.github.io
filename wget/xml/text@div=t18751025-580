I am manager to Mr. Thope, a grocer, of 128, High Street, Whitechapel—I came there at 7.50 on 23rd September, I found a police-constable in the passage, the window was open, the till had been forced at the side, a piece was broken out at the side of the till and about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of halfpence taken—I had seen it safe at 9.30 the previous evening—a pane of glass which had been recently put in was taken clean out of the frame.</p>

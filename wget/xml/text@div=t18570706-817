                  </hi>. I am medical officer of health to the parish of Bermondsey, and have been in practice sixteen or seventeen years; I have been fourteen years in Bermondsey, and have had some experience. I know Mr. Burgess's premises—I have been there on several occa<lb></lb>sions during March and April—I found heaps of bones there in a dried</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185707060063"></xptr>
               <p>condition—there were other smaller heaps of joint bones with cartilage and matter hanging to them, and there were what are technically called glue pieces, with trimmings, and skins, and ears, and tongues, and nose pieces, and tails, and matters of that description—there was also a great heap of gas refuse within a building which had been partially erected and stopped, and also in the open air; the building was uncovered—there was a boiler on the premises, but they were not boiling when I saw it—it presented the appearance of having been used for boiling bones; there was some fat at the bottom, which induced me to believe that—I saw a cask with the remains of fat in it, also a quantity of carboys, which had contained sulphuric acid—I had seen that on Mr. Burgess's premises on previous occasions; that is used for the manufacture of manure; mixed with what I believe to be bone powder and coprolite powder, it forms a soluble manure, super phosphate of lime—in March and April, when I visited the premises, I formed the opinion that mixing sul<lb></lb>phuric acid and boiling bones would be a nuisance, but I did not see it, and therefore did not certify it as a nuisance—it was in a latent condition—there was no active operation going on—if sulphuric acid was mixed with bone dust it would cause a nuisance, by giving off a suffocating vapour—in consequence of directions I received, I went in May to the defendant's premises—they were placed under my inspection by the vestry, in consequence of complaints which had been made—I first went on the 11th; or 12th, for it was at half past 1 o'clock in the morning—when I got within 200 yards of the place there was a light vapour coming in a direction from the premises—it was a very fine night, and the atmosphere was very clear—I was in a patent safety <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and when within 200 yards of the pre<lb></lb>mises the vapour became perceptible—on reaching the premises there was a great noise; the steam engine was at work, and vapour was all round me, clear and distinct—the gate was closed—on the eastern side there was not much smell, but on the western side (the wind was coming towards the west) the vapour came—it produced with me difficulty of breathing and headache, and it was excessively offensive—there was a vapour hanging over the ground for a considerable distance from the premises; I saw it from the arches of the railway, and on the other side of the railway, the south side, the atmosphere was perfectly clear—there was a great steam arising from a ditch, which I imagine to have been caused by the waste water of the steam engine—the vapour was almost entirely on the western side—it appeared to come from the erection close to the railway—operations were going on there—I experienced a peculiar metallic taste in my mouth; I believe that to have arisen from the use of sulphuric acid; that would pro<lb></lb>duce headache—the vapour gradually dispersed during the half hour I was there, and in dispersing, it became more diffused and less dense—I did not at that time smell anything that I think arose from gas finings—in my opinion the smell I smelt at that time would be injurious to health—it was not a pleasant smell—you could not enjoy life in that vapour—the ditch round Mr. Burgess's premises runs on the west, and a little to the south—I did not perceive any smell arising from it at that time—on 4th June I went to the premises again—Mr. Shepherd came to me that morning, and Dr. Aldis accompanied me—there was then a different smell—the steaming process, the extracting of fat from the bones, was going on, and vapour was escaping from the building, which caused a very bad smell, just as there is from a bad cook's shop; I do not know anything more sickening—I do not think the defendant has had any fish there of late—the vapour that escaped was from two chambers, called extractors or digesters, by means of the appli<lb></lb>cation</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185707060064"></xptr>
               <p>of steam; the defendant is a very skilful man, and he has made engines to extract fat from these bones, which have been cleaned beforehand, and during this process there is a sickening vapour given off—the gas finings were at that time in a state from which there was not so much stench—if it was wetted, and the sun came on it, there would be a very disagreeable smell; it contains a quantity of sulphur; it is what has been used for the purifying of gas—I saw bones lying about in a semi-putrid condition; the cartilage attached to them was wet—I wanted to take away a sample of them, and of the gas refuse; I asked Mr. Burgess's permission, and he declined—Dr. Aldis was not with me at that time; he stopped till Mr. Burgess told him to go: that was at the entrance of the premises; Mr. Burgess came up; I told him who he was, and he told him to go, that he had no business there, and I think he walked away quietly—I remained—Mr. Burgess was very civil to me—I was on the premises about an hour on 4th June; the smell was different on that day to what it had been before, and I can swear that it was a different process—I do not think it was acid that was being used—I made this report (<hi rend="italic">handing it in</hi>)—the vapour on 12th May rolled over the market gardens, and no doubt contaminated the atmosphere—I noticed on one occasion that the leaves of the fruit trees in the neighbourhood were shrivelled and scorched, and brown at the edges, whilst at some distance from the premises they are in a healthy condition—I attribute the difference to the vapour on Mr. Burgess's premises—he has been on those premises for more than a year, for it is more than a year ago since I was ordered, under the Metropolitan Management Act, to inspect the premises with regard to fish.</p>

               <p>the process that they carry on, but they are generally locked; it is at night that they carry on this manufacture, and there is a very suffocating smell emitted; I believe muriatic acid is used—my attention was directed, more than a year ago, to the tops of the arches which are left open to allow the vapour to come out; the manufacturer closed the arches, and I told him if he did so he would kill his men—I have never had any complaint made to me since about the arches—I do not know the name of the person who com<lb></lb>plained at that time; it was not Mr. Sheppard—I had expressed my readi<lb></lb>ness to go there at any time, as they complained that I had not been active—I believe there has been a dispute about a right of way—the varnish manufactures would poison plants, supposing the vapour to go that way; they have each an appliance to consume the vapour in the shaft, but I do not think it is quite effectual; in fact I do not think they like to use it, they are afraid of explosion—there are a great number of tanneries in Ber<lb></lb>mondsey—as you approach these premises there seems to be a legion of them; in some of them they use what is called "pure;" that is, a solution of dog's excrement—it is used in pits, the nuisance arising from that is simply when the solution is let off into the sewers, but that has now been remedied by the use of deodorizing powder, and by the free use of water; it is not used so much for the heavy as the lighter skins, such as are used for ladies' gloves—some have endeavoured to get rid of the nuisance, neverthe<lb></lb>less the air is impregnated wherever the deodorizing process is not used—besides that, the soaking of putrid skins would produce a smell, but lime is used—the smell from the fellmongers' yard would not be agreeable—in spite of all this, it is one of the healthiest spots in the metropolis; we have less consumption in Bermondsey than in any district in London, the open ground near the railway is the best spot for a Consumption Hospital—my printed report merely speaks of the great prolificness of the neighbourhood—Mr. Burgess's premises are open in one direction; you can get in with ease—I was not aware that I could have got in on this night, when the vapour was spreading—I did not go on the premises, and I have been since informed by Mr. Burgess's legal adviser, that I had no business there at those hours—I do not know the name of the person that guided me on that night, but I believe it was Clark—my report, in substance was, that I could not certify it as a nuisance which was injurious to health—I have said that I discovered nothing till I got on the premises, but then it was in a state of repose—on the previous occasion it was the bones in the heaps and the bones in the tubs that were complained of, with the ligaments and cartilage attached to them stinking—I thrust my stick into the gas refuse, and then took it out and put it to my nose, and discovered that it was not a nice smell—I took up a bone and smelt it—I wanted a sample of the bones—I believe the fish that I con<lb></lb>demned was taken away instantly, at least, a portion of it—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">here stated that Mr. Burgess had removed the fish</hi>)—on 12th May, when I was called at half past 1 o'clock in the morning, the parties were waiting at my door when I came home—I had been dining out—I went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and the parties followed after me; I went along Blue Anchor Broad into Drummond Bow—I alighted from the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and went to the gate, the vapour was almost a flame, it was dense smoke which could be seen from the Drummond entrance—the steam engine was at work, and the machinery for grinding the coprolite and the bones was working at a great rate, and there was a very great noise—I went up close to the gate, and walked up under the railway arches in company with a policeman—I attempted to look over</p>

               <p>the gate, but could not see over the premises—I then came down to the end of the shed which abuts on the railway and comes up above the railway, that took me not very far from the varnish manufactory; I stood there some time, within a very few feet of Mr. Burgess's—I did not pass under the arches—none of the persons suggested to me that I might go to the back or open part of the premises where there was no wall—the vapour was not coming directly towards me, but more towards the market garden ground it left a metallic taste for some time, an astringent taste, acid and copper together, more like acetate of copper—I think I was within seven or eight yards of it—I am positive that I was not actually on the premises, but I was within seven or eight feet of them—it was after waiting there some time that I discovered the metallic taste as well as the smell, and I said, "I can not stand this any longer"—I think the smell would come from sulphuric acid mixed with gas refuse; there was gas refuse, and there were receptacles for sulphuric acid there—Mr. Burgess refused me a sample of what I call the gas refuse, and therefore I could not ascertain what it is—I had an opinion that it was oxide of iron purifier, but my notion is that there was some lime also, but I will not venture to swear it—oxide of iron is used in the London gas manufactories to separate the sulphurous hydrogen from gas, in preference to lime, but it is objected to by Dr. Letheby—I was informed by the defendant's foreman that the large heap was gas refuse—there are two kinds of gas refuse, and I am inclined to think it was the iron—I do not think it would have been so offensive if it was the lime—I have never tried the experiment of pouring sulphuric acid on the oxide of lime purifier; and I would rather not give an opinion on what would be the effect of it, as you have Dr. Odling by you, prompting you; I have not tried it, and do not know, and therefore cannot give any opinion upon it—I will not swear that what I call gas refuse was not oxide of iron purifier—my impression is that sulphurous acid gas was given off, and that that caused the stench—I was there about an hour or an hour and a quarter—I was walking about, trying to see if it came from any other source—I smelt it for about twenty minutes, and yet they never took me to the open part of the premises with the policeman—the ditch round the premises was not clean, the steam engine was at work—I have seen the refuse water from the steam engine run into the ditch at a high temperature, and that makes a thin white vapour—I should not have complained of that alone—in fact the surplus water from the engine in some respects makes the ditch less offensive—there was an offensive smell on 4th June like steam from bad meat—I took up a bone then, and smelt it, but not the same bone—there was a vast quantity of bones all decomposed; there must have been several tons; they were dry; you could break them with your hand—I did not object much to anything except those great heaps that become heated, and smell—I should not object to them alone in the state in which I saw them, but if you were to cook them they would become offensive—what I call the wet bones were in receptacles and tubs; they stank—I had to go up to them before I found they were not fresh, and I took up one to be certain of it—I was successful with the second one I smelt in getting a stinking bone; that was a wet bone—I should think there were somewhere about a dozen tubs and other vessels—there were four extractors or digesters—I do not know the process of charging them; I have always been told that they were not used—I believe they are a very great improvement upon the old boilers—I believe there is an attempt to make them perfectly air tight, but there was vapour escaping from them on that day—there</p>

               <p>must, of course, be the means of allowing the steam to escape, or there would be an explosion; the object is to make them perfectly air tight—I have no doubt they were erected with the intention of preventing any vapour or smell coming out—I did not go close to them; I saw the vapour coming from them when I was in Mr. Burgess's premises; it appeared to come from the top—it was a smell of melted fat; it was not strong; I did not say it was slight—there was a smell from the arches on that day—that is a very filthy smell, and extends some distance—the inspector of nuisances was with me on that occasion—Mr. O'Brien, I think, was the first to suggest that there was a different smell, and we hunted it out; it was distinct and different from that which came from Mr. Burgess's—they did not mix together—when I detected the fatty smell, we stood opposite Sheppard's ground, close to the borders of Mr. Burgess's, and about thirty yards from the spot—it was not a slight smell, it was a very decided one—it was not a wholesome smell, I swear that—I have not said that it was not at all injurious or unwholesome—I have said, as to the fat in the casks and receptacles in Mr. Burgess's yard, that I could not certify that that was injurious to health in the condition in which I saw it—I had noticed the trees before that—I have not been on the premises lately—I was shown some peas and some cress that looked very well—they were on the foreman's ground—I believe Mr. Jennings grows peas—there are market gardens all round—the vegetation looked very flourishing.</p>

CHAMBER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">stated that they held two tons of bones at a time</hi>)—there are four of them, worked by steam—the vapour was perfectly perceptible from the market garden ground—it was a sickening smell—it might make a person with a delicate stomach sick—if it went into the bed room of a person either sick or well, it would make the person well sick, and make a sick person worse—it would make a healthful person uncomfortable—there was also a smell from the gas refuse—it was not a strong smell—I put my stick into it—it was a faint sulphur<lb></lb>ous smell—the bones had the meat all cut off—they were bones collected from the butchers' shops—I said they were bad—they were small in quantity in proportion to the others, but I should think there must have been a ton or two on the premises—no doubt heat would cause them to produce an un<lb></lb>pleasant smell—supposing some tons of these wet bones, on a hot summer's day, were lying in the open air, they would have a tendency to infect and impurify the atmosphere—I am quite certain that the sickening smells, and these sulphurous smells, on 4th June, came from the defendant's premises—a shower of rain with heat afterwards would produce that—I know Row house—it is a detached, gentleman's house, I should think a third of a mile from the defendant's premises—I passed it to enter the premises that morn<lb></lb>ing—I smelt a distinct smell at 200 or 300 yards from the premises—it be<lb></lb>came stronger as I neared the house—I noticed it for twenty minutes—it was a dense vapour coming in one direction towards the open market ground on the west—I have no doubt at all that that vapour came from Mr. Burgess's premises—a portion of it came from the shed—it appeared to me to come from the mixing process of the sulphuric acid and the bones—it was something similar to what might come from a varnish factory—I inves<lb></lb>tigated in every direction with the policeman to ascertain where it came from—I do not believe there were any varnish smells—there is no tannery</p>

               <p>for half a mile—steps have been, and are being taken at the present mo<lb></lb>ment with reference to those—in my judgment, the vapours arising from the premises of Mr. Burgess would lower the health of persons living in the neighbourhood—I think I have been to the premises five times altogether—three times before the last two months—it would depend on the wind and the state of the atmosphere as to how far that vapour would be carried before it would be entirely dispersed—that night was a very still night and rather warm—I think it might be carried a quarter of a mile.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of health to the parish, of St. George, Hanover Square. I have practised as a phyician about thirty years, and am senior physician to the Surrey Dispensary—the subject of nuisances comes very frequently under my attention; within the last year, constantly—on 11th April I visited Mr. Burgess's manufactory, about 1 o'clock in the day—I remained there about three quarters of an hour—I did not examine the manufacturing process—I visited them at the instance of Mr. Spanton, Mr. Claridge, Mr. Armfield, Mr. Jennings, and Mr. Sheppard, persons living in the neighbourhood—on entering, I observed immense heaps of animal matter, consisting of slips of sheep skins, and other things, in a very offensive state—one heap was only from sixteen to eighteen feet from the houses of Mr. Spanton and others—they are small houses, on the left, very nearly adjoining Mr. Burgess's premises—I also observed an immense accumulation of bones and skulls, and the bones had animal matter adjoining to them—some of them were in an offensive state—there were large stacks, there might be 300 tons—there were stacks of dry bones, and I smelt offensive smells from them, and from the animal matter also—I smelt that at the entrance of the yard, and there was a smell coming from a copper—it was a fine day, and rather cool—rainy weather would increase the offensive smells, they would be almost intole<lb></lb>rable, I should think—there was a large copper there, about 6 feet 5 inches in diameter, and about 6 feet deep—that was in the open yard, without a shaft or chimney of any kind—they were boiling bones in it—vapours were issuing from it almost at right angles to the house—the vapours were very nauseous, and, of course, this was increased on their being stirred—I was there while they were being stirred—they were calculated to have a sicken<lb></lb>ing effect—they did not have any effect upon me at that moment—the wind carried these vapours directly towards the houses that day—I did not at that moment feel any sickening effect from it, but I did on a subsequent occasion when I went, and was not permitted to go in—the copper had no lid to it, I saw none—it was in the open air; it was a large copper, and there were, close to it, two receptacles containing the skimmings from this boiler, very nauseous—I saw twelve receptacles, like small tubs; some were full, and some half full, of bones and green foetid water—there was an offensive odour from them—of necessity, from the wind blowing, these vapours would be carried into the neighbourhood—I saw animal matter—I counted eight pieces, which the men called glue pieces; they were sheeps' ears—I saw an open ditch, and vapours issuing from it—I tried some of that water, and I found fat in it—I have no doubt those smells were carried into the neighbourhood—some of that water came from the steam engine, but there was other water I have no doubt—from what I saw of the pre<lb></lb>mises, and the matter there, I am of opinion that the vapours arising from this factory are dispersed in the neighbourhood, and are injurious to health—I</p>

               <p>noticed the vegetation around there; a great many of the leaves of the trees were withered—I will not say the whole, but those nearest the pre<lb></lb>mises were; others, at a greater distance from them, looked healthy—I heard Dr. Challice describe the gas finings; I had no opportunity of examining them—my impression was, that they were oxide of iron—pour<lb></lb>ing sulphuric acid on bones, I should say, would produce an injurious vapour—I heard Dr. Challice describe what he saw on the morning of 12th May—I agree with him as to that vapour producing illness and sickness—it would produce the acrid taste which he described, and tend to the injury of health, and to lessen the enjoyment of life very materially; in fact, it would destroy all comfort—after a time the oxide of iron is put in the open air to purify itself, and so nauseous is it that, in my own district, they are obliged to purify the vapour from it by drawing the atmosphere through it—I went there on 4th June, the same day that I saw a large wagon going into the premises—I went with Dr. Challice, and saw Mr. Burgess; I told him that I was the medical officer of St. George's, Hanover Square, and I came at the request of Mr. Grey—I went into the yard—I did not smell anything on that day—a great number of the bones and the animal matter had been removed; it was, comparatively, in a clean state that day, as far as I saw—I did not go into any examination—I discovered a smell in the Drummond Road, which is about 100 yards off, which was very offensive—it caused me nausea, and sickness, and headache—I can distinguish the smell arising from the digesters from the varnish smells—I took as much pains as I could, and can distinguish them—I went in the market garden, and there was the smell there.</p>

SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> These are not many of these things in St. George's, Hanover Square? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I am aware that the object is to preserve the bones, and to turn them into different articles—the object in a factory of this kind would be to boil them while they are fresh—I am not aware that the purposes of the manufactory would not be answered unless they did so—throwing sulphuric acid on bones would pro<lb></lb>duce a smell—the copper that I have spoken of is for the purpose of boiling these bones, and, assuming that they are boiled as fresh as possible, I think there might be an injurious result from that copper—I do not consider that after bones have been boiled they would emit an injurious vapour—if bones which are to be used for turning into knife handles were put into the boiler fresh, and in a large quantity, they might emit a vapour which would be injurious—I should not like the atmosphere of a cook's shop—I should think, in some places, it might be injurious to health—in some diseases it would, in diarrhoea—I think the vapour from a large accumulation of fresh meat would be injurious—the quantity that I saw would be in a close neighbour<lb></lb>hood—I would not go so far as to say that a quantity of meat in a butcher's shop might be injurious to some persons—the copper was 4 feet 6 inches in diameter, and about 6 feet deep—people living in such a neighbourhood would suffer more than others—the smell that I mentioned would be an injury to health, the smell from the digesters and the large accumulation of animal matter—a good deal of it smelt putrid to me—I assume the putrid<lb></lb>ity to be injurious—I did not perceive any effluvia from the animal matter on the premises—there was the boiling in the copper, and the collection of bones.</p>

               <p>open, the houses are small—a number of families living in the same house are more likely to be affected—in a neighbourhood like that, a vapour such as I have described would be more injurious than in others—the families of the poor live generally in small houses, and are more crowded—the bones I saw were in a semi-putrid state—I smelt a very offensive smell indeed from the bones throughout the premises, and from the animal matter—the slips of sheeps' skin, and bullocks' ears and skulls, with the flesh adhering, were in a semi-putrid state, and the smell from them was very offensive.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Elizabeth Place, near Mr. Burgess's factory—he has been there about eighteen months—I did not perceive any very offensive smells before he came—there are varnish makers, but they are farther from my house—since Mr. Burgess has been there I have perceived offensive smells; the bone boiling began last March, I think—I have seen vapour issuing from his factory—the smells have been very offensive on those occasions—on 11th April I went with Dr. Aldis and two other per<lb></lb>sons to visit the premises—I saw heaps of bones, many of them as high as the ceiling—on the left hand, as we went in, were wet glue pieces lying all about; I should call them bits of skin—there was a nasty faint smell from them—I saw a copper boiling, and a man stirring it up—I went close to it, vapour and steam was coming from it—it went right to my house—the wind was blowing north—I smelt a very bad smell—there were lots of bones, some dry, some had been boiled, and some were wet and stinking—they had been there months, and many of them I believe twelve months—on 12th May I went there again, but did not go into the premises—I was there about an hour—I saw vapour issuing from the factory—we went up the arches a little way opposite Mr. Burgess's—the vapour arose from Mr. Burgess's and extended all over Mr. Sheppard's ground like a fog; it came out of the loop holes close by the steam engine; it had a nasty faint smell, it made me sick—I had been to Dr. Challice before 12th May—I fetched him that night—I was called out of my bed to go, by Mr. Clark at half past 12 o'clock; he said we should be all poisoned—I have frequently been outside the premises during the night and have perceived that smell and vapour—I know the difference between the smell of the varnish maker's and Mr. Burgess's—I cannot say that I felt sick before 12th May, but I have had the headache very badly—I smelt the gas finings, I sat down close to them.</p>

               <p>Clark was present at the piece of work about the wall—it was on 12th May that I went with Dr. Aldis—I do not think the digesters were at work then—the copper was at work in the middle of the yard—it was when I went with Dr. Challice at 2 o'clock in the morning that I observed the digesters—when I went with Dr. Aldis I believe I saw bones heaped up as high as this ceiling, or nearly so—I believe they were dry, the biggest heap was dry—it had been raining all the morning; they could not be dry—I got wet going there—I saw some bones in a tub—I dare say I saw about a dozen tubs with green water on the top of them—I went close to the copper, I believe I touched it—I did not want to put my nose to it—I smelt it before I got into the premises at all, from my own house, and further than that—on the night I was called up, the smell came from the digesters, it always does come from them; it made me sick, it was a stinking smell—I could not see the digesters at that time—I heard Dr. Challice state that the smell came from the sulphuric acid on the gas refuse—I would not swear but it was that, but the smells are so much alike to me that I could not tell the difference without seeing the operation; it came from near the steam engine, it could not come from the varnish maker's—we were between the two places.</p>

I have premises adjoining Mr. Burgess's—I have worked there for nineteen months—he came there about the same month that I did—at that time the houses in Elizabeth Place and Drummond Road were there, and all the houses marked in this plan, in the neighbourhood where I live—I reside, with my wife, facing Mr. Burgess's gates—I have no children—I have had cause to complain of smalls from last Feb. twelvemonth—they have been worse since March last year—I have not noticed them every day, at times I have—I went to the premises with Dr. Aldis, I have heard his evidence and that of Spanton—if they are boiling bones or mixing stuff, it is very offensive—on the morning of 29th April, about 2 o'clock, I was compelled to leave my bedroom and go out, because the smell was so bad in my bedroom—I left the house—I observed some one working at the copper, which was boiling, and there was a sort of vapour from the large building on the left, in a line with Mr. Spanton's house; the vapour was coming from the skeleton of the shed, it is not an enclosed shed—I went away and returned about 3 o'clock, it was not so bad then; the copper was boiling and they were at work at it—bones were boiling on 4th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 28th April, and the vapour was driven by the wind on my premises—that was in the day time, at times, not every day; sometimes it continued all day—it is very bad when they are boiling, and when they are emptying the extractors; the foreman has told me they contain three tons of bones; the vapours travel about all ways, according to the wind; if the wind is easterly the bone boiling is very little offence to me—I have no memorandums of 17th or 18th May—at all times the gas finings are very offensive, within, three feet of my place—my brother in law, who is a better judge than myself, supposed that there were 300 tons of finings; I should say one heap was sixteen or seventeen feet in height, and quite as large round as this Court, and there were other heaps not so large—I have noticed flesh and animal matter on the bones; I have found it offensive, and at all times complained of it—I should suppose there were 250 tons of bones and a great many glue pieces, I do not complain so strongly</p>

MONTAGUE CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What smell do you complain of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The smell from Mr. Burgess's—the smell comes from the bones, for one thing—the bones were wet when I went on 11th April—I agree with all that Dr. Aldis has said—what affected my pear trees was what came from the steam engine, or from that building where the steam engine is—it is the steam coining from there, and then there are those stones that he grinds—from them there comes a dust that covers the trees—the dust that comes out falls on my pear trees, and damages them—that is the way the vegetation is injured by the grinding of those stones—the grinding goes on in that building close to the railway—I cannot say that the other smells that I have smelt came from the digestors—they came in that direction—these are the complaints I have to make; the smell from the digestors, the dust from the grinding, and the smell from the bones—I smell them most in general when they have been boiling.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you have a large dung heap of your own, have you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—my dung heap is all straw—I have no dung at all—I manure my ground—I have had a collection of manure on the ground, but I have not now——that is what we use for our melons—all sorts of decayed matter make good dung—we have none in our ground—that is dung of the marsh—of course we turn our dung heap, but we never make any nuisance—my pear trees have suffered most, and my tenants, if they find a nuisance, will leave the houses—I have two of them here to day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Blue Anchor Road, and have done so nine months. It is between 300 and 400 yards from Mr. Burgess's place—I have occasionally observed offensive smells coming from his factory when the wind blows from the south-west; they have been very obnoxious in my house—they have affected my wife's health very much; it takes a good deal to affect me—when the wind is from the south-west, this smell comes right into my house, and fills all the rooms—it is a smell of putrid matter, like a dead dog floating down the river, when it comes against the chain of a ship, in a putrid state—twice in particular I noticed it, on a Friday and Tuesday night, three months and a half ago—I am out all day, and when I come home I am saluted with these smells—my wife has been very bad, particularly that Friday night, and I traced it round by my nose till I came right up to the factory—I did not know where Mr. Burgess's was until then.</p>

I am a seaman—I go to sea in the winter, and work at home in the summer—I live at No. 5, Elizabeth Place, close to Mr. Burgess's factory—I went through the factory yard one Sunday—I have seen heaps of bones (I can see them out of my window), and heaps of animal matter—we had to get a man to make a hole in Spanton's premises to drain</p>

               <p>the water; there had been a heavy rain, and the fleshings that Sunday morning were right up to my door—I have smelt offensive smells from the bones and from the gas finings, when the wind sets from the factory—I was obliged to leave the house once, shut the windows, and take my wife and children and the victuals away for a mile off, in order to eat it—the effect was by night as well as by day—this has been since Mr. Burgess fetched in his fish manure; I cannot say whether he has fetched it in more than once—I saw the fish go by our window in the cart, and it was an awful smell—I have seen fleshing, and fish, and bones, and there has been a smell from them—you could not go within three or four feet of them, it would knock you down—I have been compelled to shut my doors and windows many times, it blows right in—on 11th and 12th June I could see from the window that they were emptying something out of carboys into an iron place, and there was an acid smell from it quite suffocating; it had such an effect upon me that I walked round the road to see if I could find an inspector of police to smell it—I did not find one—I felt ill from it on that occasion—the steam from the extractors is very offensive—I have four children—I have been obliged to take them away from the house more than once.</p>

I have lived there about two and a half years—it is about fifty yards from Mr. Burgess's—since he came I have noticed offensive smells—before that we never had the smells that we have had since—they are alto<lb></lb>gether distinct from any smell we had before—they are sometimes every day—sometimes they stop a day or two, but they are more or less every day—there are different smells, one in particular, which, if you happen to get it as the wind is coming from their factory, you come all over in a perspiration and faint, and are sick—I believe if a person were to stand against it it would make them faint away—I have noticed another kind of smell; the nearest I can compare that to is, if you take a little vitriol and drop it on red hot iron—it is a stifling sensation—I had my children ill several times last year—I had my little girl laid up once or twice last year with slow fever, and my little boy and her complained of pains and diarrhoea—I had to take them to the doctor, and I have to keep a little medicine in the house in case anything of the kind comes on—I can distinguish the smells from that factory from any other smells in the neighbourhood—I pass the factory two or three times a day, and more than that—I have gone there at 12 or 1 o'clock at night—when the wind has been that way we could hardly stop in doors—there is a machine going on in the night which is very annoying—I have noticed these smells night and day, when I have been coming home at 12 or 1 o'clock, I have gone and traced it right down to the premises—I have done so frequently—I have smelt it down at the Holly Tree, and along the Blue Anchor Road—persons passing and repass<lb></lb>ing these roads could not fail to smell it—I have suffered sickness which I consider to arise from that—I have been taken with cramps and pains in my inside when this stench has been going on.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 12, James Street—I did live at No. 2, Elizabeth Place, near to Mr. Burgess's factory—I left just as the factory began building, on 22nd March, 1856—there was a nuisance there of bringing in barrels of stinking fish—when the wind is north west I can smell the effect at St. James's Street, as I am south east—it is a faint, stink<lb></lb>ing smell—I mean that it causes faintness—I have had occasion to shut my door and windows, and the up stairs windows frequently, to prevent the smell from coming in—I have two children, they have not been ill, but I have felt sick of a morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I have lived three years in Elizabeth Place, close to the factory gate. I have smelt very offensive smells, they made me very ill, giddy in the head and no appetite at all; that has been constant, nearly ever since they began to work—I have seen wagons go in; I do not know what was in them, but it looked like corruption, and smelt very bad—there are gas finings which have a very suffocating smell, it takes away your breath at times—I have suffered from the smells, and so have all my children; one night it was so bad that we were obliged to go out and see if we could find a policeman—I could not open the door or the window; they were doing something under the low shed, it was five or six months ago—I have repeatedly heard the steam boiler at work at night; and when the steam is let out it is enough to suffocate you, and knock you down, pretty well—my</p>

I have suffered violent sickness from Burgess's factory, three or four times a week—when I first awake, I find a very nasty smell and a taste in the mouth, and while I am dressing, it causes faintness, and I have fainted while dressing—I generally attend three London markets, and I rise at half past 1 o'clock, which is the time I have felt the nausea and have feinted away, and have been delayed one hour in going to my business—I have lived there twenty-nine years—before Mr. Burgess came there, I always enjoyed good health and never needed medicine or a physician—I was ill from the latter end of March to the latter end of May, with retching and spitting, I spit a good deal and then commenced spitting blood—that has arisen from the factory, I have to pass it from my husband's ground, and when I come back I cannot eat anything and have headache and de<lb></lb>pression of spirits.</p>

I have been one of Mr. Burgess's workmen since November, 1855—I remember when his present manufactory was first established—my business is anything we have to do—I am employed in bone boiling—I have to attend to look after the bones—they are boiled before they come to us—they are perfectly dry, and are stacked in the yard in heaps, and at that time they are per<lb></lb>fectly free from any animal matter—that is always the case with the dry bones—they are sold again as they come in, and in small quantities—the other bones, which we boil, come from the butchers' shops—they do not lie long in the yard before they are boiled—the quicker they are boiled up the better—they lie generally two hours when they are doing business—the</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Burgess. I first went to work in Nov., 1855—he began to erect the building near the railway in which the steam engine is in January—there is a steam engine and a mill for grinding coprolites—we began to grind coprolites about Oct. last—the copper in the middle of the yard was erected in April, this year—the extractors were put up eight or nine months ago—we began to use them on 4th June—I recollect the dispute about the wall—I had heard complaints before that—several of the neighbours complained, but I told them there could be no cause, because we had not began business—they com<lb></lb>plained while we were erecting the building—I told them it could not come from our premises, as we were not in business—we began to have bones in in March, 1856—they were dry—we deposited them in the open yard—there could not be any smell from them; they were cooked bones; all animal matter was taken from them—they were street bones and rag shop bones, and beside that we had calcined bones shortly afterwards—it is impossible that there could be any smell from them—the gas refuse came somewhere about May or June, 1856—it is in large heaps—there is never any unpleasant or unwholesome smell from them—if they were moved or stirred, there might be a vapour arise from it, but as it lies there, there is not—we received the fish in the early part of last year; we received it from collectors, in tubs—it was put in pure</p>

               <p>sulphuric acid; it was covered over with gypsum, which prevented any smell—the inspector of nuisances came several times there—Dr. Richards afterwards came from the Vestry—there could not be anything that was offensive in the fish after it came on the premises, we protected it so well it could not be offensive—Dr. Challice came at one time—he put his stick into it, and then smelt it—I do not think it could be smelt off the premises, even when it was stirred up; however, the whole of that was removed very shortly afterwards, on a notice being given—we began in May, 1856, to make super phosphate, that is artificial manure—that is made from bones, coprolites and animal charcoal diluted with sulphuric acid—at that time we had not got our mill at work to grind the coprolites—we received them first in a fit state, and mixed it up—a vapour arises in making that—when the air is clear, you may see that vapour at a very short distance, only a few yards—we continued to make that manure from May till the latter end of June, last year—when the mill was erected, we ground our own coprolites—after we had made the super phosphate, we cleared the mill for coprolite grinding—we did not begin to make the super phosphate after that—the first lot of wet bones and flesh bones was brought in about Dec.—the wet bones laid in a heap, the weather being cold, and after that we sawed the ends off, and put them in pickle in the tubs, in sulphuric acid, and that prevented them from smelling—I recollect Dr. Challice coming before we did anything with any of those bones—he saw the bones in the tubs—he took up one, and smelt it, and then another—they began to put the long bones into the copper about the middle of April, shortly after it's erection—other lots of fresh bones did not come in after that—the copper was used five or six times—there might be a faint smell coming from it, but nothing offensive—I think we have boiled about half a ton or 15 cwt. of bones there—there were some of the other bones from the pickle—the object of putting the long bones in was to sell them—the fat is skimmed off, and put into the tubs—in the course of skimming that fat there is the smell of fat, but nothing offensive—those long bones are used for knife handles and tooth brush handles, so that you must not boil them down, but preserve the texture of the bones—we put other bones in merely to boil them, and sell them as bones—those extractors are charged from the top—I have known two of them to be used—we did not begin to use them till 4th June; they have been used four times—so far as I could tell, there was no foul smell emitted from them except by accident—the gelatine comes out at the bottom—it keeps dropping into the tub below—there is no disagreeable smell in that dropping—when that process is gone through, and we have extracted the fat and the gelatine, the bottom is dropped down by a hinge, and the bones tumble out—there is a steam from them, but nothing offensive—that steam does not rise into the air; it extends but a little way, and only lasts a few minutes; it would not go out of the premises—the copper is only a temporary erection; it could be taken away in a few hours—it was set up for a temporary purpose while another was erected—the first building we erected was near the railway—we afterwards began to erect another building near Jennings and Armfield's; we got it to a considerable height, and had to suspend it about the right of way—the fire in the copper was lighted last Saturday, as there was a little fat in the copper, and we wished to sell it—we boiled no more bones—it is a great object to put fresh bones into the copper as soon as we can—the fresher the bones are the better the fat is, and the whiter are the bones—if they are kept, they</p>

               <p>would get discoloured, and you could not sell them—Dr. Aldis came in the beginning of April, and Spanton, and Jennings, and Armfield—I was not on the premises when they came in; they sent for me—when I went to Dr. Aldis, he told me there was a nuisance—I told him I would rather he would come when Mr. Burgess was there, and I said to Jennings and the others, "You have no business here"—Dr. Aldis said, "Then you would not like us to go on?"—I said, "Certainly not, I would rather you would come when Mr. Burgess is here"—there have not been any entrails or offal brought there since: there have been glue pieces, which are the only animal matter—I never saw such a thing as bullock's heads with animal matter on them—the horse's legs were in a dry state, such as you have seen to-day—flies would collect anywhere, especially on bones—there could not be any offensive smell from dry bones nor from calcined bones—it is the custom when we receive raw bones, to cut the ends off, and boil them as soon as we can—I never observed any unpleasant smell to go off the premises—I live in Drummond Road—I have never experienced any inconvenience there from the manufactory—I am glad to have my window open—the varnish factories are frequently at work; there is an unpleasant smell from them—I believe they boil oil—it is a nasty, heavy, nauseous smell—when our neighbours have come to complain of our factory, I have told them it was the smell of the varnish—Mrs. Shepherd lives very near this varnish place—there is a great deal of decomposed vegetables there.</p>

                  </hi>., M. D. I am professor of chemistry at Guy's Hospital. I have recently given my attention to the subject of nuisances for some considerable time past—I have been employed by the Home Office in refer<lb></lb>ence to bone boiling and other nuisances—I went to Mr. Burgess's premises with Mr. Wagstaff, on 3rd June and 3rd July—it differs altogether in it's nature from what is ordinarily called a bone boiling establishment—I have seen a great number of them—the bones are chiefly collected from rag shops and boiled in open coppers—there are large accumulations of these bones, after they have been boiled with the gelatine contained in them, they are allowed to decompose—they continue there a long time while this process is going on—in bone boilers there are exhalations which cause uneasiness—I looked at the copper on the furnace in the yard; it was in the open yard; it was not at work; but I have seen the process frequently elsewhere—it is boiling the long bones—it is a very great object to put in the bones as fresh as possible—assuming them to be placed in tube, diluting them with sulphuric acid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185707060096"></xptr>
               <p>keeps them in a fresh state for a considerable time—the effect of boiling the long bones is not injurious, noxious, or unpleasant—when you are near the boiler, there is a smell which I should compare to the smell of cooking—if carried on as stated by the last few witnesses, it could not produce an injurious or unpleasant odour—the long bones are the only ones that would pay the manufacturer—I noticed the four extractors, they are to extract the gelatine and fat; the bones are let out of the bottom—there is an accumu<lb></lb>ation of fat which is let out into tubs—that is a very excellent process—open air boilers were formerly used—if these extractors are worked properly, there cannot be any escape from them, and then there would be no smell—I saw one at work, no smell came from it—I found on the premises about a ton and a half of bones, and also bone black, that is, bones when they have been burnt, what is called animal charcoal; and there was also about three tons of calcined white bones—that was on 3rd July; I found the same kind of thing there on June 3rd—there would not and could not be any smell from calcined bones—if you hold dry bones up to your nose you can smell them, but not in passing—I saw about twenty bones that had been in the earth—all the animal matter had been taken away, there was no un<lb></lb>pleasant smell from them—I found very few ordinary rag shop bones—there were four or five tons of bones from which the animal matter had been removed in the extractors—they were in a good condition, dry—I saw some long bones that had been through the copper, they are used for knife and tooth brush handles—there were some dry glue pieces, and some pieces drying on the ground—they would emit an unpleasant smell if you held them to your nose, but not when walking on the premises—I walked among them—I found no animal matter but what I have spoken of; no entrails, or anything that could be called offensive to persons on the premises—the gas refuse was in large heaps—partly under the new shed, and partly in the open air—I examined a portion of it, it was spent oxide of iron—they use that to purify the gas—in doing that they remove certain stinking smells from the gas—there is no unpleasant smell from those heaps as you walk along—I put my stick to them, and could smell them then—I saw some carboys, but did not examine them—I looked at the coprolites—they are used for making the super phosphate—if it is made solely from coprolites, there is very little vapour; but if from bones, especially bones containing animal matter, there is a considerable sour smell—it is a smell which some of the witnesses have described as an acid taste—that might arise from mixing up the materials, if done on a large scale—I do not know that my attention has been called to the manufactories in the neighbourhood—I have been to several japan manufactories where they japan leather; sometimes there is a very suffocating acid smell from those, and sometimes rather a fishy smell, from using train oil or fish oil—fumes of considerable volume might come from that—I do not know that I have ever seen it in the night; I have in the day—I saw that there was a ditch with foul water—I can<lb></lb>not say that it smelt until I got close to it and stirred it with a stick—if steam water were thrown into the ditch, I should not think it would make much smell, independent of the temperature.</p>

               <p>in the neighbourhood—there may be smells coming from the factory that I know nothing of—I do not mean to say that the witnesses must be mistaken about the smells coming from the factory into their houses—I am medical inspector of health to Lambeth parish—I should not like to live very close to this factory; to tell you the truth, I should not like to live anywhere in Bermondsey—I heard Dr. Challice's account of what occurred on 12th May; I should say that that was quite impossible, from the process I saw—there may have been processes going on which I have not seen—if they were mixing a large quantity of sulphuric acid there would, no doubt, be a vapour arise from it—in boiling, not one particle of the acid would be detached, it would still remain in the water in which the bones were boiled—it would not give any odour to the water, it is quite inodorous, it may be capable of giving a smell—a very strong acid would destroy the bones—I did not look at the state in which these bones were, I could not ascertain any smell from the water in which they were—in boiling 7 cwt. or 8 cwt. of bones for two hours and a half in this copper there would be steam emitted, it would have the smell of cooking, which I should not like in my house—I did not see bones boiled on these premises; I have seen bones boiling—when I was there, I saw Mr. Burgess and his foreman—oxide of iron is used as a purifier of gas, it takes away noxious smells from the gas, and converts them into inoffensive compounds—some of it has been pro<lb></lb>duced to-day—I could not smell it at the distance of a yard—I perceived nothing unpleasant on the premises as respects smell of any kind—in sniffing about, I could detect different smells, but it required to have my attention directed to them before I could smell them—I did not perceive any smell from the super phosphate—I walked among the glue pieces—I held them to my nose, and smelt that there was nothing material from that—water poured on the gas heaps would not emit any smell, it would not stir it up; I think heat would not produce any—if wet came on and then heat, it might produce a smell, but it depends entirely on the age of the gas finings—I could not tell how old that 300 tons of gas finings were, but they were in a good condition—I have no doubt if rain came and then the sun shone on them it might increase the effluvia, but not materially; they might emit a little offensive odour—I gave evidence the other day in the Queen's Bench in a case of nuisance arising from the remaking of charcoal; I gave my opinion that it was not a nuisance after the premises had been reconstructed—the Jury said, they could not form any opinion of the case.</p>

We have never had any annoyance from smells from Mr. Burgess's factory—I never had better health, and I look well now—I pass the factory every day, and there are no smells—there are plenty of smells besides Mr. Burgess's before you come there, but I never smelt anything from Mr. Burgess's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surveyor to the Lord of the manor of Bermondsey, and to the turnpike trusts. There are many large manufacturing premises as you approach Mr. Burgess's, going along the railway—I do not know of any special premises before you come to Burgess's along the railway that would emit any disagreeable and unpleasant smell, but I have experienced unpleasant smells two or three months ago—there are some japan places, and manure places, going along the railway, and there are open ditches in the immediate vicinity of this factory; they are made use of as sewers, and I believe they are shown in the ordinance plan as sewers—the railway arches are used for several purposes of a very objectionable character—I have been round and through Burgess's factory a few times, and have not found anything objectionable—I am frequently in that neighbourhood, in consequence of the intended new street, to see that there are toll gates put there, to prevent an evasion of toll; and these houses on the ground marked</p>

               <p>"Fuller" have been recently erected and let, and the land on the other side is proposed to be let for building purposes—there are open arches on the railway, and any smell from Burgess's factory would come through the arches—if there had been any smells from Burgess's of an unpleasant nature, I think I should have discovered them—a nuisance would affect the rents materially in letting—I have been in the habit of going there from Oct. and Nov. last up to the present time—Bryan and Parker's used to be occupied by Mr. Burgess, and is now used for bone boiling—I have never found any unpleasant smell when it is at work—I have been inside it within a year, and did not smell anything—the boiling takes place in open iron pans, one or two feet in diameter.</p>

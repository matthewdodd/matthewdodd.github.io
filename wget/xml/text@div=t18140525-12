I went to bed about eleven o'clock in company with an acquaintance that came up from Dover. He had been a prisoner ten years in France. Before I went to bed I put my watch on the frame of the window. About one o'clock I was awoke by my partner, who said there was a man in the room who had awoke him by clapping his hand on his face in the dark. We both of us got out of bed immediately, and asked the prisoner what he was doing in our room.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the prisoner in your room, did you - A. Yes; he made some kind of excuse, as if he had mistaken the room, and by the noise that we made the watchman was alarmed; he came to the room door, and met the prisoner going out. The watchman followed him into his own room, and came back with his lanthorn to light our candle, and desired us to see that we had not been robbed. I immediately went to the window, and found my watch missing. I followed the watchman into the prisoner's room; he was searched; no watch was found upon him. I then uncovered the bed clothes, and in so doing I heard the ticking of a watch. I listened, and found the noise proceeded from the tester of the bed. I climbed up the bed post, and found my watch in two parts; the case of the watch in one part, and the body of the watch in another part. I got it down, and gave it the watchman, who asked me if it was my property; I said it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed did you shut the door - A. I think I did; I would not wish to swear I did; I have every reason to suppose I did. I did not lock the door; I rather think I shut it with the latch.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this room that Judge was in - A. Yes; it is No. 10. The prisoner's bed room was No. 12, in the gallery. I went round the gallery, as I do generally about one, to see that the doors were shut, and the candles all out, the prisoner rung the bell; I came down to the gate; I had been round to see all was safe. I put my hand against every door when I went round; I can say the door of No. 10 was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure Mr. Judge's door was shut, are you - A. It was shut. I do not come till ten o'clock on my duty. I went to the ring of the bell; the prisoner asked me if he could have a bed; I told him he must go up to the chambermaid, if there was one he might have one. She shewed him a bed at No. 12; that was the only bed that was left. He paid for the bed, and the chambermaid told me to see to the light. I watched while his light was burning, a quarter of an hour. I was up stairs. I heard the prosecutor say to the prisoner, what are you about here? and just as I came up to No. 10 the prisoner came out. I asked him what business he had in that gentleman's room. I went into the room, and asked them to look if they had lost anything. A gentleman came out of No. 11. We could not find the watch about the prisoner. I took the prisoner down to the watchman in the street, and just as I came back the prosecutor said he heard the watch upon the tester of the bed, and there it was found. I took the watch, and gave charge of the watch and the prisoner to the constable.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. I received the prisoner, and had the custody of the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the night stated by the prosecutor, I went to the Spread Eagle to sleep; I asked for a bed to sleep. I went up one pair of stairs for the purpose of going to bed; a short time after, I felt myself unwell; and although I urge that I was intoxicated, I know that will not be taken in my favour. I went out for the purpose of going to a water-closet; on my return I missed my own room, and put my hand against this door, which certainly was open, and not shut. I went into the room most certainly; one of the gentlemen asked me what I wanted.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181405250012"></xptr>I declared I had mistaken the room, and I believe I stated the reason I had so done. I went to my room, and was not met coming out of Mr. Judge's room. From that I went into my own room, when the last witness insisted I should put on my clothes, and go out of the house; some time afterwards, he said I should not go out of the house until he had enquired whether any gentleman had lost his property. Then I was taken to the Compter. While I was down stairs in the chambermaid's room, below, there was a cry in the gallery that a watch was found. I declare that I did not move any watch out of that room. As Mr. Judge had been in bed two hours before I went to bed, it is probable that some other person opened that gentleman's room, and not me. It is possible, and probable. At the same time, I hope the jury will take it into consideration that some other person had opened the room door. and had removed the watch. After I was out, they found it.</p>

               <p>4th June, I was on duty in Bishop Bonner's-fields—I was directed to gothere a little before three o'clock—there had been different meetings therethat afternoon, and placards posted up in the neighbourhood prior to thatday, one of which I have here—there was a meeting at half-past three, andanother at half-past five, at which I should say there were full 3, 000 or 4, 000 persons assembled—I was near enough to hear some of the speeches—a portion of the police were placed in the neighbourhood behind the Church—the last meeting broke up about seven, and a portion of the assembly, about 1, 000 persons, went towards a public-house, about fifty yards fromthe Church—I saw a policeman in uniform—they immediately commencedpelting him with stones—Inspector Waller passed immediately after, andthey immediately commenced throwing at him—the whole of the mob werethrowing hundreds of stones at the Church windows and at the police—thirty-six panes of glass were broken in the Church windows—in about fiveminutes the police were called out—I saw Callaghan pick up stones, andthrow them at the police and at the Church windows—he and Bingley wentbehind a building, and fetched large granite stones, some as large as my fist, and threw them—I followed them, and took Bingley and another person, but the other person was rescued from me—I took the stones out of Bingley'shand—I was thrown down and illused, but succeeded in holding him—themeeting was dispersed by the police—I called the police, and so did In<lb></lb>spector Waller.</p>

On Sunday, 4th June, betweenthree and four o'clock, I went with a party of the police into a Church in Bonner's-fields—there were then a great number of persons there—the mee<lb></lb>tingcontinued till past six, as near as I can recollect—about half-past six Ihad occasion to leave the place alone, to go to some of my force in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood—I had my uniform on—I returned in ten minutes, and saw anumber of persons opposite the Church—stones were thrown at the windows, which broke them—when I got near the Church I was observed, and theycalled out, "There goes the b——y inspector; down with him"—I wasstruck by stones, principally granites, on my limbs and head, and a brickstruck me in the loins—I was hurt, but not seriously—they were thrown by thepersons opposite the Church—I succeeded in getting into the Church, andheard the windows crashing in—a number of stones flew right into the Church—I was not there the first time that Shackell came—I was when he came thesecond time—I ordered my men out—I had forty-one of them—they had noother weapons than staves—I brought out the men, and requested the mob todisperse quietly—the answer I got was another volley of stones—a sergeantand seven men were hit by them, and wounded in different parts—thesergeant, was very severely cut in the head, and wounded in different places—this was before the police did anything—I then directed my men to dispersethe mob—on the police advancing, the mob resisted, and were very obstinateat first—the police were obliged to use their staves—we succeeded, after fiveor six minutes, in clearing that portion of the ground—the mob made a secondstand near the City of Paris, at the corner of Bonner's-Hall-field—they againthrew stones at the police—the police charged them again there, and drove them away.</p>

I wasa special-constable on Sunday, 4th June—after the meeting had separated, about seven o'clock, I saw part of the mob go towards the Church—I sawthree of the prisoners there throw stones at the Church—I assisted Potter intaking Couling—after the police came out to disperse the people near the Church I saw Illman knock policeman 92 <hi rend="italic">K</hi> down, with what I thoughtwas a stick—when I got up to him I found it was an iron bar—I saw Joneswith his arm up, as if he were throwing—I did not see the stone go—I ranup to him—a policeman seized him and said, "Take him to the Church"—Idid so, and locked him up.</p>

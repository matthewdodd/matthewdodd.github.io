                  </hi>. I am a tarpuling manufacturer. The prisoner was my journeyman and servant—it was part of his business to make hay-covers—I used to give him out the materials—he used to come to my house, and cut them out for himself—on 23rd April, I delivered to him a sufficient quantity of canvas to make forty-three nosebags—I am quite satisfied these nosebags produced by the pawnbroker are made of my canvas—I buy the Article in the piece; other people can buy it, and make nosebags of it—I received some pawnbroker's tickets from the prisoner's wife, arid gave them to the policeman; this is one of them; I marked it on the back—I gave the prisoner into custody on the same day that I received them, and told him he was charged with stealing my property, of which I had got the tickets—he said he was very sorry for what he had done, or was very sorry for it; I cannot say which—I am very deaf.</p>

I went with Mr. Leah, and took the prisoner—Mr. Leah said, "I have brought an officer to take you into custody for pawning my goods"—the prisoner said he was very sorry for what he had done, he had been laid up with rheumatic gout for a length of time, and got so badly off he was obliged to make away with the goods.</p>

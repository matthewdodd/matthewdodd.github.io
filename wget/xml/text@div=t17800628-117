Upon the 7th of June, between ten and eleven o'clock, the mob came by our door; the first person I saw was the prisoner and a man in blue drummer's clothes; the prisoner had an ax over his left shoulder; the mob got very thick to Mr. Gerrard's door. Then the prisoner called shew a book, and a bible was put out; presently after I saw two pannels of the door broke with the thick part of the ax, I believe; I did not see him break any other part of the house; then the mob got in, and the first man I saw at the one-pair-of-stairs window was the prisoner at the bar; he leaned out of the window, waved his hand, and said buzza! all Popery! A very little after that I saw him bring a drawer of linen and books to the window, and he cried again buzza, all Popery. Our house is opposite; our yard adjoins Mr. Gerrard's house; they wanted to burn the things in our yard. I desired they would not, as there were wooden things in the yard. The furniture was thrown out at the windows, the windows were broke, and the wainscoting torn sadly by the side of the windows; and two of the middle pannels were broke. The prisoner, I believe, continued there three quarters of an hour; I did not see him come out but I saw him go down the street with something to burn, but what it was I do not know.</p>

               <p>When did you see him again? - The Monday after in New Prison. My husband said I should go to see if it was the same person I had given a description of him before to my husband, and one Mr. Hawei, that he was a very tall man, and had some defect in his mouth.</p>

               <p>I live in Peartree-street. On Wednesday evening, when the mob came there I was standing at my door. The prisoner was the first man I saw; there were a great number of people with him hallooing all up the street; I did not hear what they said; I afterwards saw the prisoner at Mr. Gerrard's one-pair-of-stairs window; he put his hand upon the ledge, and cried out huzza, all popery by G - d. I saw him break the glass of the beauset, and pull the wainscoting out of the window and throw it into the street; he then went to the next window and took the top drawer out of a chest of drawers which was full of linen; and he brought it upon his head to the window, and threw it out and huzza'd; he then threw out a quart bowl full of some thing, and huzza'd. I did not see him afterwards; I am perfectly sure the prisoner is the man; it was near eleven o'clock at night when I saw him; I went afterwards with Mr. Crouch to the prison, and saw him, and I knew him directly by a disfigurement I observed in his teeth.</p>
               <p>Was you very near him when you observed that? - Yes, the window was not very high; I was opposite, not above seven or eight yards off. He had a light great coat on quite open, a leathern apron, and he had an ax in his hand. I staid there about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was you with this man in the prison? - Not long; he was in the yard; I had no conversation with him; he was talking to a number of persons in the prison.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was not the time you saw him in the prison the first time you observed the defect in his teeth? - No, I observed it when I saw him at the window.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 74, in Fore street; on Tuesday the 6th of June, the prisoner and I went to Peckham, we supped there at eleven o'clock; then I came home to his lodging, and slept with him that night; I got up in the morning and went to work; about a quarter after seven in the evening on Wednesday, I met him with a bag of tools on his back, he asked me to go home and have a bit of supper with him; when we came to the end of the court, in sight of Murphy's hous e, Murphy's house was very near down, it was between seven and eight o'clock; he made use of an oath and said, Who would have thought they would have pulled his house down! he shook his head and said, Bad work! bad work! we went up the court to his lodging; Mrs. Hayward was quite frightened, and said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Hand, they will certainly come up this court," and she got him to write No Popery on the window-shutters; we staid near half an hour, and then went out to the end of the court; they said the mob were going to pull down Mr. Cassaday's house, which is higher up; we went to Mr. Cassaday's; Mr. Hand said, he hoped they would not pull the house down, he would try to pacify them. The mob came round there twice; they gave the mob beer, and pacified them; we staid to supper, and went home to his lodging a little before twelve; St. Paul's struck remarkably loud as we went down the lane; I observed to him, that St. Paul's struck remarkably loud; he replied, there will be rain. Then we went to his lodging; we saw Mr. Hayward, I believe Mrs. Hayward was in bed, I did not see her, nor ask where she was. My Lord, I forgot to remark, that when we had been at Cassaday's about half an hour, we went to Mr. Langdale's, hearing his house was on fire; the prisoner lives in Union-court; he said his master's house would be burnt down, and he should lose all his tools; we went to Mr. Scott's, as his chest and some of his tools were there; Mr. Scott said there was no danger. We then went to Mr. Woollaston's, and asked if they wanted any help; they said they wanted all they could get; we staid and assisted them about half an hour; I believe it was near ten o'clock when we came away. We then went up to Mr. Cassaday's; we met Mr. Hayward near Mr. Woollaston's, we went with him to Long-lane, and bought a pig's head, or part of a pig's head; Mr. Hayward then went home without us, and we went immediately to Cassaday's, and staid till twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>(On his cross examination, he said he frequently slept with the prisoner when he was out late; that he was constantly with the prisoner that night till twelve; that the prisoner was in no riot; that he (the witness) was a serjeant in the yellows; that he frequently went home with the prisoner, but could not particularly mention any other day when he had done so.)</p>

               <p>I was in Mr. Gerrard's house when the mob came; I staid till it was all over; I never saw the prisoner in my life, to my knowledge, till I saw him afterwards in prison. Mr. Gerrard went out between seven and eight o'clock, and left the keys with Mr. Travers and me; we staid in the house till about ten o'clock; then we came out and locked the door, and staid at the door till the mob came; then a tall man came and knocked at the door, but not the prisoner, to my thinking he was a great deal older, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280274"></xptr> had a thin face, a black beard, a wig on, and he had a light drab frock: that man would have set the house on fire if it had not been for me and some of the neighbours; I did not observe any thing in his hand; he appeared cool, but very resolute to set the house on fire; I told them there was nobody in the house, and then two brewers servants broke two pannels of the door with a pump handle.</p>

               <p>Had either of those two, or the tall man, an ax? - I saw an ax, after it was done, in a drummer's hand; that was after they had got the goods down into Goswell-street, and set them on fire.</p>

               <p>When they first came up did you observe any of them to have an ax? - I did not, indeed my flurry was very great; Mr. Couch informed me a person was taken up, and desired me to go with him to see him; I said I could not be certain to the person, I think the man that was there was something shorter than the prisoner, and had a wig; I do not think the prisoner is the man. When they had broke the pannels of the door I resigned the key to a Mr. Berry, and went away to a relation's of Mr. Gerrard's, to enquire for him; when I returned they were bringing out the goods to burn in Goswell-street.</p>
               <p>Was Berry so situated as to observe the people who were there? - He was at the door, and opened it to let them in.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watch-motion maker. I live opposite Mr. Gerrard's. I was at the door when the mob first came up; there were about six.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280275"></xptr> I went over and expostulated with them; I made an observation on two persons in particular one was a middle sized man, in the habit of a drummer, the other was a tall man, in a drayman's jacket; the same man I had before seen at the Sun. I did not observe any other tall man; I spoke to the drummer and told him of the impropriety of his conduct. He said, he was forced by the mob to come there; he had a bar of iron or something headed with iron with which he broke the frames of the sash and the glass in the one-pair-of-stairs room; he broke one of the pannels of the door, and I fetched him the key from Mr. Travers to prevent him doing any further mischief. I talked to him a good deal and told him the hoose belonged to a Protestant but without effect; he seemed to be determined to do all the mischief he could; after the door was broke open I heard a boy ask what books there were? I went up to the one-pair-of-stairs floor with them, and staid with them till they went away. There were in the one-pair-of-stairs boys, in all about seven or eight; they destroyed the glass and window frames, and threw what goods there were into the street.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any person in the one-pair-of-stairs window calling out to the mob All Popery here? - Yes; the man in the drummer's jacket did; the man's face, who called out all Popery, was so dirty with the work he was about that I do not think I should know him again.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say the man had an iron bar or something headed with iron, was that strait or crooked? - I apprehended it to be an ax; the prisoner is not the person who had it, he has not the most distant resemblance to the man I have been speaking of; the person who did the mischief had larger features and was a taller man; there is so little likeness that I do not think it possible to mistake the one for the other.</p>

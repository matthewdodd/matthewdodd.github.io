                  </hi>. I am shop boy to Mr. Merchant, of Aldgate. The prisoner came there to buy a pair of double soled boots—I tried some on her, and they were too small, and some more, and they were too large—I then attended to a gentleman who came in, and while I was doing so, she went to the door, took a pair of boots which were tied together on a nail on the door post, and put them under her frock—she came in again, and I accused her of taking a pair—she told me I might feel in her pocket, and that she could give me a character from her mistress, over the way at the butcher's—I felt round her dress, and felt a bump; she told me I was not to feel there, I was to fetch a woman—I said that I would fetch a police<lb></lb>man—she ran across the road, and I ran after her—she ran into a passage, and I saw the boots fall from under her clothes—she picked them up, held them in her hand, and hallooed out for her mistress—a lady said that her mistress did not live there—she said that she had paid me a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bit for the boots, and was going to run again, but I pushed her into a shop, shut the door, and fastened it till a policeman came.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Bond-street, Commercial-road. On 27th Sept., I met the prisoner in the road near the railway station, at Deptford—she accosted me, and asked where I was going—I told her I was going home by the New Cross railway—she asked me for money—I went with her up some bye-lane—during the time I was with her, she put her hand in my pocket—I did not lie down with her—I was walking with her when I missed my money out of my pocket—I gave her a shilling—I had connection with her; then I found her hand in my pocket—I had in my pocket about nine shillings and a pocket piece along with them, in my right hand pocket—it was all taken away but a halfpenny—I had a fourpenny piece and two or three halfpence—I asked her for it—I said, "I will be satisfied if you give me half of it"—she denied having it—two young chaps came up—I do not know who they were—when I saw a policeman I gave her in charge—I had had a little to drink—I knew what I was about—I was not the worse for liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>, 417). I was on duty at New Cross. I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor together—I heard them talking together very loud, and I went up to them—the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge—she said she had not the money—she produced one shilling, and said that was all she had about her—she was taken to the station house and searched—the prosecutor had been drinking a little, but seemed to know what he was about.</p>

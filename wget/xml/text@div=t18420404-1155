Between nine and ten o'clock in the evening of the 14th of March, the prosecutor and three women, one of whom was the prisoner, came in—they had some drink—the prosecutor fell asleep—he was half tipsy—I saw the prisoner take the watch out of his pocket, and put it into her bosom—she came to the front of the bar, and said, "My watch is ex<lb></lb>actly right by your clock"—the parlour bell rang—I went, and when I came back they were gone.</p>

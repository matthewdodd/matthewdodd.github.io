                  </hi>. I live at 28, Longford Road, Kentish Town—the deceased was my sister-in-law and lived at the same place—on 3rd August I was at my window, which looks into a yard to which the deceased and the prisoner both had access, and saw the prisoner take two counterpanes off a line and throw them in the dirt—the deceased ran down and asked her why she did that—she said, "Because I did"—one of the counterpanes belonged to me and one to the deceased"—the prisoner went to the line to take some more clothes off it—the deceased said, "They are not yours, they are mine; you do not know your own"—the prisoner said, "I will have my revenge," and took a large clothes-prop and <hi rend="italic">jammed</hi> it in my sister-in-law's eye, who fell to the ground—I hallooed out, "What are you doing there?"—she said, "If you come down I will serve you the same."</p>

I live at 17, Winchester Terrace, Kentish Town—on 3rd August, in the afternoon, I was hanging some birds out at my back window, and saw Mrs. Edwards and the prisoner in the yard, where some clothes were hanging—Mrs. Edwards was taking her clothes off the line, and the prisoner began smacking her face with her hand—Mrs. Edwards said, "I do not want to hit you," and was walking backwards towards the kitchen door—the prisoner gave her a good smack, and ran and got a clothes prop, took hold of the thick end of it, aimed at her face, and caught her in the eye—she said, "I will have my revenge," and Mrs. Edwards fell on her knees, with her face covered by her hands—I did not hear her say anything about her eye—I was only at my window at the beginning of it, and then I was by the wall, not ten yards off—the prisoner then took two large quilts off the line, and threw them over the deceased as she lay on the ground—the deceased's sister was looking out at a window, and the prisoner threatened her with the same if she would come down—the deceased did not take hold of the prop at all—she was taken upstairs, and there was a doctor and a female or two there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 16, Winchester Terrace—on the afternoon of 3rd August I was sitting at work at my bedroom window—I heard hard words, looked out, and then ran to the staircase window, which was wide open, and saw Mrs. Edwards taking some things off the line—the prisoner was using very rough words to her, but Jane Edwards was very calm—she said, "Do not you touch my things, I will take them in; why, you are excited, what is the matter with you?"—the prisoner slapped her face two or three times, and she seemed trembling—Mrs. Edwards said, "What will the neighbours think of you?"—the prisoner made some rough reply, which I did not hear, and slapped her face twice, once after the other, as quick as she could, and immediately took the prop down and struck, her with it—the deceased put her hand to her eye, and fell in a kneeling posture—the prisoner threw the prop down on the left side of the deceased;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170062"></xptr>
               <p>she then took up some clothes, which she had been scattering about, and threw them at her, but whether they went on her I do not know—I after-wards bathed the deceased's eye—they are strangers to me—I do not know them by sight, although I have lived opposite twelve months—I do not know that I ever saw the landlady before, that is the deceased.</p>

I am in the service of Mr. John Roger Watkins, of 1, Portland-villas, Bow-road, and was so on 10th December—between 10 and 11 o'clock that night I closed the house and went to bed—the house was then safe and secure—I came down in the morning about half-past 6, and found four bars taken from the pantry window, and the window-frame smashed in so that there were means of getting in through there—I searched and missed a silver cream jug, two pepper castors, from the parlour cup<lb></lb>board, sugar tongs, and table cloths, from the drawer in the breakfast-room,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector K.</hi>) About 1 o'clock on the morning of 4th March, the prisoner White was brought to the station—he said he lived at 12, Violet-street, Devons-road, Bromley—I saw a key taken from him, and went to 12, Violet-street with it—I opened the front door with it, and went in and searched—I found a woman and child there in bed—I found this table cloth marked "J. R. Watkins, 1847," a pair of silver sugar tongs, on the dresser, and this shawl on the bed—I found nothing else there relating to this indictment—I did not receive any information from White or hear him make any statement either before or after I went there—on Friday, 7th March, I went to Rose-court, Beer-lane, City, and saw Mrs. Abrahams there in a down stairs room mangling—I said, "Is your name Mrs. Abrahams?"—she said, "Yes"—I asked her if she had a son-in-law of the name of Frederick White, living in Bromley—she said she had—I asked her if she ever received any coats, pieces of cloth, table covers or cloths, any silver pepper castors, a silver milk jug, or any other articles from White—she said she had not—I said, "You have not? but White has told me so, and I must search your house"—she said, "Well, there is a coat up stairs which White gave me"—she went upstairs, I with her, and she handed me this coat, which was identified by the last witness—she said, "A table cloth I put in the fire yesterday; I saw it was marked with red letters, and I burnt it"—I said, "Where are the silver pepper castors and the silver milk jug?"—she said they were at her son's house, 3, St. Andrew's-hill, Blackfriars—I then told her I should take her into custody for receiving those things knowing them to have been stolen, and I went with her and the constable to her son's house, 3, St Andrew's-hill—I went into a back room on the second-floor, where I saw three females, and asked them some questions—one of them, named Mary Ann Atley, handed me the key of a bureau in the front room, in consequence of something I had said to her—I took the key and opened the bureau with it, and found in it two silver pepper castors and a silver milk jug—they are not identified—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Watkins"—a part of the other has also been darned over, and the name of Charles Abrahams marked on it—here it is; in marking ink—I then asked him if ever he had received any pieces of cloth or any coats from White—he said he had not—I said, "I shall take you into custody for receiving these things that were stolen," meaning the pepper castors—he then said that he had given Fred. White a guinea for the silver pepper castors and the milk jug, and I then took him to Bow-station—I took possession of other articles in the house—Sarah Shank was at the station, and on my producing the articles she said, in the prisoner's presence, that they were her master's, taken from the house on the night of 10th December—I did not hear him make any reply to that—on 8th March, Mary Ann Abrahams and Charles Abrahams were each in a separate cell connected with the charge room—I went to visit the female prisoner's cell at 9 o'clock, and she said, "Can I speak to you, Sir, in the presence of my son?"—I said, "Certainly"—I unlocked the door of Charles Abrahams' cell, and brought him to the door of his mother's cell, she took him by the hands, cried, and kissed him, and said, "Charley, let us tell all about it and make a clean breast of it"—I brought them into the charge room and sat down—I said, "Mrs. Abrahams, before you make any statement to me it is my duty to caution you; do not tell me anything to criminate yourself, but whatever you tell me will be taken down in writing, and used in evidence against you"—she then repeated the following statement, which I took down in writing, "When first <hi rend="italic">Fred,</hi> White came to me, he brought me eleven pieces of cloth, which he stated he found when coming from work; I sent four pieces of the cloth to my sister Mrs. Taylor, Pearley-cottage, Brighton-road, Croydon; then he brought me what my son has given you last night (<hi rend="italic">meaning these articles;</hi>) then he brought me the coat, which I gave up to you last night, and told me he bought it in Petticoat-lane for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; three pieces of cloth I sent to Mrs. Franklin, at Islington, to sell for me"—the prisoner Charles then immediately said, "And four pieces I had; "he continued: "Now I will tell you, Sir; you asked me last night if I had not got an Inverness cape and a pair of boots; well, I had; it was got out of pawn by <hi rend="italic">Fred.</hi> White himself; the amount was 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the ticket; I disposed of them both, but I can get them back again; I know where there are two pieces of the cloth, one my wife has and one Miss Mitford has; the cape is at Mr. Starkey's, at St Mary-at-Hill; the boots our second mate had on board the <hi rend="italic">Earl of Auck<lb></lb>land"</hi>—that is all—on the morning of the 8th, at Stepney station, he made a further statement to me—on 11th March, while at the Court and passing the cell, White said, "Officer, can I speak to you?"—I said, "What do you want?"—he said, "Just tell my sisters I want to speak to them"—his sisters came to the cell door and handed him some tea or coffee, and bread-and-bntter—he said, "Officer, I stole all them coats, all them pieces of cloth and table cloths, and them silver things; Mrs. Abrahams told me to steal all that I could, and bring them to her to dispose of them"—she was not there.</p>

               <p>every week—when I came in he asked me whether I had got the table cloths as well as these things—I swear that I called his attention expressly to the mark, "J. R. Watkins," and he said it had been altered—he said they were not in that state, meaning about the mark being darned over—I have heard the evidence of the servant girl—I heard her say they were in the same state as when they were lost, but I do not think she rightly understood it—the two sisters were present when the conversation with White occurred, and they heard what took place—the police-court and the station oommunicate, and a person passing from the station to the Court the back way, would pass the cells—I came down stairs at 9 in the morning, and went to look at the prisoner's cell, and then Mrs. Abrahams addressed me—the two Abrahams were not under remand at the time—they had not been committed—they had been about twelve or fifteen hours in custody—they employed Mr. Young, a solicitor, to defend them, and yet they made that communication to me—when I was taking it down at the station, the sergeant on duty was present—he is not here—I did not take White's statement down; not the part where he denied saying anything about Mrs. Abrahams—it was in the open yard, and there was no convenience for taking it down—I generally carry a pencil and memorandum-book, but not always—I have not got one in my pocket now of any kind—I have other papers besides this scrap—I might have taken his statement down if I had been so inclined, the two sisters being there made no difference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It was not so worth while taking that down when they were present as when you had the mother and son all to yourself in the cell; is that the reason you did not take it down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the reason was that I had no memorandum-book, and it was in the yard—I have been getting up the case—I summoned some witnesses, and gave instructions in the office for the indictment—I did not think it necessary to employ an attorney—I do not understand more about these cases myself.</p>

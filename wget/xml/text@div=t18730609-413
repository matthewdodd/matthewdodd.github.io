I carry on business as a portmanteau manu<lb></lb>facturer, at 255, Fulham Road—on 27th March the two prisoners drove up in a pony and cart to my shop—I had known Symons before—they came into the shop—Symons introduced me to White, and said they were going to open a shop in the King's Road, but previous to doing so they were going out of town to enjoy themselves for a week, and they would give me orders for bags and portmanteaus—Symons asked White for a form, and they gave me this memorandum—the goods I supplied first were for their own use, to go out of town with—they had eight articles first and two afterwards—I only saw them once—my boy, James Elliott, took the goods home, and in consequence of a piece of paper he brought back, some other goods were furnished—the value of the goods was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

White and Company" up—I knocked at the door, and a Mr. Clark from opposite called me over—when the prisoners came the first time we went to a public-house and had a glass of ale together—I did not converse with them as to what they were going to do with the shop—they said they were going to have a front put in—we only stopped at the public-house about five minutes—they drove up in a pony and gig, and I ask Symons if it was the same pony and trap he had before, and he said "Yes"—I knew him slightly from seeing him in a place where I have my luncheon—I did not know him in any business capacity, or know what he was.</p>

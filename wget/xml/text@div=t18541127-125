                  </hi>. I am an iron moulder, and live in Lizard-street, St. Luke's. On the night of 13th Oct., I and my wife were at the George public house, at Bank-side, Southwark—the prisoner was standing there with a female, and some filthy conversation was taking place between them—it was so filthy, that I told them they ought to be ashamed of themselves for using such language where decent people were—the female appeared very angry at that, and tried to claw at my face—I had not touched her—I only put my hand towards her, to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> her away; but I did not touch her—on my doing that, she turned to the prisoner, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, he has struck me"—upon hearing her say that, the prisoner came and struck me in the face—I returned the blow, and we had something of a fight for three or four minutes—at the termination of the fight, I felt a violent blow in my side—I went into the parlour, and could hardly draw my breath—I afterwards found that I had been stabbed, just in the loins—it bled a little—some brandy stopped it—I was attended by a surgeon—the wound was dressed in the parlour—it was a sort of dagger wound—it was a stab, rather a deep wound—after being attended by a surgeon, I went to the hospital, and was there four weeks and three days—I feel the effects of it now, and I am afraid I always shall.</p>

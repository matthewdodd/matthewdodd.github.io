                  </hi> I live in Edward-street, North-road, and am time-keeper to Mr. Thomas Grissell, a builder—the prisoner was his carman, and was employed in carrying coke from Vauxhall to Mr. Grissell's houses in Queen's-row, Bayswater—I was set to watch on Tuesday, 16th Nov., near the Swan public-house, in Bayswater-road—I saw the cart loaded with coke about two o'clock that day, and I saw the prisoner take a sack with about a bushel of something in it, from the front part of the cart—I told Mr. Gam<lb></lb>mon what I had seen, and I wrote T. G. and a cross on some small bits of paper that evening, and gave them to Mr. Gammon on the following morning—on the Wednesday I again saw the prisoner take a sack from the cart just as before—he carried the sack on his back down by the side of the Swan leading to a livery yard—I afterwards saw him hand a sack of coke down to somebody else—he then removed on to Queen's-row, where the houses are</p>

               <p>building—I had seen the prisoner start on the Wednesday morning—he took his cart and sacks, and I saw him put a sack up in the cart beside what was in it—I supposed it to be this mixed food—I saw him put on the horses nose-bags and feed them at the Swan—I had seen the nose-bags filled, before he left the stable, from the corn-bin—I went with the officer to the Swan, and searched the corn-bin in the livery stable—I found a small piece of paper—I gave it to the officer and told him to open it—he said there was T. G. and a cross on it—I said, "Let me look at it," and it was one which I had written on the Tuesday evening, and had given to Mr. Gammon on Wednes<lb></lb>day morning before the prisoner left.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 181.) On Thursday morning, the 18th, I saw the prisoner come out of the Swan public-house—he got on the front of the cart, and banded a sack half full of something to a man named Brewer—he took it down the Swan Livery-yard—he returned, and then the prisoner handed a sack three parts fall down to Brewer—he took that down in the same direction—I went down the yard, and saw Brewer come out of the stable with an empty sack—he took it up the yard, and threw it on the cart—the prisoner was on the cart, and he then went on—I afterwards went with Attride and another officer to the coach-house, and found one sack full of coke, another sack three parts full, and about three or four sacks of coke had been shot down—the corn-bin was about half full of beans, oats, and out clover-chaff—there was about a bushel and a half—Attride gave me this small piece of paper—I was standing by the side of the bin, when he found it in a handful of corn, which he took up in his hand—I saw the prisoner about three hours after that, he was proceeding towards the gas-works with his cart—I told him that Mr. Grissell had received information that he was in the habit of leaving coke on his way to Bayswater, and he thought it was not correct, and I was instructed by Mr. Gammon to order him to proceed to the yard with his cart—he said, "Let us go to the Gas-works first"—I told him he had better go to the yard—he wished to go to the Gas-works to see if he had not paid for the coke—he said he had bought it—he went on to Mr. Grissell's, and I followed—I saw Mr. Gammon there, and I told him in the prisoner's presence that I had seen the prisoner that morning come out of the Swan, about half-past nine o'clock, and hand down two sacks, one half full, and the other three parts full of something, and they were carried down the Swan-yard, and in searching the corn-bin I found this paper—I took a sample of corn from the prosecutor's yard, to compare with that in the bin at the Swan—they corresponded, but they got mixed together by mistake at the police-office—they are not distinct now.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to Mr. Thomas Grissell—the prisoner was in his employ as carman, to take things to the buildings—on Tuesday, 16th Nov., I received from Attride from fifty to a hundred small pieces of paper rolled up—this is one of them—it has T.G., and a cross on it, and is Attride's writing—I threw the pieces of paper in the corn<lb></lb>bin with the mixed food of oats, split beans, and clover-chaff—the beans were Egyptian beans, and from that bin I saw the prisoner fill his nose-bags, and then take about a bushel and a half in a sack—that was not regular—he should have gone to the man for that—he would have been allowed to have some for his horses during the day—I have seen the beans produced from the bin at the Swan—they were Egyptian beans—there was clover-chaff in that, and a small quantity of meadow-hay, but none in ours—when the officer brought the prisoner to me, he asked if I would allow him to remain at home that night—I told him I had no authority to do so, as he had been seen to leave his corn two days—he said he had left a little, but it should not occur again—I told him I was very sorry he had been so foolish, after being with us so many years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you been asking him about his leaving coke? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I also told him he had left coke, and had left his corn two days, and then he said he had left some, or left a little—we do not allow our men to buy and sell coke, it would be contrary to our orders—we allow the prisoner and other men to take home a sack or two in their cart when they have done work—I put the papers in the bin about a quarter past six o'clock in the morning, and about half-past six the corn was taken out—I saw the prisoner return home on Wednesday—nothing had been said to him when he went out on Thursday—he had brought home some feed on Thursday, but none on Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>

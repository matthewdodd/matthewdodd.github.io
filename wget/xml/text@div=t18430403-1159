                  </hi>. I am a smith and bell-hanger, and live in Penny-fields, Poplar. On the 27th of Feb., between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, the prisoner came and asked me for employment—I told him I had not half work to do for myself—he said if he could but get the use of a fire he should be able to get a crust of bread—I said it was very hard to see him starving, I would let him have a fire, which I did—two days afterwards I let him have some old iron to work up—I afterwards missed an iron carrier and screw, four hammers, and a great deal of iron, besides what I let him have to work—this is my carrier—the screw is gone—this hammer is mine, and one of those I missed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wood-turner, and live in Park-street, Poplar. The prisoner came to me on a Friday early in March, with this iron carrier, and asked if it would be of any use to me—I said, "Not without a larger screw"—he said he could easily make one—he left this with me, and never returned—I bought this hammer of him for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was to give him more when he brought the screw.</p>

The prosecutor gave the pri<lb></lb>soner into my custody at a public-house in Three Colt-street, Limehouse, on the Monday afternoon—the prisoner asked what it was for—the prosecutor said, "For stealing an iron carrier"—he then said, "The carrier is my own property, I made it myself; Freeman never had such a thing in his shop; he did not know the use of it."</p>

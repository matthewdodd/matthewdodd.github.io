On the 4th of this month, between one and two o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop, she asked for a pair of shoes that were in the window; she tried them on, and said, she would be measured for a pair. I measured her foot. She said, she lived at No. 7, Finsbury-square; she went out of the shop. After I had measured her, I looked at the horse of shoes; I thought I missed two pair of girls shoes. I went after her, and overtook her; I told her she had stolen some of my shoes; she said, she had not. Two pair dropped at her feet; I picked them up. I saw them fail; them two pair are mine. The third pair dropped from under her shawl, on my counter. These are the three pair; they are worth nine shillings. She said, she meaned to come back to pay me for them.</p>

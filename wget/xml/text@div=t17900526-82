               <p>I am a smith: I work for the prosecutor: the prisoner was my shop-mate. On the 23d of April, the prisoner was very bad; on the 24th he went down for his coat; and he said thank God, he was a great deal better since he had the flannels round him: and I saw a bar of iron stick out of his coat; I followed him up Jewry-street; the iron was in his left hand coat pocket; I followed him to Aldgate; I lost him a few minutes; I saw him again in Petticoat-lane, offering it for sale: (produced and deposed to): I took it out of his pocket; the woman did not buy it; I took it from him at the shop; he said he took it to buy him bread.</p>

               <p>I picked up the iron; I never offered it for sale; and I told the man I picked it up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

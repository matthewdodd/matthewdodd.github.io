                  </hi>. I am one of the detective officers of the Metropolitan police—I took the prisoner on 8th July this year—I asked him if his name was Duroy—he replied, "I do not speak English"—I put the question in French, and he said, "Yes; it is"—I said, "You are charged with forging the name of Juste Masson, and obtaining the sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he replied, "It is a very dirty trick; we were so intimate, I thought I might sign his name."</p>

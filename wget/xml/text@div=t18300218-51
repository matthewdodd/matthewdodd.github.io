On Saturday, the 23rd of January, I went out, and left some meat in my shop - I pulled the door too, but did not shut it; the watchman took the prisoner into custody - I heard of the robbery, went to the watch-house, and saw the meat, which I knew to be mine.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WELLS. I am a watchman. I met the prisoner in a court, about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's; he had a bundle under his arm - as soon as he saw me he knocked at the first door he came to, and asked if one Sam lived there - they said No; I then asked what he had got - he said some meat; I looked into the bag, and saw two breasts of mutton, neither of which were chopped, and a piece of beef, which had this book in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was standing at the top of Petticoat-lane, and a man came and asked me to take this meat to Sam Shagger in Love-court; I inquired at about twenty houses, and could not find him - the watchman then saw me, he asked what I had got, and found the breasts of mutton and the piece of beef.</p>

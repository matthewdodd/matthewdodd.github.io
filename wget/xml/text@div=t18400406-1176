                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at Tottenham. About twelve o'clock, on the 13th of March, when I came into the shop my nephew told me something—I went about a hundred yards towards Edmonton, when I saw the prisoners in conversation—I took Fitzsimmons by the collar, and asked where the twist was that he took from my shop—he denied it—Wil<lb></lb>liams then ran off—I pursued him towards Scotland-green—he was stopped by a gentleman—I handed him to an officer—he was searched, and this silk twist found on him—it is mine, and is worth 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I missed exactly this quantity, and know it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How near to your shop did you see them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Within fifty yards, and within sight of my house—the twist was kept in a drawer—there is nothing extraordinary in the colour or the doing up—only in the pinning of them—we make it a regular practice, when we cut twist, to make a knot, and stick a pin.</p>

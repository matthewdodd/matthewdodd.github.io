I am a music engraver and live at 4, Chain Terrace, Edinburgh—I knew the prisoner at Edinburgh, about nine years ago—on the 30th April, 1867,1 was present when he married Mary Ambrose at her sister's house—I don't know all the witnesses, but I brought the minister to the house in a cab—I saw her last Saturday night—she was then alive.</p>

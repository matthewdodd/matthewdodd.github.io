               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take it? - I did not; I missed the pot, I went into the tap room, and missed the pot;the prisoner had been in the house several times that day, for a penny worth of beer at a time; she had used the house for a long time, and a number of other houses that way. I then followed out the prisoner, who went up a passage. I called the gentleman who is here as a witness, I desired him to follow her, that I might not be at the back of him, and she might not see me, I supposed she had got a quart pot of mine, she went up to the top<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300155"></xptr>of the alley and he followed her and went up to her, and took this quart from her arm, which she had covered over with her cloak.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not go out of the alley.</p>
               <p>Green. This is the pot, my name is on it, and as soon as I took the pot I put a private mark on it, and it has never been used since, nor been out of my possession. When first I caught hold of her I asked her where she was going? and what she had got? she said she had had nothing; I then turned back her cloak, and found the pot. When she went before the magistrate she said she was going to the workhouse that evening, and that she took it for the purpose of boiling water in it; but when I caught hold of her, she said she was going to bring it back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going to the workhouse that very night; I lived thirty years with one woman in the same place, and that woman died about a fortnight before this happened to me. I never was in gaol in the whole course of my life; one and another asked me to drink as I was going to the workhouse that night, and I was really over come with strong beer, and I did not know what I did.</p>

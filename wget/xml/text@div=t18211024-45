             (since deceased), he was then vestry-clerk. The weekly pensions, are paid every Friday morning, in the vestry - I attended for my father to ascertain the settlements of the paupers. On the 18th of June, 1818, I had occasion to make an examination of the prisoner, on his applying for relief, and took the examination down (reads) "A single man, carpenter, claims settlement by living with Mr. May, No. 35, London-wall, ink maker, two years and seven months, under a yearly hireling, sleeping in the house all the time - left his service eleven years ago, and went to sea, seven years to Gibralter, and has been about two years in England; never paid above 2 s. a week rent, lived in Nagg's Head-court, and Fox-court, Gray's Inn-lane". I took this statement from his mouth; Mr. Tyrrell, was present at the time. I myself did not relieve him on that occasion. On the 5th of September, 1818, I relieved him with 3 s. in consequence of his representation, on the part of the parish, the churchwardens paid me the money.</p>

            . I am the inspector of payements in the City. In June 1818, I acted for Mr. Deputy Paynter, the senior churchwarden, and remember being present with Mr. Davis, when the examination of the prisoner was taken - he said if 15 s. was given him, he could go to Bristol, and should need no further relief - I gave him the 15 s., the parish paid me the money; I have a memorandum in the book, that it was given him to go to Bristol. On the 1st of August, I relieved him with 3 s. 6 d., I gave him 15 s. more on the 12th of September, on the score of the same pretence.</p>

            . I am assistant overseer of the parish. The first application the prisoner made to me, was in July, 1818, and in November, 1819, I had seen him relieved by the churchwardens - I told him I knew him to be an imposter, he denied it; I examined him, he gave me the same account as described in the examination, that he had lived with Mr. May, London-wall, as a yearly servant, for about sixteen months. I having been a neighbour of May's, knew it to be false - I laid him the money down, and told him to take it, at his peril. He took it.</p>

            . I am a hat manufacturer, and lived at No. 35, London-wall, and so did my father; he went there early in 1805, and continued four years. I never saw the prisoner before this day, he could not have lived there without my knowledge. No Mr. May lived in the neighbourhood. Mr. Oakey, a hat manufacturer, has had his house ever since.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN SHORE. I lived at No. 36, London-wall, from the year 1792 to 1819; Mrs. Leader and her daughter kept No. 35, until Mr. Hall took the premises, and after them Mr. Oakey, and since them Mr. Spencer. No May ever lived there.</p>

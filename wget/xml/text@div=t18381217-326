On the 3rd of December, I and my wife went to bed at a quarter-past ten o'clock—I had closed the parlour and shop, the street-door was shut, but not locked—my son came in about a quarter of an hour after we were at rest—he comes through my bed-room, to get to his own, he undressed himself, and went to his own room—his clothes were left on a chair in my bed-room—at twelve o'clock I was awoke by my wife, who said, "There is somebody in the room, don't you hear a noise?"—I said, "I don't hear it," and I went to sleep again—my wife awoke me at two o'clock, I went down stairs, and found a bundle of clothes at the foot of the stairs—they were my son's—I opened the street-door, and let in the watchman—I found a pair of shoes on the landing, adjoining the kitchen stairs—the pri<lb></lb>soner claimed them at the watch-house—he was found concealed behind a water-closet door, in my kitchen—he had no shoes on.</p>

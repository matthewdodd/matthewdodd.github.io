                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). On 16th November I saw the prisoner in a public-house, at the corner of Goldston-street, Whitechapel—I told him who I was, and asked him where he had got the goods which he sold to Mrs. Rothschild, of Duke-street, Aldgate, he said, "I have not sold her anything"—I put the same question three times at least, and he re<lb></lb>turned the same answer—I likewise showed him this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and told him to read it—it is a list of goods which were missing—he still denied it—I told him he must go with me to Mrs. Rothschild's—going along he asked me how long ago it was since he had sold the things to Mrs. Rothschild—I said, "About a fortnight or three weeks,"—he said, "I have not sold her anything"—I took him to Mrs. Rothschild, and she said that he was the man she bought the goods of—he turned round directly, and said, "She means those rags"—I took him to the station; he said it was a hard case for a poor man to be locked up innocent—I told him he would not be locked up innocent if he would give me information who he bought the things of—he said "Give me time, and no doubt I shall find the man"—I asked his de<lb></lb>scription; he said that it was a man dressed like a costermonger or a porter who was on' Change, and afterwards he said in Cutler-street, and that he gave 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not this what the prisoner said, "It was a lot of rubbish I sold her?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Rags or rubbish—he first said that he bought them in the Clothes Exchange, and afterwards in Cutler-street—I did not recollect at the Police-court that he had given two accounts—the conversation was in Mrs. Rothschild's house and hearing—this is the first time I have mentioned it—I did not take a note of it—I think there were two remands at the Police-court—there might be three examinations before the Magis<lb></lb>trate—I read my evidence over myself—there was not much occasion to ask for it to be corrected, because it was not material.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). I was with Mollineux; and have heard his statement of the prisoner denying that he had sold anything to Mrs. Rothschild—that is true—the inspector asked him where he bought the things—he said, "In the Change"—that is the Clothes Exchange, Petticoat-lane—the inspector asked him if he was certain of that, and he said that it was in Cutler-street, which is just outside the Exchange—I produce 142 lace falls, which I received from Mr. Longland.</p>

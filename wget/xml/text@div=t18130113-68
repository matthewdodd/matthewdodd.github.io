               <p>Q. Did you lose a pocket-book, and a five-pound bank note - A. Yes. On the 15th of December, about half past nine in the evening. I was in the Coach and Horses public-house, drinking with the prisoner. The prisoner was in the tap-room with two men. I sat down in the same box with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you next to her while you setting there - A. Yes, part of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you perceive your pocket book was gone - A. On the morning following.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you went into that public-house did you perceive your pocket-book about you - A. I had it in my pocket in the tap-room. The prisoner went part of the way home with me. I had never seen her before that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop any where with her - A. Yes, in the <placeName id="t18130113-68-crimeloc396">Cloisters, near Dean's yard</placeName>

                  </hi>. I am servant to James Henry Machu, a silk-trim<lb></lb>ming manufacturer, in Twister's-alley—the prisoner was warehouse girl in Mr. Machu's employ. On Saturday, the 19th of February, in const<lb></lb>quence of something that was said, Mr. Machu asked her where the halfpence were which he had missed from the desk, or if she had any halfpence—she said she had not seen them nor touched them—I then asked her if she had them—she said she had not—I said, "Go into the other room"—which she did, with me and my master.—I then went into another room to fetch a female to search her, and when I came back my master said she had taken the halfpence from her bosom, and laid them on the table—they were tied up in paper—I put a private mark on them—I sent for a policeman, and gave her in charge with them.</p>

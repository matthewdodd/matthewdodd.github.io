The hamper had the bottles mentioned in the indictment in it; I know them to be Mr. Kenton's property. We had been with wine to Lincoln's-Inn-fields, to the Strand, and to the Adelphi, and brought back three hampers of empty bottles.</p>

               <p>You asked the man where he was going? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did he not tell you that a man in a brown coat who was coming after him was the man he had them of? - Yes, he said he hired him. There was no man coming after him. I asked him where he was going; he said he would not tell.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the bottles are Mr. Kenton's property? - Yes.</p>

I went with him to a publick-house; there I saw the prisoner. I asked him how he came by the hamper. He said a man hired him to take it over the kennel, he having boots on; it was at the breaking up of the frost. I took him to the Compter, and there I left him.</p>

               <p>I am a carman. I was driving the cart in which the hampers were. When Mr. Kenton's man left me on Ludgate-hill to go round the foot-way the hampers were in the cart; when he came again to the cart there were two hampers gone. He left me immediately, and came again and said he had got one of them.</p>

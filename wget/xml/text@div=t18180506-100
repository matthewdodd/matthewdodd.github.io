I ordered my servant to open the house in the daytime, to air it-in the evening he did not come to shut it up, as usual - I went to do it myself. When I came to the door, I found it bolted inside. I got my gardener to go through the adjoining house, and get in the back way. He opened the front door, and let me and the watchman in. I found the copper unfixed, and taken into one of the parlours, and the lead pipe, which branches from the cistern, wrenched from the wall, but not taken away. I found the prisoner behind one of the bedroom doors, and gave him in charge - I knew nothing of him. Next morning I found a skeleton key, a screw-driver, and a file in the house.</p>

            . I am constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house - I found a knife on him. I asked him how he could go into the house, and take the copper? he said some ladies had been to see the house; as they went along the street he heard them say there were some very good fixtures, which induced him to go-that he had been four nights trying to get in, and that distress had driven him to it.</p>

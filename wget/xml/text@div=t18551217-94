                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Reed; we are stock brokers, in Austin-friars. The prisoner was in our service—he left us about the beginning of Dec, 1854—I dismissed him, for misappropriating a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not give him into custody—about a fortnight after that, I discovered that he had misappropriated 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I spoke to a policeman, and went to Moor-lane, and stated the case, and also to Hamp<lb></lb>stead, and stated the case there, he living there at that time—I did not see him again till he was apprehended—this is the cheque—it is signed by my partner—it was brought to me by the prisoner, who asked me to mark it for cash, as Mr. Fisher had no banker—I did so, and returned it to him—it was his duty to hand it to Mr. Fisher—I have since paid Mr. Fisher that 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., probably within a month—on 28th Oct., here is a sum entered</p>

               <p>of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,. which the prisoner was to pay to Mr. Everett, and he has not paid it—I know the prisoner had it—it is in his writing—he has charged me with the payment of it, and I have had to pay it again—these two trams were discovered after I had dismissed him—I discovered his address at the Eastern Counties Railway—he had given his address there, and I instructed the police to take him on the Friday before the last Session at this Court.</p>

ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe the Committee were sitting at the Eastern Counties Railway? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I gave instruction at Vine-street station, and to Cole—I did not give instruction to Cole to go to the Eastern Counties, and wait—I did not give instruction to Few—this entry is in the prisoner's handwriting—he was in the habit of getting sums from me to pay various accounts—this was one he would have to pay—I should say he had been with me three or four years—I do not know his age—here are my initials on this cheque—Mr. Reed is not here—I think he has been my partner three years—Mr. Waddington and Mr. Bond have been clients of mine during the whole of the time the prisoner was in my service—here is the cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have not charged this in the indict<lb></lb>ment—I dismissed the prisoner in Dec.—I have never spoken to him about these two items—I have never seen him since I detected these two items—I have never spoken to him with regard to Everett's and Fisher's moneys—I gave information to the police immediately, to a man named Few—I gave information at Hampstead to the inspector, who was there—I do not know his name—I gave orders to apprehend him at Hampstead, and to Few—I gave orders at the Vine-street station only lately—I went there last Friday fortnight, when he was apprehended—I knew he lived at Hampstead, which was why I went there in the first instance—I never got any warrant to apprehend him—my reason for not prosecuting him before is, I have not found him—I have been determined all along to prosecute him the moment I could get him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect sending to his father subsequently to this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not swear that it was not after this—his father called on me, and I had some conversation with him—I think I sent for his father, but to the best of my recollection it was on two other charges—my impression is that it was before I discovered these two items, and with reference to some others, but I will not swear it—I heard that the prisoner had been at Mason's Hall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that you have not seen the father, and spoken to a gentleman of the name of Kemp, and asked him how he could treat a man there who had robbed you of these sums? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My impression is, that I have not seen Mr. Kemp since I have heard the prisoner was at that dinner—I do not think I have—my impression is, that I heard he had been about Basinghall-street some mouths after this—I do not know that some rela<lb></lb>tion of mine was presiding at that dinner—I do not know that my own father in law presided—I never heard so—I heard that the prisoner had been at some place there—we have had a great many dealings with Mr. Bond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were those transactions closed in 1854 or 1853, by. his paying you a large sum of money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell how it was settled—the account between us was settled—I have not since made a large demand on Mr. Bond for mining shares—there has been a question with regard to mining shares, involving about 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those are the shares paid for by him, and by his order, put in this young man's name, put</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185512170015"></xptr>
               <p>in the name of our clerk—Mr. Bond denies that he gave us authority to buy them, and to use any other person's name—I do not know that there has been constantly applications made to the prisoner for payment of calls—I should think, in the ordinary course of business, he would be called on for calls if they knew his address—when I gave information, I do not know what address I gave—probably it would be our own office—I do not know that the address was given at his own private residence—he might probably write the name out himself upon which the shares were given—it would probably not be necessarily known to me at all—I have bought no more shares in his name that I remember—I have some recollection that some years ago a Mr. Smith asked me to put some shares in his name, but what they were I quite forget—it was done for a gentleman that asked me to do it—I believe some shares were put in his name three or four years ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you give some evidence before the Eastern Counties Com<lb></lb>mittee? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> gave a repetition of some statement, you cannot call it evidence—I heard Mr. Reed examined, and Mr. Whitehorn's name was mentioned—I heard that they called for me to give my evidence, and I said I was at Guildhall, prosecuting this young man—I did not know at that time that he had been summoned to give evidence before the committee—I know his name was mentioned before the committee on the same Friday that we have talked of—I inquired of the chairman the prisoner's address, and he gave it me, and I immediately put it into the hands of the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear it stated, or did you say yourself, that this young man was very frequently in the matter between you and Mr. Waddingten? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was in Mr. Reed's evidence, I believe—I stated that what Mr. Reed said was true—I mean to swear I have not seen the prisoner since I dismissed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Bond state one set of things, and did you and your partner deny it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it is not the general practice for shares to be purchased by clients in the name of other persons—it does occur some<lb></lb>times—they were bought for Mr. Bond, and by his wish put in the prisoner's name—at the time they were bought he was a client of our house—we had had transactions with him—the prisoner would not, in conse<lb></lb>quence of that, have any right to appropriate to himself this 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd and this 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I dismissed him about a 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cheque—he did not then make any complaint to me about those mining shares, not a word—he did not make any allegation that these mining shares entitled him to take my property.</p>

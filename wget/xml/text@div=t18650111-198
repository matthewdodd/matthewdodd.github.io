I am servant to Robert Montgomery, of Sydenham—on Tuesday, 13th December, at 5 o'clock, I put two sheets and a table<lb></lb>cloth on a line in the back garden to dry—there is a gate leading from the backgarden to the front—at about a quarter to 6 I heard footsteps pass the side-door—I went out, and found that the clothes were gone—I went to the gate, and saw a person with a bundle, about six yards from the house, going towards the village—I saw a policeman with the prisoner next day, and believe her to be the same woman—I called a girl, who traced her to Wells-road, and then gave information to the police—her walk and her figure make me believe she is the same person—I saw the articles next day in the policeman's possession, in the prisoner's house—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them.</p>

On 14th December, in consequence of information from Livingston, I went with Beaman and Adams to the prisoner's house—I saw her at the top of the landing, and asked her what bundle she was carrying the night before—she denied carrying one—I said, "Well, you are suspected of stealing two sheets and a table cloth"—she said, "You had me once and you thought you were going to have me again, you had better look in my place and see"—she pulled down the bed and opened a box and cupboards—there was nothing there—I saw these sheets and tablecloth lying in a heap on the lauding, between her door and the lodgers' door, and asked her if she knew anything about them—she said, "No"—I said, "What do you call this?"laying hold of them—she said, "I know nothing of them"—I told her she must go to the station with me and she refused—I took her there, and going down the stairs, she said to the daughter of the other lodger, The things were put on my bed within a minute, and I threw them out on the landing—I was not in her room more than two minutes—I did not lose sight of her.</p>

I am single, and live with my mother in a room opposite the prisoner—on the evening of 14th December, about a quarter past 10, I was in my room alone, and heard a noise—I left the room and heard the prisoner come on to the landing and say, "Mrs. Taylor, I want to speak to you"—I said, "Mrs. Shields, mother is not at home"—I left the door open, and saw her shadow on the landing, and when I got into the room the sheets and tablecloth were half on the bed and half on the floor behind the door, part had caught on the door-haudle—the landlady came up with me, took the clothes and put them on the landing, saying, "We will not have them here, they do not belong to us"—the policeman had come before I left my room, and was looking in a cupboard at the time I went down stairs—the cupboard is on the right side of the window in the prisoner's room, and the prisoner was just outside her door.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I have been convicted, and got three years penal servitude from here. I came out on 12th December, 1864, and the policeman who had me then has got me now.

On the 14th he came to my place, between 10 and 11, and said, "What bundle is that?"I said, "Some bread and potatoes for my children's supper"—he said "There have been some things lost in the neighbourhood, and I believe you have got them, I shall make it my business to have your place searched." He went and found the things on the landing, and then had me up; 1 said, "Why should you have me; he said, "If there were one hundred I should have you, and if you do not come out directly I will put a rope round your neck and drag you out." I went, and he said to the sergeant, "Do not you know her figure and walk?" He said, "No; in and this man said, "Any evidence will do against her, she is a ticket-of-leave, and is condemned already. There is no ground for my being taken up except that I am a ticket-of-leave. I have been two years and seven months away, and a month here waiting for my trial. I came home intending to be a good wife and a good mother, and regain my character, but this policeman will not let me.</p>

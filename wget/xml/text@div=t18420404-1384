                  </hi>. I live in Tyson-street, Bethnal-green—I was in the employ of Samuel Parker Noble, of Charles-street Fitzroy-square. On the 7th of April last year the prisoner came and said, Will you send a date, of stout to Mr. Tulk, of Duke-street, Westminster?—I said, "Yes"—before he left he said, "Will you lend me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., it will be re<lb></lb>turned when the stout is sent to Mr. Tulk's"—I spoke to Mr. Noble, and he lent him the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he is not here—I had never seen the prisoner before—he said he had come out without any money, and he had to buy-some<lb></lb>thing for the young ladies—I supposed he meant Mr. Tulk's daughters—he did not say so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheese monger, and live in Bridge-street, Westminster. On the 3rd of November last the prisoner came to me—I knew him—he said he came from Miss Page's for a piece of bacon—I have served the Miss Page's—he said, "The cook says you know the part that will suit them, and if you have not any one with in to send it immediately, I will take it with me"—in consequence of that statement I let him have the bacon, which I should not have done without—the Miss Pages are si<lb></lb>ters to the Rev. Mr. Page, and live with him—last Saturday three weeks the prisoner came to my shop again and said, "You serve the Rev. Mr. Page, don't you?"—I said, "Yes, I do, you mean the Rev. Mr. Page, living in the cloisters?"—he said, "Yes, I am living with him, he has sent me to order half a ham, three or four pounds of good Cheshire cheese, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of eggs, he is going to have company to-morrow, and wishes them to be particularly good—I want to see them"—I cut him off some cheese, showed him half a ham, and asked how long he had lived with Mr. Page—he said between eight and nine months—I did not let him have those things—I should not have let him had the bacon if he had not represented that he came from the Miss Pages—I charged for it when I sent in the bill, and they would not pay it.</p>

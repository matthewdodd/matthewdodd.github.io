               <p>- SADLER. I live in Bishopsgate-street. On the morning of the 1st of December, I came into the shop and found the prisoner there, and some stockings laying on my counter - my young man said, in his presence, he would give 5 s. per pair on them; he said he wished to sell them for 5 s. 6 d. per pair; I questioned him how he came by them - he said his brother was a job man, that he had redeemed them from a pawnbroker; I said if I was satisfied they were his brother's, I would treat with him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090017"></xptr>for them; I sent my man with him to his brother - they both returned together; my man said the prisoner had said, it was of little use going to his brother, for he was not at home, and that as they were returning he altered his mind, and said I think we had better go; that they turned back, but that he again altered his mind, and said he would come with his brother at twelve o'clock. I sent for an officer; I told the officer to go to Chiswell-street, and bring his brother, he left the shop with the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was fetched to Sadler's, and found the prisoner there; I accompanied him to No. 21, Chiswell-street, he enquired for his brother, the man in the shop said he did not know him, and that he had no lodgers; I brought the prisoner out - he said he was very sorry, and would tell the whole of it; I told him to be cautious what he said, as it must be given in evidence; he said, he lived with Messrs. Todd's, of Fore-street, and took them from there. I found twelve duplicates on him, for forty pair of stockings.</p>

The prisoner was employed in the hosiery department, at a salary of 35 l. a year, he boarded in the house; it was not his business to take out any stockings without directions, I saw him at nine or ten o'clock that morning, with his hat on, going towards the door; he lived three months there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. With feelings of the deepest regret, I stand here in this unpleasant situation, one act of my life forfeits all claim to respectable society; should your sentence be inflicted with severity, I should be lost to all friends, an awful picture of indiscretion - I wholly depend on your mercy, and my future life shall be my only pledge. My tailor was pressing for money; I had no wages due, and intended to redeem them when I was paid.</p>

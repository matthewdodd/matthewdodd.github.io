            . I am keeper of his majesty's gaol of Exeter; I remember the prisoner being put under my care there, and I saw her take her trial at the summer assizes 1753, and had sentence of death passed upon her.</p>

               <p>Q. Is she the same person that was tried, which that record now read mentions?</p>

               <p>Manley. She is the same person.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she plead his majesty's pardon afterwards?</p>

               <p>Manley. I was by and saw her when she pleaded it, and heard her ordered for transportation for fourteen years. On the May following I took her to Biddeford, and put her on board a vessel with thirteen others, in order for transportation.</p>

               <p>This is all owing to Walker and his wife that were tried here; they sent a letter down to Exeter and said I was the person, but I am not.</p>

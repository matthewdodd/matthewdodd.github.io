               <p>THOMAS THOMAS. I live in Marchmont-street, Burton-crescent, with Gibbons and Co., who are linen-drapers. On the 11th of November, about twelve o'clock at night, I was coming from the City; I had been to Sun-street, and had left there about half an hour: I was sober; I went up to the City-road to see for a stage; but as there was none,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070023"></xptr>I returned; I met a female in Golden-lane, and asked her the way to Smithfield; she directed me through a court, which led out of <placeName id="t18261207-27-crimeloc157">Golden-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18261207-27-crimeloc157" type="placeName" value="Golden-lane"></interp>

I had not called out before, except when I was on the ground; but my face was so close to the ground that I could not be heard - on recovering, I was all over mud, and they were just running away in different directions; I cannot swear to either of them; but when they were brought to the watch-house I said it was as much like them as possible; I cannot say that Gray is the woman who directed me down the court; a watchman came to my assistance and took me to the watch-house; I was all over blood and dirt; I described the great-coat and the men as well as I could, and in a short time the coat was brought to the watch-house; I have not recovered the hat or money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did you come out of Golden-lane into the court? A. It led out of Golden-lane, I believe, but I do not know much of the neighbourhood.</p>

            . I live in Bell-alley, leading into Goswell-street - I am married. On this day five weeks, about one o'clock at night, I was going home with my husband, whom I had met; I go out to wash and mangle at Peerless-pool; I was going through Green Arbour-court and saw a gentleman with a light coat on; three men were on one, side of him, and a female on the other; they were all four pushing him about backwards and forwards; I did not know the men, but by the woman's voice I thought it was Sarah Gray - I saw her, but did not go up to look at her face, but know her voice; I have known her some years - I said to her, after they had run away,"Oh! for shame, Sarah Gray - I am afraid you are one of those who helped to rob that poor man."</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw them, did you hear her say any thing? A. No - but I am convinced it was her, because she had no bonnet on, nor had she when I spoke to her - I was within three yards of her. When I spoke to her she used a bad expression, and asked how many I had robbed in my time; I know it was her I spoke to - the man they were pushing about had a light-coloured coat, with mother-o'-pearl buttons behind - I saw that, as it was a very moonlight night; I only saw them push him about as I went in doors, but when we heard him cry Murder! my husband and I went to his assistance; they were all gone from him then, but I met Gray coming down the steps, and said I was convinced, by her person, she was the same woman; I am quite sure, by her person, that she is the same woman; she went down Crown-court when I spoke to her, and I saw no more of her; the prisoner was just under the gateway by Green Arbour-court, without hat or coat - I went with him to the watch-house, as the watchman said he had got the coat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where does the court lead to? A. Golden-lane; it is Turk's Head-court - I thought the three men were rather tall - I am sure there was a woman with them when I first saw them, but I did not speak to her then; I judge, from her height and voice, that it was her.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Golden-lane. On the 12th of November, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I stood at the end of Basket-alley; I saw two men enter the alley - one man without a hat had a bundle under his arm - the watchman followed them; he sprang his rattle in a few minutes, and I went up the court, and picked up this great coat in Basket-alley, which leads into Golden-lane - I cannot say whether it is what the man had under his arm - I picked it up in the way they had gone, but had then lost sight of them; whether they went over that precise spot, I cannot say - I carried the coat to the watch-house, after marking it.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Luke. On Sunday morning, the 12th of November, at near two o'clock, I was coming from the watch-house; I came down White's-yard into Basket-alley, and there saw the prisoner Thorn with something under his arm - I said, "I do not think this is right," and he dropped it; he was not above five yards off, and could hear what I said - he ran up White's-yard, and I after him, springing my rattle and calling Stop thief! Poulston picked it up - just as he turned the corner into Whitecross-street, the watchman stopped him- I only lost sight of him for half a minute, while he turned round the corner - I had seen him before, but did not know his name; he is the man who dropped the bundle - Poulston came up in two or three minutes - we all went to the watch-house, and he left the coat there - I am sure Thorn is the man who dropped it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. This was nearly two o'clock? A. Yes. I did not see him stopped, but was close behind - he had got about six yards from the corner; there was nobody running but him and me - the watchman who stopped him was coming towards us, hearing the rattle. I have no doubt of his being the man.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the rattle spring at two o'clock in the morning; I was at the corner of Banner-street and Whitecross-street - I ran to the spot, and met the prisoner coming out of White's-yard - I caught him in my arms; Simons was three or four yards behind him - he came up directly, and said, "That is the man" - nobody else was running.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not running towards Golden-lane? A. He ran towards me - he must have turned back to go to Golden-lane: I took him within fifteen or twenty yards of White's-yard - he had a cap on, which he threw away just before he got to me: I saw that cap at the watch-house.</p>

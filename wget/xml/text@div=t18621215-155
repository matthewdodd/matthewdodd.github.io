                  </hi>. I live at 27, Upper Chapman-street, St. George's—the prisoner came to lodge at my house about 8th August last—she had a child with her—it was called Margaret Jackson—it was very nearly twelve months old when it came to my place—it was her only child—her husband did not come with her—no one came with her—the child was at the breast—the prisoner had one back room, for which she paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—she told me her husband was a sailor, employed in the <hi rend="italic">David Milton,</hi> and she was receiving 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month—besides that she used to work with Mrs. Johnson, who lived in the front room—when the child first came it was a nice healthy looking baby—the prisoner behaved very kindly to it for the first month—she was very much given to drink—about November last she used to go out and leave it for hours together, and the baby was always crying—I have known her to leave it for four or five hours at a time—I can't say how often I have known that, but I have known her to leave it a great many times—three times I have noticed that the door was locked, and the baby in the room—on some occasions I have found the door open—I have gone into the room, and seen the child there—I found it very dirty—it wanted food, and I often took it up food such as I have had for my own children; I am only a poor person, and cannot afford to give them very good food; a little bread and butter and broth, and things like that—every Sunday that it was in my place, except the last four Sundays, I took it food—when the prisoner was sober she used to keep the baby very clean, but when she was tipsy she used to keep it very dirty—when I have gone into the room, and found the child as I have mentioned, it was dressed, except the last day, then it was quite naked, on the bed—that was on the Saturday, as she went to the workhouse in the evening—I had spoken to her about the baby twice during the last two months that she was in the place—I told her she ought to stop at home and mind the baby, and not go out drinking so much; I thought it would become her much more—she told me to mind my own business—on the Thursday before she went to the workhouse she fetched the doctor to the child; because I told her so many times if she did not have some advice for the baby I was sure the child would not live—its ears were sore at that time, but the first of its ears being sore was, I think, from its not being properly cleansed—she went to the workhouse on Saturday night about 8 o'clock, and took the child with her—I got the order for her ad<lb></lb>mission—she was not than sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in the same house with Mrs. Howell—I know the prisoner—I made coats, and used to employ her at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week—during the last five weeks or so I could not employ her, she was so saucy we could not bear her in the room—after that she had no work, to my knowledge, that would take her out of the house—she was not a sober woman—she was tipsy each time that she got her monthly money, for a fortnight afterwards, and sometimes into the third week—I remember the Saturday that she went to the workhouse—I went into her room on that day—the landlady came and fetched me—I found the baby lying naked on the bed, with a little bit of half-mourning on one side of her, and an old patch-work quilt on the other—the prisoner was out—I have seen the baby in the room on other occasions—I have known the prisoner to leave it some<lb></lb>times for four or five hours together—I went for the doctor on the Satur<lb></lb>day</p>

               <p>day, and the abused me dreadfully about it, and said she would have my life if I fetched a doctor to her child—she was drunk then—on the Thurs<lb></lb>day she put a poker in the fire, and cut my head open with it, and nearly broke my arm, and bruised me dreadfully—that was became I said I would see that the child should be done for; that it was in a dying state, and I would let the parish know.</p>

On the 4th of November, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came in company together to pawn the five books with me - they are all odd volumes; I suspected they were stolen, and sent to Mr. Hodgson - his brother came, and identified them; Treeherne said Mr. Hodgson had given them to him to pawn - I said I thought he was a respectable man, and would not send odd volumes to pawn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who placed the books on your counter? A.I do not know, but Treeherne said he wanted 30s. on them - I did not see them came in together, but they were in one of the little boxes.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and found the two prisoners in the box; I asked them how they came by the books - they said that a person, calling himself Hodgson, gave them to them under the Pantheon; that he came to the corner of Berwick-street, pointed out the shop, and requested them to pawn them for 30s. - they both said so alternately; I said, "You should not take books so" - Hall then said they did not know the man, but they were to have 1s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Then one confirmed what the other said? A. Yes - I inquired about Treeherne, and have heard that he is a very respectable young man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you made any inquiries respecting Hall? A. Yes - I find his friends are very respectable; Mr. Hodgson's brother was in the shop, and he owned the property as his brother's and sister's; I said, "Is that the Mr. Hodgson" - they said No, he was a taller man.</p>
               <p>MR. HODGSON. I have two other brothers - they do not live at my hose; one is only there during the vacation at Cambridge, and the other at the hours of business in the City.</p>

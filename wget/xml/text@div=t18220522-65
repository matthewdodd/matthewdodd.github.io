On the night of the 27th of April all the linen was deposited in the kitchen, in a double chest of drawers. My wife had been washing, and they were filled with all the linen we possessed. Foster came to lodge with us in July last, and occupied the back room on the second floor. Worboys and his wife came frequently to visit Foster. I cannot say whether I saw them for a day or two before the 28th of April. On the morning of the 28th, my little boy screamed out, I went down into the kitchen and found the drawers all plundered of every thing they had contained over night; I had seen them safe between ten and eleven o'clock; I believe I was the last that went to bed at night; I fastened the kitchen window myself by a screw, and secured it top and bottom. I found a square of glass broken, and the window a little open, but it was impossible that a hand put in there could unscrew it. I missed six sovereigns from the scrutoire, some knives and forks, an India shawl, and some trinkets. My friends wished me to search my lodgers, I declined it; but on the Thursday morning my wife's mother shewed me a brooch which caused suspicion to fall on Foster. I sent for an officer and a lock-smith who opened Foster's trunk in her bed-room; she was out and had left the key of her room with my wife's mother. I found that every thing in the trunk belonged to me; we then went into her little room adjoining the bed-room; I found that a mouse-hole which I knew was there, had grown large enough for me to put my hand in, and from both sides of the hole the officer found four curtain-pins, two irons, a blind, some sugar, five eggs, a tea caddie, and various other articles. Foster came home that night about eight o'clock; she went up stairs and found her bed-room door locked; she came down to know the reason, and the officer took her and Mrs. Worboys who came home with her; Worboys declared she was quite innocent, and accused Foster with being a base woman; they were taken to the watch-house. We got a warrant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182205220027"></xptr>to search Worboys. On the 2d of May we went there nearly at nine o'clock at night, and found him at a public-house close by; he was taken to the watch-house and searched in my presence, but nothing particular found. In Foster's pocket several trinkets of ours were found, and a key which she was asked about, and said it was a key which Worboys got made to fit our kitchen door. She said in his presence that on Monday, the 22d of April, when we were out, Worboy got the key made, and he assisted her in committing the robbery; he and his wife denied it. I found the key fitted the kitchen door very well, it was an old key filed. At Worboys's house we found a small bible, a towel, two petticoats, an ironing cloth, and some strips of muslin; the brooch is mine, and was taken from the scrutorie.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. Did you find any thing at Worboys that Foster was unlikely to have of her own - A. No.</p>

On the evening of the 22d of April, Foster was ironing for me all day; she was called out by Worboys in the course of the day - she was not absent long; she went out about eight o'clock in the evening, and said she was going to Mr. Worboys's - she returned in half an hour; she assisted me in putting linen away. Before we left the kitchen, we found all the linen safe. In the scrutoire there was a shawl, knives and forks, six sovereigns, and a bag of trinkets and other things. I know the brooch was in the bag that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller of Southwood-terrace, Highgate, next door to the prisoner—on Thursday morning 28th December, about four o'clock the prisoner came to my house and asked me if I would go into his house as he had been attacked by two thieves, and wanted as<lb></lb>sistance—I went to the door and listened and heard a groaning down stairs—I was afraid to go down, and said, "I had better go for the police"—after waiting a minute or two I went to the station, a policeman came back with me—we both listened at the top of the staircase—the prisoner was still at the door when I came back—the policeman did not care to go down, and I did not—he gave me the privilege of going down first, but I did not—I went for a second policeman, and when I came back I found the inspector there—the prisoner seemed to have been drinking; I could hardly say he was tipsy—he said he believed the thieves were still down stairs, and he thought he had marked one of them; he had cut one about a good deal on the arms and legs with a knife—we still heard the groaning, and the prisoner kept saying that he heard the two men in the room—I went down into the back kitchen with the inspector and two policemen—one of them opened the door and we went in. together—we could not open the door at first—I have not a distinct recollection whether a candle was burning in the room, but I be<lb></lb>lieve it was dark—the light must have been from a policeman's lantern—we went in and found Mrs. Keeble lying against the window at the far part of the room—she had the appearance of having had a violent push and being forced under the window with violence—her head and shoulders were against the wall as if she had been sitting about a foot from the wall and had fallen, back—she was quite insensible—the prisoner was there—I think he said that he thought the thieves must have attacked his wife, and that he had been fighting with the thieves for two hours when he first came to me—I left Mr. Keeble there and went for a doctor—nothing seemed to have been disarranged in the room—there was a sovereign lying on the floor-after an hour Mrs. Keeble recovered her senses, and the first words she uttered were, "Oh, my poor thigh!"—there was a great deal of blood on the sofa, some on the floor, and some on a chair—it was the basement floor used as a sitting-room—there was blood on the prisoner's hands when he came to me; he was dressed, and Mrs. Keeble was fully dressed, but she had one boot off—the prisoner had his slipper on, or one slipper on and one off, I know he had not his shoes on—the police asked him if he had a knife—he said yes, and took a small pocket-knife from his pocket and said that</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, Y</hi>). On Thursday morning, 28th December, I went to the prisoner's house and saw him and his wife and Hazle in the back kitchen—Mrs. Keeble was lying on the floor in a state of insensibility—I found a pool of blood under the sofa and a slipper in the blood, which the prisoner said was his—there was also blood on the sofa and all over the room, and in the further corner of the wall, close by where the prisoner was sitting—he said that thieves came into his house, attacked him and his wife, and in defending himself he cut one of his assailants about the arms and legs—he said, "They have not gone far for I have injured them so that they must be somewhere about the neighbourhood"—he per<lb></lb>sisted in saying that there were thieves in the house, and I searched the house but found nothing disturbed, and the doors of all the rooms closed—there was no indication of the house having been broken into, the doors were all closed and the drawers and articles all undisturbed—he said that he had wounded one of his assailants, and I found a small pocket-knife on the floor—I asked him if it was his—he said that it was, and that that was the knife with which he wounded his assailants—I asked him if both the blades were broken—he said, "No, only one, the other blade I keep to pare my corns"—that is the knife which was found just now, it has been in my pos<lb></lb>session ever since—I saw a sovereign on the floor—he saw me pick it up and said, "That is one of two sovereigns I had taken from her pocket to give my assailant to let me alone"—after examining the house I returned to the back kitchen and found the prisoner there, still sitting in the same chair I examined him and found blood on his clothes and hands, and the skin on his knuckles broken which I called his attention to, and he said it was caused by his knocking on the panelling to make the person in the other house hear when he called for assistance—I found on the panel, marks smeared with blood such as would be made by a person knocking his knuckles, smeared with blood, against it—he kept saying to his wife, "Dear Hannah, dear wife, were we not attacked?" and after some time when she became somewhat recovered, she said, "Yes, we were"—when I first went in Mrs. Keeble was lying on the floor, her arms and legs partly uncovered—she was insensible—she did move once and say, "Oh, my poor thighs!"—afterwards she came to a little—she appeared to have been drinking—the prisoner was in a state of very great nervous excitement, trembling and</p>

               <p>shaking all over—I think Mrs. Keeble believed she had been attacked by thieves from what she said—on the same afternoon I saw the prisoner in his bedroom where he was in charge of a constable, in consequence of his excited state, as the doctor said it would be dangerous to remove him—I asked him how he was—he said he felt very miserable—and said, "I am now convinced that I must have injured my wife in the way in which you have seen her, thinking that I was defending myself from an attack of thieves. My wife and I were at the Rose and Crown public-house last evening and I recollect nothing after leaving there until I found myself calling for as<lb></lb>sistance to Mr. Hazle outside the house"—he cried and was very much affected—he said that he felt convinced no thieves could have been in the house and that it must have been him that did it.</p>

On Thursday morning after Christmas-day, I had been visiting out; I was in the Rose and Crown; my husband came in. We spoke about my birth-day being the day before; my husband kissed me; we went home together. My husband was merry; we have always been friendly. I sat down in the chair, and was taking off my bonnet and a boot. The light was put out; I was seized, I think, by a smallish man. I think it was a smaller man than my husband; I cried out to my husband to save me. I asked what he wanted, if it was my money, I said 'Take it.' I found myself on the floor. I found I was bleeding, and I recollect no more. No words were spoken, but the man breathed hard, and trembled violently."</p>

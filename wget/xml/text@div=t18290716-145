Leafs had not determined whether they would keep them or not; if he had sold it he ought to have returned the money - he was allowed a commission of 2 per cent.; I asked him some time afterwards, and he said they had refused to keep them, but he thought Mr. Sturts, at the west-end of the town would take them; I went there, and made inquiries: there is no one here from them - I afterwards found my silk at Upsal's, a pawnbroker.</p>

Since 1827; he had goods at this time in his hands of mine, to much greater amount - I have received from him perhaps 500l.; I never came to any settlement with him - he has pawned goods for me, and I have had the duplicates - I saw him after I went to Sturts'; we had some conversation - I took him before the Lord Mayor, for a large quantity of property which he had made improper use of; we were directed to leave the Court, that we might arrange it: the common account was about 50l. - an arbitrator was spoken of.</p>

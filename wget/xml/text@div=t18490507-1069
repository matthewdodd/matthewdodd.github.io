                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 202). On 4th of Apri, I was a Camden Town; I heard something, and found the body of a male child on a plank, at a coal-wharf, by the Regent's canal—I took it to the workhouse.</p>

I found the prisoner at Mr. Scott's, 42, Gloucester-street, and said, "I have a charge of concealing the birth of a child against you"—she said, "It was not a child; it was only a six months' child"—I asked where it was—she said she had thrown it into the Regent's Canal, that it was more like a rabbit than a child—she said she was confined that day four weeks.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of George Scott. The prisoner was in my service—she was very ill on 18th of March—I told her to lie down and I would bring her some tea—she said her stomach had been out <hi rend="italic">of</hi> order some months, that she had been taking medicine to correct it, and that she had Hooded a great deal; and remarked that she was much smaller—I then saw that her shape was altered—she said she was dropsical, and had been to the Free Hospital, Gray's-inn-road—I noticed that the bedroom door was stained and recently scoured—next day she did her usual work, and rinsed some sheets as well—I said there was no necessity for that as the laundress would have done it—she said they were very much soiled, and she did not like sending them so—after speaking to two or three people, I said to her, "I feel less delicacy in asking you the question, because I find you have had one child previously, and therefore I know you must have miscarried, or had a child"—she denied it, but afterwards told me she was at Chalk Farm Gardens on 10th of Sep<lb></lb>tember, and met a person she never saw before or since, and went with him to a house in Seymour-street, and he was the father of the child; and she had thrown it down the water-closet—she afterwards said she had thrown <hi rend="italic">k</hi> into the Regent's Canal.</p>

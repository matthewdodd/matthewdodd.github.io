            . I am a clerk to Mr. Scurlock, a proctor. The prisoner came to our office on the 18th of March, and brought this will (looking at it); he had a man with her; I cannot say whether the prisoner or the man gave it to me; the man paid me for the probate - he gave me the name of Tye; the prisoner gave the name of Mary Powell, and she administered to the will; the probate was afterwards granted to her as the sole executrix - there is no written affidavit; the oath is administered by the surrogate; it is, that she was the sole executrix named in the will, that the effects were under 20l., and that she believed the paper contained the last will and testament of the deceased.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Read, ship-broker to the Baretto, Junior, which arrived on the 4th of March, having sailed about the 8th of February, 1831; the prisoner came about the 18th of March, and applied for the money of Benjamin Norrington; she did not produce a paper at that time; I told her to call after twenty-one days, when the ship would be paid off; she called two or three days after the twenty-one days, and produced a parchment, but I did not look at it; she was told to call again, which she did, and I then looked at the probate of the will which she produced, and seeing it purported to have the mark of Benjamin Norrington; I told her he could write his own name, and produced the ship's articles, which I had seen him sign; she said that was Benjamin Norrington's mark; she was told that we could not pay her on that account, and we did not pay her; she went away, and the next application was made by Mr. Howard, a solicitor of Mincing-lane - the application was from Mr. Styles, his clerk - he came alone; when the prisoner applied to me there was always a man with her - I do not know who he was.</p>

            . I know the prisoner; about the beginning of March this year I went to the Cock, in Leadenhall-street, and saw Thomas Fallen, Andrew Morgan, and John Dalton there; I went out with Dalton, and when I came back the prisoner was in the tap-room -Dalton and Fallen said to me, "How did you get on?" and I told them what Norrington's clothes sold for; I said his clothes sold for 7l. odd, and that his wages were 7l. odd - I said nothing more in the prisoner's presence, and do not think she said any thing; we drank together, and I left them; nothing more was said while I was there- I did not stay two minutes; none of them made any answer when I stated what the clothes sold for; Morgan and Fallen lived in the same house as I did - the ycame to me one evening, but the prisoner was not there; next morning Dalton and she were at Fallen's house, where I lived - they worked there; all that was said before the prisoner was, that the will was made out, and they were to give me a sovereign, and 5s. for my trouble in going up; I was to have that if she got the money - this was said on Saturday night; it was for going to the owners about the money, which I had done - I was to do nothing more for the sovereign; the prisoner said she did not mind; they seemed all agreeable to it; a few days after that I asked her how she got on with Benjamin Norrington's will; she said she was obliged to take it to a lawyer, as she could not get it, for the ship was put into the Commons', and she did not think she should get it at all; but Morgan was to pay 1l. to fetch the will away from the lawyer who she had employed to try to get the money - I afterwards asked her how she got on; she said she did not think she should get the money, for there was another will made on board the ship - I do not recollect ever seeing this paper before (looking at one.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you ever married? A. Yes; my husband's name was Thomas Pringle - I have not lived with him for several years - I do not know whether he is alive; my maiden name was Pettit - I have gone by the name of Francis, who I lived with; and by the name of Carnel, who I lived with nine years, and buried - I swore by the name of Mary Elliot, at Doctor'scommons, by Mrs. Dalton's request, as she had a will at Mr. Clarkson's, and could not go up herself; I was in the House of Correction for a month, for unlawfully pawning a cloak which I had borrowed - I forget whether I ever swore in this Court that I was single; I did not swear I could not read - I said I could not read writing well - I do not recollect mentioning I could not read at all; I said I could not write the alphabet - I can read a little - I do not recollect whether I swore I could not read; I can write the different names I have gone by, but nothing else.</p>

            . The witness never came to my house with the prisoner - I never saw her there to my knowledge; I know her; Norrington's effects sold for 7l. 9s. 6d., and his wages were 7l. 7s.</p>

             was a sailor on board, and died about the 14th or 15th of August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long before she sailed had you joined her? A. On the 7th of February, in the London-docks - she sailed from London about a week before the 20th; sailors who write a middling or bad hand, sometimes make their mark instead of their names- I have known that done two or three dozen times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at this; has that been the case with people who could write as well as this? A. Yes; men often say their hands are unsteady.</p>

            . I was Dalton's landlord. The prisoner called on me with a letter from Dalton, who was then a prisoner in Newgate; it was two or three days after he was committed, and about two months ago she wished to remove some clothes, but did not have them.</p>
               <p>The five letters found in the prisoner's pocket were all directed to Mrs. James, or Phoebe James; four of them were signed Andrew Morgan, and one John Dalton.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I must confess that I have been too credulous in yielding to the false and impious persuasions of a young man named Pavel, whose name I have for some time assumed, and by whom I was, about six years ago, seduced from my parents and friends, and having brought me from my native city (Worcester) to London, was soon afterwards deserted by him, leaving me without any means of obtaining a livelihood otherwise than at the expence of chastity; on which I, in the first instance, am sorry to say, set too slight a value - in the course of these dissolute pursuits, it was my province to become acquainted with various seafaring men, one of whom was Norrington, the testator of the will in question, and who, in the course of a long intimacy, always gave me to understand that he had no relatives or friends to whom he was under any obligation, alleging, that although he had a step-mother, he did not consider her any relative - on the 8th of February, 1831, after informing me of his intention of going to sea, he left me the will, and told me, that in the course of a day or two the ship would be at Gravesend, from whence he would send me a monthly note;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060110"></xptr>and on condition that I would mend my course of life, promised that we should get married on his return from sea; on the ship's arrival from India, I naturally made inquiry respecting him, and on discovering his decease, applied at Mr. Read's countinghouse, where I was instructed to administer to his wages and effects; I shall not further trespass on you with the details of intimate friendship that subsisted between the deceased and myself, but will suffice it to remark, that there could be no necessity for making a second will in favour of the step-mother, had the testator not revoked the first will to her by the will made in my favour. for which I am now prosecuted, and the date of which is evidently between the two wills in the step-mothers possession.</p>

            . I am a blind painter, and live in Tottenham-court-road. On Sunday the 19th of August, a little after seven o'clock, I was in Goswell-street, about a quarter of a mile from Queen-street, and saw the prisoner walking towards Old-street with this child in her arms, she going away from Queen-street, the child was repeatedly calling to be carried home and seemed uneasy. I requested her to take it home, she said she was going home; I asked where she lived, she said in Holborn. I then suspected that she did not know the way, or that it was not her child, and asked whose child it was, she said it was her own. The child kept crying to be taken home, I asked if she knew the way she was going, and told her she was not going in a direction for Holborn, and asked her what part of Holborn she lived in; she said in Hatton-garden. I asked her what number, she would not answer. I then told her the child was stolen, and I would accompany her to the watch-house or workhouse. She remained where she was, a crowd collected round, and a little girl said she had seen the child in Queen-street, we took her back to Queen-street, and on the road she said she had just come from Chelsea. The child is now in Court.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was given in my charge, she said she did not mean to hurt the child. I asked her where she got it from, she said from the the corner of Red Lion-street, that she lived in Eyre-street, Hatton-garden, and had left her husband at Chelsea with three children. Several people followed us, and there was a cry of "Rescue" several times.</p>

I met this child child crying, and two or three people round it, it wanted to go home, I asked where it lived, it could not tell. I took it down two or three streets to see if any one owned it.</p>
               <p>JUROR to SMITH. Q. Can the child talk and say where it lives - A. Yes, Sir.</p>

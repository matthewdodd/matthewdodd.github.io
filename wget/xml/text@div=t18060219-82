               <p>Q. On the 25th of last month do you remember the prisoner coming to your house. - A. Yes, she came in the afternoon, she called for a glass of rum, which I drawed her, and put before her; she gave me a one pound note for payment; I took the one pound note and laid five shillings and six-pence before her, and three pennyworth of halfpence, that made six shillings with the three pence for the rum; I then laid before her a seven shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the seven shilling piece that you laid before her a good seven shilling piece. - A. Yes, that made thirteen shillings. I turned my head a moment, I saw the seven shilling piece was changed and shoved along the counter; I said to the prisoner in a passion, you d - d hussy you have changed the seven shilling piece; with that I took the remains of the change, and kept the one pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the seven shilling piece that you supposed she had changed. - A. I supposed that she had put it in her mouth; I immediately went out for an officer, and left my wife with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say anything else to you before you went for an officer. - A. She said if I could not give her all silver, I must return her the note; when I returned I stood against the door; she said if I would let her go she would take the seven shilling piece, if I would give her the remainder of the change, she knew where to pass it. When the constable came the seven shilling piece was delivered to him; she said it was a good one, I tried it in the scale, it was not a good one.</p>
               <p>- CATER sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Did you happen to be in Mr. Chapman's house on that day. - A. Yes, I saw the prisoner there, and I saw two seven shilling pieces in her mouth between her teeth; she told me that her husband was a soldier, and she had come to London to buy some trinkets.</p>

Yes; while my husband was gone for a constable she begged and prayed for the change, and if I would let her go she would pray for me; I heard her rattle the seven shilling piece in her mouth, and I saw her trying to swallow it. I put my hand to her neck, I said you good for nothing woman you are trying to swallow them.</p>

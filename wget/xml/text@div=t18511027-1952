                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 315). On Monday evening, 15th Sept., at a quarter to 9 o'clock, I was with Hunt, secreted in a yard, at the back of the Chequers public-house, at Eltham. I saw a wagon of Mr. Shove's, driven by Reeves, and drawn by two horses—Saxby was on the wagon—when they got into the yard, Reeves got down off the wagon, and went and stood by the horse's head—Saxby then threw down four trusses of clover-hay to Chalk<lb></lb>ling, and counted them as he threw them down—Chalkling was standing close to the wagon—Saxby said to him, "Will you have any more?"—he said, "No"—he then carried the four trusses into the coach-house—he is under<lb></lb>ostler in the yard—I then came out of my hiding-place, and asked Chalkling the reason why this clover was left in his place—he said, "I know nothing about it, for I am under-ostler"—I then took him with me up to Reeves, who was standing at the horse's head, and asked him the reason of his leaving this clover here—he said, "I know nothing about it;" and in an instant he said, "Oh, it is all right; I am going to receive 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for these four trusses of the clover, for I left five trusses here last Friday night"—I asked Chalk<lb></lb>ling whether he knew anything about the clover that was in the coach-house besides (pointing to a lump besides the four trusses)—he said, "No; I know nothing about them; for I am the under ostler"—I found twelve trusses in the coach-house, besides the four—I then took Reeves and Chalkling to the station—I afterwards searched the wagon, and found one truss of hay on the top of the load, which was not tied down with the ropes—the four trusses were also not tied.</p>

                  </hi>. On 15th Sept., I was with Green, in the yard of the Chequers, Eltham, in a garden adjoining the road—the prisoners could not very easily see us then—it was a quarter to 9 o'clock in the evening, and was dark—I saw the prosecutor's wagon drive in—Reeves was driving it, and Saxby, who was on it, threw down three trusses of hay to Reeves and Chalkling—it was taken into the coach-house by one of the two; I cannot say which—there was another man at the horse's head—when I came out Green said something, which I did not understand—Chalkling said he knew nothing about it; he was the under-ostler—I did not hear him say anything to Reeves—I got on the wagon, and saw one truss loose—I took Saxby into custody—Reeves said he left five trusses there on the Friday night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn dealer, of Lewisham. On 15th Sept. Reeves was in my wagon, as carman—Saxby was only an occasional labourer for me—when I had work I employed him as a haybinder—I was very seriously ill at this time, and know very little about who was working for me—I did not</p>

I went to Mr. May, and got a load, and put four on top of the load, and another truss on top, a green truss.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Seear, a dairyman, of 17, Lucas Road, Kennington Park—on the afternoon of 16th March, between 3 and 4 o'clock, Levy came in and asked for half a pound of biscuits, which came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a half-crown, and I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I put the half-crown in the till—there was no other there—she then left—in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, Cooper came in for half an ounce of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. tea and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of sugar—she gave me a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I gave her change, and she left—I then tried the florin with my teeth, and found it was bad—I left the shop in charge of a little girl, and went to Aldred Row, about 50 yards off—there saw Levy coming from one side of the road to the other, towards Cooper—I said to Cooper "I want you; you have given me a bad 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece"—she said she was very sorry, and she opened her purse, gave me a good 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and I gave her back the bad one—when I got back to the shop I tried the half-crown, and found that was bad—I gave it to Lambert, who shortly afterwards brought back Cooper, and my husband brought back Levy, and they were given into custody.</p>

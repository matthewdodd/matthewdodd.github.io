                  </hi> I am a cigar-manufacturer and live in Houndsditch—the prisoner was my apprentice—on the 16th of Sept., in consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion, I stopped him, and charged him with robbing me—he said, "If you Want to search me you must call a policeman, and take me to the station, And search me"—I did so, and found twenty-four cheroots in his two trowsers'-Pockets—I can swear they are my property.</p>

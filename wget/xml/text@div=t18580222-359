                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live at Wandsworth. On 25th Jan., I was in the tap room of the Ship public house, and the prisoner, who was there, began to quarrel with me about some work—I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him, and he said, "<hi rend="italic">Shove</hi> me again"—I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him again, and he said, "Hit me, and I will go up to the police court"—I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him again with my open hand, but did not hit him—he got hold of a poker and struck me on the back part of the head; I became insensible, and was in bed ten days—I was not drunk, but <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>—I was with the captain of a <hi rend="italic">Billy boy</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He was not talking about work, he was talking about going away; the captain agreed for one of them to go with him, and said, "Two drunken captains will not do on board one vessel;" and as soon as he spoke he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> fist and struck at me. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not; I shoved him on the breast, and then on the face; he agreed with another captain to take him down; he is what they call an <hi rend="italic">un</hi> freeman; he said, "I have agreed with another man, and if he does not come you shall go"—I said, "He is liable to be fined 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for taking you down."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Quinlan—on 28th August, we lived at 43, Bedfordbury—the prisoner was my late husband's cousin—on 28th of August he had his dinner at our place, between I and 2 o'clock, after which he stopped a short time, and he and my husband went out together—I was in bed and asleep when they came home—I was awoke by my husband—he was very drunk, and began to knock me about—the prisoner was not with him when he first came up, but not many minutes afterwards he came up for a bundle he had left—(we live on the third floor front)—I cannot tell what took place as I went down to the first floor, and there I stopped in Mr. and Mrs. Bird's room till 12 o'clock, when I went up to bed in the dark for fear of waking my husband as he was snoring loud, and he was in the habit of ill-using me when he was drunk—(I heard nothing while I was down stairs)—I had had a drop of beer, and went to sleep, and cannot recollect anything—I was not quite sober—I awoke between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning, and saw my husband with<lb></lb>out any clothes on—I did not see his face, his back was to me—I threw my daughter's waterproof coat over him, and ran down stairs screaming to the Charing Cross Hospital—his face was dreadfully swollen, and black and blue—he was lying on the floor; he was in the habit of doing that when he was drunk—I was afraid he was dead, and fetched a policeman—I went to Dr. Watkins, who ordered him to be removed to the hospital on Sunday, and he died there on Monday about 12.30.</p>

We were always like brothers; we had had about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of drink, we were coming home, and had a custle in Chandos Street, and fell on the ground two or three times, afterwards came home, and we went up into the room together; he had been quarrelling with his wife, and then he commenced quarrelling again with me, and we fought. We fell together several times, and he nearly choked me, and I had to throw him. We had been drinking very much; I left him lying on the floor, thinking he would come all right"—I ex<lb></lb>amined the room, it bore evident marks of a severe struggle, and there was a quantity of congealed blood in the corner where the deceased had laid, and his clothing was about the place—the prisoner's head was very much swollen, and he had to be taken to the House of Detention for his head to be treated, as erysipelas had set in.</p>

               <p>I received a communication from Catherine Quinlan—I went to 43, Bed-fordbury, and found the deceased lying on his left side, quite insensible—his face was very much swollen, and there were marks of violence on the right side of his face and head, and on his left arm—he bled very much, and the blood ran down on his left arm, where it was congealed, and his hair was matted in it on the floor—he was quite naked—he was seen by Dr. Watkins, who ordered his removal to Charing Cross Hospital—I took him there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Charing Cross Hos<lb></lb>pital—on 29th August, the deceased was brought there in a state of total insensibility, and with marks of great violence about the right side of his head and face; and after he had been taken into the ward, I found marks on his neck, and his left shoulder and arm—he continued insensible till Monday, about 12 o'clock, when he died—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the organs were all healthy, except the lungs, which were congested—I opened his head, and found that a blood vessel had been ruptured, which was the cause of death—that would arise from violence either from a blow or a fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Should you say that that blood vessel would be likely to be captured by a violent fall on the ground, and the head striking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite as likely—if there had been a violent blow it must have been given with a flat instrument, because there was no wound—it is more likely to have been caused by a heavy fall.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's statement before the Magistrate:</hi>—"I was drunk, and also the deceased; we had drunk five or six quarterns of raw rum, besides malt liquor. We quarrelled in Chandos Street, and I shoved him, but he made it up with me. All I recollect besides is being in the room with him, and we fell together. He had hold of my shirt collar, and I threw him several times on the floor, and he threw me also down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I received a deal of injury, and had erysipelas in my head. My cousin was the only relation I have, and I generally had my meals there. We have been brought up together from children. We went out, and had five or six quarterns of rum, independent of malt liquor. We quarrelled, and made it up afterwards, and had a couple of quarterns of rum together, and some beer. I went to Mr. Bird's place, and heard screams of "Murder!" I went up, and the deceased was like a raving madman, and stark naked. He laid hold of me by the handkerchief, and nearly strangled me. We were struggling together ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. He threw me on the edge of the bedstead, and I threw him down on the floor; but there was not a blow struck; first he was below me, and then I was below him. On Sunday morning I found my head cut open, and went up to know which was the worst of us, and found he had been taken to the hospital I have been under medical treatment ever since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Marquick, a painter—we live in Baldwins Gardens, Leather-lane. On the afternoon of 9th Oct. I was walking in Leather-lane, between two and three o'clock—I had to pass Cross-street—I saw the prisoner sitting on the shaft of a brewer's dray which he was driving—I do not know whether he had any reins—he was some little distance from the corner of Cross-street—I had to wait at the corner to allow two drays to pass, his being the last—I noticed a stall with a woman and a boy at it—I called to the woman to get out of the way—she moved a step or two in the same direction the dray was going, more into the street—if she had not done that, the dray would have hit her—the dray on which the pri<lb></lb>soner was, passed my feet—I had to move out of the position in which I stood to allow the first dray to pass—I was on the same side that the woman was—when the dray passed me it was close to the kerb—it was a two-wheeled dray—when it came up to the stall the left wheel touched the woman, pushed her down, and she pushed her son who stood at her side—the left wheel then passed over the woman—it dragged her, I should think, a yard and a quarter—when it left her her legs were raised, causing her person to be exposed—I</p>

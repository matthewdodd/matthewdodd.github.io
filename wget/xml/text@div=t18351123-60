I am a labourer, and work at what I can get—the prisoner is a stone-sawyer—he lodged with my mother, where I live—he came on Sunday, and lodged there three days—he slept with my bro<lb></lb>ther, and I slept in the same room—I had a box there, which I kept locked—It contained some books—I was accustomed to leave the key on the mantel-piece, in a small mahogany case—I went to the box on the 3rd of November, to deposit some papers, and placed the key in its place, as usual—the prisoner was in bed—It was my custom to get up first—I got up, on the 8th, looked for the key, and could not find it—the box was locked—I suspected something, and broke it open—I missed thirteen books—I have missed other things since, which I did not recollect at the time—I had the prisoner taken up—he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

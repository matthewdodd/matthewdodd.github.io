On the 26th of March, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came in (he has come there for the last six weeks for sheets of paper;) he was about five minutes in the shop, and asked for a sheet of brown and a sheet of writing paper - they are kept on separate sides of the shop; I did not wait on him, but observed him secreting some pamphlets under the sheet of paper; he was leaving the shop - I stopped him at the door, and twelve small pamphlets were found on him; I told him he had been there the last night and took some - he said, "If you let me go, I will pay you for those I took last night;" I saw him shifting them under the paper.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Waller. I stopped the prisoner at the door, as he was going out; he had these twelve pamphlets under the brown paper he had bought - he gave no account of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I leaving the shop or standing at the counter? A. He was at the door, in the act of going out.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went for two sheets of paper, which are kept at different sides of the shop - I had to cross the shop to fetch the writing paper, and folded the brown paper to make a sort of portfolio to put the writing paper in, and laid it on these books while I got the money out of my purse to pay; a person came in to look at some cards, which laid by the books - I drew the paper towards me, and these pampblets with it; I was in the act of putting them back when this young man seized me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SMALES. He was not putting them back - he had gone from the counter with the books, in the brown paper in his hand; he was a yard and a half from the counter, full - he did not intimate that this was the case then.</p>

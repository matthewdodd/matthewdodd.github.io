               <p>Q. Did you see them do any thing - A. No, I was in the back room at the time, and my wife desired me to come in the shop, as my daughter had missed a piece of ribbon; I went into the shop, I saw the prisoners there; my daughter informed me in their presence, that she had missed some ribbon; she thought the prisoners must have got it. I ordered them to produce it; they both declared they had no ribbon at all, I told them then, that we would search them, we took them into a back room for that purpose, and searched them; the prisoner Brown took off her beaver hat which she had on, and laid it down on a seat, I examined her hat, and in the inside of the hat I found this ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. What is its worth - A. Twelve shillings, the prisoner then said, it must have rolled into the hat, that is all she said.</p>

The prisoner Brown asked to look at some bonnets, I shewed; her several, they said they would not suit, she then said if she left a crown at any future time whether we would make her one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all that passed on the ribbon - A. Yes, I left the two pieces of ribbon on the counter and shut the drawer that we keep the ribbons in. They were then proceeding to leave the shop, saying they would call again about the bonnets. The ribbons would not do, I then missed one of the pieces of ribbon and enquired of them after it, they both said they saw me put it in the drawer, I was certain that I had not put it in the drawer, but immediately looked, having not a piece of the same colour in the house. I looked and could not find it. I said I was certain that one of them must have it. Then my mother called my father into the shop, and I served some other customer.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not present when they were searched - A. No.</p>

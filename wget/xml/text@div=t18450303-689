                  </hi>. I live in Little Trinity-lane, and am a carpenter On the 22nd of Feb., about eight o'clock at night, I was in Fleet-street—I saw the two prisoners following two gentlemen on the right hand side, about half way up Fleet-street—I saw Bourne take a gentleman's coat flap up, put his hand into his pocket, and take a handkerchief half-way out, and leave it—they then ran across to the Temple, where were two more gentlemen—Brown lifted up one gentleman's pocket. and with his right hand took a handkerchief out, and put it into his trowsers—Grimes was behind him, covering him—two officers ran up and took them—I went</p>

I and another officer watched the prisoners for half an hour—there were three of them at first, but one left—Grimes felt several pockets—they then crossed over by Messrs. Hoare's, and just before they got to Temple-bar, Bourne followed a gentleman and took his handkerchief—Grimes was close behind Bourne at the time—Bourne put the handkerchief into his pocket—I took him, and said, "I want that handkerchief"—he took it out—Stewart came up, whom I had seen occasionally with my brother officer—he never was with me before.</p>

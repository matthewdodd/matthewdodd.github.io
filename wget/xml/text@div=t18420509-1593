                  </hi>. Previous to and on the 8th of March I was a pri<lb></lb>soner in the Fleet. the elder prisoner lived in the room exactly opposite to roe—the other prisoner is his son—the elder prisoner was in the habit of coming into my room frequently—his room is what is called a <hi rend="italic">whistling-shop,</hi> where people can get any thing to drink, a sort of canteen, and where now and then you can dine, to save the trouble of employing servants about the place—my room is No. 10, in the Coffee-gallery—I hired the room of Mr. Shepherd, one of the turnkeys—I was the sole occupier of it—previous to this Clark had a piano-forte standing in my room, and other things, and from his coming there he had the opportunity of seeing the position of dif<lb></lb>ferent articles in my room—no other person had the same kind of general access to my room—a few days before the 8th of March I lent him a couple of sovereigns, which he paid me again—on the 8th of March I left my room, about a quarter after nine o'clock at night, and locked it—it was considerably after the prison gates had been closed for the night—about a week or ten days before the robbery I was in the prisoner's room, and heard him and another man conversing about cashing bills, and I acci<lb></lb>dentally said to the prisoner, "Why, if I had known you cashed bills, I should have got a bill cashed some time ago, which I have had done since I have been here"—he asked me the amount—I said 66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then asked him what per centage he asked—he said 50 per cent.—I said I had had mine done for the regular per centage—when I left my room on the 8th of March I left a leather coat-bag and my writing-desk on the portmanteau in the room—there was a small German clock—the writing-case contained two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and other things much more valuable to me than money, documents, securities, and correspondence—I locked the padlock of my door, and put the key into my pocket—there was no other lock to the door—I went along the Coffee-gallery, up the stairs leading from the Coffee<lb></lb>gallery—as I was going up I met the elder prisoner at the bottom of the stairs leading to the upper gallery, with a bason of sugar in his hand—I was leaning over the gallery, and he came up, with, I believe, one foot on</p>

               <p>the stairs, going to ascend—we entered into conversation there—he informed me he was taking it to No. 11, in the top—meaning the other gallery—he asked where I was going—I replied, to the room of an acquaintance in the next gallery—he inquired bow long I should be—I said about half<lb></lb>an-hour—this at the time made no impression on me, as he kept a <hi rend="italic">whistling<lb></lb>shop,</hi> and people sometimes assembled there, I thought be might wish me to go into his room, or something—I then proceeded to my friend's room—I do not swear positively, but my impression is, that instead of going up stairs, he went back—when I left my own room his room Was wide open, and there appeared nobody in it—the candles were lighted, and nobody else in the gallery at the time but him and me, which is a very rare occurrence—my impression is there was nobody in his room—it is possible somebody might be in a corner without my seeing them—I suppose it is not above fifty or sixty yards from the prisoner's room, No. 3, to the staircase where I met him—I returned in about three quarters of an hour—I should say it was about ten o'clock, and found the padlock and staple wrenched off my door, and on entering the room, and lighting a candle, I found my writing-case gone—I looked for the padlock and staple, and they were gone also—none of the contents of the writing-case were left behind—the clock was not taken—I had seen the two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes safe in the writing<lb></lb>case that very morning—it was impossible I could have opened the cast without seeing them—by a memorandum which I made I am able to speak to the notes I lost—I had a recollection in my mind of the notes—I would not even trust to myself, but next morning I sent about them—I know I had three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes of a certain number—I know the numbers and dates from the note I gave away—I know it to be "No. 3," the other two consequently must be "Nos. 4, and 5," that were stolen—I have no me<lb></lb>morandum made before they were lost—I made this memorandum myself merely to bring down here—the three notes had been brought me by my sister with other money—I had had the notes in my possession from about the 23rd of February—I cannot tell the numbers from my memory—I bad frequently seen them—I cannot tell the numbers from my memory—my memory in numbers always fails me—I know the one I gave my sister was "No. 81, 303," dated the 10th of December, I think 1841—the other numbers must have been "4, and 5," as they were consecutive.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you in the Fleet? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I came for the order for the Olympic—I came in to see Mr. Clark—he was to get me the order—I had been there about an hour when I was sent for the coat—I got it from no. 13, in the 3rd gallery—my mother, who was there, gave it to me from a box in the bed-room—I threw it on the table—Mr. Clark took it up, and showed it to the gentleman, and put it on the back of a chair—about an hour or two after he told me to take it up again, which I did—Mrs. Clark was there till I took it back—it was about twelve o'clock when I went up for it—I went to the Olympic on the 18th—that was the only time I went—that is the way I know that it was on the 16th—I did not at that time go to Mr. Clark's more than once or twice a week—I live with my sisters, no. 4, Bedford-row East, Old Kent-road—they are no business—they are Mrs. Clark's children, and live on their money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What makes you recollect fetching the coat the day before you went to the Olympic? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My coming for the order—I mentioned about this six or seven weeks ago to Mr. Clark—I was not asked about it—I was not examined before the Justice.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the army, but have left the service. I was confined in the Fleet in March. I remember M'Donald's father applying to me for orders for the Olympic—I gave one on the 16th for the 17th, St. Patrick's day—I was not then aware it was a benefit night—on the following evening, I went into Clark's room about eight o'clock, and learnt by the ladies having returned, that the order was not admitted on account of it being Miss Mitchell's benefit—I gave another order for the 18th—that enables me to be certain of the 16th being the day, having applied to the books of the theatre on that occasion—M'Donald was there on the 16th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You know nothing of the coat being produced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw a coat produced in Mr. Clark's room on the 16th—I cannot say who was present, nor what sort of a coat it was—I will not swear whether it was the one produced or not, as I did not look at it—Mr. Clark said, "I will show you a coat, I recommend one of you to have something made from as a pattern"—it being so long back, I cannot say who "one of you" was—I cannot swear any one was present but Mr. Clark and M'Donald—I cannot say whether the younger prisoner was present—there were two besides—I cannot say whether Cook, the tailor, and James Clark were there, my memory does not serve me—I have had a great deal to do with the Olympic—I have the power of giving orders.</p>

               <p>Olympic, but not to his friends, I will swear—I will not swear I never gave another order in his room but I know this was on the 16th, because it was a private box order, which I did not often give, and St. Patrick's-day is a clue to my recollection—I knew some time before that Miss Mitchell was to take her benefit on St. Patrick's-day, and when they came back, I said, "God bless my soul, I forgot it was St. Patrick's-day, or I would not have given you the order, I should have known it was Miss Mit<lb></lb>chell's benefit"—I was not called before the Justice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a prisoner in the Fleet. I came in on Monday, the 14th of March. On Wednesday, the 16th, I saw Mr. French and M'Donald together, and the elder prisoner was in the room, no. 3, Coffee<lb></lb>gallery—I saw French give young M'Donald an order for the Olympic—I saw a very handsome brown coat in the room that day—I can swear it was the coat produced, by one defect in it—here it is—it exposes part of the red padding.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a fancy warehouse in St. Paul's-churchyard. Young Clark has been in my service five or six years—if ever there was anything oi consequence I was to leave to one of the establishment, I left it to him, in preference to any other—I had the greatest confidence in him—he lives and sleeps in the house.</p>

            . On the 28th of July, just at Midnight, as I was crossing Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, I was set upon by five Men; it was a very clear Star-light Night, and I could see very plainly. Grace came up first, took me by the Collar, and said, Damn you, you Dog, stand, and deliver your Money; if you speak a Word you are a dead Man. I look'd him very hard in the Face. Two others then rifled my Pockets, and while they were taking my Money, a short Man in a Cap and a blue Jacket, whom I take to be Richardson, came behind me, struck me on the Arm and took my Hat and Wig. - I look'd over my Shoulder and saw him. - Him and Grace I remember, but I don't know Smithson. - Grace held me fast, but took nothing from me.</p>

               <p>Watson. I told Justice Robe's Clerk, that we all went to a Night-House in the Strand, then another House in Shug-L ane, and so to Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, and I nam'd all their Names to the Clerk, but he forgot Smithson, and so his Name is interlin'd.</p>

               <p>Some others depos'd, that they had never heard any Ill of Richardson before this Time.</p>
               <p>Watson. I have known Richardson several Years; he and I were three Months in Clerkenwell Bridewell for a Street-Robbery, but there being no Indictment we were discharged - After I had made my first Information before Justice Robe, several Thief-Catchers, - there's

               <p>Court. Upon your Oath was Richardson in the Robbery?</p>
               <p>Watson. Yes.</p>

               <p>Watson. Yes, there was an Attorney came to New-Prison, and enquir'd for me; and when I was brought to him, he call'd for a Bowl of Punch, and bad me sit down and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173309120015"></xptr> drink heartily, and when that Bowl was out we had another. He told me that Richardson's Father was a good 'Sponsible Man, and if I would clear Richardson, and leave him out in my Information, it should be better for me than I could expect. I told him, I was willing to do any Thing that I could, without hurting myself; and, he said, I might save him without hurting myself, if I would but say he was not in the Robbery; and that he would not offer to bribe me, but it should be better for me than I expected. - And others came to me afterwards on the same Account.</p>
               <p>Court. An Attorney do this! What was his Name?</p>
               <p>Watson. It was a cramp sort of a Name, I can't remember it just now, but I know the Man; he's a tall Man, I saw him in the Court a little while ago. - He stood in that Place.</p>
               <p>Officer. Was not his Name Wimpry ?</p>
               <p>Watson. Yes, that was the Name.</p>
               <p>Court. Call him into Court.</p>
               <p>Officer. Mr. Wimpry, an Attorney! - He don't answer.</p>
               <p>Court. Go, see if he's in any of the Publick Houses hereabout.</p>
               <p>Then an Officer went out and brought Mr. Wimpry into Court.</p>
               <p>Court. Here, Sir, you are charg'd with endeavouring to suborn Evidence. This Witness swears you treated him with two Bowls of Punch in New-Prison. and told him it should be better for him than he expected, if he would clear the Prisoner Richardson.</p>

We seeing that, and some People being not far off, we run for it. Grace got clear, but Richardson and I were taken; he by the Watch, and I by the Prosecutor. Richardson afterwards told me, that he had nail'd the Call of his Wipe, and ding'd it down, and was afraid, God damn 'em! that some of 'em had nail'd it again - That is, he had taken the Man's Handkerchief, and drop'd it, and was afraid that some of the Watch had taken it up again.</p>
               <p>The Watchmen then depos'd, as in the former Trial, that they found the Handkerchief, near the place were Richardson was taken.

                  </hi>. I keep a clothes shop, at Richmond. On 31st Jan., I missed a pair of trowsers from my premises, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening—they were in the passage, inside the front door—I saw them safe about 5 o'clock, and missed them about 6 o'clock—I have seen them since—these are them.</p>

I apprehended the two prisoners in a room in a house in Windmill-lane—I found this bag there—it was lying on the bed, close by Cranstone—I examined it, and found a dress in it, and a pair of gloves, which contained four duplicates—one of them is for a pair of trowsers—in going to the station, as we were on the road, we got near Lady Shaw's house, and we made a stop there—West then said, "You have a pair of gloves in that bag, with some duplicates</p>

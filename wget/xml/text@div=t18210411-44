On Wednesday, the 7th of March, about half past six o'clock in the evening - it was rather dusky - I found my shop window either cut or broken, and about thirty volumes of books stolen. There were three volumes of Lord Byron's Works, octavo, bound in green morocco, gilt leaves, which cost me 4 l. 4 s.; one octavo, and two minion Bibles, bound - the first worth 1 l. and the two others 7 s. each; also part of a set of Lord Bacon's Works, six volumes, worth 3 l. 3 s.; - four were left; I lost other books. I do not suppose they could carry away all at once. I was in the shop at the time, and heard a noise, but as it rained I thought it was the umbrellas knocking against the window. I was alarmed ten minutes after, they were all taken, at one time, I had seen them safe, and the window quite perfect, about half past four o'clock. Next day I saw part of them at Bow-street. They had my mark in them, in my own writing. I have recovered all but one Bible. I received the octavo Bible, and Hoyle's Games, from Ackerman on the night of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What part of the window was broken - A. All the pane was out, except a small bit - the books could not have fallen through - they did not rest on the glass.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On Wednesday evening, the 7th of March, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner Davis in Oxford-street, near Chapel-street, on the opposite side to Rathbone-place, near the Pantheon, coming from that way - he had some bound books under his arm - he passed me. A short time after I saw him again without them. I passed on and spoke to two brother officers - I then crossed over the street, and saw Davis come from Chapel-street again. He crossed the street, as if going towards Rathbone-place. He was hardly out of my sight a moment, before he returned with Pickering. They both ran into Chapel-street again - they had nothing with them then. We followed them, and saw them go into Ackerman's, which is a rag shop - and as soon as he went in, the door was pulled to, and Ackerman stood outside of it. Read rushed by him, and got into the shop, and there we found the two prisoners. Ackerman said to me,</p>
               <p>"Take these fellows away, and them books," pointing down to the same books, which laid on some rags, all loose on the counter. We then secured the prisoners. I produce the books. Pickering denied any knowledge of them, and Davis said, he had been employed to bring them there, at three different times, by a man on the other side of the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Davis was alone when he had the books - A. He was.</p>

               <p>THOMAS ROBERTS. I am a carpenter - I was with Davis, and saw the prisoner, with a parcel of books under his arm. I afterwards saw him and Pickering cross from Rathbone-place way. They ran across - Davis was first, and Pickering followed him to Chapel-street. They were about half a yard apart - they appeared together. I saw them both go into Chapel-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Davis was alone when he had the books - Yes, it had been raining, and looked heavy, when they were running. I saw them together in the shop.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>DAVIS'S Defence. I was going down Oxford-street, about six o'clock, and met a genteel looking man, who asked me to carry the parcel. I carried it to this house as he told me. I untied the handkerchief, and took it back to him. He gave me another parcel - I took three in all. I then went back, but could not find him - I returned back to the shop, to know where I was to be paid - the officers came in and took me.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at one time chief clerk in the Examiner's Office in the East India House—the Company was in the habit of receiving balls of opium from Bengal for thirteen or fourteen years before 1854, when I left the service—they were deposited in various places; some in my room—when I left in 1854, I gave directions to have my room cleared—there—were balls of opium at that time in my room; I reckon there were about ten—these balls before me have the same appearance—this kind of opium is not common in England.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman, and superintend the work for Mr. Rigby.

                  </hi>. I am registrar of books and papers at the East India House. It is part of my duty to keep and deliver out books as the officers of the House require them—I have examined the fifty one books produced—I know that such books are the property of the East India Company—all these books are of the same kind as I deliver out of my department—I remember the fact of two books being delivered to Dr. Royle's department; they were No. 11 and No. 12—these are the two—I am not aware that these could be obtained by purchase in England out of the East India House—they are very valuable as to the information they contain—they are never sold to my knowledge.</p>

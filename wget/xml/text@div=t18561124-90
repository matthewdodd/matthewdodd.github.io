                  </hi>. On 29th Oct, I was in a public house in Dudley-street—I came just outside, and saw tour of the prisoners; Young was not there; they were in conversation about buying a suit of clothes; Wootton said that he was going to buy a new hat the first thing—Cullen said, "You have got a very good hat, I do not see what you are going to buy a new one for"—he said that he was tired of it, and was going to buy a new suit of clothes, and would have a hat and all complete—he said, "You can have the hat if you like," and with that he gave Cullen the hat, and said, "I have got a pipe you can have, I will make you a present of it"—Wootton went away then with the intention of buying a suit of clothes, and I saw nothing more of him.</p>

            , Jun.; the prisoner came to their shop on the 29th of October, about six o'clock, to buy an eighth same of an Irish lottery ticket; I shewed her some, and after chusing one, she presented me a 20l. note for payment, (the note produced); this is the note she presented; it appears to be a Guildford bank-note, there is no stamp on it; upon taking it into my hand, I thought it was not regularly signed, from it being signed Sparkers and Co. by only one of the partners.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with the signature of the Guildford bank-notes, and did that give you suspicion? - A. Not particularly that, but it is quite irregular to sign notes so; I did not say any thing to her, but shewed it to Mr. Alder, and said, I should take it over to Messrs. Esdailes' the bankers, to inquire whether it was good; I said that in the presence of Mrs. Solomons; she said, very anxiously, she would not trouble us to take it over, for she had got a smaller note, which would do as well, and she seemed to wish to have that back; I went over to the banker's, and shewed it to one of the clerks, who immediately discovered it to be a forgery; I went back and asked her where she lived; she said in Houndsditch, and kept a shop; I asked where she took the note; she said it was impossible to tell, as she had dealings at different parts of the country; after that I asked her again if she could possibly tell, and, after some hesitation, she said, she had taken it of a man whom she had sold some cloth to; Mr. Messenger came over, and put the same questions to her, and she returned the same answers she had done to me; I gave the note to Mr. Alder; he went over to Esdailes' house, and she went with them.</p>

               <p>Q. I have no right to ask you whether you offered that note to the prisoner; but I ask you did you not purchase two pieces of cloth of her? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. It went out of your hands on the 28th of October? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. I buy clothes, and keep a little shop, and have near seven years.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18011202-29-person315">Q. </persName>
            Has any misfortune happened to you in that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me, within half a dozen, how many times you have been in custody in the course of that time? - A. It is a question I don't think proper to answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any objection to tell how many times you have had the good fortune to be admitted King's evidence? - A. I believe I can recollect once.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you say you cannot recollect more than once? - A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not like to tell me how many times you have been in custody charged with felony of different sorts? - A. No, I don't think proper.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the prisoner being taken to the Mansion-house, I believe you were lent for before the Lord-Mayor? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you had been brought before the Lord-Mayor at first, that you found yourself at liberty? - A. The Wednesday following, as I was taken on the Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the subject of this very note? - A. Upon this note, and another one.</p>
               <p>Q. You then contrived to get you yourself at liberty, and get the prisoner committed? - A. I did not contrive it, because the late Lord-Mayor saw my life, by a conspiracy, was to be sworn away, and admitted me to bail.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18011202-29-person316">Q. </persName>
            May I take the liberty of asking where you got that note? - A. Yes, of a young man, who calls himself Flinc.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same Mr. Flint who was tried here the other evening? - A. No, a son of his; he calls himself so.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Flint, of Shoe-lane? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That young man has absconded since? - A. He has.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, that man came to me, and bought two pieces of Irish, and gave me the note; I did not think any thing of the note being bad; I did not know his character at that time, or else I would not have taken it; but, since that, I have heard a very bad character, and am very sorry that ever I took the note of a person of that description; I am innocent, and it is that only which supports me to speak; I sold him two pieces of Irish linen, of twenty-five yards each, at three shillings and two-pence per yard; and I gave him a ten-pound note, a two-pound note, to the best of my recollection, and, I believe, one shilling and eight pence, or one shilling and four pence, I will not be sure which.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave her a good character. <rs id="t18011202-29-verdict149" type="verdictDescription">

            . I live in Whitechapel. On the 24th of November, I met the prisoner six miles from St. Albans, with the child; my wife asked her whose it was, she said it belonged to a woman who was either behind or before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She frequently gave me the child<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020072"></xptr>with a hat on, and said, "When you are going up the street you can get a caster (a hat) for the child." I have frequently taken it into a cook shop, and fed it, and have taken it off the floor when she has been beastly drunk; she gave it to me, but not to take into the country - I have had six children, and am in the family way now, it is not likely that I should steal a child.</p>

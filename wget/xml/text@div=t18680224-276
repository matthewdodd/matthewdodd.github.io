                  </hi>. I am a boot maker, of 22, Church Street, Soho—I entered the prisoner's service as foot traveler in the beginning of 1867, and left on 13th July—the arrangement was that I should solicit orders for him, have 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and 2 ½ per cent, on all orders from my customers, to be paid when the orders were executed and paid for, without reference to whom they were paid—he distinctly told me that I was to receive no monies, except by special command—I did receive a special command to receive money, and I received money in consequence six or ten times—sometimes I have been with the prisoner, and have receipted bills for him, he not being able to write—I was dismissed at a week's notice, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd</p>

               <p>being due to me—I asked him to give me a list of the outstanding accounts, to calculate my commission—he said that he could not give it to me then, but if I came on Monday he would have it ready—I applied on the Mon<lb></lb>day; it was not ready, and he asked me to call in a few days—I called again in a few days; he came to the door in a blustering way—I said I had called for the list—he said, "I shan't give it to you"—I said, "If you will not, I shall have to go round to all the customers and ask them for a copy of their bills, and then I shall apply to you every week until my commission is due"—I did so, and then served him with a written notice, which he has got—he refused payment, and I took out a summons in the County Court—I never had a horse and trap to go about with, but I have fetched it from the stable on the other side of the way—the summons was heard on 15th January; the defendant was sworn, and stated that my arrangement was 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and 2 ½ per cent, on all monies that I received, and not on orders, as he had never paid me on orders; that I had never made any application to him for money, and he did not know that he owed me any, and was very much surprised when he received the summons, as he did not know what it was for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean to tell the Jury that your commission was payable on all monies you received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was to receive no money except by special command—when I left, I settled accounts with him up to what money had then been collected in—at the time I left, the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I sued for was not due—I was to be paid when the money was paid—that is not what he swore; he swore that my engagement was nothing on orders—if he had sworn that my commission would be payable when he was paid, that would have been true; but he swore that I was to be paid when he was paid upon what I received myself, although I was to receive nothing—he sometimes made me wait six weeks when I had taken the orders—when he was paid, I was always paid, at the end of the week—I did not cancel all the orders in the book when I left—the Judge did not say that my having cancelled the orders put an end to the matter, or any<lb></lb>thing about that—he said that as the defendant had sworn it, and was supported by his wife and his father, he must give judgment for him—they were examined on the trial as to the agreement—I do not know George Peter, but he is a clicker to the prisoner—he did not see me canceling the orders in the book—I did not cancel any, and did not tell him that I had—I am certain the prisoner swore that he did not know he owed me any<lb></lb>thing, and that I never applied for commission on the orders I obtained—he swore that he discharged me because, while using his horse and trap, I took the best orders for myself, and left the bad ones to him—the trap was not supplied to me, I was only out in it when with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 28, Tottenham Place, Tottenham Court Road—on 15th January, I was at the Westminster County Court, and attended to some part of what was going on—I heard the prisoner say that he paid Mr. Collins 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and so much commission on monies brought in by Collins—I am quite sure it was on monies brought in by Collins—I do not know the parties—I never saw Collins, but once before, till I saw him at the County Court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Seymour-place. On the 6th of July, 1833, I was at Paddington Church, and saw the prisoner mar<lb></lb>ried there to Kezia Mason—I saw he yesterday morning, she was then alive—he lived with her from that time till the 26th of June, 1836.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bryanstone-street. On the 27th of June last I was married to the prisoner in Marylebone Church—repre<lb></lb>sented himself to me as single—I went to live with him afterwards at Cheltenham, and we kept a tobacconist's shop—I stocked the shop to the amount of between 20% between and 30%—that stock is now in existence—my family interfered—we separated, and he was taken afterwards in London.</p>

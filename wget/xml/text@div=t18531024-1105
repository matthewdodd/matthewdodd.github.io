I remember the prisoner coming into my shop on 19th Aug.—I believe it was about 12 o'clock—there was some conversation about some pins, and the prisoner asked me if I had any rings—I told him no—he asked me if I bought rings—I said yes, if they suited me—he told me he was commissioned by a lady to sell several hundred pound's worth of jewellery; she had a heavy lawsuit pending, and she did not wish to have her name mentioned—he said he would bring two rings to me to see—he came back again in perhaps not quite half an hour—he showed me these two rings,</p>

I heard of the robbery—I received a note, directing me to go to Lady Pigot's house—in consequence of inquiries which I made, I went to No. 10, Milton-place, Euston-square; that is where the prisoner lives—he came in about a quarter past 2 o'clock in the morning—I arrived there between 9 and 10 o'clock at night, and remained in the room till he came—I asked him if his name was Williams—he said it was—I told him I was a police officer—I was in plain clothes—I was going to take him into custody on suspicion of stealing two rings of Sir Robert Pigot's—he said, "I know nothing about any rings"——I said, "I believe you sold two rings to Mr. Maidens, in Oxford-street?"—he said, "No, I did not"—I asked him if he knew Mr. Maidens—he said, "Yes; but he will not say I sold any rings to him"—before I took him to the station, I sent for Mr. Maidens—Mr. Maidens was a short distance away with some other officers; he came in half an hour afterwards, and said, "That is the man I bought the rings from"—on the road to the station he said, in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>," Do you mean to say I sold you any rings?"—and Mr. Maidens said, "Yes, you did"—on 20th Sept. I received a letter from the prisoner, from the House of Detention, which was put into my hands by another officer; in consequence of which I went to the House of Detention—he asked me if I had received a letter—I told him I had—he then told me that he wanted to see some papers which I had, as some of them were in reference to the date when he purchased the rings; be had bought them from a person, and would bring witnesses forward to prove that upon his trial; and that the reason he did not say so at Marl borough-street police court was, he thought the parties were out of town from whom he purchased them—I told him to name any paper he wanted, and he should see it—he said he could not do that—I looked over the papers, and I found none of them had reference to rings of any description—the letter was dated, "House of Detention, Sept. 19, 1853," directing me to let him have any papers, or see them, which I had got of his</p>

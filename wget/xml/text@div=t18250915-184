            . I am a coal merchant, and live in Hampstead-road. On the 3d of August I went to keep watch at the prosecutor's house. I was in the top room, on the third floor, at a quarter past one o'clock, and saw the watchman come and sit down on the steps of the door - he then turned round, apparently at a signal being given, and moved to the other end of the steps, near the area<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150070"></xptr>steps, and I saw a man's arm and hand give him, (through the rails,) what appeared to me to be loaves of bread - they came from a person standing on the area steps - he put it under the left side of his coat, and went round the corner, and I saw no more of him.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Todd, and sleep in the same bed with Wardrobe and Stephenson. I go to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock, and they get up to make their bread. On Wednesday, the 3d of August, I went to bed between eleven and twelve, and they got up, and came down the steps to go to work. I did not see the officer till the Saturday morning. I then saw Mr. Webster in the shop, but it was Tidds who took the men.

                  </hi>. I am a weaver, living at No. 6, Granby Street, St. Matthew, Bethnal Green. On 28th Dec. I fastened up my house, and went out at 9 o'clock, and locked the door; the clock had struck 9—the shutters were closed, but not fastened; the bar was not up—at a few minutes past 10 o'clock I was fetched by the neighbours, and saw the prisoner standing outside my door, and two men holding him—the hasp where the lock goes in, was nearly broken off, so as to make it give way; that would enable a person to open the door and go in—some of my working tools had been disturbed, and I lost a handkerchief out of a hat box; I have never seen it since—the prisoner was taken into custody—some work materials had been removed.</p>

About 10 o'clock on 28th Dec. some one told me some<lb></lb>thing, and I came round to my house, No. 14, Granby Street, and watched Mr. Webster's house, next door—I saw a light up stairs, and two men came out; the prisoner was the first—I do not know who the other was; I have not seen him since—I ran across the road, caught the prisoner, and held him till a policeman came—he struck me slightly in the mouth—the other man got away.</p>

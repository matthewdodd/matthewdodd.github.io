                  </hi>. I keep a tobacco-shop in Bishopsgate-street. On Saturday, the 7th of March, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I went into my shop, and noticed some cigars in disorder in the window, and a pane of glass broken—there was a hole large enough to admit a man's arm—I missed five bundles of cigars, worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—while I was closing my shutters the policeman came up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a copper-plate printer, and live in Skinner-street. On the 7th of March I was passing the prosecutor's shop on my way home, from half-past eleven to twelve o'clock, and saw the prisoner in company with another young man—in a moment or two after I passed I saw him taking some cigars out of a hole in the window—he gave them to the other young man, who went away to the Wellington public-house in Shoreditch—I followed, and when I got to Worship-street the young man dropped some—I picked up some of them—I afterwards showed the policeman the spot, and he found one there—as I went in at the door of the Wellington public-house the other man came out—I afterwards met him outside with the prisoner—he bad nothing in his hands when he came out—he had taken them fn there—he escaped—I went back to the public-house again afterwards, and found the prisoner there—he was se<lb></lb>cured.</p>

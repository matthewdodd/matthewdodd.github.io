I did not cry out, for the Blows they gave were so violent, that they took away my Speech for several Minutes, and I have had a sore Breast ever since - But I crost the way and told Betty Hays I had been robb'd of my Pocket. She ask'd me, If I had not dropp'd it? And I said, No, for I saw it in Lydia's Hand. She had a Warrant against them a pretty while by her, and being they us'd me so ill, she serv'd it upon them that Night.</p>

And so she hit me a Slap o'the Face, and she had often threatened to use me ill, whereof I cross'd the Way; then they fell aboard o' Kate Hyam; and I heard her say, Don't take it; but she spoke so faint. I could hardly tell what she said. And then she came over to me, and said, Dear Heart, I have lost my Pocket.</p>
               <p>Hester. Jew Kate's Husband got drunk, and stood talking with a Man in Middle-Row, and the Man said, Let me have the Watch, that your Wife pick'd my Pocket of.

Whereof I fell upon her, and beat her to her Heart's content, and so she got a Warrant for me.</p>

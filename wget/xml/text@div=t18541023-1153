                  </hi>. I am of the firm of Bolton, Smith, and Co., of Bow-churchyard, warehousemen. The prisoner Bannister, who called himself Mortimer, called at our warehouse on 25th May; he stated he was about opening a shop in Drury-lane, and he required goods to stock his shop—I said it was customary for us to have money for the first parcel—he replied his uncle had just died and left him property, and he referred me to Mr. Taylor, in Southampton-street, Bloomsbury—he said the value of the property was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said Mr. Taylor would satisfy me that the property was coming to him—in consequence of that I went to Mr. Taylor, to the address given, Mr. Arthur Taylor, No. 22, Southampton-street, Bloomsbury—he was represented as being a surveyor—I called on Mr. Taylor, and was introduced into his room—it was between the 23rd and 25th of May, that I called on him—(I cannot give the exact date, that Mortimer called—it was from the 23rd to the 25th)—I was introduced into a room where there was a table, and plans, and papers, distributed in a manner that I should suppose any surveyor's office would have—I told him I was come from Mr. Mortimer, who had requested us to let him have some goods as he was opening a shop in Drury-lane—I said, "Should I be safe in allowing Mr. Mortimer to have the goods that he wanted?"—he said he was instructed by Mr. Mortimer to sell property that had been left to him by an uncle, and that in about a month or so he had no doubt he would have the proceeds, and that I should be quite right in trusting him to the amount of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he should think the property he was instructed to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230101"></xptr>
               <p>sell, would realise certainly between 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we supplied Mortimer with goods; ready made clothing to the amount of between 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I requested that some arrangement might be made about payment after I had seen Taylor—I had said to Taylor, "Suppose I take a bill of Mr. Mortimer on you, will it be right?"—he said, "Make it payable here, and I will see that it is paid"—I said, "A bill on Mortimer at two months"—I af<lb></lb>terwards took this acceptance (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>); I saw this acceptance written by Mortimer—this other paper is a note to Mr. Taylor, to pay the amount of the bill when due—I asked Mortimer for a note to Mr. Taylor, and he com<lb></lb>menced writing, and could not—he said he had had the cholera the night before—I said, should I write it, which I did—I wrote the body of the note myself as he was so incapable, and he signed it—I read it to him—what induced me to part with my goods on this occasion, was what Mr. Taylor had said, that he had the property to sell, and that he would see me paid, and Mortimer said something of the same description, before I went to Mr. Taylor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had that statement of his any influence on your giving the credit to him? without that representation, would you have given credit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think I should—I would not have given him credit without the two representations.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. John Edward Smith, of Wood-street, Cheapside. I saw the prisoner Mortimer at our warehouse—in consequence of directions I received, I went to No. 22, Southampton-street; I there saw Mr. Taylor—his appearance was respectable—I said I came from Messrs. Smith and Co., and we were referred to him by Mr. Mortimer, who had called at their place for goods—he told me we could safely trust him, as he had his affairs in hand, and Mr. Mortimer was shortly to come into possession of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—nothing else was said at that time—I saw him again afterwards; his office had the appearance of a solicitor's or a sur<lb></lb>veyor's office; it had books and papers about, and a clerk there—I saw him again after I found the goods had disappeared—when I saw him in the first instance, it was about the 29th May—the latter end of May—after the goods were gone I saw him again; about a fortnight after I first saw him—I called to know if he knew anything respecting Mortimer, as I found the shop closed, and the goods were taken away—he said he could give me no information respecting him at all, but that he had the affairs in hand—I went again to Taylor's several times, but I only ran against him that one time—I understood that some one had distrained the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the Old Bailey, and am partner with Mr. Cook. About 25th May the prisoner Mortimer came to ask us to fit up a shop in Drury-lane—he told me that in consequence of the death of an uncle, he was coming into the possession of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in two or three weeks—on that faith I did the work—it came to 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the work done was car<lb></lb>penter's work, painting, and gas fitting—he also ordered thirteen boxes, which were supplied to him—the value of them was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and there was a mahogany writing desk, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I supplied all those things on the faith of his representations—I was backwards and forwards at the shop while the work was going on—I did not see any goods delivered.</p>

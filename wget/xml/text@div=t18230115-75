Gould alarmed me, I felt and missed a silk handkerchief, which was safe five minutes before. In consequence of what he said, I turned into Cloth-fair, following the prisoner and two others; he pointed the prisoner out - I collared him, and the other two ran off. I have not found the handkerchief; it was a red, yellow, and black colour.</p>

            . On the 10th of January, I was in Long-lane, and saw the prisoner take a dark coloured handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to a second man, who gave it to a third, who put it into his hat, which he had off ready to receive it. I informed Harland, and followed them - they were talking to two girls at the end of the court; I pointed the prisoner out, and he took him; the other two ran off. I had a large basket on my shoulder, so that I could not take either of them. I am positive of the prisoner's person - I had watched him for three minutes.</p>

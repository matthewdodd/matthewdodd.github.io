            , a waterman, on the stand, told me he had searched the rank of hackney coaches; he could not find any coach belonging to the prisoner; I directly took hold of him on suspicion of stealing the coat; he had been offering the coat for sale. When I had got within a few yards of the watch-house, I had hold of one cuff of the coat, the prisoner gave a twist, the coat came off in my arms, he got away. I pursued him; he was stopped by a watchman; he was not out of my sight, nor two minutes from me, until I got him again. I took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>JAMES HALE. Q. Did you apprehend this man in conjunction with Wood - A. Yes. The coat being a big one, and he a little man, he made a ruslt, and sprang out of the coat; I am sure he is the man, he was not from us above a minute and a half. We never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked that coat up in Couson-street, Mayfair, about eleven o'clock at night; I had a long way to go to my lodging in Water-lane, Blackfriers, and as I was locked out I went to get into a watering-house I told them I had a coach on the stand on purpose for them to let me in, and I had not been in a minute before the waterman asked me if I would sell the coat, I told him I did not know. I am as innocent of stealing the coat as a child unborn.</p>

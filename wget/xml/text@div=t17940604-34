My house was broke open on the night of the 24th of April, it was between that and the 25th. I did not go to bed till past twelve o'clock, the clock strock twelve when I went down to see the cellar window was fast, and that was fast; and I locked the cellar door, and all the parts were secure, as far as I know. My wife and I both went to bed together. My family consists of two servant maids, my wife, and four children. Before I went to bed I went down into the cellar, particularly, which I always do every night; to the best of my knowledge the house was all safe. I generally gets up at five o'clock in the morning, just as I was getting up, the man that keeps the tap called out, Mr. Clipson, come down, for God's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040057"></xptr>sake, for you are robbed; his name is Horsefall. There are shutters that part the tap from the vine vaults at night. I immediately came down stairs, and I found my shop covered with papers and linen, several odds and ends of things, and three pair of sheets that they did not take away, and the till turned toply turvy, and I missed several things. I advertised a reward of twenty pounds, and I received some information; Saturday morning I went to Hatton Garden, and there I got a search warrant; I went to Bowler's lodgings, in Turtle street, Gray's-inn lane, the prisoner and his wife were in the room; the first thing we found was a pistol in a box of leathers, loaded and primed, it seemed to be quite fresh in a box of loose feathers. In searching in a box I found three yards of muslin and a piece of irish, both of which I immediately said was my property; these were found in another box, not in the box of feathers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that box contain any thing else? - Nothing that I can speak to. These things are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in the course of your search, find any thing else? - No, I did not, in that room the prisoner was in, and we brought him away with us to the office.</p>
               <p>

            Where were the other things found? - I did not find any more.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt that that night these things were in your house? - I cannot particularly say, my wife can.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I take it for granted that it was light at the time when you got up? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. And had been so some time? - It certainly had.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was it, and what month was it you found these things in the possession of the prisoner? - Saturday morning, the 26th of April, the very next day.</p>
               <p>Q. The commitment is dated I see the 28th of May? - I found the things the 26th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the man not to be committed till the 28th of May? - He made some voluntary confession before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. How many examinations did he undergo at the magistrate's, before he was committed? - I cannot tell, I never was there against him but three times, the day he was taken and the next Tuesday, and they sent for me over, just before this sessions, when they bound me over to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Q. You I believe, have been frequently in this court, sometimes as defendant, and sometimes as prosecutor? - I have been as defendant.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been here prosecuting for perjury, and sometimes prosecuted for perjury? - Never for perjury, I was tried for murder, by the prosecution of Mr. Jacques, and acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you a witness on the prosecution of Crosley, the attorney? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been a witness in this court? - The first time was when I was a witness against Mrs. Brownrigg.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. In the first place, with regard to the elapse of time, between the time that that man was taken up, and his commitment, it was in consequence of something that he said he had to impart that might be of public benefit, and no favour to him, that he was not committed? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in the service of the sheriff of Middlesex? - Yes, and now am an officer of the Sheriff of London.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of William Clipson.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the night of the 25th of April, going to bed? Do you remember whether the house was fast? - I saw it all fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Horsefall calling to you? - I do. When I came down stairs, and I believe I was down about a quarter of a minute before any body else, I found the house in that state that it appeared to be broke open from the cellar, I found two doors that locked away the taphouse, from the wine vaults, broke open, that parts the tap house from our house; our man that keeps the tap house can speak better to the cellar than I can. The middle street door was open likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was the shop? - There were a great number of things laying about, my childrens clothes, and three large new pair of sheets, I saw some of the things on Saturday, at the justice's office, in Hatton-garden, a small piece of muslin, and a piece of irish; this is the muslin, and this is the irish.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take on yourself to say that is your property? - I will, I had seen it on Thursday, in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there any mark on it? - Here is a mark that I cut out some gussets for sleeves from it.</p>
               <p>Court. That might have happened to other pieces of cloth? - It might, but I firmly believe it is mine, the muslin I have some frocks that will match, except that they have been washed, and there is the same quantity as was left to make a younger child one, and it corresponds with the quality.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then there is no mark whatever on the muslin, and these childrens frocks of your's will not match with it, because they have been washed? - I can bring them if you require them.</p>
               <p>Q. That linen has no mark on it, except that soute person has cut out such a piece from it, as may be cut out by any person that is making shirts. Will you swear positively to that piece, when a man's life is at a stake? - I believe it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. But you will not take on yourself to be positive; it is a common way in which a person would cut out gussets? - I don't know how any other person would cut it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it any extraordinary size to cut out for gussets? - It is the size that I wanted it.</p>
               <p>Q. If this man is convicted there is a reward? - Very possible there may, I never enquired, I don't wish to get money in that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband has been familiar with courts of justice? - He has been.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you married? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you don't know there is a reward of forty pounds? - I have heard it, but I don't want any forty pounds; I could not have lived these years in the world, and not have heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you married Mr. Clipson, where did you live? - In St. Martin's-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you live in Drury-lane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The neighbours were unkind enough to say that it was a bad house I believe? Did not they call it a baudy house? - I really don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard them reproach you with keeping a baudy house? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor have you never been charged with keeping a baudy house? - No, ne-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040059"></xptr>never; I cannot help what people may please to say, I don't know that they ever did, I never heard they did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many lodged in your house? - I really don't know, I have three in my house now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been charged with keeping a baudy house? - I don't know that I have a right to answer all your questions, and I shall appeal to my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. You have no right to answer any questions that accuse yourself of any crime; and whatever you might have been you may be an honest woman now.</p>

Mr. and Mrs. Clipson came down, and in searching I found my cellar door broke open, and the lines belonging to the bells were cut, that the bells might not ring, and the ventilator tore out of the window of the tap room.</p>

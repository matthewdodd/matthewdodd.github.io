I heard nothing of it till Friday, I heard it had been at Mr. Goodman's on Snow-hill, and I found it on the Saturday at Mr. Porter's, he asked me if it was mine, and I said it was; they told me the person who brought it was to be there on the Monday; I went, and saw the prisoner; she said she had the chain of a young man; the chain is of my manufacturing, by my people, I am quite sure of it.</p>

               <p>On the 9th of April last, about six in the evening, one Saunders brought this brass chain to me, and asked me if I wanted any; I asked to look at it, I sent for Mr. Wood, and appointed him to come on the Monday; Saunders came, and the prisoner came with him; she said she had the chain of a young man for debt for rent; I asked her how long she had had it; she said three weeks; I told her if she could not give a better account of it, I should send for a constable; she was taken before an Alderman, and committed to prison.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. How long did she lay in custody before she was fully committed? - About a month.</p>
               <p>For what was she committed at last? - For having that chain in her custody, knowing it to be stolen; the reason was because she did not bring ball that was approved of.</p>
               <p>(The commitment produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are you a dealer in this article? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing peculiar in this chain by which it is distinguishable? - No, I could not swear to it, it is not my manufactory, if it was it would be different.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my chain, I know it by the make; it is my work and my young man's; it is in many pieces.</p>
               <p>Court. What quantity do you make of this? - To a large amount.</p>
               <p>How long has that workman made for you? - Several years.</p>
               <p>That which was in your shop window, did it differ from any other which he has made? - No; it is not in a state for sale.</p>
               <p>How long will it remain bright after it is made? - Half a year.</p>
               <p>If you was to put any other in a damp place, would it not appear as dull as that? - Yes, and a great deal duller.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to constable. Did the prisoner tell you she could tell you where the man lived that gave it her? - Yes; we went, and she wanted to go with me to a house in Golden-lane to enquire for him, and a woman said he was gone from there on the Saturday.</p>

               <p>The prisoner brought this chain to me, she said she lived in Golden-lane, I told her I would shew it to a person, she came again, she wanted two shillings and two pence a pound for it, I told her it was not honestly come by, and she went down with my wife, she made no objection of going, she seemed to wonder at it; it seems such a person as she described had been there, and had left his apartment.

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Of course, Sir, you know something about chains for scales? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Look at that, and see whether any person can with safety venture to swear that is his property, or whether any workman can swear that is his work? - I employ six people<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110080"></xptr> at this time, and I cannot see any difference between one person's work and another's, it is quite a common pattern, we put these to counter scales for grocers for large weights; I firmly believe that no man can safely swear to the making of this chain; I have cut up a great many thousand yards.</p>
               <p>If it was badly made you would find fault with it? - Yes, we always look at it to see if it is well made.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you chain-makers in your own house, or do you buy of six different people? - We employ them out of doors, they are called garret-masters, they are not made in our house; there is nothing made in any scale-makers in London.</p>
               <p>But you are not a chain maker yourself? - No, I am a scale maker, not a chain maker; this is a chain often used to scales, I believe.</p>
               <p>You formerly dealt with Mr. Wood? - I have several times, and do now.</p>
               <p>Wood. You have not had anything of me these two years?</p>
               <p>Astill. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Wood. Not to my knowledge.</p>

He is a bricklayer's labourer, employed by the Company; he was along side of the nail box; he was lifting the nails from the box, and putting them in his pocket; he observed that I see him put some in his pocket, and he dropped some on the stairs, and said that he wanted them, to put them in his shoes. I said nothing to him, but I went and told my fellow labourers that Longley had got some of the Company's property; and my fellow labourer went to the counting house to this gentleman, Mr. Duree. I went back to my employment, because I was requested to be back as soon as possible.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to the East India Company. I am what they call an elder there. On Saturday last, about twelve o'clock, I believe it was, I was informed by the last witness, and another man, that the prisoner Langley had been taking some nails from a box on a stair case, belonging to the Company. Afterwards he went on the top of the house to work; I went to the top of the house after him, and called him down. I asked him what he had in his pocket? he said, nothing. I told him I was sure he had some nails of the Company. He then emptied the nails into an apron, belonging to one of the men, out of his pockets. I asked him if had got any more in his pocket, he said, he had not. I put my hand into his waistcoat pocket, and found there was some tea, two ounces and a quarter weight of Singlo tea. I sent for a Custom house officer that is here, and he took it from him; and he has got it in his possession. I asked him where he got the tea? he said, he thought there was no harm in it; and he went up, and pointed out the chest where he took it out from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else? - Not to my knowledge; I was there all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the nails? - Very likely three shillings. I gave them into the custody or one of our men.</p>
               <p>- HETCHELL sworn.</p>
               <p> I have got the nails; the prisoner took them out of his own pocket and delivered them into my possession; likewise I see the officer take the tea out of his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. How many nails are there? - Six or seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had a piece of tiling off, and the bricklayer was not in the way to lath it on, and I went down and took some nails on purpose to lay it on as soon as possible I could; the lath nails don't run very little larger than them; I did it to get it lathed in as soon as possible I could, because of the rain; and when I went down to get some lath nails there was some tea laying down along side of the chest, and I scratched it up and took some of it, and they asked me what chest it came out of? and I shewed them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

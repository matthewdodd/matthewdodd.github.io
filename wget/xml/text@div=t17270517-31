            , (Servant to a Laundress) depos'd, That as she was pulling out some of the late Mr. Widdrington Darby's Linnen, the Prisoner came to enquire after the Particulars of Mr. Darby's Murder, and after she had given him a relation of the unhappy Accident, he would have insinuated to her, as though it would be no Crime for her to give Mr. Darby's Servant one or two of those Shirts, or otherwise to embezzle them; but she being of a better Principle, gave no heed to what he said, though he urg'd it with much Importunity; finding he could not prevail with her this way, he desired her to give him a little Small Beer, which she did, and whilst she was gone to draw it, in all probability, he took the two Shirts mentioned in the Indictment.

Mrs. Booth went before the Justice with the Prisoner, and there comparing the other Shirts of Mr. Darby's, to those the prisoner had stole, and found them to be of the same Cloth, Make, Size and Mark, and by Consequence the Shirts for which he stood indicted. He had several to appear for him, who gave him an extraordinary Character, but this Fact was plainly prov'd upon him, which he could not positively deny, saying he was in drink, and could not tell what he did.

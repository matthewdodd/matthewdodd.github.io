I live at 58, King-street, Woolwich—my late hus<lb></lb>band was a baker there—the prisoner was my servant—it was her custom to fetch the beer for my supper, and at times she would fetch it in my absence, and put it on one side—on Sunday evening, 10th May, I went out about ten minutes to 9, and returned about a quarter to 11—I knocked at the door, and the prisoner came down and opened the door to me—she was partly undressed, and appeared to have been to bed—I saw the beer on the table, but having been out I did not, want it—I was going to put it away, but per<lb></lb>ceived a strong smell proceeding from it, which induced me to taste it—I then tasted it a second time, and put it away in a cupboard—next day it dinner-time she asked me if she should fetch the beer—I said, "Yes, fetch me a pint"—she said, "Oh, there is your beer in the cupboard, you did not drink last night"—I said, "Where did you get that beer last night?"—she said, "At Mr. Bayne's"—I said, "There is something the matter with it; I cannot drink it"—she said she had fetched some for herself and some for me, and had drank her own, and there was nothing the matter with it—I asked her who served her—she said, "<hi rend="italic">Carry</hi> Bayne"—I told her to take it back to them, and ask them if they had not made a great mistake in giving her that for beer—she was some time before she came to take it; which ex<lb></lb>cited my suspicion, and I took it myself to the house—they tasted it, and from what they told me, I Went back and taxed the prisoner with putting some<lb></lb>thing into it—the denied it—MR. Bayne afterwards came, and she denied, is his presence, having put anything into it—she waited some time, and he said, "Why do not you say what you have put in it? you have put some poison in it;" and he named different poisons to her—she would not own what she had put into it, and I said that I must have it analyzed—I went into the shop, and when I returned Mr. Bayne told me in her presence that she had admitted putting oil of vitriol into the beer—she did not deny it—we asked her what she did it for—she said that she did not know—we pressed her very much, and she said that she did not do it with any intention to do me any harm—I told her to leave my service, I should not require her any longer—I was with her while she was putting her bonnet on, and before she went out, she said that another person, who had been in our employ (Clifford) had told her to put it into the beer—she was there for some time, and I asked her why she should tell her to do so; she said that she did not know, but she met him a fortnight previously—after a time she left the house, and on the Thursday morning she went to the station and gave herself in custody, but I was not there—she said, in my husband's presence, that if he would go out of the room she would say who told per to do it—he went out when I asked him, and I was left alone with the prisoner, who said that Mr. Clif<lb></lb>ford had told her to put it in—on the following day I went to her mother's house—my husband went there before me, and when I got there she said that Mr. Roberts told her to put it into the beer, and that would settle me—my husband denied it, and said he knew nothing at all about it, and I said that he knew nothing about it—I said, "Why do not you tell the truth?" and after pressing her she said that Mr. Roberts had nothing to do with it, and Mr. Clifford had nothing to do with it; she did it of her own free will—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bottle in which vitriol is kept at my house; it is used for cleaning copper.</p>

I said to him, 'Who shall I say?" He said, 'Say Clifford,' and I then put it into the beer, and shortly afterwards went to bed"—she also said that her master had seduced her last boxing-night; that her mistress was out that night, that he threw her down on the sofa, hurt her head, seduced her, and gave her seven pence; that he had had connection with her several times since, and she had had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from him—I told her it required a Magisterial investigation, and I must take her in custody—I took her to the station, and charged her, on her own confession, with attempting to administer the poison—I received this bottle from Mr. Bayne.</p>

I had my supper, and covered Mrs. Roberts' beer over. After George had had his supper. I left Mr. Roberts in the parlour, and went up stairs to see the baby to bed; when I went down Mr. Roberts was out at the back. He shut the shutter. The beer was on a table. He west into the wash-house, came in, and said that Mrs. Roberts was out till 12 on Thursday, 11 on Friday, and half-past 10 on Saturday. He told me to pour it in, and that would settle her. I said, "What shall I say?" He said, "Say Clifford." He told me to cover it over, and I put a plate on the top, I said, "Shall I sit up?" He said, "No, go to bed; and if you say any<lb></lb>thing about the beer, I will settle you." I went to bed, and afterwards heard a knocking. I let Mrs. Roberts in, and went to bed. Next morning I was laying the cloth for dinner, and there was a quarrel up stairs, mistress and master were fighting. He came down and asked me who had told mistress about the beer. I said, "I have not" He said, "If you have I will transport you. When your mistress comes down, ask her if she wants any beer; and if she says yes, tell her she has not drunk the beer you got last night. She did so, and I told her there was the beer she left last night She asked me who I got it of; I said, "<hi rend="italic">Carry</hi> Bayne." She told me to take it there. While I was getting my bonnet she took it herself, and came back and said that it was poisoned. She spoke to Mr. Roberts, but I did not hear him make any answer. She walked into the shop, and said she would not have me in the shop any longer. I went up stairs, changed my dress, and went home. At night my father went down to Mr. Roberts The inspector sent down a policeman to ask if she would charge me. The inspector came back and said that Mrs. Roberts said she had no charge against me at all, and I bad better go home. I told them that Mr. Roberts had to do with it, and father came back and said that Mr. Roberts was coming down. They both came down together, and I told Mr. Roberts to his face that it was because Mrs. Roberts said she would transport me. I</p>

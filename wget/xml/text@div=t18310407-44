I missed the articles stated from my chest, in the forecastle, on the morning of the 8th of March; when I went to bed, about twelve o'clock the night before, I had put them safe in my chest - the prisoner did not belong to that smack, but I had seen him the day before, in a barge, about twelve yards from the vessel; in consequence of suspicion, I went in search of him, and found him at a public-house in Ratcliff-highway - he had my shoes on his feet; I took him to the smack, and sent for a constable - my handkerchief, cotton shirt, and comb were found on him.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you take him? A. I saw him in a public-house, and ran for a constable, but could not find one; I kept my eyes on him as he came out of the house, and went on towards the London-dock gates - I thought he would get away, and took him myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How do you know the shoes belonged to you? A. By a private-mark on them - I told you I had lost a shirt and handkerchief, but did not notice whether you had them on or not.</p>

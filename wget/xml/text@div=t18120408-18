               <p>Q. Had you ever known him before - A. No. A man brought them to me, he told me he would put something into my pocket if I would do it; I was to have the crimpage of them; I gave security for nine pounds, that was the advance of their wages, for which I was to receive six pounds of Mr. Solomons, I was to put them on board the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Were both the men willing to go on board - A. Yes, very willing seemingly, they were in sailor's dresses. They were brought to me on Friday the 20th of March, I took them to the office to receive the two months advance, and I gave security for them, and then I took them to my house, I told them to go and buy clothes and other necessaries to go down to the ship that night, they then gave me two pounds to buy them two beds; I told them to buy them themselves. This was about about four o'clock. I then went with them as far as Fleet-market, the prisoner then told me to go into a public-house and wait there until he came back with his things; I went in and waited about an hour, he came in and said, am not I an honest man? he called for something to drink; he said he had got no clothes, he had got to go to Temple Bar: I and the other man accompanied him; this was about half past five o'clock in the evening. When he got me there he said it was only a little further; he took me to a place called the Coal-yard, St. Giles's, and then went into a public-house, and said he had got a duplicate of a watch there, and when he was in there a great many people knew him, some called him Daly and others John.</p>
               <p>Q. They seemed to be his intimate acquaintances, did they - A. Yes, he then sat down, and had a game of cards with the other people, I was in the room and the other man with me; I said, do not sit down at cards, this is a Friday, and my sabbath is a short day, make haste and go home. This was about half after six o'clock, it was then dusk. One of the men pretended to know me, and asked me to have something to drink; I told him I would rather not; he said what makes you so down hearted; I told him I had enough to be down hearted, to be security for nine pounds for these two men, that was a handful of money these times; he then said never fear, I will go and speak to them, and hear what they say; I know they mean to go. He went and spoke to them, and came back to me again.</p>
               <p>Q. The stranger did - A. Yes, he said, I have spoke to them, I know they mean to go. The other man said, I want to go backward; I told him he might go backward if he wanted; the stranger said, do not you know there is a back door, go along after him; I was going after him, I saw the prisoner pass me, go out of the front door; I then went after the prisoner, and caught him in the Coal-yard, at the corner of a stable yard, I got hold of him by the collar, and he laid hold of me, and pulled me down, and pulled my watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nobody in the coal-yard at that time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080015"></xptr> - A. No; there was a jew cleaning a horse in the stable; the prisoner got away, then the jew told me to get out of the yard, they were all Irish that lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say that the prisoner got from you, and run into the stable - A. Yes, in the corner of the yard that he knocked me down, he ran into the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get off again - A. That I do not know; about five minutes after this I saw the prisoner come down the yard in long clothes hugging a girl round the neck. I would not leave the yard; I gave a girl sixpence to fetch an officer, the officer came; the prisoner saw me, and run off to the Rose and Crown public-house in Broad-street, I ran after him, there was a serjeant of Marines there, I wanted him to keep him while I went for a constable; the publican of the house said, Daly, go away; he knew him, and the serjeant knew him, he said, Daly go away. The landlord called Daly of oneside, and put him into the street; he ran up a little court by the side of the public-house, I ran after him, he got a matter of forty of his countrymen and women, they knocked me down, kicked me, and rolled me in the mud; they used me very ill. I came out and enquired for the officer of the parish; a gentleman told me to run up the street, there was Bow-street. I went to Bow-street, and brought three officers. We went to several houses, the prisoner was found and secured.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into this coal-yard you had no idea of his robbing you - A. No, I thought he was an honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. In the coal-yard upon your catching hold of him he threw you down - A. Yes, and pulled my watch out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out then - A. No, there were no houses, only a parcel of stables there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. You told my lord that you were a dealer in toys - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not a crimp then - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in the habit of giving security for seamen - A. I have done it before. It is very seldom I go to the India House, I do sometimes.</p>
               <p>COURT. What is the name of the public-house that the landlord told him to go away - A. The Rose and Crown.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL LACK. I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 20th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prosecutor came to the office, he had been terribly rolled in the mud, he said he had been knocked down by two men, and robbed of his watch; I took him into the office to the clerk, and under the direction of the clerk I and Mantz went with him to St. Giles's. We found both the men, he pointed them out, and in their presence he exclaimed of their having robbed him. I told the prisoner what I wanted him for, he resisted my searching him, I was obliged to strike him; he was quiet after that. I searched him, and upon him I found fourteen or fifteen shillings; he denied knowing the prosecutor until he was before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. You have heard the prosecutor say that there was only one man that knocked him down - A. To me he said he had been robbed of his watch by two men, and that he had been advancing money for them. We took both the men into custody, the other man was discharged. The publican of the Rose and Crown has left that house, he keeps the Cock in ottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MANTZ. I am a constable of Bow-street. I know no further than what Lack has stated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bull; I live at Woolwich, and occasionally let lodgings. On Tuesday night, 22nd Oct., the prisoner was brought to my house about half-past nine o'clock, by a person who lived next door, where she had taken supper—she asked for a lodging—I asked her if she was a stranger in Woolwich—she said, "Yes," that she had come from London with her husband, who was gone to Burrage-grove to sit up with a brother who had died—I showed her up to a room—she had the room to herself—there was a chest of drawers there containing wearing-apparel, a purse containing a sovereign, and a half-sovereign, and another purse containing my certificate, and the receipt for my rent—I had put those things in the drawers the day before, and locked them up—the prisoner did not come down in the morning, and I went up about eleven, and asked if anything was the matter—she answered that she was getting up—I went down-stairs for I dare say two hours; she did not come down—I went up again at half-past two—I knocked, and told her she must open the door, which she unlocked, and let me in—the stairs do not open to the street, but inside the shop—no one could have gone into that room that night or day without my knowing it—there are three or four locks before you get in that room—a gentleman named Howe lodged in my house, and William Lawrence, a carpenter—my husband is at sea—when the prisoner let me into the room, I asked her what was the matter that she had been there all day—she said she had been waiting for her husband to come from the Burrage-grove, and he had not come, and she had not any money to pay for the bed—there was a bundle on the table; I asked her whose it was—she said it was hers—it was wrapped up in a handkerchief of hers—I told her she must leave the bundle till she paid for her lodging—she hesitated a good bit, and then asked if it would be safe—I told her it would be quite safe for her to leave it with me—she said she would go to the Burrage-grove to her husband to get money to pay for her bed, and come back for her bundle—when she was gone, I examined the bundle; I found it contained a number of my things, which had been in the drawers, but not the purses—the locks were all broken—I missed the two purses, and the sovereign and a half, two pairs of trowsers, a waistcoat-piece not made up, a petticoat, and two towels—they were not in the bundle—I have never seen them since—the window of the room the prisoner was in, opens to the street; it is on the first-floor—no one had occupied that room after I had seen the things safe the day before—I told my uncle—he gave information—he had been stopping in my house for three weeks—I saw the prisoner again in about half an hour after she went away, in the street, coming back to my house—my uncle brought her back—a policeman came in, directly after her; I do not think she saw him—I was present when she was searched at the station—she was wearing a petticoat of mine, and the shift was rolled up like a bussel behind her—she might have had the trowsers on when she left—I neither saw nor heard any other person in my house—I slept in the back parlour—the lodgers are there still—these things ( <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all mine.</p>

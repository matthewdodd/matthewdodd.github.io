                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist, and live in Hand—court, Bedford-row. On Sunday evening, the 24th of Nov., about eight o'clock, I was sitting in my parlour, which is over my shop, and heard the bell of my shop door strike—it is an alarm-bell, so that I may ascertain when any one enters the shop—I went down and found the prisoner Noon in the shop—he asked for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of peppermint lozenges—he after—wards changed it for liquorice—he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, which I placed in the till with other copper, and closed it—I did not lock it—it is a drawer—at that time I had a roll case of tooth-instruments in the till, and one or two other cases—there are three partitions to the till, and the tooth instru—ments were in the back partition—I am sure they were in the till when I put the penny in—after Noon had paid me the penny for the liquorice, he left the shop, and shut the door—he remained in the shop till I had shut the till—I have another door to the shop, but it opens at the back part, behind the counter—that is the door I had come in by from the upper room—it leads on to the head of the kitchen stairs—there is a way out of that passage into the street by a private door—there is one street-door which opens into a small square lobby about four feet and a half square, on one side of which is the shop door, in the centre is the door opening into the house, and the opposite side is occupied by the front shop—there is only one street door—the customers come in through this little lobby—the same street door would take me up into my upper room—the pri—soner's appearance created a suspicion in my mind, and when he had gone out I walked to the shop door to examine whether the alarm-bell was cor—rect—I pushed my hand against the door, and saw that it was perfectly closed—I then went to my upper room again—I had a friend there—we were rather merry, and speaking loud—I found after sitting for about two mi—nutes, that I had not closed my room door—I immediately rose, walked short across the room, and shut it, and I suspect that gave the parties is the shop the alarm—within five or eight minutes after that I heard my shop-boy come into the lobby—he has heavy boots, and makes a great noise coming in—he would come in through the shop door, and not hear—ing the shop-bell ring, I suspected there was something wrong—I came down, and at the foot of the stairs I put my foot into a hat—I do not know whose it was—it was not my boy's—he was in the passage when I came down—I went into the shop—there was no one there—I saw the till standing as wide open as it could be pulled—I looked into the back par—tition, and missed the case of tooth instruments—the others were left—I missed nothing more at that time—on the following Tuesday I missed a</p>

               <p>hat and great coat which I had seen on the Sunday morning—the great coat was hanging over the back of one of the shop chairs, and the hat' was on the top of a glass-case in the shop—it was a hat and coat that I very seldom used—I had not seen them after Noon came—I have never seen them since—I saw the case of instruments on the Tuesday morning fol—lowing, at Featherstone-street station—I had notice to attend there, and the policeman showed them to me—these now produced are them—this is the case which I had in the till.</p>

               <p>there, and remained outside till they came out, which was at five minutes past one in the morning—I knew the whole of them before—I seized the two prisoners by the collar, and took them into custody—I observed Sut—ters put his hand behind him to his coat pocket, and saw him throw some—thing away—I watched the articles that flew from his hand, and observed this skeleton key and a knife, with something just about the size and colour of this case of instruments—the handle of the knife being white, I was enabled to see where it fell, but the case of instruments I could not—I did not wait to look any further, for there being such a number of thieves about there, I was fearful of a rescue—I picked up the knife and key, the case I did not—at the time I picked up the knife and key I had hold of the two prisoners—I was afterwards obliged to let go of Noon—I still held Slitters—he again put his hand behind him—I instantly seized his wrist—he opened his hand, and something fell to the ground—I picked it up, and found it to be this bag, containing five pick—lock-keys, one skeleton-key, and one latch-key—he made a determined resistance, and his hat fell off—I took him to Featherstone-street station—I afterwards proceeded to a street in the Vinegar-ground, a locality where thieves and prostitutes live, and on a wall in the rear of some pre—mises I observed Noon—that was about three or four minutes'walk from where I had found them—he again made his escape from me—I saw him in custody at the station about nine the same morning—I went with Davis to the place where I had seen Sutters throw away the things, and pointed out the spot to him.</p>

On Sunday, the 24th of Nov. last, I left my residence before seven o'clock, and went to a friend's house about ten minutes' walk from where I live—I got there about five minutes to seven—it was to the King's Head—I took notice of the clock as I came out of my own house—I remained at the King's Head till eleven o'clock—I saw the prisoner Sut—ters there when I first went in—he was in the tap-room, and I saw him there all the evening till eleven o'clock, except leaving the room for a minute or two at the time, or it might be three or four minutes—I think he remained in the lower room about an hour—we generally go up into</p>

               <p>the upper room on a Sunday evening—there is more company there—he never left the room beyond three or four minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COBBETT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When first you got to this place you found the prisoner down stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—we went up stairs perhaps in the course of an hour after—I cannot say exactly the time—we all went up stairs together, all that I found in the tap-room—I found the prisoner and one or two more there when I went—I did not take particular notice who—they were parties that frequent the house—I do not know who or what they were—there might have been three or four persons—I cannot say how many went up from the tap into the upper room—I did not notice how many were in the lower room—the whole of us went up stairs—there might have been a dozen—the prisoner was among them—I do not know whether Thomas Sheil went up with us—he was going up and down for refreshment and so on—I found one or two parties up stairs when I got there, two or three friends together—they had not been in the lower room I believe—I did not see them come up, and had not seen them below—there were three or four—I had heard some parties come in, but did not notice who they were, and I suppose it must have been them—the gas and fire was alight—I did not notice whether Sheil was there when 1 got up—I had spoken to him in the bar I think—the bar is before you get to the tap-room—when I first entered the house I stood at the bar, and spoke to Sheil—I said, "Good evening," or something—I think his mother was in the bar—I spoke about the weather, or something of that sort—I am sure it was Sheil, the landlord, I spoke to—he was not employed about anything par—ticularly, merely waiting there for anybody to come in—I cannot say posi—tively whether his mother was there—I took no particular notice—I go into the house frequently, and do not notice things of that sort particularly—it is not like a strange house—I spoke to sheil, and I think I saw his mother—he was standing about promiscuously, waiting for anybody to be served—tea was over I believe—I saw no tea thing—I can not call to mind whether his sister was there—I do not exactly know whether I saw his brother that evening—I thing I saw him at the latter part of the evening, towards ten o'clock—he is my particular friend—I merely go there to see his brother—I am intimately sequainted with him—I do not know sheil himself, no more then keeping the house—I did not see the brother before ten o'clock—I do not exactly know when he came in—he might have come in before—I did not find him there when I first got there—I found three or four parties there—I staid about an hour town stairs, and at the end of that time, when the company got to about a dozen, we all went up stairs together—we generally go up there of an evening—it is more comfortable than the tab-room—we found it lighted up, and three or four persons there—sheil's brother is in the <hi rend="italic">ballet</hi> at Drury-lane theatre—Sheil's is a respectable house—I know nothing of any wrong conduct going forward there—it is like most other houses of that description, I suppose, a beer-shop—I never saw any dancing there—I have seen females there, respectable looking females—I never was insulted in the house—it is not my business to inquire into the characters of the persons—I have known Sutters above a twelvemonth—I do not know what he is—I merely know him by seeing him in there, passing the time of day, and making any re—mark of that kind—he always behaved civilly to me, and I always saw him conduct himself with propriety—I have seen him speak to two or three persons there, who I should suppose knew him.</p>

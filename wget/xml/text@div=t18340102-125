               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written)."On the 28th of September, 1831, I was in the employ of Messrs. Moses and Son, of Hounsditch, who sent me with a truck load of goods, for the purpose of delivering at different Inns; at the bottom of Hounsditch I unfortunately met with a man, whose name is 
               <persName id="t18340102-125-person963">

            , and who had lived in the service of Messrs. Morley and Co., of Gutter-lane, Cheapside; he being out of work, asked me to give him a job, which I did, as I wished to go to another part of the town, on my own account - I accordingly gave him the goods for the purpose of delivery, and the book to get signed, telling him to meet me at the end of Camomile-street, at a quarter past seven o'clock that night, which he did, and delivered me the book; but it being a wet night, he left the truck somewhere until the morning - I took the book home, and thinking all was correct, told him to meet me at eight o'clock next morning with the truck, and at the same spot, when I would pay him for his trouble; which he did - I took the truck home, but told him, if he would wait awhile, I would give him a glass of something to drink - when I came back, after I had cleaned my master's boots, he gave me a draft to get cashed at a banker's - I returned to the man, who by this time had another with him, whom I did not know, and we all repaired to Steven's Wine Vaults, where having had several glasses of gin, and feeling rather stupified, I at his request permitted him to have the draft, to get changed for me; after which I waited a length of time, but finding he did not return, I went to every place in quest of him, but in vain, he was not to be found; I then made inquiry at the different inns, and found that he had deceived me in that respect. Not having delivered the packages, I was therefore ashamed to return to my employers, and with a mind bordering on madness I absconded - since which I have been driven to every privation of this life, travelling different parts of England in quest of employment, but to no effect."</p>

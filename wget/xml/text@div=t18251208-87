On the 4th of November, I left a number of gilt trimmings, some sable flounces, and two new hats at No. 4, Creed-lane, which is my warehouse - about four or five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080040"></xptr>o'clock in the afternoon, I bolted my warehouse door on the inside, and came out at the front door - I saw my man lock that door. I went there again on the 12th of November, and when I had been there about an hour, I found the property was gone - the inner door had been broken open, and on examining it I found some impressions of iron work about it. I then examined the street door, and the warehouse door - neither of which were hurt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you in the interim sent any person to the warehouse? A. No; a bricklayer had a key that would admit him to the private part of the building, and he could get at the inner door to break it - he had had the key about a month before I left my trimming there. The prisoner is a stranger - no one lives at the house. I had not sold flounces there for a fortnight before - but I cannot swear that I had not sold these very flounces.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother, and lodge in Creed-lane. I had been out on Lord Mayor's Day, and when I was returning down Creed-lane, I saw two persons standing at the corner of the court near the warehouse. I took particular notice of the prisoner Dove, as being one of them. I went home, but as my landlady was not there, I said I would take a walk for a quarter of an hour, and when I went out, I saw the two men again. I went down Ludgate-hill, and when I returned they were gone. In a day or two afterwards, I heard my brother say he had lost something, and I told what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you see the young man standing? A. At the corner of the court, near my brother's premises. I had been out to spend the evening- I had been playing at cards, but had not been drinking. I saw the prisoners in custody, about the 16th or 18th of November. I had not seen any person whom I thought I knew between the time - but I saw two young men lurking about on the Sunday night.</p>

On the 5th of November, I was at work at the cellar, No. 4, Creed-lane - I shut the door, and left every thing safe - the warehouse where the goods were is parted from the passage.

            . I am a provision-dealer, and live in Cow-heel-alley, Golden-lane. The prisoner Elsey took a two pair back room there, in the month of September. Evans used to be there, and I believe has paid me the rent twice. I have seen him come in of an evening, and go up to that room - but I have not seen him in the morning; they did not take it as man and wife. I will not swear he lived with her - I have seen him about a dozen times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many times did you see him? A. I saw him once or twice, when I called for the rent. I have seen other men come there frequently. I believe Elsey got her living by seeing men.</p>

            . I went to the Benbow public-house, in Golden-lane, on the 11th of November - I took Evans, and from information I took him to the house in Cow-heel-alley - he said, "Mind, Vann, I don't live here at all;" Elsey and another woman were there; Elsey said she knew nothing of Evans at all, and the room was her's; the other woman said she came to sleep there. I saw this flounce on the table, which Elsey said some strange man had left there - and in the table-drawer I found six skeleton keys, and a crow-bar - this key opened the street-door of the warehouse in Creed-lane, and the bar exactly fitted the indentures in the wood of the inner door.</p>

               <p>Nicholas May. On Saturday between 9 and 10 at Night, as I was walking along, I happened to be forced into this House, the lower Part of <placeName id="t17341204-68-crimeloc335">Green-Bank, at the Back of Wapping-New-Stairs</placeName>

The Door was shut, and there was no body then in the House but she and I.</p>

            . On the Sunday Morning I saw a Watch in the Prisoner's Hand, and she said the Man had left it for 9 s. and if he came and paid the Money he must have it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As I and a Woman who looked after the House, were sitting by the Fire, this Man came in and sat down by us, and asked for a Hot-pot, which I fetch'd for him, and then went of his own Resolution up Stairs, and would fain have been rude with me; but I bid him pay what was due first; and so he left his Watch, having no Money to pay his Reckoning, and I pawn'd it to Mrs. Baldry in King Street, in Wapping.</p>

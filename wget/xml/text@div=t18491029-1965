                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter-carriers of the London District Post-office. On Monday, 15th Oct. about one o'clock, in consequence of in<lb></lb>tructions, I put myself in a particular situation in the Post-office, commandaig a view of the water-closets in the basements—I could not be seen by those in the closets—immediately I got there I saw the prisoner—I did not see him enter—he had a letter in his hand, open—I observed that it was sealed with fancy-coloured wax; he took a letter from the cover, which he com<lb></lb>menced reading—after he had read a small portion of it, he took from the inner fold of the letter a parcel, which was apparently wrapped in black or blue paper or rag, from which I saw him take what I thought was a gold coin, which he put in his mouth; he appeared then to finish reading the letter, and while so doing he dropped a piece of the letter, or the contents, on the floor—he made use of the cover, and threw it in the basin of the closet, and then made use of the other part—he got up from the seat and turned round, and as I supposed he saw the paper floating, as I saw it on the surface of the water—he adjusted his clothes, and tried to force the water fresh into the basin by pressure on the seat—the paper not going away, he put his left hand in and took out portions of it, I could not see which, and folded it up in his hand, and pressed it very tight, turned round to the window, and after watching two or three seconds, threw it out—he then left the closet, and I left the position I was in and returned to the Superintending President—on my way from the back of the building, the prisoner was standing at the back door, which I had to pass, about eighty-five yards from the window I had seen him throw the paper out of, looking towards where the paper had fallen; on passing him 1 said, "Good morning," and he nodded—I went and acquainted Mr. Robert Smith, the Superintending President, with what I had seen—the paper thrown from the window would have fallen into the Post-office-yard, or into Foster-lane—I then directed the plumber to search the closets, and he afterwards produced to me this cover porduced—I had told him to which closet he was to go—the cover corresponds with the one I saw in the prisoner's hand by the wax—I after<lb></lb>wards went to where I presume the paper fell—the prisoner had an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of going there while I went to the President.</p>

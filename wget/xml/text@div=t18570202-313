                  </hi>. I am assistant to Rebecca Webb, a cheesemonger, of No. 131, Tottenham Court road. On Thursday morning, 15th Jan., between 7 and 8 o'clock, I went into the back kitchen, and found that a board had been removed from the window, which was in a rather dilapidated state—there was a box under the window inside, with waste paper in it—I did not miss any at that time, but about 11 o'clock a policeman came—I then looked into the box, and missed some paper, which I identified at the station house as my mistress's—the window was perfectly secure the night before, between 5 and 6 o'clock; I went to bed between 11 and 12 o'clock—I cannot say whether I was the last person who was in there—I was down first—removing the board gave them the opportunity of putting a hand and arm in, and reaching the paper from the box—there were bars to prevent them getting in entirely—the window looks into a court which is no thoroughfare, and is even with the ground floor—it is five or six feet high—there was a table outside the window, which is used by a man living in the court, and anybody standing on that could reach.</p>

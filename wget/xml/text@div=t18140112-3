The prisoner lived with me until the last day of December, and then she left me. On the 31st of December, I missed my watch; I saw it on the 29th. The prisoner was not in my apartment after I missed the watch. It is my dwelling-house; I let it out to separate people; I live in the house.</p>



               <p>Q. What watch was this - A. A silver watch. I called the prisoner down stairs; her mother said, Nancy, your mistress wants you; I went up to her. I asked her to be so good as to tell me where my watch was, it was my husband's watch; I told her my buffett was broken open. I could get no redress at all; I came down stairs, and sat content until the watchman came; the watchman went in, took her, and out her in the watchhouse. The next morning I went upto the pawnbrokers and saw my watch.</p>
               <p>JAMES - . I live with Mr. Watts, pawnbroker, East Smithfield. On the 30th of December, in the evening, the prisoner pawned this watch with me for twenty-eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That is my watch; I missed it out of my buffett.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you tell me to pawn the watch to get some money to pay the two carpenters that came into the room to mend your buffett -</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She gave me the watch to pawn, and had three quarterns of rum for the two carpenters. I pawned the watch by her order.</p>

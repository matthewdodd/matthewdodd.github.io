            . On the 17th of June, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I called in the two prisoners to sell them some old clothes - they were in company together; they looked at the clothes, and Mitchell said, "I will give you 10s. for them;" there were three or four coats and some trousers; I said, "I will have nothing to do with you - you are a complete characteristic of a Jew; I will not sell them to you:" Moss said, "Will you sell them to me?" and I showed them to him - he hesitated some time, and I said, "I will give you this frockcoat in," which I then had on - he was feeling it for some time, and I saw him put his hand to the pocket, but did not recollect there was a handkerchief in it - as soon as they were gone I put on my coat, and missed the handkerchief; I put on my hat, and followed them - I took Moss, and said, "Have you my handkerchief?" he said, "I have not:" I said, "Your companion has;" Mitchell then took out my handkerchief, and said, "Is this it?" I said, "Yes, you know it;" I seized them both - Mitchell broke from me, and ran across the street, but an officer took him; Mitchell had not touched the coat</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. I believe you induced them to come into your shop? A. Certainly, I called them - I took the coat off, and Mitchell stood by: I saw Moss fumbling about - I had other things about the counter, and thought they were his object; I did not take them before they left my shop, because I was not certain.</p>

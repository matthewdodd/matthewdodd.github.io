He came on the 8th of May, and looked at some shoes, and then said he had not money enough. He came again on the Sunday morning, and said he had brought a young man with him; they looked at some shoes, but did not buy them. On Monday there was a pair missed, which I had seen safe that morning. On Tuesday I saw him with them on his feet.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner on Wednesday, in consequence of information I received from Toole - he said he was going on an errand, and could not stop: I took him to the watch-house: he said he bought the shoes of a man in the street, and then of a man in the fields.</p>

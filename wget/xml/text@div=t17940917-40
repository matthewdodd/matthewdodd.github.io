               <p>I was robbed on the 4th of August, at nine o'clock in the evening; I was going to Grosvenor-square; when I came in <placeName id="t17940917-40-crimeloc205">Lower Grosvenor-street</placeName>

Says he, some men have been a quarrelling; says I, that is a pity; so I stopped about two minutes; after that, I said, I will be much obliged to you to let me pass now, I think there is room enough; he said, you had better stop a little longer. When I went to go forward, and I felt something, and I said, what are you about, picking my pocket? No, says he, I am not, you had better stand still; with that he snatched his hand out of a sudden, and my pocket was turned inside out; with that he ran off; so with that I called out stop thief! and says I, I am robbed. In less than half a minute's time the prisoner was taken; it was not the prisoner at the bar that robbed me, it was one Shield that robbed me. I had just changed half a guinea, and had the ten shillings in my pocket, just before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I would ask you, because I know you will tell us the truth,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170103"></xptr>did not you, at the watch-house, persist that he was not the man, and you had no charge against him? - I had not, but the other evidences have.</p>

               <p>About nine o'clock on the 4th of August, I heard the cry of stop thief! upon which I immediately ran out, and when I came up to the mob, I saw the prisoner at the bar run up to a man, who was detained by several, he was taken hold of, he shoved up very close to the other man, and then burst away from him, on to the other side of the way; the people cried out this man has got the money; I immediately ran up to the man, and there were two men took hold of him; and he says, I am not the man, and then I was quite close up to the prisoner, and there was something dropped, which I took to he money, by the chink; he ran up Grosvenor-street, and he was catched in little Grosvenor-street; he said he was not the man, and he could laugh at us, because he was not guilty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Holmes, Robinson, and Stoneham, solicitors, of 5, Philpot Lane—Dowst was their junior clerk from March, 1865, till his apprehension—in July last the firm was in possession of 266 coins and medals—there were five gold medals and two silver ones, about thirty gold coins, and the rest silver—they were brought to me by Mr. Stoneham in a wooden box—I opened it to see that they were there, and placed the wooden box in a deed box, with some papers—the box was taken down to Westminster and brought back again—I saw the coins in the box when they were brought back to the office on 22nd July—Dowst was at the office on Saturday, 10th August, but I do not know of my own knowledge that he was there after the other clerks left—on 12th August I noticed marks of violence on the lock of the table drawer, which is never locked, and on Tuesday morning, the 13th, I went to the deed box, which was locked as I left it, but all the coins and medals were gone—the papers were there—the box lets down in front, and there are two shelves in it—the coin box had been on one shelf, but it was gone—I next saw them at the Bermondsey Police-station on 20th August—Painter was then in custody—these are the coins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this bent medal has the name of Phillips, our client, on it—I have seen Painter at the office repeatedly of an evening with Dowst.</p>

I deal in miscellaneous property and curiosities, at 244, Old Kent Road—on 21st Angust, a little after nine o'clock, Painter came and said, "I have a small collection of silver coins to sell; will you buy them?"—I said, "I do buy coins, but, as you seem to be very young, I wish to know whether your parents gave you leave to sell them"—he said that his father was dead, and had left them to him to sell—I asked him if he had a mother; he said, "Yes"—I said, "Did she give you permission to sell them?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I must have her address, as I am very particular what I buy"—he gave his name Mr. West, or Webb, 3 or 4, Chatham Place, Old Kent Road, I am not certain which—I spoke to my wife, and then asked him if he had the coins; he showed them to me, one bundle after another, wrapped up in newspapers—my wife then left the shop, and after she was gone I bargained with him about the price—he wanted 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, I offered 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a bar<lb></lb>gain was made at that—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. first, and he wrote out a receipt for 51.—that was that my wife should have time to come back—I after<lb></lb>wards gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was very fidgetty to get away to his business in the City, as he said, but I invited him into the parlour to have a glass of wine—I turned my back, and heard him say to Mrs. Howlett, an old lady in the shop, "I will be back again bye and bye," and he left—I ran after him, and saw him walking—when he saw me running he began to run—he was stopped, brought back, and taken to Bermondsey Station—he said that he hoped the coins would be all right—I demanded my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back, which he gave me—four days afterwards I found this broken medal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on a shelf on my premises—I had not purchased it of anybody.</p>

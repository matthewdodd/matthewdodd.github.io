               <p>evening, I was at Lambeth—I was not on duty, nor in my uniform—I saw the two prisoners, about a quarter-past eight o'clock, in Stamford-street—Hart was carrying a bundle containing soap in a Macintosh cape—they crossed into the York-road, and went down Button-street, and when they got to the bottom of that I saw Hart give Killick the bundle—I then stopped Killick, and asked what he had—he said, "Some soap"—I asked him where he got it from—he said he found it—Hart then ran away, Goff, who was with me, ran after him and brought him back—Killick owned the Macintosh, and I found in it six bars of mottled soap—I searched Killick, and found in his pockets four half-bars of soap—I found some receipts on him—I found where Hart lived, and went to the house in company with Goff—the prisoners were not going towards his house when I saw them.</p>

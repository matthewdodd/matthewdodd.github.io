The prisoner was in my employ—he went round the town twice a week as my clerk aid collector for two or three years—he had authority to receive money, and was to hand it over to me on the following day, in September last—he did not account to me on the 14th of September, or thereabouts, for any money received from Mr. Evans, of Shoreditch, who owed me 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Isherwood, on Ludgate-hill, owed me some money—the prisoner did not account to me for any money received from him.</p>

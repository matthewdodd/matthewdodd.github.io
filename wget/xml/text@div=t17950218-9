I told him I had missed a watch; he said, he would not give any thing for the watch, and when my husband came in and talked about going to the pawnbrokers, he said, he thought he would not get it by that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180017"></xptr>means, for he dare say that they that took the watch had sold it to the jews.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come in from the street? - He came up stairs while I was making the bed, and seeing me there, he went down again directly, and did not come in again till I had missed the watch.</p>

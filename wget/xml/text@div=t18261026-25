On the 11th of September I was at Smithfield, selling beast; I received some monies, and had 450l. about me in notes - as near as I can recollect, there were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260017"></xptr>one 40l., two 30l., five 20l., ten 10l., and smaller ones; I had them safe when I went into a room with the prisoners - I felt them in my inside breast-pocket at the time I entered the room, in a book containing memorandums. I was standing near Smithfield Bars when the two prisoners came up to me - I am sure of their persons - they came up in a fondling way, and asked me to take a walk with them; I consented, and we went towards Cow-cross: we passed a public-house, and they asked if we should go in and drink there - I refused, and we walked to the bottom of Cow-cross; they then said, "We will go to our own lodging - we are sisters:" they took me to <placeName id="t18261026-25-crimeloc139">Sharp's-alley</placeName>

I found a girl in the lower room; one of them asked her for a candle, and she lighted them upstairs, and when we got to the chamber-door, one of them said to her, "Light our fire," as if she was their servant, and then said, "Now, Sir, this girl will fetch a pot of ale" - I gave her a shilling, and she fetched a pot of ale - I took the shilling out of my purse. She brought the ale, and sat down in the room, then went out and fastened the door - the two prisoners and I then took a glass of ale each; I was then sitting on the bedstead, and the prisoner Wilkinson sat by the side of me; the other sat at a little distance off - she came closer soon after; I was very warm, and took my coat off; she came nearer to me, and made an attempt to get hold of the coat, which I had laid by the side of me - I perceived her attempt, and caught hold of the coat - Wilkinson immediately clasped her arms round my neck - Hartnett likewise fastened on me, and we were all down on the floor together. Wilkinson, in a great fury and heat of passion, pinched my hand and scratched the back of my neck, and called out, "Oh the b-r!" I was in great terror, and cried out Murder! They got my book out, opened it and got out this roll of notes, dropped the book, and the memorandums were scattered about the room - I stooped down to pick up the papers, and one got down stairs; I immediately ran after her; the other came down after me - I cannot say which of them went down first; they were both down in the lower room together, and I got hold of them both, crying out and begging for mercy. A man was in the room, who I supposed to be the master of the house; I said,"For God's sake, Sir, assist me - these women have got all my property - I am ruined for ever." He made no reply, but in a few minutes shut the door, and stood against it. I had hold of them for three or four minutes - the man then shut the outside door, and stood with his back to it - I heard him say in three or four minutes, "I have sent for a constable," or "I will send for an officer." The women cried out bitterly for me to let them go, and as he stood at the door, and from what he said, I let go my hold; the man immediately threw open the door, and said, "Go along with you altogether;" they started out, rushed through the crowd at the door, and I lost sight of them. I got my coat and book, but the money was gone - I recovered my memorandums, and every thing but the 450l. When I got out of the house, I went to an officer, who is not here, and informed him (I was obliged to go a hundred miles into the country next day) - I immediately went home to my lodgings, at Woodness's, in Bartholomew Close; stated the case to him, and he went with me to the house about eight o'clock the same evening. We found the man there who rescued them; he told me he knew nothing of them. I was sent for nearly a month afterwards to Lambeth-street, and was taken to the lockup place, where I saw the prisoners sitting together, and pointed them out. I am positively certain of them - I was certain of them the moment I saw them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were there other females there? A. I think there were two; but the moment I saw the prisoners I took no further notice - I have recovered none of my money - I am positively satisfied they are the women.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How old are you? A. About fifty; I do not exactly know my age. I live with my wife, and have a child grown up. I had done business that day, and dined at my lodging - I had a pint of half ale and half porter to drink, that lasted me for an hour after dinner  - I then went to Mr. Young's, in Smithfield, on business - I drank nothing more, and was perfectly sober: I did not go out to see a female - I thought nothing about it: they accosted me about seven o'clock in the evening, near Smithfield, going to St. John-street - my sight is middling; not so good as it has been; we had a candle in the room; I took my coat off because it was so very warm - that was my only reason - they ordered a fire to be lighted at some certain time; it was not lighted: the coat lay on the bed close to me; one of them came and sat close by me for three or four minutes - I was not ten minutes in the room altogether - I had not offered them any money - I did not intend to do any thing more than pay them a visit - I swear I had no object but sitting down with them. They took my book in the room, and instantly ran down before me; I followed, after picking up my book and papers, which did not take two minutes, and found them still in the house, down stairs; I laid hold of them both in the room - I went to no office, but to an officer's house, and then to Woodness, and went with him and the officer to the house - I saw nobody in custody before I saw the prisoners - I was in London two or three times before they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the officer tell you the two women who had robbed you were in custody? A. He said two were in custody who he suspected might be the two - he said he had taken two, and wished me to go and look at them: when I went, I expected to see the women who robbed me - I think there was another woman there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was a woman named Castles taken up? A. I do not know - I did not see such a woman - she was not examined in my presence. This money belonged to the owners of the beast; I paid them their money, though I lost this; I did not inform them about it, as I could pay them; I did not know I could take the man who was in the house.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Were you perfectly sober that night? A. I was - the less excuse for me.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I apprehended the prisoners in Albion-street, Commercial-road; they lodged on the second floor front room at Mrs. Thomas', No. 4 - I took them at another house in the same street, playing at cards with other women; I think there were three others. I then asked if they did not lodge over the way; they said, Yes; I went to their lodgings on the second floor; I asked them their names;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260018"></xptr>Wilkinson gave her true name - Hartnett said hers was Jones; I found on her 24s. in a purse; she took it out of her bosom, saying, she supposed I wanted her money, and threw it on the table. Wilkinson had only a few halfpence, and in a tea-caddy which she claimed, were three sovereigas and six gold rings; one was a mourning ring, the others plain. I found a quantity of wearing apparel in the room, all new; there were three gown-pieces, some cotton and some silk, three or four shawls, some lace caps, and two Leghorn bonnets; I asked who they belonged to - Wilkinson said none of them belonged to her - Hartnett said, "You may as well say it is all mine." I took them to Lambeth-street - I showed the prosecutor into the lock-up room - he identified them almost immediately - he said he was satisfied they were the women, and said,"Poor creatures, I am sorry for you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you tell him you had got the women who robbed him? A. No, I said I had two women who I supposed to be them, from the description. There was another woman, and two or three men in the lock-up room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you suppose to be the value of the wearing apparel you found? A. I should think 15l. or 16l. I apprehended them from information relative to their being flush of money, not from the prosecutor's information.</p>

            . I am patrol of St. Sepulchre. I know Tingey, by seeing him about the market - I recollect seeing him on the 11th of September with the two prisoners, about seven o'clock in the evening - I am certain of them, for I spoke to them; they wished him to go into a gin-shop; he said, No, he would drink nothing there, and they went on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. When was your attention called to this? A. I heard next day that he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any women who are like these? A. Hartnett has a sister who walks that way, very much like her - I do not know Dandy Bet, or Saucy Sall - Hartnett is called Irish Nell. I am certain the prisoners are the persons - the street lamps were not lighted, but there was a light from the wine-vaults.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You knew the prisoners, and are sure they are the women? A. Yes; I have been a patrol in that parish eleven years - I have known one of the prisoners from a child, and the other six or twelve months - my business calls me to Newgate market, and I frequently saw them walking there among the salesmen: I took particular notice of them that even ing; I followed them down to the end of Sharp's-alley, and said to them, "What, are you both out again? I hope this will be a warning to you." They had both only been liberated at three o'clock that afternoon - they were at the door of the wine-vaults - I am sure of them and the prosecutor.</p>

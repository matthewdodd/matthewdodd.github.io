            . I am daughter to the last witness. On the 26th of November I shewed the prisoner a bonnet, she said it was not good enough; I shewed her another, she did not like it. I went into the other shop to get her one, and when I came back she said they were too dear, she would call again, and as she went out of the door I looked upon the board, the bonnet was gone; I ran after her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050013"></xptr>there was a coach going by at the time, I called out stop thief, I saw her throw the bonnet down, I picked up the bonnet and looked up the street, I saw her run through the courts; about an hour and a half after that she came down the same street, I went after her, I told her somebody wanted to speak to her; she said nobody wanted to speak to her, she pulled off her pattens and was going to run, I laid hold of her, and brought her down the court; she ran up; a lady going by at the time she helped me to bring her home; when I got her back she said they had no business to keep her, as they had the property back. This is the bonnet, I am sure it is the bonnet that I shew- the prisoner, and that she took and dropped: it is worth five shillings and sixpence.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse, and the next morning I took her before the magistrate; going to Worship-street I asked her how she came to be guilty of such a thing; she said she was very sorry for it; she knew nothing of the bonnet until the girl stopped her with it, she thought it must have hanged to her side; she should not have done it but she was intoxicated; if the prosecutor would hush it up she would pay him the expence, if there was any damage, if he did not approve of that she would pay him for it, if he would go to her lodgings in Golden-lane.</p>

On the 5th of November I missed three fowls, which I had seen safe at four o'clock the afternoon before - they roosted in a little shed at the back of our house - the door appeared to have been lifted off the hinges, as the lock was not loose. I saw them again at the watch-house, and knew them to be mine- one of them was dead, and two were alive - I have no doubt they were mine - I had had them about six months.</p>

            . I am superintendant of the watch. I met the prisoner at four o'clock on the morning of the 5th of November, with a bundle - I took him to the watchhouse, and saw the tail of a fowl sticking from under his coat - I then found another live fowl in his hat, and a dead fowl in the bag - this was about 100 yards from Mr. Astey's.</p>

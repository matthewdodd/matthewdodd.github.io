                  </hi>. I am a wholesale cheesemonger, of Newgate-street, and have a warehouse in Bath-street. Riss was my carman eight or nine months, and was so at the beginning of March—the barrel of pork, of which this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the head, belongs to me—it is worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is marked "F 74"—I had such on my premises in Bath-street—this particular barrel had not been sold—it was Bias's duty to load goods into his cart—he had access to the barrels of pork in Ruth-street—those of which No. 74 was one, were safe on my premises on Monday, 3rd March—it was Bias's duty, when he took out goods to a customer, to deliver them, and bring back a receipt—he has brought no receipt for No. 74—in consequence of what Russell said to me, I spoke to Bias on 7th March—the officer and my manager, Mr. Milne, were present—when I was called in, Mr. Milne told me that Biss had admitted having a barrel of pork—I asked him what the meaning of this was, this robbery which had been going on, and asked Mm to tell me what he knew about it—I did not say that it would be better for him—he told me about this barrel, without any promise whatever—I said nothing in allusion to this barrel, except that I had been told that there was a barrel of pork—he said that he had taken it in the cart, and delivered it to Drew, in Hatton-garden, put it into his truck—that was not the way that his cart ought to have gone.</p>

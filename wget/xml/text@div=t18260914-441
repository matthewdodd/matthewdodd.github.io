The prisoner was in my service upwards of a year and a half - on the 30th of August I missed a coat and pair of trousers, and afterwards a marlin-spike was gone; I had missed the snuff-box six days before, and had sent him to different coffee-houses to inquire if I had not left it there; I told him and the servant girl that it would be prudent for me to go to their houses to see if any thing was there; I pretended to go, but went to Worship-street; I then went home with the officer, and told the prisoner he might sleep in the house that night, and go before the Lord Mayor in the morning, but after two o'clock he got up, and went out, pulling the door after him; I got up, and spoke to the officer, who was on duty at my door.</p>

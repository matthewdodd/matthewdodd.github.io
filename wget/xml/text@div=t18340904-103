               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. When you looked in the box, you found a hat of your master's? A. I did: I saw him take it off the ground, and put it into the box - I was certain he took a hat - I did not see the box open when he first came into the shop - I did not see whether there was any hat in it when he first came in - I am quite sure there was no other hat there besides the one I took out of the box - an old hat was left behind, which did not belong to us - the prisoner must have brought that old hat with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not he possibly have taken this hat by mistake? A. No: because the hat was found laid very carefully on two other hats, and the hat which he took had been on the ground in quite an opposite corner - I was with him all the time he was in the shop - I did not see him place the old hat down, it was at the door - my back was turned to him at one time, while I was looking for the size he asked for.</p>

            . I am a hatter, and live in Union-street, Borough-road - I went after the prisoner from Mr. Wilson's shop, and overtook him turning into Thames-street- I said I wished him to step back with me - he said, "For what? I suppose it is a mistake, I have taken the wrong hat" - the box was not open then - he went to the warehouse with me, and Cassels claimed the hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far from the shop did you come up with him? A. A few doors, on the opposite side of the road - he walked till he got to the corner, and commenced running just as I got up to him - I caught him within a door of the corner - he ran the length of a house- the box was under his arm - his hand would keep the lid on - it was fastened down completely - I said I wished him to come back with me - he appeared to know where I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040059"></xptr>came from - I was stripped, at work - I could not tell him what he was wanted for - I was merely told to follow him and take him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I have produced the hat which I got from Mr. Wilson's - I was sent for - the prisoner said he had made an exchange, he supposed - he told a long story about the string of the box breaking - I said, "If you have taken a wrong hat, the other must be up stairs" - I took him up stairs, and Cassels pointed out where he took it from - I asked him to look on that spot for the old hat, and he could not find it: but quite on the other side of the room he picked up his own hat - he said the string of the box broke, and he must have taken up the wrong hat - the hat left behind was papered similar to a new one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him where to go, to see who the hat belonged to.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Ward's Terrace, Forty Acre Lane, and am a single woman, save and except my marriage to the prisoner—I was married to him on 14th June, 1870, in the Parish of St. Mary, Stratford-le-Bow—when he married me he told me he had had a wife that had been in a lunatic asylum, but he had written a letter to her, and believed her to be dead—we went and got married—our banns were published in the church, and he was described as a bachelor—he first told me that his wife was living about fifteen months ago; he said she was in Axminster Lunatic Asylum.</p>

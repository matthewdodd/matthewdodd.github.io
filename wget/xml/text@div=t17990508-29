             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a messenger of Excise; I had received directions from the Board to detect the prisoner; On Friday, the 3d of May, I placed myself in No. 19, principal story, chief office, Excise.</p>
               <p>Q. The Excise-office is furnished at Government expence? - A. Yes; I observed the prisoner go past No. 19 with his eye turned towards the door, which attracted my attention; I observed him pass and repass No. 19 five times; I passed him in the long passage, and went through No. 20 to No.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080053"></xptr>18, so that No. 19 was between the two; I held the door in my hand, to watch his passing me again; he came from the direction of No. 19; I stopped him about seven yards from No. 19; I laid hold of him, and saw these tongs under his coat on the left side; I had seen them in their place about ten minutes before I found them upon him; I took him to No. 19, and the tongs were missing; I then took him before the Commissioners, and then it was that I took the tongs from him; he said, in No. 19, that he had taken them from that place, pointing to the fire-place.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no situation in the Excise-office? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I saw the poker, tongs, and shovel, in the room, the door was open; I was looking for a gentleman that had said he would collect a few halfpence from the gentlemen there for me, as I was distressed, that made me walk backwards and forwards to look for him.</p>

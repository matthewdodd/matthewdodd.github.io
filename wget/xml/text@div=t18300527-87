            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I apprehended the prisoner on the 4th of May, at the Coachmakers' Arms, in Old Quebec-street; I told him he was charged with bigamy - in going to the office be acknowledged that his first wife was alive, and said he left her on account of her misconduct; I have two certificates, one from St. John Zachary, and one from St. Luke's, Middlesex - I have examined them carefully - they are correct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Where did you get the first certificate? A. From his first wife; I only knew her to be his wife from what she said - I received this other from the other person who said she was his wife - I am positive they are correct copies. (read)</p>

I thought you would come again"—he said he had not been in the shop at all—I said, "Do you forget coming for a string? you did not think I watched you over the road"—he then said he did not know what he gave me, it was not a half-crown—I said, "What did you give me?"—he would not say—I gave him into custody, and gave both the half-crowns to the policeman.</p>

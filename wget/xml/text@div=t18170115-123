               <p>WILLIAM FROUD. I am a shoemaker; I was standing in my shop, in Chesterfield-street, and saw the prisoner go by my window, he had the prints under his arm; he went about two steps and turned back, my passage door was open, he went into the passage, and was there about ten minutes. I did not go to look for him, as I thought he was going to take the things up stairs to a woman who lives in my house. One of my lodgers asked if the prints were for sale; I got up and saw the prisoner tying the prints up in bundles in my passage; he offered one of my lodgers one piece of print if she would give him a handkerchief to tie them up in, she said she had not got one; he pushed the door to, the constable came to the door, and asked for the prisoner. He told one of my lodgers that he had had a dreadful fall, and that they must not be alarmed at his coming in - I heard him. The constable took him.</p>

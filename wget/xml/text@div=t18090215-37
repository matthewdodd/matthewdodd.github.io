On Tuesday the 7th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the two prisoners came in my shop both together; they asked me to look at some silk handkerchiefs; I was near the door engaged with other customers; I requested them to walk further into the shop, and told Wood, one of my young men, to shew them some silk handkerchiefs; he shewed them some silk handkerchiefs; after looking at a variety of patterns, and laying aside a certain quantity, meaning to purchase them if we could agree for the price; among these, several were taken from the window; he had occasion to leave them to go to the window; after that the young man was looking over them again; he came to me and said he missed one handkerchief that he had taken out of the window, and requested me to look sharp after the man and woman; I told him to let them pay for what they had engaged and I would have them taken in custody; they went out after they had paid for the goods; I went towards the spot where they were; he asked me if I had seen the handkerchief, meaning the handkerchief that he had lost; he said I laid it on the counter among the others to shew to this man and woman, and on looking for it he missed it; we proceeded to take the things off the counter one by one; we could find no handkerchief of the description; the female prisoner had a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150018"></xptr>muff; she repeatedly said to me, I dare say, sir, you will find the handkerchief somewhere by and by among some of the goods; I said I rather wish to find it now I went out for an officer; my young man came to me, and said the woman had pulled it out of her muff; when I went in it was found. The female prisoner said she would give me any thing if I would let her go; I said I should not do any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How many persons were there serving in the shop at this time - A. Two besides myself - Wood and Vennymore - he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount of the money the prisoner laid out with you - A. The young man took seven pounds nine shillings, instead of seven pounds nineteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Your young man cast up ten shillings too short, and what he cast up Bellars paid - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you took him up you kept the goods and the money - A. No; the lord mayor wished him to take the goods; he would not take them; there were seven other silk handkerchiefs found on him that did not belong to me.</p>

I said there is one particular pattern in the shop I should like to find; we searched for it; the woman seemed to be in a flurry; I saw her draw the handkerchief from her muff at the time Mr. Gray went out; I jumped over the counter before ever she had an opportunity of taking her hand off it; I said, madam, I see you this moment take it out of your muff, do not deny it; Mr. Gray came in; she said she would pay two pounds, or an hundred pounds if she had it, to let her go; Mr. Gray told her he could do no such thing; she said to Bellars, you have no occasion to stop, you may go.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. I believe you asked him whether he had any objection to tell you where he lodged - A. I did; he told me; and there I found some other goods. I found six handkerchiefs upon him, which I think he said he bought at some shop near St. Paul's, he could not tell me what shop; when he was in the Poultry compter, he said perhaps it might be near Fleet market; I went down from Bishopsgate street, Cheapside, St. Paul's, Newgate street, up Fleet street, so far as Bonsor's; I could not find out where he bought them.</p>

On my going into this gentleman's shop, I asked him to let me look at some silk handkerchiefs, I told him I wanted to sell them again; he fixed his price. I purchased two dozen in the whole; I paid him for them; they were laid of one side. I asked him after that if he would be so kind to make out a bill, I told him I would stop a few minutes. I was not in a hurry. If this woman behaved any ways imprudent it was unknown to me; I could not think she would be guilty of any thing of the kind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber; I was repairing the roofs of Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4, St. Andrew's-terrace. On the 9th of Nov. I had occasion to go up for a basket—the roofs were then quite sound—on the 11th of Nov. the policeman brought me a piece of lead—I have compared it with that on the roofs of those houses—I am able to swear it came from one of them—I joined the two pieces together, and they corresponded—I am sure it is part and parcel of the lead that was on those houses, by the thickness and width.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leather dresser, and live at 55, Hunter-street, Dover-road. On the morning of 11th June, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was with the prosecutrix at the Black Prince, in a side box, and saw the prisoner on the other side—he came round while we were standing there, had something to drink, and went out again—he did not speak to us—while he was there the prosecutrix took out her purse and was about to pay for a lobster, but she did not, and put it into her bosom again—we stopped some time and then came out—I might have been about ten yards in advance of her—I received a blow in the jaw, and when I turned I received another in the face, and was knocked in the mud—it was the prisoner who gave me the first blow—I saw him—when I was getting up I saw the prosecutrix on her knees, in the act of rising, and having hold of the prisoner—they struggled together, and I heard her say "Give me my money, you scoundrel,"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186107080095"></xptr>
               <p>and with that he made off—a policeman came up—I afterwards went with him and the prosecutrix to a public-house, and there found the prisoner and took him into custody—he said to me, "Don't let her do it, <hi rend="italic">Cockey</hi>; don't let her do it"—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man that struck me, and that I saw struggling with the prosecutrix—I have seen him about before; nothing further—I have no ill-feeling towards him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have known him by sight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen him about for some time—I joined McCarthy about 11, coming along by the Elephant, and we walked down the Walworth-road to the public-house—we stopped there for some time—we went in a little after 11, and did not come out till close upon a quarter to 1—I believe I paid for a couple of pints of stout during that time—I had nothing else, nor had McCarthy in my presence—it was about a quarter of an hour before we left the house that the prisoner came into the compartment where we were—he did not speak to us—there were a great many other persons there—when we came out into the street there were several persons about, and also at the time I was knocked down—the prisoner came behind mo and hit me in the jaw—I saw him as I turned round, and then I received another blow and was knocked down—I was about twenty yards from the Black Prince at that time—I was not able to attend before the Magistrate upon the first examination—when the prisoner was taken he did not say he was not guilty, or that he did not do it—all he said was, "<hi rend="italic">Cockey</hi>, don't let her do it"—McCarthy took out her purse in the public-house to buy a lobster, but she did not buy it—there was a man in there selling lobsters—I was quite sober—I was not turned out of the station-house because I was not sober—I was told to go out while they were taking the evidence of McCarthy.</p>

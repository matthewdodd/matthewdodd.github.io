                  </hi>. I am a shorthand writer, of 89, Chancery Lane—I am one of the official shorthand writers of this Court—I was present at the trial of James Coutts, at this place, on Friday last, 5th January, before the Recorder, and took notes of the evidence given on the trial—I remem<lb></lb>ber Mr. Alsop being called and examined as a witness—I took down what he said—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a transcript of the evidence he gave—I have my original notes here—Mr. Minot, clerk to Mr. Justice Willes, produced the affidavit of Mr. Coutts, but could not identify him; and then, after some conversation, Mr. Alsop was examined—(<hi rend="italic">The examination was read, as at page</hi> 294: <hi rend="italic">the part upon which the perjury was assigned bang that Coutts was present before the taxing-matter on the</hi> 14th <hi rend="italic">November, when his affidavit was used.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">JAMES GOUTTS</hi>. I produce a copy of the record of my trial—I have examined it with the original—I am now carrying on business as a baker, at Bromley—I first became acquainted with Mr. Alsop a little after 4th December, 1867—I had seen him before, but not to speak to him, I think—from that time onwards, he was repeatedly engaged as solicitor for other parties against me—he was solicitor in an action brought against me by a person named Kelsey—I made an affidavit in that action—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the affidavit to which I was a party, with Mr. Bleby, who was my solicitor in that action—it was sworn on 11th November, 1868—I received a commu<lb></lb>nication from Mr. Bleby about 10 o'clock on the night of the 12th; in consequence of which, I came to town on the morning of the 13th—I also came to town the next day, the 14th, and I went to Mr. Bleby's office, which is about the middle of Chancery Lane—I came from the Southampton Buildings side, at the top of Chancery Lane—if I passed Serjeant's Inn at any time that day, it must have been after the taxation; I have no recol<lb></lb>lection that I did—it was a little after 12 o'clock when I got to Mr. Bleby's office, not beyond 12.15, I think—I had some conversation with Mr. Bleby as to the taxation, after which Mr. Bleby left the office with Mr. Peace, his clerk, leaving me in the office—I remained there until Mr. Bleby's return, all the time—Mr. Peace came back once before his return—during the whole of the time, a youth named William Edwards was in the office with me—I was not present in the taxing<lb></lb>master's room on any occasion; I was never before a taxing<lb></lb>master at all in my life, to my knowledge—I was not present when this affidavit was used and read at the taxing; I did not see it there at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You describe yourself as a baker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—I have been a Baptist minister—I should say it is four or five years ago since I ceased to have a fixed charge—I became acquainted with Mr. Mitchell in Bromley—I was not in business between the time I ceased to officiate as a minister and the time of my meeting with Mitchell; that would be about</p>

               <p>four years—I subsequently made an arrangement with Mitchell to see to his accounts; not in the first instance—an arrangement was made that I was to have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for it, but I never had any—I think that arrange<lb></lb>ment continued about nine months—his was the business of a baker—my name was not over the door instead of his at the end of the nine months, it was in the beginning of the following year—it was not while I was arranging his accounts that he became bankrupt; it was some time after; four or five months—I had not a bill of sale for 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on his goods; it was for between 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Kelsey was a creditor, and was the creditors' assignee—he brought an action against me to contest the bill of sale—on that occasion Mr. Alsop acted as his attorney—I am happy to say I have not had any private business matters with Mr. Alsop; I never had any private business arrangements with him; I have never employed him—I believe I have not been brought into connection with him at all, except when he was acting as solicitor for other parties—I swore that affidavit—it states: "I swear that I have paid the witnesses, other than the said Ernest Robinson, for their travelling expenses and attendance at the Assizes, the sums set opposite to their respective names in the schedule"—I had paid them partially, not in full—if you wish me to explain, I can do so simply, and it will be patent that there is no untruth in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It would be untrue, whether wilfully untrue or not is another thing; but, if you swore that you had paid them, and you had not, it was untrue? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HARRIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you paid any of the three persons, Strong, Carpenter or Robinson, in full? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Carpenter and Robinson were not paid in full—Strong was paid in full—that is to say, he owed me more than his claim, and that he admitted—I knew that this affidavit would not be used that day, but it was to be used at some future day—I knew on the evening of the 12th that it had been impounded, but I knew nothing about it on the 11th—I went to London on the 13th, to my solicitor's chambers, in Chancery Lane—he had used this affidavit—I did not know that he was to use it—I went to his place because I had a letter from him on the morning of the 12th—it was with respect to the taxing of my costs—I was there, I believe, the whole time while the matter was before the master on the 14th—I knew on the morning of the 13th that it was going before the master on the 14th—I did not go before the master—I was forbidden to go by Mr. Bleby—he stated I had better not go—he assigned no reason at the time, therefore he could not have said it was because it was untrue—I did not ask for any reason—I had previously seen him and explained the whole case to him—he did not say why I was not to go before the taxing—master—I had an idea why—I had no wish to come in contact with Mr. Alsop, for one reason—I give that reason on my oath—that was a reason which led me not to go—if it had been left to myself I should not have gone, and that would have been my reason—if my solicitor had told me to go I should have gone, whatever my reasons may have been—the immediate cause of my not going certainly was my attorney telling me not to go—you asked me my private reason, and I told you I did not like to meet Mr. Alsop—my solicitor gave me no reason—ho came hurriedly into the office and he left hurriedly, but he said "Mr. Courts, you need not go;", and I said "Very well, I will remain till you return."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said before that he forbade you to go! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me not to go.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HARRIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Which was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He forbade me to go; it is per<lb></lb>fectly true that he said I need not go—it is no use perplexing me; I wil explain simply how it was, Mr. Bleby had an engagement at Westminster that morning, I was waiting there from 12.30 till near the time of the taxation, for his arrival, he came in hurriedly, and said "I am going to this taxation"—I said "May I go," or "Shall I go"—he said "You should not go"—I don't know the exact words, but he forbade me to go, and in consequence of that I did not go—the effect was that I did not go—if he had said "Come," I would have gone—it was in consequence of my solici<lb></lb>tor telling me I need not go, or I should not go, or forbidding me to go, that I did not go; that is quite correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it was not because of your not wishing to meet Mr. Alsop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If you ask me my private reasons—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were your private reasons—had you any reason except being forbidden by your attorney? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but at that time my not going depended entirely upon my attorney forbidding me; I had no other reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HARRIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it is not true that you did not go because you did not want to meet Mr. Alsop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I don't want to misunderstand you, but you wish to perplex me. The witnesses are all paid their expenses—Strong was paid before—Carpenter is paid—I called at his house the day the affidavit was sworn, on the 14th November I think—I paid him myself; I called twice to see him and failed to see him, the third time I did see him—that was on 14th November—I paid them all on the same day—Strong was paid, that is to say it was only to settle the accounts <hi rend="italic">per contra</hi>—I did that on the 13th—Robinson was paid on the 13th also, I sent the money to him, I sent the money to them both—I never said that I was before the taxing-master on the 12th—I never said to anybody at the last trial that I was not there on the second occasion but I was there on the first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WADDY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The last time you were before the learned Recorder did you hear anything at all said about your having been there on the 12th, except by Mr. Alsop, when he said "The affidavit was used on the 12th, when the defendant was not present, and on the 13th and 14th when he was!" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I swore this affidavit on the 11th November; after having sworn it I went direct from London to Bromley and called on Carpenter, he was not in, but I saw his wife and told her I had come to pay Mr. Car<lb></lb>penter 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., being the balance due to him—I left some instructions with her and went away—I called again next morning, the 12th—I left the money at the house on Friday, the 13th—I had taken the 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with me on the previous occasions to pay him—at the time I signed this affidavit I knew it was not to be used that day—Strong owed me an account greater than his claim—I went and told him that would square it up; I saw him on the 11th—I wrote to Robinson when I got home on the 11th, that letter was returned to me.</p>

I am a painter, living at Farwig, near Bromley—I was present at the taxation of costs—I was not there on the 12th—I first flaw Mr. Alsop about this matter on the 11th, at his office in Bromley—he asked me if I had been promised some money by Mr. Coutts, and I said no, I had not—he said, "Mr. Coutts has sworn in his affidavit to having paid you money"—I said, "Then I have not received any"—he said he thought Mr. Coutts had committed perjury, or something of that sort, that he had been a long time trying to catch him, and if he got him this time he would not like to stand in his shoes for so much money, or something of that sort; that was it as near as possible—that was on the 11th—after that I went to my own house—my wife gave me some information, and I went back, and told Mr. Alsop what my wife had told me—I said that Mr. Coutts had been to pay the money—he said, How do you know"—I said my wife said so—he said, "You can't swear to that, because your wife's evidence is no evidence; you were not at home, and you never saw him"—there were other things passed, I don't exactly recollect—I told him that I was to call and see Mr. Mitchell, to receive the money next morning, that was the 12th, and he asked me if it would make any difference to me if I stopped away—I believe Mitchell was at that time managing the baker's shop—Mr. Coutts came to my house afterwards, and paid me this money—Mr. Alsop told me, I think, at the second interview, but I would not swear that, that I should not be the loser, he would make up the 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I think it was; I am not quite sure of the amount—I said I thought it was more than 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said well, if needs be, he would pay me the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been paid with the subpoena—Mr. Alsop afterwards brought me a paper, which I signed—I went before a Magistrate at Bow Street—I afterwards saw Mr. Alsop, and told him I thought he had treated me rather badly in bringing me into an affair that I did not know anything about—I believe that was the beginning of the conversation; it is some time back; I cannot recollect positively—I told him I thought he had done me wrong, and ill-treated me in making me a complainant to enter an action against Mr. Coutts—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186902010046"></xptr>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you a complainant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I was—Mr. Coutts paid me the money on the 12th, I beg pardon, on the 13th; he came before it was exactly light—I was not astonished that he should pay me, because my wife had told me before that he had come to pay me, and told me I was to go to Mr. Mitchell's at 9 o'clock next morning—I told Mr. Coutts I thought I had not any claim on him; at any rate, I led him to suppose I did not expect any—he waited till I got up—that was on the morning of the 13th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Defendant's Statement before the Magistrate was read, as follows</hi>: "What I have to say is this; there have been many meetings between myself, as solicitor for various parties, and Mr. Coutta I have met him at the Bankruptey Court on two or three occasions; I have met him at the Examiner's Office, in the Court of Chancery; I have met him at Judge's Chambers; I have met him before the Judge; I have met him at the County Court, at Bromley; and I have prosecuted him, as an attorney, in the Criminal Court at Bromley. I was in the habit of meeting him, on law business, almost daily. It has been proved in evidence to-day that Mr. Coutts was within thirty yards of the place where I swore to seeing him. He must have passed the office with the windows opening on the street at or about the time I was at the Taxing Office. It has already been proved that there were several persons present, and a great confusion existed. I was no witness set down in my counsel's brief; I was asked the question suddenly, if Mr. Coutts was present, and I answered 'Yes' I then went into the box, and honestly and conscientiously deposed to what I believed to be the truth. The learned counsel turned round and asked my clerk if Coutts was present on the 14th, and he immediately answered, 'He was,' and this before I had an opportunity of communicating with him. The next witness, Mr. Kelsey, was asked the same question, and he said "He was," but, on cross-examination, he would not go beyond belief. I have nothing more to say."</p>

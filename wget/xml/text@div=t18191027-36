               <p>MR. ALLEY (for the prosecution), stated, that the deceased was found with a knife in her thigh, in her master's kitchen, at <placeName id="t18191027-36-crimeloc211">Charing-cross</placeName>

It was however extraordinary, that the window had not been cleaned, and if she intended to do it, her getting on a table would put it out of her power so to do. She had also declared, that the prisoner had nothing to do with it. The Coroner's Jury had, however, found a verdict against him; but he (Mr. Alley), had no evidence to prove that he was ever near the house, or in any way whatever to connect him with the transaction. Under all these circumstances, he deemed it entirely useless to offer any evidence.</p>

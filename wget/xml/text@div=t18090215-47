               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever come to your shop - A. I do not recollect that he did. On the 18th of January, we missed a piece of toillinet, the young man in the shop had put it in the window in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it before - A. I cannot recollect; I had seen it within a fortnight; I have seen it since at Bow street in the possession of the officer; there is my master's hand writing upon the stuff.</p>

            . On the 19th of January I was going up Brewer street, between five and six in the evening, I saw the prisoner pass me, I went after him directly, knowing him before; he had this under his coat; I asked him what he had got there; he said it was his own property. I took it from him and took him to the office; I did not ask him any questions. That is all that past.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Did not he say he bought it - A. He did before the magistrate.</p>

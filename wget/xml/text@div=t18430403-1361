On the evening of the 29th of March, my wife went up stairs to the bed-room to get some change—she called my father out of the club-room, then came down, and called me—I went up, and found Grant under the bed—I fetched the policeman, and when I got him, Grant had been pulled from under the bed—Walker then came in—he called him some name, and said, "You shall not go to the station-house without me; if you take one you shall take both"—these articles were under the bed, and were pulled out with Grant—I had seen them safe under a window in the club-room, which is in the first floor, two hours before—the bed-room is on the second floor—I had seen the prisoners in the club-room before, and I did not observe Walker again till he came into the bed-room, and said, "You shall not go to the station without me."</p>

This man took my basket from under my window; I had pitched it there when I went into the shop, with the loaves in it; my shop is rather small, I had no room to take it in; there were some customers there, I went in to serve them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take it? - A. I did not see him take it away; I received information from a person that keeps a cellar next door, her name is

               <p>Q. Were all the loaves in the basket when you caught him? - A. Yes. (The basket produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I met a man in the Strand, at the corner of Southampton-street; he asked me to carry that basket, he had one quartern loaf in his hand, and that gentleman came up; he asked me where I got it; I told him that a man told me to take care of it till he came back.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) What did the prisoner say to you? - A. He said he was going to carry it to Covent-garden; he likewise found two-pence halfpenny in his pocket when he was at Bow-street, that this man gave him to carry it he said.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. In March, I had some premises at No. 21, Little Alie Street, where I carried on the business of a waterproofer. On a Sunday nigh in March, my house was burnt down—I was away from home at the time—the two prisoners had worked for me—a person named Myers Goldsberg was my foreman—after the fire, I took a place at No. 6, George Street, Minories—shortly afterwards the two prisoners came to my house, with a third person—Robinson came up stairs to me, and said, "Mr. Stern, I want some money"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "I must have money; I am very poor; I have got no work; I want to go to America; you must give us 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each to go away, or I will go to the insurance office, and say that you set your house on fire"—I told them to come again in an hour's time—they all three came, and Robinson spoke out, and said, "I am <hi rend="italic">hard up</hi>, will you give us the money or not I"—I said, "I have no money; you know my own things were damaged by water and fire; I have no money"—I was a quarter of an hour talking to him—a gentleman came knocking at the private door, and I went away with him—during the quarter of an hour they were with me, one said, "If you don't give us 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, I will go so far" (<hi rend="italic">Drawing his hand across his throat</hi>)—they said they would swear anything, they would swear black was white, if I did not give the money—Robinson said, "I will give you till 4 o'clock to go for the money"—I said, "Yes, you wait here"—he said he had read the papers, and found that I was insured in the West of England, and should receive the money, and I must give him some—I went away with my friend, and left them—I met Robinson six or seven days afterwards in Whitechapel Road, opposite the church—I was with another man, and we all three walked together; Robinson began to laugh—I said, "What do you laugh at?"—he said, "I am very sorry I went to the insurance office, and said you set the place on fire yourself"—I said, "It was very wrong to go and tell a lie; you know I was not at home at the time; I was away during the time it was on fire"—he said, "You know very well there is no work; I want to go away from London; if you will give me the money now, I will go away to-morrow morning, and will not go against you"—he told me to meet him by Aldgate Church, between 8 and 9 o'clock—I told him I should bring the money there—I said to him, "Where are the others?"—he said he had been to one of them, and could not find him—I met him at 8 o'clock by Aldgate Church—he said he could not find the others—he said he would go to Goldsberg's—I said, "Go, and I will wait for you"—I did not wait—he went away—I next saw Greenbow, and he told me to come with him to his brother's, and give him the money there, and he would go away the next morning—I said, "I can't give you any money, if you do not give me a receipt"—he went away, and brought Robinson with him to Whitechapel, and we went to Morris, a cigar maker,</p>

               <p>at Aldgate—when we got there, there were two policemen in plain clothes, placed there by my direction—I came into the shop, and Mr. Morris said to the policeman, "I have some private business to do, will you walk out?" and they walked into the front shop—I, and Morris, and the two prisoners went into the back room—I had left directions with Morris what to do, to make a receipt for the money—Green bow then said to Robinson, "There is something suspicious here; I will tell you what, we won't take the money here"—there was a little talking together, and they walked away, and I went with them—while we were there, Robinson said he had made up his mind; he could not go with 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he must have 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he must have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to buy some clothes—when they walked out, and I was with them, Robinson said, "You had better come to my landlord; you give me the money here, and I will give you the receipt"—the prisoners were both together at that time—the policemen were behind, and I gave them both in charge—they were taken to the station, and they were discharged—the inspector said, "If they come again to annoy you, lock them up."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 111, Houndsditch. I did not know Mr. Stern till he called at my house one Thursday evening—Robinson livel in my house—Mr. Stern knocked at the door on the Thursday evening; he told me he wanted to see Mark Robinson—I said, "He is not at home;" he was very doubtful of my word, and I called down another man, and said, "Is Mark at home?" he said, "No"—Mr. Stern said, "I want to see Mark</p>

               <p>Robinson very particularly, I want to call him into a public house and give him something to drink; I want to give him some money"—I said, "You are a very liberal man to give him some money, perhaps you will give some to me"—he said, "No, I have no reason to give you money, you don't know anything at all about the case"—he did not come by himself he came with Mr. Goldsberg, and another man—I listened to all he had to say—he said, "I want to give him some money if he would leave England"—I and I could not say anything, I could not interfere in it—Robinson lived in my house three or four months; he was always honourable to me—I never heard anything against him.</p>

                  </hi>. I make waterproof garments. I was in the house of the last witness—I recollect Mr. Stan, and Goldsberg, and another per<lb></lb>son coming on the first Thursday after the fire between 10 and 11 o'clock at night; they knocked at the door—the last witness went down and opened it—I was in my own room; he called me down, and said, "Is Mark Robinson at home"—I said, "No, he went out"—Mr. Stern said, "I want to see him very particular"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "I want to give him some money, and he shall leave England; tell him I have been here, I want to give him money sufficient to go to America"—he wished us good night, and went away—on the following Monday then went knock again, my landlord called me to answer the door—I went, and the prose<lb></lb>cutor was there—he said, "Did you give that message to Mark Robinson?"—I said, "Yes"—he said that before he would get me into trouble he would be in it himself-be said, I can get anybody into trouble as easy as I can make a garment for my own trade; one Jack Sheppard is gone, and another is here; that is me; there is a not another Jonathan Wild, who</p>

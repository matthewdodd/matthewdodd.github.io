            . I wanted a coach, but there was none-it rained a little; I sat on the step of a door, under shelter, to wait for one. In about a minute, the prisoner, with four or five others, and a girl came up - They spoke to the girl who stood with me; I did not hear what they said. The prisoner, and another man, insisted on my getting up, and laid hold of my arm. As I was getting up, I felt my watch being drawn from my fob; I immediately loosed my arm, and seized my watch; the prisoner immediately knocked me down - I am sure he is the man; I have known his person for two years, by seeing him loitering about the Theatre. I got up, and knocked one of them down - I was knocked down myself repeatedly. I knocked the prisoner down once or twice - He was in the act of taking my seals from me, he was pulling at the ribbon - He did not get it then. I do not know who got it at last; it was taken from me, and he was acting with those who took it - He did not take it himself. After a considerable scuffle, I felt my seals go with a sudden snatch. They knocked me down again, and ran down Tavistock-street. The young woman who was with me saw it all, and picked up my hat and gave it to me. I immediately followed them - They did not see me; they walked down Maiden-lane, and turned into a court which leads into the Strand; I followed them into the Strand, and saw the prisoner and the party standing together, I immediately collared him. The patrol, who was about five yards off, sprung his rattle, and the party ran away. I still held the prisoner - He endeavoured to get away, and struck me - I took him to the watch-house. I lost my seals from off my watch. They tore my trowsers down to get at them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The violence was committed on your person after you lost the property - A. Yes, and before; they took my seals in Charles-street. I was sober.</p>

            . I was with Mr. Pead. When we came to the end of York-street, he wanted a coach, there was none - He sat on the step to wait for one. I saw him struck, and an attempt made to get his watch. I saw the prisoner, who was one of them, knock him down - I am sure it was him. I saw something go from the prisoner to another man, who gave it to a girl. The prisoner knocked him down again - They ran off. I picked Mr. Pead's hat up, and gave it to him; one of them had knocked it off. We followed them into the Strand, where Mr. Pead took the prisoner, and went to look for the others.</p>

He was very muddy and dirty-the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181804010015"></xptr>prisoner's right side was also covered with mud and dirt, as if he had been down.</p>

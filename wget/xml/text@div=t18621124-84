               <p>I don't know what part of London he lives"—I said, "That is very strange"—he then said, "Tell Mr. Ellis to come here, and I will tell him all about it"—he could see Mr. Ellis at that time, he was close handy—I said, "You may as well tell me, I know as much about it as Mr. Ellis"—Mr. Ellis then came up, and Coulson said to him, "I bought them springs and axletree of Manhman, your horse-keeper"—I asked him if he had any more—he said, "No, I have no more"—I said, "I shall have to go to your house and search your house," and afterwards, in my presence, he told Mr. Ellis that he had bought four nutcracker springs, and three axles—I told him he had better go home, and I would go and see Marshman—I then went to Marshman's house, and brought him to Coulson—I then asked Coulson if that was the man he had bought the springs of—he said he was—I then asked him where they were—he said, "You will find them in the cupboard in the front room"—I went to the cupboard, where I found three nutcracker springs and two axles—Marshman then said, "Those are the ones I sold you, the ones I took from my master"—Mr. Ellis identified them as his property—Coulson said to Marshman, "I paid you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them"—Marshman said, "You have not paid for them at all; I have not sold them"—Coulson said, "I paid you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them"—I afterwards got two springs from the wheelwright; they were not nutcracker springs, but they had been separated, so as to make two springs for the truck—when Coulson said, "I paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them" Marshman made no further answer—I afterwards got from Bulcolm, the wheelwright, two springs and one axle, which were identified by Mr. Ellis.</p>

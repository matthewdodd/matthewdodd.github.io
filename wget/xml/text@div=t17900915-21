On the 24th of August, at three in the morning, my man and I was both in bed in the barge; I heard a noise; I looked out from under the tilt; I saw the prisoner taking up a bar of iron; I called my man; he looked out, and asked the prisoner what he did there; I told my man to lay hold of him; he ran towards him, and he dropped the bar; I went to assist him: I called the watch, and the watchman came to the side of the wharf; we delivered him to the watchman; he had a skift along side our barge, with lines and old pieces of rope that had been cut off; he was taken to the watch-house, and from thence to the Compter.</p>

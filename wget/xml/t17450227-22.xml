Last Lord Mayor's Day was twelve months I lost a silver tankard, one Mr. Ambleford was drinking in my house up one pair of stairs, and had a silver tankard carried up to him. The Prisoner at the bar had spread a report about the parish, that he had received the tankard into his panniers [he goes about with an ass and panniers, and sells things.] Mr. Ambleford the other witness, who was a very honest gentleman, was put into despair about this, and about two or three weeks ago cut his throat.</p>

Sir Thomas asked him, whether he did not say that he knew who put it into the panniers; then he said he was with his ass and panniers, and that he did receive the tankard out of Mr. Griffith's house from a person he knew very well, whom he had known three years. Said I, if you have known the person three years, cannot you tell who it was? then he said it was one Crisp a turner in the Broad Way (who is a man of as good a character as any in that parish.)

               <p>- Tubb. I heard the Prisoner say he received the tankard: that a person brought the tankard out of the house, and he received it into his panniers at a proper place, and in Channel Row he let the man take the tankard out again, but he would not tell who the man was: Now, says he, what will you do? He said it was above a twelve-month ago, and he thought we could not do any thing to him, or he would not have spoke any thing of it. <rs id="t17450227-22-verdict116" type="verdictDescription">

            . I was captain's steward of the ship. On the 24th I locked Capt. Lamb's plate up in the cabin, part in a chest, and the remainder in a box, which I did not lock. Next day, about eleven o'clock, I took it down to the gun-room the two mates, Capt. Johnson, and a boy were on board, and about twelve revenue officers. The prisoner was there as a custom-house officer. I was going to put the plate under the batches, which had an excise and custom-house lock and our own lock. I put it in the steerage while the officers unlocked the hatches; they then called me down to open the store-room door; I left the box close by the hatch, and went down-it had a canwas cover three times round it. The prisoner staid near it, and an excise officer named Cass. In about three minutes I heard the plate rattle; I ran up the ladder immediately, and found the box moved on to a chest in a darker place; the canvas was forced in on one side to make room for a hand. I saw the prisoner's hand in, and drawing it out as fast as he could no person was near him. I asked him if he put his hand in that box? he said Yes. I took the tin funnel out of his hand, and said it belonged to the box he said, "Does it?" He being an officer, I did not like to take him. I took the box into the cabin, missed five table spoons and two forks, and told Capt. Johnson. I missed the prisoner in about ten minutes he returned on board in about twenty minutes. Capt. Johnson then asked him how he came by the funnel? he said at first that he did not know, then that he found it in his hand, and afterwards that he took it out of the box. He said he had taken no silver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Will you swear that the prisoner went ashore - A. No; he said he had been ashore. He told Capt. Johnson that he put his hand in the box, as he had a right to search.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell Arnold that you thought the prisoner was innocent - A. No; I said I hoped he would be found innocent, as he said he was.</p>

            . I am the ship's husband. Glover gave me information of the prisoner; in about ten minutes afterwards I saw him come on deck from the shore. I asked him how he came to have the funnel in his hand? he said he did not know. I told him that Glover had said that he caught his hand in the plate-box, and saw him take the funnel out - He said it was so, but he took nothing else. I took him into the cuddy, and told him in private that it was a very serious thing, and that I should be under the necessity of giving him in charge, but I would first give him an hour to produce the plate he said he was innocent. He was taken into custody, as he did not produce it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you say he ever left the ship - A. He told me he had been ashore to get something to eat. I saw him with two plates.</p>

            . I am a tide-waiter of Excise. I saw Glover go below, and bring the box to the foot of the hatch. In about a quarter of an hour he came up, and charged the prisoner with stealing the plate. I did not see him near the box.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Was you present all the while - A. No; I left the prisoner for ten minutes. I was in the cabin when Glover came up. I did not see the prisoner go ashore - I do not say that he did not.</p>

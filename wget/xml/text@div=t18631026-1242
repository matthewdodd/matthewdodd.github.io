                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Lewis and Allenby, linendrapers, of Regent-street—I know the prisoner—I recollect his calling one afternoon in March, 1859—he was shown into my private room, and said that he wished to open an account for his wife, and wished to know if she might have goods on credit for a short time—I said yes, if he favoured us with references—I placed before him our book, in which he wrote his name, "Captain Thomas Mitchell, 2, Hanover-street, and Kirk<lb></lb>lington, Oxfordshire," and gave Major Williamson and Colonel Hamilton as references—the entries in this book are in the prisoner's writing, in my presence—I wrote to the referees the same day, and in due course received these two letters, one from Major Williamson, at Ryde, dated the 28th and one from Colonel Hamilton, dated Richmond, 8th April (<hi rend="italic">Both these letters spoke favourably of the prisoner, and stated that he might be credited with perfect safety</hi>)—I received Major Williamson's letter first, and the prisoner called on or about 11th April, the day we received the letter from Colonel Hamil<lb></lb>ton—I believe he was alone the first time he called—he called on 16th April with a person whom he represented to be his wife, and made his first purchase of goods—I saw him. and handed him over to one of my assistants—the references being satisfactory, I should give general instructions that if such a person called for goods he was to have them—Henry Oram was the assistant who attended to him when he called after he had written, which was on 12th May—he then took away with him goods to the value of 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we gave him credit on the belief that he was Captain Mitchell, and on the strength of these letters, which we believed to be genuine—his giving a country address would induce us to place faith in his representations; if a gentleman has a residence in the country, we consider he is respectable.</p>

               <p>and we found that he was lodging there—the personal inquiries at Richmond were made in July or August following, in consequence of reports we heard after we had supplied the goods—we made the inquiries at Kirklington within the last month or so—the fact of the prisoner being a captain cer<lb></lb>tainly influenced me—I parted with the goods on his statement, and on the references which corroborated it—I think this letter signed "Williamson" is in the prisoner's writing—all this happened in 1859, and I heard that he was in Lewes Gaol the same year—the last entry of goods made to him is, I believe, in May or June, 1859—we ceased to supply him because we heard rumours about him—we made inquiries, and found he had left his lodging at Hanover-street in a suspicious manner, and heard nothing more of him till he was in a Lewes Gaol, convicted of passing a forged cheque of Lord Charle<lb></lb>ville's—during those four years we have done nothing in the matter—I received a sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1860; I cannot say that it was from the prisoner; the circumstances were peculiar—I was distinctly told that it was not on account of the prisoner's debt to us; the money was brought to my counting-house by a person who said that he wished to pay 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of Captain Mitchell—I said, "Pray, who do you come from?"—he said, "From Messrs. Lewis and Co., Great Marlborough-street, solicitors"—I said, "Is this sent by Captain Mitchell? he is in Lewes Gaol; he cannot pay money now"—he said, "No, that money was brought to us by a lady, requesting us to pay it to you;" and I believe he said that he thought it was the wife of Mitchell—I did not receive the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the first entry—I did not in 1859 receive back any of the goods which form part of this charge; certain goods were sent up from Lewes Gaol to the Vine-street Station, one of our men went to the station, identified them, and brought them back—I did not represent that we were going to institute proceedings; he was then in prison, and we thought that that would be enough for him—we are members of the Trade-protection Society—the Society for the Prosecution of Swindlers are interested in these proceedings to-day, under our instructions—they are not instituted by the Society; it was suggested by us.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

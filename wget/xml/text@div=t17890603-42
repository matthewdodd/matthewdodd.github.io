               <p>I lost this wine out of my house, from my cellar; it was sometime past, I missed a very large quantity of wine; and on parting with my butler, I desired a particular account might be taken of every bottle of wine to be given in charge to the new butler; the prisoner came into my service the 24th of January last; the account was taken whilst he was in my service; on the 1st of May, when I went into the country, the prisoner (after he had been discharged my service, not for any fault or suspicion of the kind) I told him he might stay in my house till the Monday, when I should return to town to dinner, and in the afternoon I would pay him his wages before I went out of town; on that day I ordered a pipe of port and a pipe of madeira to be bottled off; when I came back on the Monday, this man was to receive his wages; on the Monday he did not stay in my house, but went to see some friends; he did not return on Monday, but on Tuesday morning I ordered him to be detained; I went down stairs and insisted on having his box opened, he said he had not the key of his box, but he would go and get it; I would not suffer him to go, and the box was accordingly opened by force, and he took all the things out himself, clothes, shirts, and different things, and at the bottom of the box there was a good deal of hay, and among that hay were eight bottles of wine which he took out himself; they were all wrapped up in separate papers, waste paper which I had sent into the kitchen; one had a seal upon it; in consequence of this, I took him to Bow-street; at the desire of the prisoner, I saw him up stairs in my parlour in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030050"></xptr>presence of my servant; I promised him favour; I said, as I have been robbed of a great deal of wine, very like you may turn King's evidence, as it will be better for you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I collect Sir, from your sending your servant to see if you had any wine of that kind, you did not know whether you had or not? - I did not, I had a very good opinion of the prisoner; I meant to keep him in my service, and I told him when he would go away, I should give him a a very good character; he did not go for any misconduct at all.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am butler to Mr. Lushington; I found some wine in the prisoner's box, as described by Mr. Lushington, there were eight bottles.</p>
               <p>Could you tell all that by the appearance of that wine, to whom it belonged? - In my opinion to my master.</p>
               <p>Why do you think so? - The bottle of claret was the same as some in the cellar; nobody but me had the key of this cellar that I know of; I had been in the house about two months.</p>
               <p>Had you such an account of your master's wine as to tell whether any was missing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you find the wine correspond with that book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any wine missing in the cellar? - There was.</p>
               <p>Was the same quantity of wine missing in the cellar as described in the indictment? - A great deal more.</p>
               <p>Was there any claret missing? - I cannot say there was any missing from the claret binn, there was not; I found in one binn port, claret and sherry intermixed; and I believe madeira also in the same binn; the late butler might have done that; I took the stock regularly from binn to binn; this man had nothing to do with the cellar.</p>
               <p>Did you reckon it all as one wine? - I did not know that it was mixed, I reckoned it all as sherry, I have always accounted for it as sherry, but there were some odd bottles that were intermixed, which would have come at the last.</p>
               <p>Can you say with certainty, whether any bottles of wine were missing from this binn? - Yes, there were, but I cannot say how many, I believe there were nine bottles missing from this binn, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Had that the seal of Shallico's claret? - I believe it had, I never

             the cork; (The bottle produced.) This is the bottle that I found in the box.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This has the seal of Shallico upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You say Sir, you apprehend you are able to state that wine was missing out of that binn; you are not able, by your account to state that any claret was missing? - No, I am not; I took account of it as sherry.</p>
               <p>Your claret in your other cellar does not appear to have any taken from it? - Not any, that is Shallico's claret and is all right.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to leave it all to the counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him an exceeding good character.</p>
               <p>Calton. I keep the key of the cellar, they are open binns; the lock of the cellar has been examined, and it does not appear that it has been broke open at all; I never suspected the man of being a dishonest man.</p>

I was passing down Ratcliff-highway on the 28th of December—I saw the prisoner and another young man watching the prosecutrix's premises—I saw a pair of trowsers cut down from the door-post—I crossed and saw the prisoner was doubling them up—he placed them under his coat—I followed him, called "Stop thief," and he dropped them—I took them up.</p>

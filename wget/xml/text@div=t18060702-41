             sworn. I am clerk to Mr. Armour and Williams.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to your cutting-room frequently. - A. Yes, he applied for a situation; he has been in the habit of coming two or three months. On the 3d of June he was in the cutting-room, as I thought, with a piece of nankeen under his coat. I was talking to a gentleman that came in on business; as the gentleman was going out I turned round, and I saw him take up a small end of linen. I asked him what he was going to do with that? he replied, he wanted a little piece to face a waistcoat. I told him I was surprised at his doing such a thing in that house, for if he had asked for such a thing, I was sure he would have it given him. I then asked him what he had got under his coat, for I saw it below the lappel; he told me that was a piece of nankeen he had bought coming along, upon which I took it from him, and I looked at it. I saw it was the property of a gentleman who had sent it to be made up. I told him I could swear to the property. He then told me he was very sorry he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020029"></xptr>had taken it, and begged me to let him go in consideration of his family. I told him I should acquaint Mr. Williams of it; he offered to come by me; I stopped him, and locked him in the room. I took the nankeen in my hand, and went up to Mr. Williams and shewed it him; an officer was then sent for.</p>

             sworn. Q. Do you live with Messrs. Armour and Williams, - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoner was apprehended. - A. On the 3d of June, between ten and eleven o'clock I let the prisoner in at the street door; about an hour afterwards hearing a noise in the cutting-room I went in there, I saw the witness Cook coming out of the cutting-room with a piece of nankeen in his hand, I entered the cutting-room, and I perceived a pound of thread sticking up in the prisoner's coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it visible to the eye before you searched him. - A. Yes, it was about two inches out of his pocket; suspecting that he had something else about him I watched him narrowly, he turned his back to the table and took out the pound of thread and a gross of buttons and laid them on the table; I was sent to Marlborough street for an officer.</p>

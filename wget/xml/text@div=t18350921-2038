                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live No. 4, Hackney-road. The prisoner repeatedly came to my office with paper for sale—on the 17th of September he came and offered nine quires of pink foolscap—I said I was not a buyer, and did not want it—he said, "Take and look at it"—I examined it, and found it was nine quires—I took away one sheet, and returned the rest to him—he asked either three or four shillings for the nine quires—I knew it could not be made for that, and declined purchasing—he then said, "Will you give two shillings?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Well, it is yours; give me one shilling"—I said I would have nothing to do with it—he walked away saying, "I may have something to suit you another time.

                  </hi>. I am journeyman to Mr. Skinner, and live in White Lion-street, Norton Falgate. I was in the office when the prisoner came into the passage, and asked for Mr. Skinner, who answered him; but what he said I could not say, as I was not it the room—Mr. Skinner came to the door, and the prisoner unfolded some paper out of his apron—he stood in the passage—Mr. Skinner took the paper into another room—looked at it, and then came out—the prisoner asked three shillings, then two shillings, and then one shilling—Mr. Skinner said he would have nothing to do with it—I saw the prisoner take it away—there appeared about half a ream—he was there five or ten minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fancy stationer, and live in Bunhill-row. I have two partners—the prisoner was in our employ about eighteen months, till I gave him in charge last Thursday—he was employed in mill<lb></lb>ing or glazing paper—I have examined the sheet of paper produced—It is my manufacture, and belonged to a parcel which he had to mill, a week or ten days previously—there is a pecularity in that lot of paper, which enables me to say decidedly it belonged to that quantity—we buy it white, and colour it—I cannot tell whether I miss any—I am certain it belongs to that lot—It is difficult to find paper which will take a pink colour, and it would</p>

               <p>be ten chances to one if you made the same colour exactly—I have com<lb></lb>pared it with the remainder of the lot—It is used by apothecaries, and worth one shilling a quire, the wholesale price—It cost sixteen shillings a ream.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had three reams of paper to mill three different colours—last Wednesday week his son counted it up; and if I had taken nine quires, he must have missed it—he tied it in brown paper, and took it into the warehouse—I took two or three damaged sheets; it is no use telling a story about it.</p>

             at the end of New-street, Bishopsgate-street; she asked me to go home with her; I did; I felt my handkerchief and money as I went in at the door, I felt to see if they were safe, because I thought I was in bad company; as soon as I was in the house they asked me to sit down; I did not like the house and wanted to go out; they swore I should not go out without I would give them something to drink; Cross was there with a candle in her hand when I went in; they opened the back door and another woman came in; then they opened the fore door and two more came in; they held me while Harwood put her hands in my pocket and took my money and my handkerchiefs and two keys; they swore the keys were of no value to them and returned them; they wanted to feel in my fob and asked me, what I had? I said, I had a watch, but would not part with it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever recover your money or handkerchief? - No; I had the two prisoners taken up the same night; I always said the prisoners were two of them; I charged the watchman with another, but a man at the door prevented his taking her away.</p>

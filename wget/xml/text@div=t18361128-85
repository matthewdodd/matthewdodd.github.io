                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old. I go to the Blue-coat school, at Westminster—I have seen Holmes and Woodford about—I went to school with O'Donnell—on Tuesday evening, the 8th of November, be<lb></lb>tween eight and nine o'clock, I was in Vincent-square, and saw the three prisoners there—there was a woman coming along, rather tipsy—Holmes laid down before her, and Woodford pushed her over Holmes, who got up, un<lb></lb>tied her cloak, and ran away with it—I saw Woodford put his hands into her pocket, but did not see him take any thing out—O'Donnell was there, but he did not do any thing—I watched them—Holmes ran down Vincent-square, into different streets, and into Peter-street, crying out, "Who will buy a cloak for sixpence, which I have won at a raffle at one penny a mem<lb></lb>ber?"—I followed him—he asked a fish-woman, named White, to buy it, for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said, "I suppose it is not good for any thing"—he said, "Yes, it is a pretty good one"—she looked at it, and told him to put it in her apron—she gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence—he gave Woodford 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and asked O'Donnell if he would have any—he said no, he would not be in the mess (I knew the prosecutrix—she only lives down the court) I told them I would tell, and Holmes said he would give me such a hiding—O'Donnell lives in Rochester-row, and I live close by him, in Vauxhall-road—I went to the prosecutrix's house, but she was not at home—I saw woodford on Thursday, and said to him, "Do you know the woman who bought the cloak?"—he said, "Yes, it is old Mother White, the sweep"—I said, "Where does she live?"—he said, "In Castle-lane"—I went there, but found she did not live there—I found her in Loader-place—the prosecutrix would not come here as a witness—she was before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of the 8th of November, the witness and the three prisoners ran up to me—they were all running together, singing out "Buy a clock for sixpence"—they were all speaking together—I asked them how they got it—they said they won it at a raffle, at 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a member—I cannot say which it was said so, for what one said the others said—I gave them sixpenny worth of halfpence for it, and took it home—I gave it to the policeman when he came.</p>

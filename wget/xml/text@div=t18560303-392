                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector, G</hi>). On Saturday, 23rd Feb., I went to a house, No. 2, Morton-street, in the Borough—the street door was fastened—it was broken open by an officer—the parlour door was fastened—I directed one of the officers to break it open—John Evans came, as I believe, down the stairs—he rushed towards the door—I stopped him—he kicked me violently, and a desperate struggle ensued—I got him down with assistance, and got his boots off—as he came towards me, he dropped a parcel, which was taken up, and was afterwards found to contain six counterfeit shillings—while the struggle was going on, Savage came to the passage—I do not know where she came from, but she took an active part in endeavouring to rescue John Evans from us—I pushed her back, and she was taken into custody—I went to the parlour, where Jane Evans lay in bed, and appeared to be very ill—I took from that bed this paper box, which contained thirty-six groats, seven shillings, and five sixpences, all counterfeit—I then went up stairs to the second floor back room—I there found some moulds with impressions partly scraped out—I lifted up the window, and in a garden pot I found these plaster of Paris moulds, one for half crowns and two for sixpences, one of the date of 1834 and one 1839, and in a garden pot, wrapped in paper, I found sixty-six groats and</p>

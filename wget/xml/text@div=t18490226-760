                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. William George Gill, of Isling<lb></lb>ton—the prisoner was in his service to carry out medicine—he lived in the house, but did not sleep there. On 22d Feb., he came to work at twenty minutes past seven o'clock—he ought to have staid there till the evening—I missed him at eight that morning, and he did not come back; I missed the jacket and other clothes about eight from the kitchen; it was his livery—he did not wear it in the morning, but in the afternoon—I afterwards missed a table-cover and a basket—I have never seen the basket since—this is the jacket—this knife is Mr. Gill's.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 237). I apprehended the prisoner at his mother's—I told him he must come with me to the station for robbing his master of a table-cover, a basket, a knife, and livery—he told me another boy had persuaded him to go away, who had got the jacket on—I appre<lb></lb>hended the other boy the next morning, and found the jacket at his mother's.</p>

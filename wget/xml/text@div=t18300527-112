            . I am a stone-dresser. On the 13th of May, between half-past four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was at work in the road in <placeName id="t18300527-112-crimeloc599">Great Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You first saw the coach two or three yards from the deceased, driving at a very speedy rate? A. Yes - I immediately called to the coachman; the coach was about the middle of the road - I am sure of that; I did not see the deceased come off the curb - he was about the middle of the road, as near as I could see; there was no other carriage near the spot - there might be some up at the Freemasons' tavern; the street was newly paved - I did not hear him call to the deceased to take care; I was too far off.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You swear he whipped the horses afterwards? A. Yes - I was twenty or thirty yards from the Freemasons' tavern, and could not see it where I stood; the carriage was coming along Great Queen-street - it happened three or four yards nearer to Lincoln's Inn-fields than Little Queen-street.</p>

            . I am a stone-mason - I was employed on the pavement. I first saw the deceased under the horses' feet; I had not seen the carriage before- after he was rode over, the horses kept going at a very quick pace, between a trot and a gallop; I and two more stopped them - I did not see the prisoner do any thing; he might attempt to stop, but I was not observing him -I was before him, trying to stop the horses; he might strike the horses without my observing him - they were going a good deal quicker than they ought; I cannot tell at what rate - Jacobs was taken into a doctor's shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Lane with you attempting to stop the horses? A. Yes - he was working within six yards of me, further from the coach than me; I was twenty or thirty yards from where the man was run over- the prisoner gave his card, and offered to take the man any where in his master's carriage.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were the horses difficult or easy to stop? A. When the prisoner saw persons come before the horses, he directly pulled up - a man caught hold of the reins at the time he was pulling up; I heard a cry before the man was under the horses at all - I could not distinguish from whom it came; the cry was, "Take care of the man!" I rose my head, and saw him under the horses' feet - I heard nothing more before he was run over.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was the coach? A. In the middle of the street, and so was the deceased - I think he was going towards Little Queen-street.</p>

            . I am a boot and shoe maker, and live in Queen-street. I saw the prisoner on the coach-box - he appeared driving at a quick rate, not such as a careful driver should drive at; I did not hear any cry out before this happened - my attention was called to the driver by hearing a carriage going as quick, or quicker, than I ever saw one - I cannot say at how many miles an hour; I saw it go over the body of the man - I then looked after the man, and not the carriage; it kept going on as far as I saw it for about twenty yards - I afterwards saw it had been stopped about forty yards off; I did not see the coachman make the slightest attempt to stop it - I do not think the pace at all slackened, but I did not pay much attention to it; the deceased was taken to a surgeon's - when I saw him he was kicking and plunging about, and in a minute he lay still, and was carried away by the mob.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your shop nearer to, or further from, Lincoln's Inn-fields than where the accident happened? A. Rather farther - it is six houses from where it happened; the Freemasons' tavern is nearer to Drury-lane - my shop is on the opposite side to Great Queen-street; there were a number of carriages at the tavern, waiting for some public meeting - I saw the man step off the curb, and was sure he would be struck down when he stepped off, for he could not escape, the carriage was going so quick; he could not have been above four or five steps from the pavement before he was struck down - I should say he was one-third across; the coach must have come three times the distance he did, in the time - he was not looking towards the coach, or he certainly would not have stepped off the pavement if he had valued his life; his head was inclined the reverse way - I was behind the coach when it happened; I saw the prisoner taken into custody - he offered to take the deceased any where in his master's carriage, but he had then gone to the hospital.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Could any body who happened to be crossing have escaped from the coach? A. They might have escaped with difficulty, but this man was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270056"></xptr>looking - the horses were trotting very fast indeed when I saw them.</p>

            . I am a japanner, and live in New-street, St. James'. I was standing in Queen-street, near the archway of Lincoln's Inn-fields - I heard a voice at some distance say, "Take care," and shortly after I turned my head, and saw the deceased lying upon his face; some person took him up - the coachman pulled up, I conceive, as soon as he possibly could; he might be from ten to fifteen yards from the deceased when he pulled up - I conceive that when two persons ran before the horses he was endeavouring to pull up, but had not completely stopped them, when they got in front and stopped them; I conceive the horses were not going more than seven miles an hour - it is a great thoroughfare, and there was a public meeting that day; I went over to assist the man, but there were so many round him - I mentioned that the carriage was Admiral Owen's, having seen it stand in Piccadilly, before the coachman gave the card; he gave his card when the Police-man came up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know that he heard you tell whose it was? A. No - the horses were on the trot, and I conceive at a family pace; the horses appeared to be frightened after the accident, and I have no doubt forced themselves on - he appeared to do all he could to stop them; I cannot say who said, "Take care" - it was only one voice.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you observed at what rate the carriage went when it came down the street? A. I saw it before the accident; it seemed going at the same pace, and I thought began to slacken a little after it went over the man - as soon as he could he endeavoured to pull up, which was ten or fifteen yards further on.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was in Queen-street, and saw a carriage and horses about thirty yards from the deceased; it was going at about fourteen of sixteen miles an hour - it appeared an alarming pace; I saw the deceased run over; the coachman did not appear to slacken his pace before he was run over, nor attempt to stop his horses at all, till he was stopped by others.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you a judge of horses? A. Yes, I have been accustomed to them a long time; they were black like cattle - they were in a half-headed barouche, and going at a smart trot; I did not hear him call to the deceased.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say the carriage was about thirty paces from the man, how long was it getting to him? A. Not many second - it probably was not a minute; I venture to say it was not half a minute - I call a pace a step.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was fifty or sixty feet off, and half a minute going, at the rate of fourteen miles an hour? A. Yes - he was going at a very smart trot; I was speaking to the deceased about three minutes before, three or four yards from the spot, at the corner of Little Queen-street - he was attempting to cross when I saw the carriage; he was just in the middle of the road when he was knocked down - the horses were about ten yards from him, when he began to cross; when he put his foot on the curb the carriage was about five or six paces from him - I did not tell him not to cross; I was not aware of the danger at first - I have every reason to believe nobody told him to take care.</p>

            , Esq., of Red Lion-square. I have known the prisoner five years; I was in Great Queen-street - I was talking to him at the Freemasons'-tavern, and observed to him that one of his horses was very cold and shivering; I have been subpoenaed on the prisoner's behalf - I saw the hind wheel of the carriage go over the man; before that I heard the coachman call out, "Hoy! take care;" I should think he was going at the rate of seven miles an hour, which appears a quick trot in the street - the street was crowded, on account of the stones laying on one side; the pavement was free for passengers - there was plenty of room to cross where it happened; I was about forty yards behind the coach when it went over the body - I could see he did not whip his horses, for I saw the whip hanging over his left arm; my attention was directed to the deceased - I saw him on the ground; I could not see whether he stopped the horses - I ran up, and saw persons round the horses' heads, about ten yards from where the man was rode over; I do not think it was more - when it happened I saw the horses make a bolt; they went quicker for a time, but I thought the coachman was in the act of pulling up - I could not see; I saw two men hold the deceased up, and went away - his head was four or five feet from the pavement; he was lying across the street, but did not lay right across the street.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What sort of a carriage was this? A. A half-headed barouche; it belongs to Admiral 
               <persName id="t18300527-112-person977">Tolmash</persName>
             - the box was fixed to the body of the carriage, which made it more difficult to pull up; the prisoner had driven off to exercise the horses - they were nearly thorough blood horses - seven miles an hour is a moderate trot for such horses; I am sure I heard the prisoner cry out, "Hoy! take care," and should think the man had time to take care of himself - the horses going faster was entirely their own act; I saw the whip across his arm till he was stopped - another man took possession of his horses; the bystanders would not let him drive the deceased to the hospital - he offered to give himself into custody.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there any luggage on the carriage? A. No, nor any body in it - the people wanted to pull him off the box; the man had time to get away if he saw the carriage - I saw him on the pavement; I saw him come down on the payment, but did not see him cross.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him at all in the road-way, before the carriage ran over him? A. I did not - I did not see him in the road before he was rode over.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how can you tell whether he had power to clear the carriage? A. I cannot say; the road is eight or ten feet wide in that street - the carriage was four or five yards from him, when I saw him on the pavement.</p>

            . I am a medical student. I merely saw the deceased under the horses' feet - I did not go to assist; I saw him trampled on by one of the horses, and to the best of my belief saw one of the wheels go over him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270057"></xptr>- I did not see the horses stopped, and did not see them till after the accident; they were then certainly going at a very fast pace - I thought he did not appear to have the management of his horses.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Theobald's-road. I was in Queen-street - the horses appeared going at a very fast rate; if it was possible to continue at that rate, I think they would go about twelve miles an hour - they were nine or ten yards from the deceased; I saw both the left wheels go over his head - the coach still continued at the same pace, till it was stopped - I cannot be mistaken; some labourers stopped it - the man was taken into a shop, and then to a surgeon's in Lincoln's Inn-fields; I stopped with the carriage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you in the employ of the witness Wilkinson? A. Yes; I had gone out of his shop rather before him, and was seven or eight yards behind the carriage when it happened - I was five or six houses off; I was rather confused, seeing the danger the man was in - the coach was nine or ten yards from him when he began to cross; the carriage was going at a terrible rate - the man might have seen it coming, if he had looked; I did not hear the coachman cry "Hoy! take care;" I was fifteen or sixteen yards off when it went over him - I had come from my master's door in the same direction as the carriage; I was about twenty yards from the door when it passed me - I was walking very fast: I was coming out of the shop, and saw the carriage coming by at a very furious rate, galloping - I swear it was galloping.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Could the prisoner have seen the man crossing? A. Yes, I think he must from the distance.</p>

            . I am a porter. I was in Great Queen-street, and saw the coach - it was going pretty quick, but not very quick; I saw the man knocked down - the coach went on a pretty quick rate, as before, five or six miles an hour - it was not galloping; three laburers stopped him - I cannot say whether the coachman attempted to stop the horses; they went twenty or thirty yards before they stopped - I had a load on my back, and did not see what became of the man; the people round cried out before he was run over - the crying out was not by the coachman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The horses were trotting? A. Yes, they were not galloping at all while I saw them - they kept at a quick pace; I did not observe them bolt.</p>

            . I am porter to a gentleman in Great Queen-street. The first I saw of this was the coachman singing out to the man who was crossing, "Hoy! take care;" this caused me to look round - I was within ten yards of the coach, at my master's shop door; it was going at a smartish high trot, but I cannot tell at what rate; I saw the man knocked down - he was nearer the left side, leading from Lincoln's Inn-fields, than to the right, at the time the coachman sung out - he was knocked down in the middle of the street; the men who were at work stopped the coach twenty or thirty yards further on; I think it went quicker after the accident than before - my eyes were on the deceased - I could not see whether the prisoner struck the horses; I crossed over to my master, Mr. Jowitt, who stood at his door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What you saw was merely accidental? A. I think so - I gave this account before the Coroner and Grand Jury; I imagine that this was an accident - the prisoner called out "Hoy! take care;" I think it was impossible for the man to get out of the way then - he was about two yards from the pavement when the coachman sung out; he could not get across the road- I suppose he could have returned to the pavement, but he was agitated, and might not know what was best.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the coachman, in your hearing, call out to him till it was impossible for him to get out of the way? A. I cannot say; he could not in the direction he took - there were several carriages, but they did not reach up to that spot; they were closer to the tavern a good deal.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. At what distance was the coachman from the man when he called out to him? A. To the best of my belief he was within five yards of him.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I saw the man knocked down - the coach passed me just before; it was going at a sharp trot - I saw the man knocked down; he was three or four paces from the curb - the prisoner tried to stop his horses all he could, but some mason's held their hammers up - I did not see the labourers catch hold of the reins, and do not think they could do so without my seeing them; I cannot say they did not - I ran to assist in stopping the horses, and Mr. Hamilton, who I work for, went to assist the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is Mr. Hamilton? A. A lapidary - he was with me; the carriage passed me by Mrs. Cutmore's, nearly opposite Little Queen-street - the horses did not gallop at all, while I saw them; I never saw the coachman use his whip - the deceased was just stepping off the curb when I saw him, and I just then heard somebody cry "Hoy! take care;" I cannot say whether that was the coachman - if the deceased had drawn back one foot instead of going on, it would not have happened, in my judgment; he had a hat in his hand, and a bag on his shoulder - when the man was knocked down I think the horses plunged, and went on faster; it appeared to me a mere accident.</p>

            , (examined by MR. ADOLPHUS.) Q. Were you examined before the Coroner? A. Yes; I did not go into the Grand Jury room: I am groom to Miss Le Blanc, of Lincoln's Inn-fields; I saw the prisoner in Great Queen-street, eight or ten yards before the accident happened - the horses were going at the rate of six or seven miles an hour, not exceeding seven; they were trotting, and did not gallop till after the accident - I did not see the man crossing; I knew the prisoner when he lived with Lord Melville, but had not seen him for two years; as he drew up towards me, I called to him Jack - he took no notice of me, and after he had passed I heard a voice distinctly call out "Take care;" I cannot say whose voice it was - this drew my attention, and at that moment I saw the man under the horses; they made a plunge afterwards which threw the prisoner back in his attempting to draw them up; I think the carriage went eight or ten yards before it was stopped, but who it was stopped by, I do not know - the prisoner did not use his whip in my presence,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270058"></xptr>either before or after the accident; he appeared to do his best to stop the horses - there was only room for one carriage to pass there, the street being under repair; when I knew the prisoner he was a humane, good tempered man.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You never heard of an accident happening before? A. Never; I heard "Take care" called twice - I did not hear Hoy! I did not know the prisoner's voice - I was not six yards from the carriage when it happened; I was behind it, but could see perfectly well what the prisoner did, it being a half-headed barouche - he threw himself back, pulling with all his might, to draw the horses up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw him do his best to stop the horses - was that after the man was under the horses or before? A. After; the horses plunged when the man was between their legs; no man in the world could stop them.</p>

            . I am a surgeon of St. Bartholomew's-hospital. The deceased was brought there on a Thursday, labouring under three severe wounds on the head, one on the right cheek, and one on the left; he lived till the Wednesday morning - every care was taken of him; he died in the hospital - there was a very extensive fracture of the skull, which I have no doubt caused his death; his intellects were affected for the last two days - there was laceration of the brain; he had his full faculties till the Monday night - he never expressed that he was near death, nor did I tell him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You conversed with him several times? A. Yes; he talked rational till the Monday; when he came in he was perfectly sensible, but faint from the loss of blood - I was engaged attending to his wounds when he said something about the accident; I did not hear it.</p>

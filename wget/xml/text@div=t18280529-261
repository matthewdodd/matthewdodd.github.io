               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Was any other person there on the day of the robbery? A. No - a person worked there, but he was not there then; I do not know that he had not been there while I was out; I saw the trousers at five o'clock when I made my bed - the other man should have come to work at six; I had seen the prisoner working with spectacles the day before, but he did not borrow mine - I had had no quarrel with him; I was not drunk the day before - the prisoner and the other man were; I took up the other man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who is the other man? A. A man named Joiner; I went to his lodging - the prisoner and he worked together; the prisoner did not return to me.</p>

            . I live where Pearson does. On the morning of the 8th of May, at twenty minutes past eight o'clock, I was at my own door - the prisoner passed by me; he stumbled, and his hat fell off - he took it up and put it on; I saw it was full of something - he also seemed bulky round the waist.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it anything unusual for a tailor to take home work? A. His hat was full - he could hardly put it on.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner on Friday evening, and found these spectacles on him - he said he knew nothing of the prosecutor or the property, and was never at the place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find any more than one pair of spectacles on him? A. Yes, a pair which he said was his own; he afterwards acknowledged that these belonged to Mr. Pearson, though at first he said he did not know him, and his name was Wilkinson.(Spectacles produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He allowed me to take the spectacles to work with - I put them into my pocket going out.</p>

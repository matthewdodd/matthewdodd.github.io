            . I am a City officer. On the 20th of August, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners going up Newgate-street; Moore went up the passage of Messrs. Gilman and Lucas, in <placeName id="t18280911-14-crimeloc76">Newgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner MOORE. Q. What time was it? A. About half-past eleven o'clock. I did not see the truss lifted on your back; if I had taken you first, I should have lost the other - I saw nobody else in the passage.</p>

               <p>MILLER's Defence. I was sitting on the rails in Smithfield Market; a gentleman came up, and asked me to carry a parcel for him from No. 42, Newgate-street, to the Goose and Gridiron public-house, St. Paul's, and I was to ask for Mr. Green; I went to No. 42, Newgate-street, but could not see the gentleman; I went to the passage and saw the parcel there, but not the gentleman - I asked two men in the passage for Green; they asked if I had come for a parcel - I said, Yes, and they lifted it on my shoulder - I let my hat fall as I came out, and this young man picked it up, and walked by my side - I never saw him before.</p>

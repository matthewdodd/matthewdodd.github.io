               <p>What did he say to Groves? - He said lay hold of my hands, and young Groves said, O dear! O dear! how came this here, and he said, I am a dying; and young Groves went and fetched Mr. Yates's man, he would have been here, but he is ill, I do not know how the pistol went off, no further than when my head was turned, I saw him moving the wood work; two surgeons were sent for, and Roberts was carried to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Did you see him in the hospital? - Somebody gave orders that I should not see him, I went five times in one day, some people were let in, I was not let in.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to the prisoner when he had the pistol in his hand? - I desired him to lay it down, I told him it was loaded, but I am sure he did not intend to do what he did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was there any priming in it? - I believe there was not, it was blown out in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>The deceased was my journeyman, I saw him after he received this wound, I asked him how the affair first began, he told me he called in at Mrs. Groves's, they asked him to eat some soup, he refused at first, they asked him again and persuaded him, they sent him for a spoon to this Mrs. Smith's, he staid there some time, the prisoner came after him, and said to him, damn you Tom, what are you staying here all this while for, with that he laid hold of a pistol that lay on the table, and said, damn me I will shoot one of you, the woman said, lay it down, it is charged, he said no, it is not charged, there is no priming in it, and says he, damn me I will have a smack at some of you; the person that is the deceased said, he forgave him, and he hoped God Almighty would; I was going to ask some more questions, but the surgeons came in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask him why the witness gave orders that nobody should see the deceased but himself? - I gave no such orders, the surgeons gave such orders, and the sister told me, that nobody was allowed to see him, but me and my man.</p>
               <p>Did the deceased at the time you saw him, think himself a dying man? - The first time I saw him, he said, O my dear master! - I am dying.</p>
               <p>- WOOD sworn.</p>
               <p>I was fellow servant with the deceased, I saw him at the hospital, he was stript, he was sitting upright in his bed, the moment he saw me, he cried out O Wood! Wood! I am a dying man, I asked him how it came, and the surgeons would not let me stay, I went again, and the surgeons interrupted me, and about twenty minutes before he died, I asked him how he was, he said, he was just a dying, I asked him whether the prisoner at the bar did it wilfully or no, he said, he did not think he did, he forgave him, and hoped God would; he could utter no more, and I took my farewell of him, and he was dead in a minute.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. I need not call the surgeon, Gentlemen, it is a very unfortunate accident.</p>

                  </hi> I am accountant to Messrs. Bevington and Sons, of the Neckinger Mills, Southwark—I have been so ten years—Peters was clerk and salesman—his duty was to sell goods to customers and enter them in the day book with the quantity and quality—it was his duty to prepare an invoice and hand it to the delivery clerk, who would have a delivery note made out for it, which would be put into an envelope, and deliver it to the carman with the goods—the customer would be required to sign it when the goods were delivered—there is a weigh-bridge at the entrance of the premises over which all goods sold by weight have to go before they go off the premises—it is necessary for the carman to have a pass note made out by one of the junior clerks—he would get it from the delivery clerk, and the particulars would come from the receipt note—the goods here are skivers, 12 qualities in all—when skivers come from the mills to the warehouse, Peters and the warehouseman have to decide as to the quality to which they are to be put—they range from a high to a low price—after they are sorted they are kept in a warehouse—the prices vary from 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—if a customer came to purchase skins, he would see Peters or Barrett—samples would be shown him, and when he had decided on a purchase, an entry would be made in the counter book, which is supposed to be kept by Barrett, specifying the quantity and quality of the skins, the lot from which they were taken, and the name of the customer—they would go from the counter book into the day book, which was kept by Peters, and the invoices should be made out by the day book and then the receipt note, and the pass would be made out, and the day book would go into the counting-house and be posted in the regular way—the previous stock-taking was on July 1, 1877, and was made by Peters and Barrett—Peters gave the stock by name and I had to post it—it appeared to be correct—early in November I took stock myself, and taking what Peters had told me iu July, I found a deficiency of about 760 dozens of skivers and 80 dozens of roans—I communicated with Peters that I was going to take stock—this was an unusual stock-taking—we only take stock every midsummer—Olpin was allowed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month credit, and on examining his account found it was overdrawn—Olpin was a shaver, that is a man who makes skivers—I knew him in the service, but do not know him personally—on Tuesday, 7th November, he came to the mills and said that he had called to see Mr. Samuel Bevington, and asked why he was stopped having goods—I said "For a man in your position the account is very good, especially as the firm have arranged 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month"—he said "I do not owe you more than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "You certainly do; I am given to understand from Peters that the account is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187802110090"></xptr>
               <p>above 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "Oh, it is admitted I have not had the goods"—I sent a telegram to the office in St. Thomas's Street—Olpin remained, and when I got the answer I told him that the amount standing to his debit was 208<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "Oh, I have not had the goods, come round with me and I will show you the invoices"—I went out with him and went into a barber's shop with him on the way, and Peters came in there, and on leaving I suggested to Peters that he had better go back to the mills; he touched Olpin on the shoulder and drew him aside—they went 30 or 40 yards from me and were talking two or three minutes—Olpin then returned, and said that Peters said to him "Don't let <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> see the invoices" (I am <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>), and that he said to Peters "That game won't suit me"—I went with Olpin to his house in Blue Anchor Road—he produced this file of invoices—I have cast up the amount of them since, and if the amounts represented in them are true, Olpin would owe the firm 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him to let me have them to compare with the ledger—22 of them are in Peters' writing, and the others in Barber, the junior clerk's—I left Olpin's house and went with him to the Star public-house, where the landlord showed me two cheques, one for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and after I left Olpin showed me more cheques—I then went to St. Thomas's Street and made a report to Mr. Bevington, and on the same day, about 5.30, I again went to the Star and found the prisoners there, and heard Olpin say to Peters "If you have done wrong why to hell don't you go to the governor and make a clean breast of it?"—Peters then asked me to see him privately—I went into a private room with him, and he threw himself on a seat and said "Ah, <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>, it is all over now"—I said "If you have done wrong, you had better go to the governor and explain the matter and make a clean breast of it"—he said "I cannot face them, I will write"—this letter is in Peters's writing.</p>

I am one of the principals of this firm—this letter is addressed to the firm—I saw Peters at his house, and had a conversation with him—I had had a long search for him, as father was apprehensive that he would commit suicide—I found him at his house in a depressed state of mind, and under a promise of leniency he made a statement to me, but not a full confession—the letter had been written before I entered the house, and was lying before him—I had not seen him before I went there, or given him a promise of leniency or in<lb></lb>timated that he would be reinstated—I took the letter up and put it in my pocket with his consent—that was after I had made him a promise of leniency—I had had about a quarter of an hour's conversation with him before that.</p>

               <p>am very sorry to inform you that I have been false to you in respect to Olpen's account. The way it has occurred is this: five years ago he began dealing with you, with my father, and about a year ago open an account. The way the accounts have been falsified is this: when Olpen has come in to buy I have made out the invoice and sent it with carman, or given it him, and entered it afterwards different in price in the day book. I never took money from Olpen on your account without paying it in. I have no excuse to offer. I can only say that I am very sorry and ashamed to have abuse your confidence in this manner. I write this now, as my head is so bad, not be able to see you in the morning. Respecting the stock was not correct when it was given under my charge, and was very short when I had it. I leave the rest in your hands to do what you will, us I am entirely to blame."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Continued</hi>). At the close of my conversation with Peters he asked me to go back to the Mills and fetch his overcoat, and when I got there I made a communication to Mr. Bevington, who went out and came back with the coat—Peters afterwards came out with Olpin, saying "Here comes Mr. Samuel Bevington, I'm off"—I called at Peters's house several times after that; I called on the 28th and he handed me these invoices, marked C 1 to 23, and said that he could swear Olpin had had the goods mentioned in them with the exception of two of them—I have compared them and they agree with the day book kept by Peters—I finished stock-taking on 30th November, saw Peters again, and mentioned the deficiency I found—I told him the same as I have told you to-day—he replied that there were about 200 dozen short stock-taking, but he could not account for the rest—he came to the warehouse the next day and looked over the stock, but did not account for the deficiency—I remember 76 dozen of high-limed skins being put into stock after the stock-taking in July, and I could not find any trace of them when I went through the stock in November—I told Peters I could not find them—he said that they had gone to Olpin, and that he had passed an invoice in the name of A. D. Poppleton for five dozen high-limed skivers, for which I have written off the skins that have gone to Olpin at 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—he has entered them to Poppleton at 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I do not know whether 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would be their fair value—Mr. S. Bevington and Peters had priced them, they always did so—this is the assortment book, in which I make up the assortments from information given by Peters—I find here at folio 99 that he told me to price these skins at 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he told me had sent to Olpin at 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and debited them to Poppleton, but that the 56 dozen had not come into stock—I have looked through the books, but find no trace of a sale to Poppleton of 76 dozen high-limed skins in Olpin's writing—I have examined the day book and ledger, and the receipt notes and the pass notes, but the counter book has not been posted—it was Barrett's duty to keep that—I find in the stock book an entry in Peter's writing of 99 dozen skivers being in the possession of Whithard and Crisp—they are bracketed with 664 others, that is to make a total quan<lb></lb>tity in stock—"W. C. and Co." is against these—they got into Messrs. Bevington's hands, because they were to be sold on commission.</p>

               <p>have been to those places—the manufactories are at Worcester, and a warehouse at Thomas Street, Southwark—the entries on these papers are copied from the rough sheets used in the stock-taking—the rough sheets are on the file—I counted the bundles of skins—I assumed that each bundle contained 2 dozen—Orchard and Collins counted them—there were more than 7, 000 or 8, 000 skins to count, about 1, 300 dozens of skivers, and about 1, 100 dozens of roans—it was Peters's special department to take the quantities—Peters's father left about three years back and Peters suc<lb></lb>ceeded him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the sheet in Peters's handwriting showing the stock-taking in July—I find that Mr. Samuel Bevington has initialled the quantity in red ink twice, once for the roans and once for the skivers—he is the buyer for the firm—the first process is fellmongering—they are bought in large quantities in that state every week—about 120 dozens came to Neckinger Mills every week—the skins are more faulty in the summer than the winter—it requires a practical man to detect the qualities of the skins in that stage—we have to sell some at less than cost price in consequence of their being of bad quality—the price varies according to the quality, from 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen in the crust state—the factory is divided into ten departments, two of which are the crust skiver and roan departments—I never checked the stock-taking of Peters's father—I noticed that Peters, in his letter, states that the stock was never right from the time he had it—if that was so then he has returned me a wrong account ever since—we finish the goods at Neckinger Mills—when Olpin came on 27th November he arranged for a credit of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—I suggested that I should telegraph to the ledger-keeper—Olpin acquiesced in that—he offered to take me to the house and show me the invoices—I did not suggest that he had not had credit for the last two payments—I mentioned two cheques of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went and looked at his invoices and found they began in February, 1877—there was only one monthly statement that was rendered by Peters—I cannot say when I asked him whether there was any further payment and he told me that he had paid three cheques since that time—he said they were the cheques of a pub<lb></lb>lican near—I suggested that I should go to the publican to see them, and I did so—I only saw two of the cheques—I asked to see the two cheques for the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not know at that time that they were credited in the ledger—I have found so since by looking at the ledger—on 24th August there is a payment of 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cheque for it, it is stamped as paid through our bankers; that left a balance of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the balance shown in the ledger is 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are statements rendered by Peters; they are receipted by Mr. Pillow, who is a person in the firm—those statements go down to 4th August—I should say they correspond with the ledger—the earliest date is December 5th, 1876—these are statements of goods had from the firm rendered by Peters—Mr. Pillow received the money upon them and receipted them—a balance is shown upon two of them—the word "discount" is in Pillow's writing, the figures are Peters's—the invoices should be made out from the day book, not from the receipt note—the ledger is posted from the day book by the ledger clerk in St. Thomas's Street—these two invoices dated October 30th and November 21st are on the forms of our firm, they are both in Peters's writing—the receipts correspond, but are dated earlier—I have gone through the carman's receipt notes from July 11th and compared them with the invoices.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The terms upon which we dealt with Olpin were a monthly credit, less 2 1/2 discount—goods supplied in one month were to be paid the following month—the ledger clerk would make out the monthly accounts—it was not Peters's duty—if Peters sold goods he would enter the sale in the day book, and that would find its way into the ledger—if the entry in the day book was made at a fraudulent price it would appear as a correct entry in the ledger, and would appear in these statements, and be paid for by the customer—but he would only pay the fraudulent price that was in the day book—the July statement is in Peters's writing—in the ledger Olpin's account appears under consecutive dates, but not in the statements, so that they cannot have been copied from the ledger—it was no part of Peters's duty to render these monthly state<lb></lb>ments—there is no entry in the statement of 11th July—I never took stock myself till November, and that was by the special direction of Messrs. Bevington—Peters and the under-warehouseman Barrett took stock, that is they counted the stock on hand, and Mr. Samuel Beving<lb></lb>ton initialled it—he would take it on trust from the warehouseman—Peters always told me whether the stock was correct or not—on 1st July I found there was a large deficiency—I can't say for how long it may have been wrong.</p>

Bevington, at Neckinger Mills—Peters was the warehouseman, and his father before him—it was part of my duty to assist Peters in assorting the skins, show<lb></lb>ing goods to customers, and delivering to the carmen—I had nothing to do with making entries in the day book, that was Peters's duty—he and Mr. Samuel Bevington fixed the prices at which goods should be sold; I had nothing to do with that—I had a counter book in which I entered the skins that went out of the warehouse—I did not always have that book—I asked for it, the firm did not ask me to keep it—Peters used to ask me for it, and once he kept it for about six months—during that six months it was not made up; I never saw it—when I got it back again Peters told me to make it up from the day book; I did so—when I had not the counter-book I made entries in this pocket-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I made the entries by Peters's direction—this shows the quality or class of goods that went out since January—I made the entries either that day or the next—I had no counter book then—I received directions from Peters as to the class of goods that were to be delivered to Olpin—I recollect the stock being taken in July—I counted the skins in the bundles—I had a man to help me—I gave the numbers to Peters—I asked him</p>

               <p>how the stock came out—he said a few short—I asked him how it was that they were short—he said he had got some at the back of the book to be entered, and that would make them right—the night before he left he told me not to expect to see him any more—I asked why—he said because he might be 100 miles away to-morrow—I have been shown this exhibit marked "I"—the extracts are correct from the pocket-book.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I have been under Peters's orders between six and seven years—I have assisted in every stock-taking during all that time—it will sometimes take a month to take stock at Neckinger Mills—it would usually take two men to count as well as somebody to memo. down the figures—when Peters's father was there I assisted him in the stock-taking—Mr. Samuel Bevington attends to the stock-taking, ticking off the bundles and initialling them—he has before his eyes the goods that have been counted—it is a mere matter of counting—no comparison is made with the previous year—I have not heard Mr. Samuel Bevington say that he was averse to this prosecution—I have not discovered since this prosecution that a large quantity of goods had not been taken into account—there has been no discovery of any alteration in the figures—in selling, the actual skins are shown to the customer, not samples—I don't remember Mr. Samuel Bevington ever selling to Olpin—he is there almost every day and present when Peters is selling—I am not aware that Peters was allowed a discretion to sell at less than the usual price—I think he would ask permission first—he might ask what he liked provided it was above the standard—if skins are found to be faulty the price is reduced—the majority of the skins sold to Olpin were what are called broken or faulty—I have often been with the carman to Olpin's to deliver goods—I never delivered a bundle more to the carman than I was ordered to do, nor has more been delivered at Olpin's than I had orders for.

                  </hi>. I live at 28, Aspinall Road, and was clerk to the late Mr. Roberts, a leatherdresser—I have bought goods from time to time of Olpin, averaging from 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and have receipts for the pay<lb></lb>ments—I am the Mr. Kaisey to whom this letter is addressed—I handed it over to the other side—it was obvious that Mr. Bevington wanted me to give such information as I could, and I was unwilling, because I had known Olpin many years.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I think Mr. Foster called on me three times before he sent the letter, and saw me the third time when he brought the letter—I have known Olpin twenty-five years, he has borne an irre<lb></lb>proachable character—he came round with the letter and summons and took me to the police-court straight—Olpin has been in the habit of coming to my master's three years—the skins he sold were all inferior, from 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. up to 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., none better—he never had any good ones—the highly-limed skins are inferior.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leather-dresser, of 653, Old Kent Road—I did business with Olpin from July, 1876, to February, 1877, to the amount of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week—I believe these receipts to be his writing—they were Bevington and Sons' goods which I bought—I saw their carman deliver them from the van—some of them. I paid 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for, and afterwards got them reduced to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Olpin gave me an intimation that if I made any reduction, he could not supply them, because he only got 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of them—I saw Bevington's carman deliver them every week.</p>

Olpin sued me in the County Court tor 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I did not owe it—he obtained judgment in my absence—the writ was served personally on me—he put the brokers in my house and got the worth of the goods—I owed him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but he sued for a larger amount, and the expenses made 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the fruits of the execution were much more than 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; they were under 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swore at the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coachman, and live at 1, Bromley Cottages, Castle Yard, Richmond—on 16th October, about 2.30 in the day, the deceased came into the bar of the Fox and Duck with John Stocker,—and said, "So help me God, I have killed <hi rend="italic">Bobbie;</hi>" that is the name the prisoner goes by, he asked Pieseley the potman, to go round to help pick him up, I went with him and James Kirkman to Mr. Wench's stable, and there saw the prisoner lying on the stones in the stable with his head on his arm—he looked as if he had been knocked down; I did not see any mark on him—he was lying quite still, I don't know whether he was insensible or not, the potman and Kirkman tried to pick him up—he said "He said get out of the way," which they did—after that Stocker came in and he stepped over him as he was lying and went to the corn bin, he then stepped back over him again and stood against the door post, and the prisoner got up and struck him in the face and knocked him down on his back on the gravel—they picked him up and carried him into the skettle ground of the Fox and Duck and set him on the form there—he was insensible—I saw him next afternoon dead—he was about 45 years of age; he was sober at the time, and the prisoner was sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased was often drunk—he did not say anything about a spreader before I went into the stable—where the prisoner was lying was pretty close to the door, and the deceased was standing in the doorway—the prisoner ran out as he got up, he made a start to go out of the door to run away—I did not see him push the deceased to get by him, he got by directly he struck him and then the deceased fell on the back of his head; the ground slopes down there—I thought the prisoner hit him very hard, I did not see any mark—he fell with his head on the stones—I have known the prisoner nine or ten years, he was always a quiet, peaceable, well conducted man—I have not seen the deceased run after people with a spreader—a spreader is a kind of splinter bar, used to keep the chains from rubbing; the deceased used to go with horses and braw a barge from Wey-bridge—I don't know anything about his temper.</p>

               <p>I left where I was and went across the road; I met the deceased, he asked me to go and help pick <hi rend="italic">Bobbie</hi> up, I did not know who he meant, I ran round with him to Mr. Wench's stable and found the prisoner lying on the ground on his right side, with his head on his right arm; I went to raise his head up, he said "Get away"—I stepped over him and went to the back of his head—the deceased stepped over him in order to get to the corn bin, and in coming back he stepped over him again, and then the prisoner got up and struck a blow with his fist knocking the deceased down on the ground on his back—I and another man picked him up, and took him into the skettle ground and seated him on a form, and I got some warm water and bathed his face—he afterwards walked up to bed, I walked up behind him, he did not speak; he laid down on the bed for an hour and half, he was left alone for that time; I then went up to see him and took off his things and put him to bed—he did not speak, he was unconscious, about 7 o'clock, I went up to him again, he was then asleep—I went up again after 8 o'clock, he was about the same, as if asleep—I left him till nearly 11 o'clock; I then went to bed—I slept in the same room; he seemed a little worse then I think—I spoke to Mrs. French, the landlady, she came and looked at him—we tried to administer a little brandy to him, he did not take it he did not speak at all—I then went to fetch Mr. Wench; both the prisoner and the deceased were in his employ—I afterwards went to Richmond to fetch a surgeon, he was not at home—I went back again to the bedroom; the deceased was still either asleep or unconscious, and a little after 1 o'clock I 'again went for the doctor.</p>

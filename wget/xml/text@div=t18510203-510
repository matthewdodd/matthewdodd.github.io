                  </hi>. I am a messenger of the St. Katharine's Dock Com<lb></lb>pany. On 31st Dec. I was in the office of the "D" warehouse, about half-past ten o'clock—I saw the prisoner—he asked if the officer had got an order for canes for Bacon's cart—he said no, and he had better go and see Davis, the foreman—the prisoner left as if to go there—be had a cart at the back of the warehouse—I can see through loop-holes in the ware-house all over the yard—I was looking through a loop-hole, and I saw the prisoner in the area several times between ten and twelve—the labourers go to lunch at twelve o'clock—I was then looking through a loop-hole—it is part of my duty to see that no men take their lunch in the warehouse—I saw the prisoner's cart backed towards the loop-hole door, which leads from the first-floor into the yard—I had seen the cart further up the yard a few minutes before—the tail of the cart was about four feet from the entrance to the copper vault—there was a ladder from the vault to the level of the area—the door' of the copper vault was locked—if any person wanted copper they had to go to the warehouse-keeper for the key of the vault—I saw the prisoner come in a direction from the area on one side of the cart—he went round to the other side, got into the cart, went to the back-part of it, and trod the straw down—he then got out and drew the horse and cart away—I informed the warehouse-keeper—I had seen the prisoner in the Dock before—to the best of my belief I saw him on 10th Dec, and I saw him on 24th Dec.—he was about the yard with his horse and cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouse-keeper of the "D" warehouse. I was in the office on 31st Dec, Elsam pointed out the pri<lb></lb>soner to me—I went to him and asked what he was in for—he said he was in for canes—he was then at the back of the "D" warehouse, within about ten yards of his cart—I asked him if he had anything in his cart, he said, "No"—I placed my foot on the step of his cart, and asked him to remove the straw in front of his cart, which he did with his feet; he kicked it backwards and forwards—I then requested him to remove the straw which was towards the back-part—he said there was a tail-board to the cart, and he would let that down that I might see—he did so, and I discovered eight ingots of copper, this is one of them—it is part of the cargo of the Bull<lb></lb>finch—they were placed endways in the cart in a row—I am the keeper of the warehouse—they had been in that warehouse—they were imported in July, 1849—we have subsequently examined the vault, and sixty-six ingots are deficient—I have no doubt these are the same as those in the vault—they have the same marks on them, the same brand—there was a greater thickness of straw where the copper was, than in other parts of the cart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is the mark on these ingots? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a foreign brand, 1848, and "H. T. S." underneath it—this is the same mark as is on those in the vault—that is the mark of this particular cargo—I cannot say whether it is the mark of any other cargo—I should think "H. T. S." stands for the shipper's name, or those who took it from the mine—the weight of this one ingot is about 40 lbs., the weight of the eight ingots would be about 300 cwt.—the vault is kept locked—it is only opened by persons who have to go there—the key is kept in my office—I have not the papers of the original assignment of this copper—the loop-holes are about ten or twelve feet high.</p>

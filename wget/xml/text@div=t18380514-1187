                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live in the Minories.

                  </hi>. I live in Peacock-court. On Friday, the 27th of April, about half-past nine o'clock, or twenty minutes to ten, I came up the court, and saw the prisoner on the other side of the scaffolding, stooping—I asked if he had lost any thing—he said no, he wanted a bit of slate paving—I said, "It neither belongs to you nor me; it belongs to Mr. Furnival"—when I returned, I saw him with a piece of slate on his back.</p>

I have known the prisoner about twenty years—he has worked under me six or seven years running—in March last I sold him between twenty and thirty feet of old stone—some of it was similar to what has been produced—I examined them at the Mansion-house, and saw the edges had been cut—those I sold him were larger, and more uneven than these.</p>

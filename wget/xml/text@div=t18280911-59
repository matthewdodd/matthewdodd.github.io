            . I am a baker, and live in Hackney-road; I know the prisoner, but only by this transaction. On the 8th of August, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw him coming up Hackney-road, with a pony walking- I was going down the road; I returned in half an hour, and saw the pony standing at the Durham Arms public-house door; he was inside: I asked the young man at the public-house if it was for sale - I went home; the young man came over, and said it was for sale: I went over, and asked the prisoner what he asked for it - he said six guineas; I asked if he would warrant it quiet in harness; he said Yes, that he had had it twelve months; I asked if he would allow me to put it in the chaise - he said Yes; I did so - it ran away, and kicked the harness all to pieces; I told him I would give no such money for it - he said he would take a little less; I gave him 4l. 10s. for it: I asked his name - he said William Castle, and that he lived at the Rose and Crown public-house, Wimbledon; I gave 5l. and the pony to Mr. Chaplin, for a horse, the same day, because it kicked in harness.</p>
               <p>Q. If it did not suit you, how came you to buy it? A. I bought it, and sent it to Smithfield; it was a mare pony - I also went to Smithfield myself, and gave it, with 5l., to Chaplin; I have seen it since, in the possession of the prosecutor, and have every reason to believe it is the same - it was a black pony, but had no particular mark.</p>

            . I am constable of Wimbledon. I received information from Low, and apprehended the prisoner on Sunday evening, the 31st of August, at Wandsworth; from the description Low gave me I knew him - his name is Frederick Holloway; he lived at the corner of Wickhouse-lane, Wimbledon-common, and used to keep a shop there some time ago, but has not done anything lately, to my knowledge; he lived about a quarter of a mile from the Rose and Crown - I mentioned several things to him which I suspected him of; I told him of this robbery - he said he knew nothing about it; I found six awls, a key, and a knife on him; he is something of a saddler: I have driven the prosecutor's poney, and know the one produced at Bow-street to be the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You did not apprehend me? A. No; I had been searching for him - a young man stopped him at Wandsworth, and fetched me directly.</p>

             re-examined. I generally keep a horse; when a pony of this sort runs away and kicks, it is not worth much; if it had been as he warranted it, I do not think it would be worth more than 6l.; Holloway has been bit in purchasing it.</p>

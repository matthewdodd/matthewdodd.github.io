                  </hi>. I am a coffee-house keeper, living in Church-street, Shoreditch. The prisoner lodged with me for about eighteen months—he came home to my house on Tuesday, the 25th of February—I served him with his tea about four o'clock—I went to bed about eleven o'clock that night, and my wife came shortly afterwards—I am not in the habit of locking my room door, and did not lock it that night—I never lock it, on account of my son coming in in the morning to get the key to open the place—at a quarter before three o'clock on the Wednesday morning the prisoner came to my door, and awoke me by opening the door—he came in with a lighted candle in his left hand—as soon as he got in he closed the door, and rose his hand to me with a blow with a hammer which he had in his hand—before I could get time to speak to him, he struck the blow, which catched me on my head—I held up my hand to save my head—if it had not been for my hand, no doubt it would have caused my death in<lb></lb>stantly.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he in his right senses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never knew any thing to the contrary, not the least symptom of it whatever—he struck my left arm—while he was in the attitude of striking my wife, I was feeling about for him I got hold of the hammer-handle, and struck him on the nose in my own defence—he then immediately seized the candlestick, and began to beat my wife, pulled the clothes all to pieces, and the child fell on the floor—my wife said, "Who is ill-using us in this man<lb></lb>ner?"—I said "Dodds"—he used some words, and immediately made his escape to the door, and ran down stairs—as soon as I could, I made to the window, threw it up, and <hi rend="italic">sung out,</hi> "Murder," and then I fell down</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, R</hi>). On 13th December, when the two Johnsons and Richards were locked up, I went to No. 2 in those cottages—I found the prisoner Williams there—I asked him if he occupied the house—he said he did—I also asked him who the three persons were who had left there with bundles in the morning—he said he did not know that any one had left with a bundle—I left him in charge and searched the house—I found this centre-bit, this large file, seven keys, two small files and a small hand-vice—he said the keys had been there for some time—I went to the station and found Richards wearing two coats, and after he was taken away for the night this coat was found in the cell.</p>

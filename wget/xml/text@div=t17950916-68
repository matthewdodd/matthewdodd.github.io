               <p>I was servant to Mrs Greville about three weeks. My mistress desired me to take these things to pawn, a sheet, a table cloth, and two tea spoons.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160201"></xptr>Q. Who did you pawn them with? -At Mr. Freer's. She bid me pawn them in my own name; I believe the tea spoons were eighteen-pence a piece, and the sheet and table cloth for eleven shillings, or eleven shillings and sixpence, I am not sure which.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life was she in? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. What age are you? - Sixteen.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived with her three weeks, you must know what way of life she is in? - I did not know when I went to her; nobody came after my mistress but one gentleman. She said that when she took her money she would redeem them, which she expected every day, and she had some to take.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you live with before you lived with her? - I lived once in Hungerford-street, with Mr. Sheldon, carpenter and undertaker; Mr. Sheldon's was the only place I ever lived in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She says she came from a place; I had her from her father. Mrs. Robinson, her mother, has known me for some years; her father is a master taylor.</p>
               <p>Jury to Robinson. Where did the prisoner live before these three weeks? -With Mr. Small, Dean-street, Soho, No. 26, a very creditable house, a quiet house.</p>
               <p>Q. Any women live there? - No, one gentleman lived in the second floor.</p>

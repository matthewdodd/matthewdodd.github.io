                  </hi>. I am one of the deputy comptrollers of the Post-office. A Mr. Braden keeps the Post-office receiving house at Smithfield-bars—on 12th Dec. in consequence of something that had trans<lb></lb>pired in that district, I made up a test letter—I placed in it a half sovereign and a sixpence, which I marked, and three postage stamps, which I also marked—I placed them in an envelope, with a medallion head upon it—I also put a marked postage stamp on the letter, and directed it to a fictitious address, "Thomas Cadman, mate on board H. M. S. <hi rend="italic">Lightning</hi>, Portsmouth; if sailed, to be sent to Rio Janeiro"—I fastened the letter with adhesive gum, and gave it to Mr. Cole, with directions what to do with it—if that letter had been posted at half past 11 o'clock on the following day, it ought to have arrived at the General Post-office at half past 12—I was at the Post-office on the 13th, when the half past 12 o'clock collection came from Smithfield-bars; they are accompanied by a letter bill, stating the number of letters—this is the bill that came; thirty-two letters are mentioned—the letter I had given to Cole was not among them; thirty-two letters did arrive—I afterwards proceeded to Mr. Braden's with Cole and Smee—the prisoner was not there, he had gone to his dinner—I sent Cole for him, and he shortly returned with him—Cole said to me, in the prisoner's presence, "I have found your stamps, Sir, in his plate"—he produced these four stamps, which are the same that I had put in and on the letter on the previous day—I said to the prisoner, "These are my stamps, where did you get them from?"—he said, "I found them on the floor when I was sweep<lb></lb>ing the shop"—I asked him at what time—he said, "At 8 o'clock this morning "—I told him the letter was not posted till half past 11 o'clock, and desired the officer to search him—Mr. Cole had previously produced twenty-six sovereigns—I saw Smee take some money from him—I cannot say how much, but there was some silver and gold, and I identified amongst it the half sovereign and the sixpence that I had placed in the letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter carriers at the General Post-office. On 12th Dec. Mr. Sculthorpe gave me a letter to post—I kept it in my possession till 25 minutes to 12 o'clock on the 13th, when I posted it at Mr. Braden's, at Smithfield-bars, by dropping it into the letter box—Mr. Braden keeps a receiving house—I returned to the Post-office, and was there when the 12 o'clock collection came from Smithfield-bars—I received the bag from the carrier, and took it to Mr. Sculthorpe—after it had been opened I went to Mr. Braden's, with Mr. Sculthorpe and Smee—the pri<lb></lb>soner had gone to his dinner—I went to No. 9, Greenhill's-rents, which is about 100 yards off, and found him in the kitchen, seated by a table with a cloth on it, and a plate and knife and fork, and he was smoking a pipe; there was a fire about two yards from him on his right—after questioning him as to his name, I noticed that there were five postage stamps in the plate before him—I examined them, and recognized three of them as the stamps that had been enclosed in the letter, and one that had been placed outside it; it had been torn from the letter, and part of the letter was</p>

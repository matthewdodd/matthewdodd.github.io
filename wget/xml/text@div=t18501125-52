About half-past seven, on this Wednesday evening, I went to the Ship, and saw a smallish man, whom I first supposed to be a boy, standing on the pavement—the prisoner directly came out, and struck the man on the left side of the head—that blow appeared to deprive the man of sense, and he fell, and he never moved afterwards—the prisoner lifted him up again by the front of his clothes, and struck him a second time, I cannot exactly say where, but I think it must have been on the head—he then seemed to let go of him, and he fell again—the prisoner directly went into the Ship, and Hart came and picked the man up.</p>

I knew the prisoner by his coming to the rooms to dine-shortly after I knew him he made proposals of marriage to me—he said he had been in the army, at Malta—he had at that time mustachios, and bad the appearance of a military man—I then lost sight of him for some time—I saw him again at the dining-rooms in June, 1848—he told me he had been in Spain, in the Spanish army—he had no mustachios then—he again made proposals of marrying me—he bought a wedding-ring and showed it me—we were to be married in a day or two afterwards—I received this letter from him, with a duplicate in it—I took the duplicate to the pawnbroker and got a ring out—(<hi rend="italic">This letter requested the witness to redeem the ring, which he had got for a debt from Mr. Howell, of Cambridge, and requested her to accept it as a present</hi>)—I paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of my own pocket, and took the ring out of pawn—the prisoner afterwards took that ring as a pattern to get the wedding-ring of the same size—I never got it back—on 30th June, 1848, I saw him; I had then a watch and chain, worth 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had been eight years employed as waitress, and had saved some money—he asked me to lend him the watch and chain for a few hours, to go to a dinner-party with those gentlemen with whom he was thinking of taking a situation in the Bank—he promised to return it to me again at six o'clock that evening—at the time be took it we were in a cab—he had not asked me to lend it him before—he took it from off my neck—I then left him—I saw him again at ten o'clock the same evening—he then had the chain round his neck, the watch in his waistcoat-pocket, and the ring on his finger—I asked him for them—he said, "Don't make a bother, you shall have them presently"—I saw him again at eleven o'clock—he had not got them then—he said he had left them at a friend's, up the street, in safety till the morning, because he thought there was a woman who was following him, and wanted to rob him—I did not see him any more till 20th Aug. this year, when I met him accidentally in the street—I asked him for the watch and chain—he said he had pawned them at Vaughan's, in the Strand, on 13th July—when I knew him before, he went by the name of George Fitzroy Campbell—this is my watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

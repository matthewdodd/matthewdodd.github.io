                  </hi>. I am a beer shop keeper, and live in Bethnal Green. On the afternoon of 21st Aug. the prisoner came, and asked for half a pint of porter, and she tendered me this Prince of Wales's medal—I said to her, "It is a great pity you have not some better way of getting your living than robbing poor people"—she said that she did not know what it was, and she took it in have Street—I said, "The sooner you are off the better."</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of the last witness. I heard him order the prisoner to go away—she left, and I watched her—she went down Hope Town, and stayed ten minutes pr a quarter of an hour—she then got with another person, and went down Church Street, and into Shoreditch, and she stopped, and went into the Chequers beer shop—I then saw her standing at Mr. Young's window, and I stopped and saw her go in—when she came out I went in, and spoke to the young man—the person I saw the prisoner with was Carmody, who was taken, but discharged.</p>

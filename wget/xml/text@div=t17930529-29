I told her I did not want one; she said she was in great distress, and that she had not had any victuals to eat since the day before; I asked her how she came so distressed? she told me she had been bad of a fever near on three months; I told her as she was so distressed, I did not want a cloak, I would let her have some victuals, and if I heard any body wanted it I would let her know; in about an hour and a half she came again and asked if I had heard of any body? and I told her no; then she begged me to buy it; accordingly I did buy it; I gave her four shillings for the duplicate, to the best of my recollection there was a shawl and a cloak, they were pawned at Mr. Kendall's Brick-lane; I sent for them, and they were brought to me; the officer has got them now.</p>

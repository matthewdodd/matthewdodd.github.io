             and another came into my master's shop on Monday morning last, between 9 and 10 o'clock, he asked for some patterns of thicksets, they are for making of small clothes, which I desired the porter to give him while I waited on other customers. The porter's name is John, I forget his other name; during the time he was there, I observed him turn his face to the window, presently I asked the porter what became of the piece of Florentine, as I had but just come into the shop, he made a reply and said, he did not know any thing of it; I then looked on the counter, expecting some person might have put it there, and have taken it out of the window. I then looked out at the door, and saw the florentine under Davenport's coat, standing near to the door; I then turned over the counter for the purpose of cutting Davenport's patterns of thickset. The porter had a suspicion, and called Mr. Burbidge forward; Davenport dropped the Florentine from his coat, I saw him, I saw it fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The porter is not here. - He is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons who were in the service of Mr. Burbidge? - None, except a customer who came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this piece of Florentine rolled up tight or loose? - Rolled up as we usually keep them doubled back, to shew the quality in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - I have seen the prisoner before in the shop as a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. The porter on some observations of his own, called his master? - He did.</p>
               <p>- WARREN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a beadle of the ward, I produce the goods, I received it of Mr. Burbidge, it is called Florentine, I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Court to Burbidge. At the request of the porter you went into the shop? - I did; when I came into the shop close by the prisoner, he dropped the silk close by me, I saw him, I gave it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was in the shop or no? - I do, I did not see it at the window myself that day, but I saw the vacancy.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say you had not sold it. - That piece I am sure we had not. (Deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was Mr. Chaplin at home that day? - He was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes things are taken out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150062"></xptr>to shew the customers? - Occasionally things are taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. You said very fairly you could not take on you to say from your own knowledge, that it was there that day? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Davison. I began to put them in about seven o'clock that day, and it was between seven and eight that I was finished, I put this piece in between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had occasion to go into this shop; on Monday last, about ten o'clock, there was a person either at the time, or immediately after, came into the shop; the shopman told the porter to serve me with what I wanted, and he would serve the other customer: the shopman immediately goes round the counter, and says to the potter, what is become of the piece of Florentine there? The porter says I have not seen it since, I laid it on the counter this morning, he immediately went out to the door and looked, he came in directly again, and as I comprehended the circumstance, he sent for Mr. Burbidge, and when he came into the shop, a piece of Florentine fell down from behind the door.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eleven witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>

On the 7th of May, about half-past ten o'clock at night, the prisoners and another soldier were in my front parlour; the bell rang - I came up, and my niece said, in their presence, that the soldiers had stolen some beef from the larder, and she had sent for the watchman - House had gone; they fought the watchman very much; he could not secure them - I sent for a file of men, and they were taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WILLIAMS. Q. Have you ever seen Ashton at the house before? A. I do not recollect him; the other soldier behaved pretty well, and was dismissed - House was brought back in about a minute - Ashton was rather in liquor; the skewer was stuck in the beef; they called for beer, which they did not drink.</p>

            . I am waiter at this house. I did not see the soldiers come in - Coventry rang the bell - I ran up, and saw her pulling Ashton back from the door - I kept the door fast; she bolted it, and I rang for master, who sent me for the watchman - I went out, and saw House about a hundred yards off, packing up a bundle - I collared him, and called the watchman.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Element; three soldiers came in together, and called for beer; the beef was then in the room, in the show-larder - Ashton took it, and gave it to House, who went out with it - I was in the bar, behind a curtain; the meat was brought back with House, and my uncle gave it to the prisoners at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is the larder from the bar? A. Two or three yards - Ashton was tipsy; he remained behind with the third man, who offered to pay for the beef; the skewer was stuck quite in, but could be seen.</p>

               <p>THOMAS FARNSWORTH sworn. - I am a cooper: I detected the prisoner with the property, at the door of Mr. White's cooperage, he had it concealed in his breeches; I slopped him, and James Seys took it from him; it was a bag with holes in it, and some of the rivets fell out; he said it was the first time, and begged I would not publish it to his master.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You did not promise him any favour? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>JAMES SEYS sworn. - I am a cooper: I took this property from the prisoner; I have had it from that time to this. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You cannot undertake to swear to these rivets? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them? - A. Three shillings; there are six pounds of them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you any rivets of that sort in your shop? - A. Yes; here is a sample that I took out of the bag afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you missed any? - A. Yes; I can positively swear to a quantity being missing out of the bag, because it was a fresh bag.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you believe them to be your's? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Farnsworth.) Q. Where was the prisoner when you detected him? - A. I saw him come out of the shop, when I stopped him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To White.) Q. The prisoner is a cooper himself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, therefore, if he was doing a job for himself, these things were necessary for him to use? - A. No, it was impossible.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I must leave it to the mercy of the Court; it is the first offence I ever committed in my life-time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who had known him twenty-five or twenty-six years, and gave him a good character. <rs id="t17981205-33-verdict184" type="verdictDescription">

            . The prisoner was my servant; there had been several things missing; I had no suspicion of the prisoner till I was told by one of the servants, that she had a person come to her of a morning, that took things from her; in consequence of that I went into her room; I saw in a bundle of her wearing apparel a body of a chemise; on the Saturday morning I was led to suppose that this woman would come again; under these circumstances I was up before the servants were; she did not come. Mr. Debatt in the course of the morning forbid her going behind the counter, which she had been in the habit of doing; she said she would not stay without she did; I was up stairs; she came up and said I shall leave you this evening; I made no answer; about ten in the evening she came down, she said she had done what she had to do and was going; she asked if I would wish to see her clothes; I said most assuredly I should; she then went up stairs and brought her clothes down in a bundle; I opened the bundle on the table; she asked me if there was any thing that belonged to me; I said there was not what I expected to see; I said I want to see the body of a chemise, and I think you are making it of one of my sheets, I saw it last night; she said no, I could not see them last night for they were gone to Lambeth to be made; she refused to turn out her pockets; I sent for an officer, and while the officer was coming she began to unpin her things from under her gown; when the officer came she dropped the things; there were this body of a chemise and the remainder of the sheet; on comparing the two together I am sure it was my sheet; it was marked D. at the top, I. and E; it is worth five shillings.</p>

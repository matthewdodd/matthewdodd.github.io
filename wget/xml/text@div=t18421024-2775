On Saturday, the 10th of September, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and asked if her mangling was done—I asked what it was, were they in a coloured handkerchief?—she said, "Yes"—I said there were five pieces—she said, "Yes"—I said they were 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which she gave me, thanked me, and said I should have more on Monday—I had a candle in each window—I could not distinguish her face at the door—I was not aware that I had given the things to the wrong person till Mrs. Lunn sent her son for them on Sunday morning—it was a strange bundle, I had forgotten who delivered it, and took it for granted that the prisoner came for that bundle—I had several bundles in the house.</p>

            . Q. Do you live in this house - A. Yes, on the ground floor; a young woman of the name of Hamilton lives up stairs; there are but two rooms in the house. This gentleman came in about eleven o'clock and went up stairs to Mrs. Hamilton.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay there - A. I saw him again in the afternoon, he was enquiring for somebody; the young woman came down and he went up again; I hardly knew him; I saw the woman while he was there, coming down backwards and forwards of her errands.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she was not laying in bed - A I do not know, I was not in the room, I mind my own affairs, I do not mind what any body does in the house or in the court. When Mr. Kemp came down he asked us to drink three times before the porter was finished, then he asked us to have a drop of rum; he gave me a shilling, he told me to get it good, because what he had been drinking all day was shocking stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober - A. I do not know. When I came in with the rum, the prisoner said this gentleman has got only sixpence in his pocket; she said she was sick, and went out; the gentleman as he was going out, said what am I to do, if I give you something, I must change a note; I said, sir, I can get you change; he put his hand in his pocket and said I am robbed; I said put your watch in your pocket and your hat on; I locked my door and ran after her; I said this gentleman says he has been robbed; she ran down the steps and I after her, she said you heard me say he had got but sixpence; she said she had no money, she would not come back for any body; a person came up to me and said you must go home, your door is broke open. I then returned home.</p>

I was told that a gentleman was robbed of forty pounds at a house in Bell court; I went there, I found Mr. Kemp standing at the door, he said, I was robbed in that room; he begged me to break the door open; I examined the room, I found nothing; Bet Hamilton stood on the foot of the stairs; when I moved her she went out.

            . I am a constable. I was in Coleman-street between ten and eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner and another person - I suspected, and followed them through White Rose-court into Basinghall-street, they went towards London-wall - I missed the prisoner for a short time, and his companion was standing opposite the prosecutors' - when he moved I saw the prisoner with the cloth on his shoulder about ten yards from the prosecutor's door; I could not see him come out of the door as the street turns there; I let him walk on, the other crossed over to him, and I caught hold of both - the prisoner threw the cloth down: the other man said, "You don't want me, Sir, let me go;" he struck me in the face, and got away; I kept hold of the prisoner, got assistance, and took him before the Alderman; Mr. Jardine got there almost as soon as I, and claimed it.</p>

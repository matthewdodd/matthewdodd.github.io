                  </hi>. I live 3, Prince's-street, Fitzroy-square. I knew the deceased, Ann Pullen—she was about fourteen and a half years old—the pri<lb></lb>soner was her mother—she occupied a second-floor back room in my house—on 24th Nov., about eleven o'clock at night, as I had just retired to rest, I heard a knocking outside my bed-room door, and a voice said, "Do get up!"—on opening the door, the prisoner entered the room with a light in her hand, and said, in a state of great agitation, "Ann is dead, what shall I do, what shall I do; do come up"—I immediately put on my things, and fol<lb></lb>lowed her to her room—I there saw the child lying on her back upon the floor dead—I saw a rope lying on the bed—it was a French bedstead—the prisoner said, "What is to be done? I know not what to do; something must be done!"—I said, "We had better send for a doctor"—she said, "What is the use of sending for a doctor, as she is dead; it is only a needless expense," or words to that effect—I felt that her pulse had ceased, and she was quite cold—the prisoner then said, "I left her early in the morn<lb></lb>ing, with directions to mend a pair of stays and a pair of stockings, which she had neglected to do; I then went out to my work, and on returning, at half-past eleven in the forenoon, I found nothing had been done, and on asking the reason why it had not been done, the girl said she had sat down, and gone to sleep; I said I am determined you shall not sit down and sleep, for you shall stand and do your work, for I will tie you to the bedpost, and you shall have nothing but dry bread to eat until it is done"—she then said, "I took a rope, and put it round and round her neck, and then round the head-post of the bed, and made it fast to the foot-post;" and she said, "I put a chair near her, with her work on the chair, and went out to my work, lock<lb></lb>ing the door and putting the key under the mat; on returning at night, about half-past ten, I found her in a stooping position, dead"—I then said, "This is a very serious case, and there must be an inquest held; the death must be registered, and, as there was no witness to the death, a doctor's cer<lb></lb>tificate will be required"—I forgot to state that she said, "I tied the rope to the foot-post slack, but not so slack as she might get her chin through"—she said she did that in order to keep her from sitting down to so to sleep.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SNOW</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know at what time the pri<lb></lb>soner came in that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not—she said about half-past ten—a young woman, an acquaintance of hers, out of place, had been living in the same room with her about three weeks—I did not then know that that young woman was in the habit of going' out for a night or two at a time, I have since understood so—I thought it my duty to make this matter known, and called in Mr. Derbyshire—the prisoner described the matter to him, as she had done to me, and I gave information to the Coroner's beadle—she re<lb></lb>peatedly said, in the course of her intemew with me, "What to do I know not, something must be done"—I alterwards asked her if she was satisfied with what I had done?—she said, "Quite satisfied; I knew not what to do,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184812180039"></xptr>
               <p>and I knew you would do what was right; I have done it, and I must abide the consequences"—the child's arms were lyitug down by her side—I have had no opportunity of observing the prisoner's conduct toward the child—she is a strictly honest and industrious woman—she had lived in my house above six years—I noticed one instance of this girl's conduct more than twelve months since—she secreted herself in the water-closet—I wanted to go in—she would not open the door or answer—I was at last obliged to get a chisel and mallet, and forcibly open it, and she was inside all the time; and that, connected with what 1 had heard about her, made me conclude she was a perverse and stubborn girl.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodged with the prisoner at 3, Prince's-street—I was there on Thursday morning, 23rd Nov.—I did not return that night, and was not there on the Friday—I beard the prisoner tell the child on the Thursday that she should have nothing to eat until she had done her work—I saw the prisoner on the Saturday night—she then told me the child was dead, and said if I had gone home it might not have happened—I was in the habit of returning at night—I have staid out on one or two occasions—she told me she had tied the child to the bedpost by the neck, for not doing her work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you tell the prisoner that you were not going to return that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—she behaved very kindly towards the child while I was with her—the child was rather perverse at times—I do not know whether she had any food on the Thursday morning—the prisoner was very industrious—she generally went out at six o'clock in the morning, and sometimes did not return till eleven at night—she sometimes returned in the middle of the day—when I returned I used to find the room-door locked, and the key either left down stairs or put-under the mat—the prisoner told me she had put the key under the mat on this night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons. I was called in on Friday night to see the child—I found a deep discoloured inden<lb></lb>tation, extending across the middle of the neck right round from one side to the other—a rope tied tight round the neck, or with the pressure upon it before death, would have caused such a mark—I attribute the death to suffo<lb></lb>cation by strangulation with the rope—if the rope had been tied round her neck and fastened to a bed-post, and she had sunk from exhaustion and so been strangled, that would have produced the marks I found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Could you tell from the appearance of the body how long she had been dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; for I did not examine it for three days after—I found very little food in the stomach—I could not tell what it was—it was digested food, like gruel—there were no marks of violence upon the body—the indentation on the neck was deeper on the right side than on the front—I do not think it could have been produced after death—Betts' Medical Jurisprudence is a work of great authority on the subjects on which it treats—the appearances of persons suffocated are very various—the arteries and vessels of the brain are generally congested, and the brain itself presents a number of small red spots when cut into, apparently resembling extrava<lb></lb>sation—I examined the brain; it was not so highly congested as I should have expected from my reading—my experience is not so great as to enable me to make frequent comparisons—it is not usual to find so large an amount of congestion in the brain of a person not dying from suffocation—the lungs of a person dying from suffocation are generally full of blood and dark-coloured fluid, and the body of the lungs filled with air from rupture of the</p>

               <p>air-cells—I examined the heart; the right ventricle and right auricle were full of fluid and dark-coloured blood—if a rope is placed round the neck of a person not very tightly, it is likely to produce a tendency to apoplexy—drowsiness is one symptom of apoplexy—it is difficult to say how long a girl of this age could remain in an upright position without exhaustion—it would depend very much on her previous habits—some are soon exhausted—I should say a girl of a hardy constitution might continue five or six hours without sinking.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you say whether what you found in the stomach was gruel or digested food? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot, but it had every appear<lb></lb>ance of digested food—I cannot say when it was taken—the body presented all the symptoms of a person who had died of suffocation; every organ was healthy except the brain and lungs—the prisoner made a statement in my presence as to what she did with the child—it exactly corresponds with what Mr. Longman has stated.</p>

            . I am a constable in the City of London. On Friday the 25th of October I saw the prisoners in America-square. they went up Vine-street, into John-street, into the Minories; I called my brother officer, I said John, here is something not right. In the Minories I shewed my authority, and said to Hoblan, what have you got here. I touched him upon the stomach. I found something hard; my brother officer came up, I said, Jack, take care of this man, I gave him charge of Plaston: I had hold of Hoblan, we took the two prisoners up the Minories into Whitechapel, to a wine-vaults, I untied Hoblan's apron, out dropped five pieces of wood. On searching farther I found nineteen brass breast plates belonging to different regiments of volunteers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Plaston searched - A. I did, on him was found thirty-one breast-plates.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say - A. For God's sake do not hurt us, you may do away with it, Plaston said he had a wife that had been bed-ridden for nine months; Hoblan said, for God's sake do not hurt us, we can settle it. I kept the property in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am a city officer. On this night week, about half past five in the evening, I saw the prisoners in America-square, I was with Hodson, by their shifting their hand I immediately suspected they had got something; the moment I laid hold of Plaston, he said, I will tell you the truth if you will let me go; I said, I do not know what you mean, I have not accused you of any thing. I put my hand to his pocket, I felt something that appeared to be brass. We brought them to the wine-vaults in Whitechapel. In his two waistcoat and breeches pocket, I took out thirty-one brass breast-plates. Hudson searched the other going along. Plaston begged for mercy, he had never done such a thing in his life.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Bellis. Are they what you call breastplates - A. Yes, they are brass breast-plates, they appear to be part of the ordnance stores of his Majesty; we had a good many in the tower; they are worth about four shillings.</p>
               <p>Plaston's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, I have a poor wife that has been laying bed-ridden a long time.</p>
               <p>Hoblan said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Plaston called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Hoblan called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Black Bull, in Holborn, which is kept by Mr. John Edwards. On 18th April the prisoner came and asked if I had any parcels for Mr. Tucker—(I had seen the prisoner before; we book parcels for Mr. Tucker)—I told him we had not—he went away, and came again, later in the day—he again asked if we had a parcel—we had one then, and the prisoner said he was in Mr. Tucker's employ, and he would take it—I gave him the parcel—it contained tea, and sugar, and grocery—I do not know what weight it was; I merely lifted it from the floor to the counter—he came on 19th April again, and asked if I had a parcel for Mr. Tucker—I had a portmanteau, and I believe it contained a new coat—I gave it him, because I believed he was Mr. Tucker's servant—I had seen him come with Mr. Tucker's man before.</p>

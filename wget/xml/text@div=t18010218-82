On the Monday morning following he came to my house again; I had given directions for Newman and Kinchin, two officers, to be in the house every morning till he came again; the prisoner then offered me another bad shilling, and I gave them charge of him; he threw something in the fire; I first took out a seven-shilling piece with the fire tongs, and then three shillings and a six-pence; I gave them to Newman; they appeared to me to be bad ones; I also gave him the shilling which I had put into the glass wrapped up in a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not received a guinea from my wife, and was I not to spend three guineas more in your house? - A. There came some people to my house and left a guinea, and they agreed, if I would make it up, to spend three guineas more; they have been tempting me with money all this week.</p>

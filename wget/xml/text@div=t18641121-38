                  </hi>. I am a stonemason, of 10, Canal-road, Shoreditch—on Saturday night, 15th October, about half-past 6, I was coming along the Kings-land-road—the female prisoner came and walked by the side of me for a bit—she then bobbed in front of me, and some one struck me from behind, and I was knocked down—I then saw the two prisoners standing over me, holding me down—one of them gave me a kick in the side, and I felt one of their hands in my right-hand trousers pocket—I am not able to say whose hand it was—as soon as they let me go I got up—the male prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186411210035"></xptr>
               <p>went away, and I saw the female running down Mansfield-street—I missed 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my right-hand trousers pocket—I ran after the female and caught her—she asked me what the man had done to me—I told her I would tell her presently—there was no policeman there—she turned and went back again, and I followed her down the Kingsland-road again—she then called out some name, and the male prisoner crossed the road to her—they went off together—I followed them—we got very near to the Woolpack public-house, when they turned round and saw me following them about one hundred yards off—they then ran down Thomas-street—I ran after them—the male prisoner turned round and showed fight, and the female caught hold of my coat, and then other women came up—the male prisoner then struck me in the chest and got away again while the women held me—that was just under the new railway arch—I got away from her and chased the male prisoner again—he was stopped by a man at the top of the street—he gave him over to me—there was no constable there—the female prisoner and more women came up and caught hold of me again, and the male prisoner went down on his hands and knees, and begged and prayed me to let him go, and he would make it up again—the women pulled me away, and he got away again—I went after him again along the Kingsland-road, and took him to the station myself—the female prisoner and two or three others followed, trying to get him away—I told the police<lb></lb>man at the station about the female, and he went out and took her into custody—I was quite sober—I am sure the prisoners are the two persons who rifled my pockets when I was down—it was only half-past 6 in the evening, and I could see them plainly—it was getting dark.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean to say it was not dark at half-past 6 on 15th October? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not quite dark—I said at the Police-court that the male prisoner fell down on his knees, and begged me to let him go—he got away from me three times—there are archways all along the Kingsland-road—the woman did not speak to me; she might have mumbled something, but she never spoke directly to me, that I am aware of—I was not in her company at all—I did not go under an archway with her—she did not charge me with not paying her some money—I did not walk two yards with her—that I swear—I had come by the railway from Leytonstone, and was walking along with my hands in my pockets—I had one hand on the money at the time—I was not stunned—I could not see the male prisoner when I got up—it was some name the female called out—I was about twenty yards behind her then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potman at a public-house in the Kingsland-road—on Saturday, 15th October, about 7, I was coming down Thomas-street—I heard voices near the railway arch, and walked down towards them—I saw the prisoners there, and saw the male prisoner strike the prosecutor in the chest and run away—he was stopped at the top of the street by a man—the female prisoner ran behind him—the prosecutor was surrounded again at the top of the street—the male prisoner stopped there a minute, and said to the prosecutor, "Let us go in and have some beer, and we will make it up"—the prosecutor said, No, he would not—he had hold of the prisoner by the collar, and he said, "Leave go of my collar, I can</p>

               <p>walk"—as soon as he left go he ran again—we ran after him, and then the female laid hold of the prosecutor by his collar, and the man ran again—we followed, and took him again—he said he could walk to the station, for he did not know what he had done to be taken up like that—I then heard the prosecutor say, "You have taken 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my pocket"—the female followed us to the station and stayed outside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the prosecutor knocked down to the ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I never saw him fall—I can't say whether the voices I heard were female voices, there were so many there—I heard the prosecutor say he had been robbed, at that time, after he was struck by the male prisoner—I am quite sure of that—I did not hear the female charge the prosecutor with anything—she said she did not know the male prisoner, and was never in his company—it was about a yard from the archway where I saw the prosecutor struck.</p>

On the evening of 15th October, the male prisoner was given into my charge at the station door by the prosecutor—I afterwards went outside and took the female—I told her the charge, and she said she knew nothing about the money; it was a shame that the prosecutor should knock the prisoner about as he had—2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on her, and five penny worth of coppers on the man.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: On the 9th of August I was upon duty on the quays; I say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170037"></xptr>the prisoner and several more suspicious persons about the quays; I watched the prisoner, I saw him and another put their backs against the warehouse, and their feet against the hogshead of sugar, and shove it in with their feet; I saw them haul the cross-bar, which secures the head of the hogshead, away, I cannot say which of them it was; I then saw the prisoner step on one side for a few seconds, and he then brought an apron and spread it down by the hogshead, and began to scrape the sugar out with his left-hand as he leaned over the hogshead, to prevent any body seeing what he was about; I then thought proper to take him into custody; when I was coming towards him, he had quitted the hogshead and was coming towards me, I laid hold of him, and he attempted to rescue himself from me, by which means I tore his shirt and smock frock, which he had on at the time; I then took him into the warehouse, tied his hands, and took him to the Compter; I desired Davey to take the apron up, which he did, and came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose sugar it was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It could not be easily ascertained, I suppose? - A. No; there were a number of hogsheads about at the same time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going along Freshwharf, and the officer laid hold of me, tied my hands and took me to the Compter, they searched me, but I had no sugar upon me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

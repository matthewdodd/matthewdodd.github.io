               <p>Q. You are sworn to speak the truth - do you mean to say you did not see the prisoner do anything? A. No, not till I saw him take the necklace off, and then the child turned round - I did not see him take it off - I did not see him unclasp it; I saw it in his right hand, and had seen it on the child's neck five minutes before; he put it into his waistcoat pocket - I walked after him, and when he crossed the new street he turned round, saw me looking round, and put it into his right-hand waistcoat pocket, and began to run- I run after him; finding I could not catch him, I touched a gentleman on the back - he followed, and stopped him, he dropped the necklace in the gutter - I did not see it dropped - a young woman behind saw it; I did not see him stopped, but I saw him in custody about five minutes after. I know nothing of his friends.</p>

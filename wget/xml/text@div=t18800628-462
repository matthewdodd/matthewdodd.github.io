I am the prosecutor's son, and was in the shop when the prisoner came in and ordered the pail and bath, which he said were to be sent to 27, Ravensdon Street—I took them there, but they would not take them in, and I came away—at the bottom of the street I saw the prisoner, who said, "Have you been to take the things?"—I said, "Yes, Sir"—he said, "What number have you taken them to?"—I said, "No. 27,"—he said, "I told von No. 17; what about the change?" and held out his hand—I had the change in my pocket—my father came up and said, "What about these goods?"—he said, "They are to go to No. 17"—father asked him to go with him, and he would not—I saw the prisoner given in custody.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was on my way home, and saw a very respectable person standing on the step of the house. I asked her my way, and she asked me to oblige her by giving an order at the oil shop. I did so, and I gave the name as Thomas or Thompson. Half an hour after that I met the lad going back with the goods, who said, "They were not ordered at No. 27." I said, "It was No. 17." He said he had not been there. The father said "I shall not go to 17, I shall stick to you," and gave me in custody. How could I ask him for the change? He would naturally want the sovereign, and I had no sovereign to offer him.</p>

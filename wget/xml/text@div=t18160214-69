In the evening of the 26th of December, we locked up the house perfectly safe, and went to the play. On our return home at about eleven, I found the door fast as I had left it; but on opening it with my key, I discovered that the shop door was open, which I had left fastened, and all the property mentioned in the indictment was gone. In consequence of this, we gave information at St. Clement's watchhouse; I have seen about half my property again.</p>

            . I live at No. 1, Stonecutter-street, Fleet-market. I have known the prisoner at the bar about twenty months. On the 26th December, he came to my house, at a quarter before eight at night; there was a person of the name of Harling in my shop; the prisoner came there to leave a bundle, which contained ten pairs of sheets. That property will be produced in Court. He left it until the morning following; we drank some gin together; I gave him leave to leave them until the next morning. I did not see him at my shop the next day. The things were taken away to be produced.</p>

            . I live in St. John-street, and am a constable. On the night of the 6th of March, a little before seven o'clock, I was sent for, and went on the roof of <placeName id="t18270405-197-crimeloc1086">St. Sepulchre's work-house</placeName>

I then went up on the roof, and took him; Mr. Palmer got a ladder, and we got the prisoner down; there had been three rows of bricks on one side of the lead - they were taken up, and placed on the tiles of a shed; the lead was pulled up, but not cut off - the tiles were pulled up on one side, and the bricks on the other; the lead was not separated, only ripped up; I did not see that any part of it was gone; a little hammering would have put it down as it was before.</p>

            . I am master of St. Sepulchre's workhouse. On the night of the 6th of March I was on the roof; I had given notice to the patrol to be on the alert - I had lost twenty-three feet of lead from there the night before - I met the prisoner that night about twenty minutes before eight o'clock, going to the work-house - I went on the roof a few minutes afterwards, and found the bricks taken off, and the lead raised up - I think nine or ten of the tiles were taken away - one end of the lead was turned up, and there was a cut in it, as if it was began to be cut - I saw the prisoner there, and heard him say, "I know I shall have seven pennyworth, I ought to have had it last time." There are some sloping sheds, by which he could get on the roof - I saw him ripping the lead.</p>

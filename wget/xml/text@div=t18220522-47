               <p>MICHAEL M'GUIRE. I live in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, I occasionally go into the country to buy rags, phials, and things. In April last I was in London, and I went to Hatfield; on Monday I was going towards Cockfosters, I saw the prisoner between eight and nine o'clock at night at <placeName id="t18220522-47-crimeloc250">Cockfosters</placeName>

I gave him part of three or four pints of beer; a young lad was with him, and my mistress was with me. I left the public-house a little past eight o'clock, and crossed the fields to go to <placeName id="t18220522-47-crimeloc251">Barnet</placeName>

When I had crossed four or five fields the prisoner overtook me, and another man; and I asked if they were going to Barnet, they walked with me about one hundred yards, then knocked me down; I got up and they knocked me down again; and his companion came behind me while I was on the ground, and took a bottle of liquor out of my pocket, and robbed me of three dozen and four oranges, and a blue purse, containing four pounds in half crowns, shillings and six-pences. The last words the prisoner said were,</p>
               <p>"If you do'nt be off I will have your life." I have known him for eight years, I did not know the other man's name, but think he was at the public-house with him. I gave information next morning, and saw the prisoner again two days after. He only knocked me down, we never had any words.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. The lady you call your mistress is not your wife - A. I married her at the Catholic chapel; she was singing as we crossed the field, and I told her not; I did not strike her. I went to the constable, and saw his wife. I did not say I had lost five sovereigns; my money was in my left-hand waistcoat pocket - I was quite sober.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. We set out between six and seven o'clock in the morning, with one hundred and fifty oranges, and went to Cockfosters, and went into the Cock, public-house, to sell oranges. I saw the prisoner standing at the door; several people were with him - he was drinking beer; I never saw him before, but my husband knew him. My husband staid at the Cock, while he had four pints of beer - several drank out of it - we left, and were going to lodge at Barnet. We went nearly a mile through the fields, when the prisoner with another man overtook us - we asked if they were going to Barnet; he said he was, and he went as far as the field-gate with us, and then asked my husband what he was going to do with the woman, meaning me - I was singing as I crossed the field. My husband said what was that to him - he seized my husband, and knocked him down; he got up; he knocked him down again, and his companion took the bottle of liquor out of his pocket, and also three dozen and four oranges - he lost 4 l. in money. His companion said,</p>
               <p>"Come along Tom, I have got what we wanted;" Tom then said to my husband, if he did not be off he would have his life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. Did you return to the public-house to find him - A. No; we had enough to do to run off for our lives. He kept his money in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

             re-examined. I had 18 d. a dozen for all the oranges I sold, and had about 3 l. in silver when I set out. I counted my money in the field, and there was 4 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you offer to make this up for 3 s. - A. No; I said if I could get within 3 s. or 5 s. of my money, I would go no further. I was tried here eight years ago for manslaughter. I have known the prisoner for years.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 29th of April, about nine o'clock the prosecutor came and wished me to take Beech - I sent him to my partner, and about ten o'clock next morning, the prisoner came and surrended to me; I said the Magistrate was not at home and he must come next day, which he did. If I had not known that he bore a good character, I should not have let him go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard this woman cry Murder! in the fields - I went to assist her, and she said I had saved her life. She went behind him, and took a bottle out of his pocket - he put up his stick, and said he would murder her and me too. I took it from him, and threw it away.</p>

            . I am the wife of the constable of Barnet. The prosecutor came to my house between eight and nine o'clock on the evening of the robbery, and said the man robbed him of five sovereigns, which were in his breeches pocket, and that he cut his pocket-off. Next morning he said he had been to the prisoner's mother, and asked her for 5 s. to think no more about it, but she refused.</p>

I saw him next day in my shop; he did not say he had been robbed, but ill used - that if the prisoner gave him 3 s. he would not hurt a hair of his head, but if not he would prig him before one o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Scotchoner, who keeps the Sir Robert Peel beer-house, Victoria Dock-road—on the night of 30th June, the prisoner was there with some Americans; they call them Irish Yankees—there were also some Russian sailors in the house, and among them a man named Kossoroukoff—the Russians were drinking, and the prisoner went and took their ale away, two pots at a time, after the Russians had paid for it, and gave them both to his own party to drink—I went up and told him he must not take the Russian's ale away, and I must put him out, as he always created a great disturbance in the house by doing so every time he came in; and if he did not go out of the room, I would</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boiler-maker, of Bell and Anchor-cottages, Victoria-docks—on the night of 30th June, about half-past 11 o'clock, I was in company with a friend, named George Dent, in the Victoria Dock-road, and observed a party of Russian seamen on before me—I afterwards saw five more seamen, Americans, come up, and one of them went in among the other seamen, who were on before me—I had seen the Americans in public-houses on former occasions, all five of them—the prisoner is one of them—I have seen him with his comrades—he went from his party to the party before, and then returned to his four mates—the party of Russians then set off to run, and the American party followed them—Dent and I ran on with the Americans, and while I was running I saw the prisoner running about fifteen yards before his own mates, with a knife in his hand—one of the Russian sailors was left by himself; and I saw the prisoner plunge the knife into him—I had left Dent behind, and I then turned and went back to him—the prisoner made the plunge with something in his hand which glittered; I cannot say whether it was a knife or not—I had seen the man, at whom he made the plunge, that night at the publican's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186208180128"></xptr>
               <p>house—when I returned to my mate, the prisoner was returning to his mates, and, as he was coming past me, I saw this thing glitter in his hand, as he was putting it into the breast of his shirt, and pointed it out to Dent—I then touched the prisoner on his shoulder, and told him not to run away—he walked about five yards past me and then set off running to his mates, and I lost sight of him for that night—about two hours afterwards I went to the Bell and Anchor public-house, close by where I live, and saw the same Russian, at whom the prisoner made the plunge, lying on the table—Harris, the policeman was there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it the noise that these people were making in the public road that attracted your attention? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was a bustling and talking among the Russians when the American was in among them; a noise; loud talking—I was about five or six yards from the party of Russians when I heard this—it was half-past 11 o'clock at night—the noise was not from the whole party of Russians and Americans; the party of six were behind—the prisoner's mates were ten or twelve yards from the Russians at that time—the whole body of the Americans did not overtake the Russians, but the prisoner only overtook one man.</p>

               <p>Russians stood still during the time the prisoner was among them—they were walking on; but when he went among them they immediately stopped—the Russian party were at that time, as near as I could judge, about eight yards from the American party—when the prisoner returned to his four mates, the Russians ran away immediately, and the Americans ran after them—the prisoner was with the other four, all running together, and I and Taylor ran with them—I did not observe who was first among the Americans—as the Americans ran, I saw the prisoner turn from the man who was stabbed—I was the last one who got up—the prisoner was then about three yards from me—he had a weapon of some description in his hand—I saw it glitter, and I saw him put it in his bosom—he called to his mates to stop; and, as he went up to them, he said, "I have done for the b—r"—I was not near enough to see whether the Russian was in any threatening attitude—the prisoner and the other Americans ran away in another direction from the Russians—I had not known the Russian before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What light was there at this time that you could see by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Gas-light—there are not a great many lamps about there—you could not see for any great distance, not with the light there was—when the prisoner put the thing that glittered into his bosom his mates were before him—they had returned from the Russians, and were running back towards the railway crossing, in a different direction to the Russians—they began to run back before I got up to the man that was stabbed, before I saw the prisoner turn from the Russian—I know of no reason why they began to run—they were running after the Russians at first—I saw no reason for their running back again—I did not see them turn—they were about six or eight yards from the Russian that was killed when I saw them returning back again, but the other Russians were further—the rest of the Americans were about five yards before the prisoner when I saw him turn from the man that was stabbed.</p>

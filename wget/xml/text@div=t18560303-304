                  </hi>. I live at No. 258, Blackfriars-road. On 5th May, 1855, John Sturt was introduced to me by a person named Allen, to borrow some money, and I advanced from 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the security proposed was an assignment of a bill of sale given to him by Miss Le Brice on the furniture in the house, No. 60, Upper Norton-street, Portland-road—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was offered to me by Sturt, who had it in his possession, and Charles Dowsett, who was always present—I then went with Sturt, Charles Dowsett, and Mr. Allen, who had intro<lb></lb>duced them, to No. 60, Upper Norton-street, to look at the furniture, and after seeing it and the bill of sale, I advanced the money—Sturt said at the same interview that he was the owner of No. 65 as well as No. 60, that he had bought the house, and held it at a ground rent—I lent him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that representation, temporarily, on No. 65, and on this bill of sale I made it up to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lent the second 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the assignment of this bill of sale—I advanced the money because I thought the furniture was well worth it—I should not have done so if I had believed that it belonged to some<lb></lb>body else—if he had not told me that he held No. 65 at a ground rent, and that it was his house, I would not have advanced it even then—he gave me a note of hand for the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each time, for security for the same advance—at the time I advanced the second 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I believed that the furniture belonged to John Sturt—if I had not, I would not have advanced it—before I paid the second 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I saw Mrs. Sturt and <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett, but I do not recollect seeing Hart—Mrs. Sturt said that the furniture was her husband's, and <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett said that it was Sturts—six or seven days elapsed between the time when I was first asked for the money and the time when I advanced the second 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and during that time I went once or twice to No. 60, Upper Norton-street, and I also went to No. 65—I found Miss Le Brice living at No. 60, and the defendants lived at No. 60, all except Hart—I did not advance other moneys on the property in No. 65—the advances were not upon the property, they were upon bills of exchange and I O U's—there was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the furniture of No. 60, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the furniture at No. 65, and up to 28th July it got to over 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the I O U's—on 28th July I received this bill of sale (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), executed from John Sturt to myself—it covers 191<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the security I received on it was still the furniture at No. 60, Upper Norton-street—before I received that bill of sale I had seen Hart with the other defendants—I used to go to No. 65 occasionally, and Hart was there—I do not think he had said anything about the furniture at No. 60 before I received this bill of sale—I do not think he said anything particular about it at any time, but he has been present when the others have spoken about it—he has assured me that I should get my money if I waited—he was more than once present with all of them when the ownership was talked of—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185603030020"></xptr>
               <p>amount beyond the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced in various small sums—I saw all the defendants on many occasions while this money was being advanced—Charles Dowsett at one time told me that he lived with his mother, at No. 5, Macclesfield-street—Sturt was present, and must have known that—I can pledge my oath that he was present, by a bill of exchange which I have—I remember it by the circumstance of a bill of exchange which they came for me to cash—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I lent some money on it on that occasion—the execution of the bill of sale to me is dated 21st May, and the advance was on 22nd May, the day that Charles Dowsett said that he lived at Macclesfield-street—during all the time that the money was being advanced I did not hear Charles Dowsett say that he had any claim on the furniture at Upper Norton-street, or that it belonged to anybody but John Sturt—on 16th or 17th Aug. an execution was put into No. 60, Upper Norton-street, at the suit of Margetson and Hay wood, furniture dealers, of the Islington Bazaar—I received information that it was put in from Mrs. Sturt—I was then at No. 258, Blackfriars-road—she wished me to see to it for her, and I went to Margetson and Haywood, at the ware-house, and something took place—I afterwards saw Sturt, and he wanted me to get the execution out—I ultimately became the claimant in an inter<lb></lb>pleader issue, and a second execution was put in two or three days after<lb></lb>wards by Lawrence Levy—Margetson and Haywood were the defendants in the interpleader issue, in which I was the plaintiff—it went into Court, and resulted in a verdict for me—Sturt was subpœnaed on both sides, at least I understand he was subpœnaed on the other side—he was a witness for me, and was examined as a witness for me—he swore that the furniture in the house was his, and that he had assigned it to me for money advanced, and that this was the bill of sale which he gave to secure its repayment; it was produced and put into Sturt's hands at the time—he said that about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been advanced, and that the bill of sale had been given as security; that was the bill from Sturt to me—Miss Le Brice was examined, and Hart was there to be examined, but was not called—I am not aware whether he was in Court to hear what Sturt swore—I had seen him immediately before the trial, and had a conversation with him about what he was to prove at the trial—he said that he knew the money had been advanced, and I must succeed—after saying that, he was there ready to be examined—he said that it was a question of time with Sturt, but they would be sure to pay me—before this bill of sale was given, in July, I was repeatedly asking Sturt for money, and some of it was repaid; at other times I had a difficulty in getting it; and after the execution of Margetson's was put in, Mrs. Sturt said that it was very expensive, and asked if I would allow her brother to remain and hold a copy, that she had to keep him, and it would not matter—after I paid the money into Court, Mr. Sloman, the sheriff's officer, remained in possession for a fortnight for me—there was nobody else in possession for Margetson, he had withdrawn on the money being paid into Court—Mrs. Sturt said that it would be very inconvenient to keep paying 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and if I would allow <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett, whom they had to keep, to be in possession, it would save them that—I agreed to that, and gave him a copy of the bill of sale, and allowed him to take possession instead of Sloman's man—he remained in possession till 24th—I was there often, and asked him if the things were safe; he said, "Yes"—in consequence of something I heard, I went to the house, No. 65, and saw Sturt and his wife, and Charles and <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett: I was very much</p>

               <p>out of temper, and said that I had heard that they, were changing the things at No. 60—Sturt said that it was not so—I said, "I will go in and see"—he said, "You can;" and Mr. and Mrs. Sturt, myself, and <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett went into No. 60—I do not think Charles Dowsett went—I said, "I think these tables have been changed, in fact, I am sure this is not the table and fender, and the stair carpeting is gone"—Start said, "Yes, I pledged that, but it shall be taken out and restored to you"—I said, "That aught not to be, I am sure they have been changed;" they assured me that they had not, or if they had that they should be restored, and I left—that was about a month before Christmas; it was after the trial, the trial was on the 8th or 9th Nov.—I went again when Sturt was there, as Mrs. Sturt came down in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and said, that Charles Dowsett had caused a Mr. Jul<lb></lb>lien to be detained at the station house for making away with a carriage which he had to repair or paint, and I had better come down and prove my title to it, as if he was ordered to restore it they should have so much less to pay me—I went with her in the cab to the station house first, with the bill of sale in my pocket, and at her request went up and asserted my claim—Sturt was present then, and I went to No. 68; the defendants were all pre<lb></lb>sent, the matter was talked over, and Dowsett said that he must be ordered to restore it, and that he had met him accidentally, and caused him to be detained—I produced my bill of sale then, and after that discussion I and Sturt went to the station house and I asserted my claim—after my claim was allowed in the action, I went on 24th Dec. to take possession of the pro<lb></lb>perty, in consequence of something which I heard—I said to Mrs. Sturt, "Sturt tells me he has paid the rent for Michaelmas quarter; now, Mrs. Sturt I want to see the receipt"—she said, "Yes, so he has paid it"—Darvillee a witness, who went with me, was present, none of the other defendants were there—I think first she said that she had it in her purse, and called Sturt's mother to produce it—she could not find it, and then they said that Sturt must have got it, and gone over to my house to show it to me—I said "Has the rent been paid?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "And with your own money?" she said, "It has, in two sums"—I said, "Because I have, been told that an arrangement has been made by which it is pretended that <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett should pay the rent and claim these goods"—she said, "Cer<lb></lb>tainly not; you know he never had a shilling, it is not likely"—I said, "You may say what you like, but I will not leave the house without seeing the receipt; I will wait any time to see it, but if you do not show it to me I shall remove the goods"—Sturt's mother then went out, and in a few. minutes <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett appeared—I had three or four persons altogether there—I said, "We intend to move these goods;" Dowsett said, "I do not intend to let you, they are mine"—I laughed, for it surprised me, and then Charles Dowsett appeared, and Hart and they all said that they did not intend to let me move them—Hart had come in when they said that, and three or four men who had come with me began taking up the carpets to move them—<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett went for one constable, and Darville fetched another—the men kept getting the things down stairs, and putting them on the staircase, and Tom Dowsett said, "Well, these things are mine"—I said, "Indeed! why, you have been in possession from Oct. for me; it is very singular that they should become yours all of a sudden; why did not you claim them before? why not claim them under the execution? why not tell me when I put you in possession? why remain quiescent, and then appear?"—he then produced an agreement, by which he said that he was the landlord, and that he took the house of one Frederick Cruse—I read it, and so did the</p>

               <p>constable—he said that he always had been the landlord, and that Sturt had nothing to do with it—I said, "Oh, that is impossible"—he said, "Well, it is so; if Sturt has been playing the rogue to you, I do not intend to have anything to do with it, and do not intend to let you have the goods;" and they have carried it out, for I never have—I said, "Do you claim them all?"—he said, "I do, from the top of the house to the bottom, and you do not move them"—he did not say who Frederick Cruse was, but I said, "The well known swindler"—he said, "That is my business; this is his agreement"—I believe there is a person named Cruse—I asked him if being the landlord of the house made the furniture his, but he would not explain that—I said, "You know you cannot be the landlord, for I have paid the rent myself to the Guarantee Society"—that was the Michaelmas quarter—the cheque was to Sturt—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is dated Jan. 16, and bears the endorsement of the manager of the Kent Guarantee Society—the amount is 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mrs. Sturt had paid the property tax, and I paid the difference, 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mrs. Sturt went with me—I have the cheques here for all the advances which were made by cheque, and I believe they all bear Sturt's endorsement, but some were made in cash—we tried to remove the things, but were violently resisted—the defendants were all there except Sturt—when anything was wanted he was never visible, but when he wanted anything he was always present—that is the way they do their business—<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett before that had taken part in the ownership—I saw him twenty times, and said, "You are taking care of the things"—he always said that they belonged to Sturt, until 24th Dec.—he never asserted that they belonged to him till the moment that I wanted to remove them—I do not know whether Charles Dowsett was present at the trial, or when it was discussed what was to be proved at the trial, but I have seen him often at the house—Mrs. Sturt was a Miss Dowsett, I have understood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Hadwen, an attorney, I was engaged in the case of Spokes against Margetson—I prepared the whole of the proofs, and examined the witnesses before the trial—I saw Hart at Westminster Hall, and repeated his evidence to him, which I had written down—examined him in my capacity as attorney's clerk—I had been told that he could prove certain circumstances, and I drew according to that a proof—I was introduced to Mr. Hart at Westminster Hall, read over the proof to him, and asked him if he could swear to that effect, and he said, "Yes, most decidedly" I believe that proof is amongst the papers—on 24th Dec. I went to No. 60, Upper Norton-street—I met Mr. Spokes there—after he had been there some time, he called Mrs. Sturt into the back parlour and asked her if she had paid the last quarter's rent—she said, "I have"—Mr. Spokes said, "I have been given to understand that you have not paid it, that some other person has"—she said, "Who?"—he replied, "Your brother, Thomas Dowsett, I have been informed"—she said, "It is no such thing, he could not have done so, for he has no money; I tell you I have paid it myself with my own money"—Mr. Spokes then asked her to pro<lb></lb>duce the receipt—she said, "I have it; I think it is in my purse down stairs"—she then called, I think it was Mr. Sturt's mother, and asked her if she could find her purse; she did not succeed in finding it—she said, "Oh! Sturt has got it; he has gone over to your house with it"—Mr. Spokes then said, "I don't believe it;" and he went out into the front room—after some few minutes he directed me to fetch a van to remove the furniture—pre<lb></lb>vious to that Mr. Spokes asked if Thomas Dowsett was in the house, and whether he had got the copy bill of sale he had given to him—Mrs. Sturt said, "No, he is not in, but whenever he goes out, he leaves the copy hill of sale with me," and she went to a drawer and produced it—I then, by the direction of Mr. Spokes, fetched a van to remove the goods, and directly I came back, I saw Thomas Dowsett there, who set up a claim to the whole of the goods, as landlord—he was there with his brother Charles, and Hart—Thomas Dowsett said he was the landlord of the house, and the whole of the goods were his, and he then produced a receipt which purported to be for a quarter's rent—he said he took the house from a person of the name of Cruse—Mr. Spokes said, "Do you claim the whole of them, or is it the portion that has been seized that you have purchased?—he said, "I claim the whole"—Mr. Spokes produced his bill of sale, and claimed the whole of the furniture, and said he should take them away, but Hart prevented him doing it—I remember Thomas Dowsett saying, I think, at another part of the evening, "If Sturt has been a b——rogue to you I cannot help it; he must suffer for it; the goods were always mine, and were never Start's"—Hart and Charles Dowsett were present when he said that—I do not remem<lb></lb>ber their saying anything at that time—in the course of the evening they said the property was Thomas Dowsets—they both said so at various times in the course of the evening—we were there till very near 11 o'clock—they said it was not Sturt's property, and that it was Thomas Dowsets—I remember distinctly Hart saying, in the presence of Charles and Thomas Dowsett, "We have done the b——old fool, Spokes, out of his money"—that was not in Spokes's presence—the Dowsett made a kind of chuckle;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185603030031"></xptr>
               <p>or laugh, at the idea—Hart afterwards said to Mr. Spokes, "Whenever I begin a matter, you know, Spokes, I never leave it till I finish it"—we were prevented from taking away the furniture by all of them except Sturt, who was not present—I was hurt in the endeavour by Thomas Dowsett, and had my coat torn—on 1st Jan., I made another attempt to take away the furni<lb></lb>ture; I could not get into the house then—I saw the defendants outside the door—they again prevented me from taking away the furniture—and again, on 2nd Jan.—it continued all night—I did not see Start either time—I saw Mrs. Sturt—Hart said, "If you dare come here, I will break your b——head open"—that was on the night of 1st Jan.</p>

ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you have tea at all on 24th Dec.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had tea previous to Mrs. Sturt being asked if she had paid the rent—that was, as near as I can recollect, about 5 o'clock—Mr. Spokes, myself, and a son of Mr. Spokes, were taking tea—I think the son of Mr. Spokes was there the whole time—he was out with his father in the gig—there was also a person who, I think, Mrs. Sturt said was her sister—there was nobody else on our behalf at that time, there was afterwards, as we expected that we should have to remove the goods—the tea things were brought in immediately I entered the room, and I had some tea—I had never been there before—I have known Mr. Howe a short time, since the beginning of this year—he has given information to Mr. Spokes respecting the character of these persons, and he gave the same information to the defendants' solicitor; so he told me—we have been together a few times for the last few months, and dined together once—I may have drunk a glass of ale with him—we have not been at public houses together—I have seen him over the way at a public house, Mr. Gooch's—I have been there with him—last Session he was here about the Court, and I went over there, and he was there—I was in and out, sometimes, two or three minutes at a time—I was conversing with him, asking him for information about these parties—I cannot say since that date Ihave been asking him for information—I have been with him at Mr. Spokes's house, I should think, five or six times—he told me distinctly that he could not get enough money from Mr. Spokes, and therefore the other party had given him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that he had gone to the other side, and they had paid him very liberally indeed—he told me that yes<lb></lb>terday—he said that he had found some parties now who would pay him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you advertise to dispose of the house and furniture? A. About three weeks previous to this agreement; the prisoner had applied to Mr. Hughes, a professional gentleman, to whom he was to refer - Mr. Hughes had not authority to treat for the premises; he sent him to me, and I saw him about the second day after the advertisement - he came to live in the house on the 29th of November; his servant took possession on the 27th - he was not in possession, nor did he or his servants sleep in the house till the 27th; I did not receive his bills of exchange till the 27th, and the agreement was executed the same day, except his signature, which he put on the 29th or 30th; it was drawn up before I had his bills of exchange - my solicitor has the bills, I dare say; I had them on the 29th - they were not in circulation then; I did not live in the house after I gave him possession - I was at my country house; I never slept in the house after the 27th - I left my servant there; I had been out of town some months before, but my servant slept there - I think my servant left on the 29th; I am not able to say whether the prisoner had signed the agreement before my servant had left - I think he left on Monday, the 29th, or it might be on Tuesday, the 30th - he left in the evening; I certainly had not left the house altogether, and gone into the country, before the 27th - I had been in the house several days after the 27th, but not to take a meal there - it was previous to my taking the bills that it occurred to my mind to take something else.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your lady here? A. Yes - she and I were going backwards and forwards from our country-house; I did not go after my cook went till I found out this - I had some furniture in the house, and a storeroom - that was not broken open; part of the furniture was taken away by the cook - I never gave the prisoner authority to sell any of the furniture.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 16th of December, I went with the prosecutor to a house in Blackfriars-road, and found these articles of furniture.</p>
               <p>COURT to HENRY LAWLESS. Q. When was the arrangement made? A. It was made in the presence of Mr. Woodard, the prisoner, and myself, on Saturday, the 27th of November - it was arranged in our presence, that I should go into the City, draw that paper, and return at a certain hour in the afternoon, and the prisoner should execute it, but I could not get there in time; I found the prisoner had in the interim given the two bills, and agreed to call at my office, in Tokenhouse-yard, and sign the paper - he had not seen the paper, but he knew the contents verbally; we had talked about the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. But your agreement refers to an arrangement for the assignment of a lease, and letting him into possession, when did any difficulty start, and it was suggested to make a tenant of him? A. That was the difficulty throughout, and the agreement was proposed - I had seen the prisoner on the Thursday, but it was not agreed that he should take the things till the Saturday; there certainly was a final verbal agreement on the Saturday, but he certainly was not unconditionally accepted as a tenant, without this paper - that was the very thing we were providing against; there were a variety of agreements and stipulations to be reduced to writing by me, which I did, and the prisoner signed it on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you introduce into that writing any stipulation that had not previously been mentioned? A. There was one stipulation as to the penalty, but I had read all the rest carefully over to the prisoner; the penalty for liquidating damages, I did not call his attention to, till the Tuesday - there might be some parts which might not be understood, but the whole was read over, and I did not consider there was any thing travelling out of the road of the agreement; it was arranged that I should draw up the agreement, making him the tenant of a ready-furnished house of Mr. Woodard's, and on the Tuesday the prisoner adopted that agreement, by signing it, with the clause about liquidated damages being added - I particularly called his attention to that, as it had not been named on the Saturday; I think he signed it between eleven and twelve o'clock - I explained to him, that, under this agreement, he would be the tenant of Mr. Woodard, and it was drawn to keep the tanancy aloof from the legal possession; I explained that to him on the Saturday, and on the Tuesday also - I stated that inasmuch as he was not prepared to pay the money down, he could not expect to be put into possession of the property on such a nugatory security, or to that effect; I will not swear those were the words I used.</p>

            . I am a law-stationer, and have been brought up to that business all my life. I now work for Mr. Ashurst - I am here accidentally, waiting for another trial; I have counted the words in this agreement - it contains, with the names and attestations, one thousand and eighty words, and eighteen words over - there are seventy-two words in a folio; one thousand and eighty words are fifteen folios - without the names and attestations, it contains only two words over; there are figures, which I have counted as words at length, which is the usual course of business - I have counted some thousands of deeds in my life.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many words do you swear there are independent of the attestations and names? A. One thousand and eighty-two - the attestations and names consist of sixteen words; the signature appears as one word, but it is two words - I counted this No. 65, which some gentleman has put, but that is not part of it; I mistook it - the stamp is for 1l.</p>
               <p>The court ruled that the agreement, not being duly stamped, was not admissible in evidence.</p>

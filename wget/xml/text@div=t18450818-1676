Binge, hardwaremen, in Houndsditch—I ordered one dozen of scissors of them last May, and they sent me down two dozen, by the Parcels Delivery Company—I know the prisoner—he called on me in May from Messrs'. Binge's, and I returned by him one dozen of small scissors, and three pairs of large ones—I told him they were more than I ordered—he lett with the goods—on the 26th of June I returned him one dozen of fruit-knives and one dozen of combs—they had been sent by Messrs. Binge, by the Parcel Delivery Company, and were unsuitable for</p>

The prisoner was one of our commission travellers—it was part of his duty to collect orders from samples, and, if goods were returned to him, to return them to us—he did not on the 14th of May return us twelve pairs of scissors, nor three pairs; nor did he on the 26th of June, or subsequently, return twelve silver fruit-knives, nor any combs, nor tell me that they had been returned by Mr. Cuthbertson—it was his duty to deliver them to me or my brother.</p>

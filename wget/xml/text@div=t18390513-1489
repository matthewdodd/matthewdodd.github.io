The prisoner was our carman—I did not say any thing to him about any parcel on the 23rd of March, as we were busy, bat I told him to call on the Monday or Tuesday, and I then asked him why a parcel for Gillman and Lucas was not delivered—he said he was not aware he had a box for them—it has never been found, nor any of the contents.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the New Inn. I received on the 23rd of March a deal box by Kent's Eyworth wagon—it was delivered to the town wagon to be delivered to Gillman and Lucas, in Newgate-street, but not in my presence—I have the book in which the entry is made—the prisoner drove the wagon that it was meant for—I cannot prove that it was put into that wagon, but it is likely I saw it put in with the other parcels—there was a small box inside a large one.</p>

On Saturday, the 23rd of March, I was leaking through my window, between nine and ten o'clock, and I saw the prisoner in the prosecutor's wagon—he uncorded and opened a box about two feet long, and emptied the whole of the contents—there were two pieces of bombazin, and other articles, which I cannot enumerate—there was a small box inside it—that he took out, and the lid of the large one fell, I could see Gillman and Lucas's name on it, and Smith—the wagon was standing still before my door for half an hour.</p>

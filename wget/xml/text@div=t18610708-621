                  </hi>. I am a wholesale fish dealer, residing at 7, Mill-lane, Lambeth-walk, Surrey, and have a shop in Hercules-buildings, Lambeth, On Tuesday, 18th June, I locked up my shop at 2 o'clock in the morning and went home—the policeman came and called me up at 4 o'clock—I re-turned, and found the place broken open—I missed a watch and clock, abutter pot, two coats, a hat and black bag, and two knives (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these are the fragments of the butter pot—these things are all mine—I found the door broken open—I had securely fastened it before I left—I know nothing about the prisoners; I think I saw them in my shop that night, but I will not be sure.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 112). About 2 o'clock in the afternoon of 18th June, I was passing up Smithfield with another officer—I saw the prisoners Jennings and Mayes—Mayes was carrying a parcel under his arm, consisting of a workbox wrapped up in this dirty towel, which is identified by another person—the clock was inside the workbox—I followed them to the corner of Smithfield pens and caught hold of them—Jennings immediately said, "Oh, don't take me Mr. Fawke"—he knew my name—I said, "What have you got there?"—I did not perceive him carrying any-thing—he said, "We have got a workbox and a little clock which we have tried to sell"—I said, "Where did you get them from?"—he said he was induced last night by two other persons, whom he would show me, to go with them, and they went to the other side of the water and broke into two places while they watched, and also into a fish shop in the City, where they stole the workbox—he said, "Do you know Love-lane; I will show you the two, lying in the pens, and you will find a watch that was stolen"—it was Jennings that said all this—I went there with them and another officer, and they pointed out the other two prisoners, and said, "Those are the two men that broke into the fish shop"—Mahoney and Jones both denied it—we then, with the assistance of McLeod, took the whole four to the police-station—I did not notice anything on the ground then—I saw the mackin<lb></lb>tosh, but there was such a mob round at the time, and Mahoney was violent—it was laying down by the side of Mahoney and Jones—this is not the one—it was taken away by the crowd—we found these remnants of a dish</p>

               <p>with butter adhering—the lid that has been brought corresponds exactly; it is of the same pattern—Jennings was wearing this jacket under his other clothes—I took him to the station-house—three of them said they had got no homes—Jones gave his mother's address—I know all the prisoners by sight—I saw them on the day previous in Love-lane, close to the Smithfield sheep pens—there were five of them together then—I have frequently seen them in company with each other, and frequently watched them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 141). I was with the last witness on the afternoon of 18th June in Smithfield pens—I saw Jennings and Mayes taken into custody—I heard them say they did not steal the things, they were only induced to accompany the other two—they spoke of three rob-beries—I then went into the pens and saw Jones and Mahoney—on the ground close to where they stood there was a mackintosh lying on the ground—I also picked up these pieces of a broken butter dish—Jones and Mahoney denied all knowledge of the other prisoners, and said they had not committed the robbery—there was a fifth man, I think, who got away—at the station I found some note paper on Jones—after Jennings and Mayes said that Mahoney and Jones committed the robbery they pointed them out, and I went away to secure them—I do not know that the other officer said, "Why did not you take him in custody?"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners' statements before the Magistrate were read as follows:—Jones says</hi>: "I am quite innocent of the charge; Jennings said that what he said was out of spite to me." <hi rend="italic">Mahoney says</hi>: "I am quite innocent; Mr. McLeod came into the cell and said that Jennings said that I had some postage stamps on me; I said all that I had I had put on the window sill. I told him I had no postage stamps at all. I told him to look on the window; I told him I had put everything I had on the window; he (McLeod) turned back again and said there was no postage stamps on the window—I said it was only a spite Jennings had against me to say so." <hi rend="italic">Mayes says</hi>: "Two men gave me the box to sell for them, and I went to see whether I could sell them; no one would buy them of me—as we were turning back from Smithfield-pens I was going to look for the men to tell them, and the officer laid hold of me and said, 'Where did you get those things from?" and I told him two men gave them to me, who were in the pens—he said, 'Do you know the men?' and I said, 'I don't know,' I was going to see where I could find them in the pens, and I saw Jones standing, and I thought they were the two, but they were not, and then Jennings made answer, and said they were the two, and the officer went to them.

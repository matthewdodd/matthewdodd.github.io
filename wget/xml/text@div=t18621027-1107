                  </hi>. I know the prisoner—I first knew him six years ago; at that time he was a married man—I lost sight of him after that until July last—he was then a widower—he was brought to me by the in<lb></lb>terference of some of his working mates, and I was introduced to him at the house of one of his workmates—I think that was the first Sunday in July last—there was some conversation then in which the prisoner proposed marriage to me—I at first consented, and the banns were afterwards twice published—after that something came to my knowledge about him, and I refused to marry him, on account of his character, it was not satisfactory—I told him so—I have a brother named Alexander—I went with him and my mother to see the prisoner—we told him what we had heard, and wished to have no further intercourse with him; notwithstanding that, he came to me again—I told him at one time that I was of a different religion, and I also told him on that occasion that I would have nothing further to do with him—on Tuesday, 26th August, I went to his sister's at Rotherhithe, soon after 6 in the evening—whilst I was there the prisoner came in, about quarter-past 7—I started between 8 and 9 to go home—the prisoner came with me—I objected to his coming with me, but he came—he came with me to High-street, Deptford, and I again objected—I wished him to leave me and go home, and allow me to go home—he still continued with me—I went into the Broadway, Deptford, and I again entreated of him to leave me, as it was getting very late, and I said I was afraid if my brother met him they would quarrel, finding me in his company—he continued arguing with me, and my brother was at work at a sewer in the Broadway and overheard me, and called out to me by name, and asked if that was me—I said it was—my brother came up and asked the prisoner why he prevented me from going home—he said he wished to speak to me—my brother said there could be nothing very important to say that night, and if he wished to speak to me he was to see me next day, and whatever he might wish to know he should have all the requisite information from my brother and myself—my brother and the prisoner then took some beer together—the prisoner offered it two or three times, and at last a witness fetched it, and they both drank—my brother was called away to his work—the prisoner at this time was talking very loud—I told him to leave me, that I did not wish any further company or conversation with him—he said he would not leave me till he had spoken to me—I said, "You can have nothing to say to me to-night, for your conduct clearly proves what you are, and I have now reason to believe that some part of what I have heard of you is true"—he said, "I want to know your inten<lb></lb>tion"—I said, "My intention is, after this night, to have nothing further to say to you"—he turned round, and said something to the effect that he would have my life, and I received one or two successive blows in the chest, towards the left breast—I could not see what the blows were struck with—for a few moments I stood, and then I found I could stand no longer, and I supported myself against the side of a shop—in the struggle my shawl came on, and I found that I was bleeding—I went back with a view of getting my shawl, where I knew it had fallen off, and the prisoner again rushed at me—I raised up my right arm and he stabbed me through the muscle of my arm—I then knew it was a knife, and told him so—I said, "You are stabbing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270158"></xptr>
               <p>me"—he said, "I know I am"—I said, "Now I know what makes me bleed"—I threw myself into the arms of the first person I saw, and asked him to save me, and to go in search of my brother, because I was afraid he would kill him too—I called out to my brother, but he did not come at that time; he came afterwards—I did not see what happened to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, and live in Church-street, Deptford—I knew that the prisoner was at one time engaged to my sister; it was in July last—I had objected to his marrying her—on 26th August, about half-past 11 at night, I was at work in a sewer in Church street—whilst there I heard the voices of my sister and the prisoner in the street—I came up and asked her what she did there at that hour; that she had more right to be at home, as I thought it was an improper hour for her to be out—she said that she had been trying to part with him for an hour and a half—I told him that he had a little distance to go, and it was pretty nearly time he was gone home—he said we should have some beer, and wanted me to go into a public house with him—I declined doing so—a young woman brought some beer—he handed it to me and I drank, and handed the pot back to him—I had no angry words with him at that time—I went to my work, and about five minutes afterwards I heard my sister scream out as though she had been hit—there was a fence between me and them—I went to the place as soon as I could, and I saw the prisoner with his hand like upon her—I went between them—he let go of her and turned on to me, and hit me in the chest with a knife, saying, "And you"—he struck me on the left side, under my breast—I turned my back to get away, finding it was not a blow with a fist, and he then stabbed me in the back—I fell to the ground after the second stab—I received a third stab while I was on the ground, and a fourth on the hand—he said he had had his revenge, and he meant to—the prisoner might have been drinking—I can't say whether he was drunk or not—he spoke sensibly enough when he came to me—I was taken to Guy's Hospital, and was there for some time.</p>

I am the sister of Alexander Hartnett's wife—on the night of 26th August I was walking along the street with Bridget Hart<lb></lb>nett—I was in Church-street, where Alexander Hartnett was at work in the sewer—I heard the prisoner say to the prosecutrix, "I want to know your intentions this night"—she said, "You are showing your true character, what I have heard of you, and after this night I shall have nothing more to say to you"—he pulled her by the shawl, and said, "Then I will have your life"—I did not see the knife, as it was very dark, but I saw his hand going up and down, and I afterwards saw that she was wounded.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When I was a young man, about sixteen, I was at work for a Mr. Massey, and when I was out with young Mr. Massey rabbit-shooting I got shot by him. I have got a good many shots in my bead now, and a great many in the body, and whenever I get a drop of drink it takes my seuses away. I do not remember being taken, or anything at all about it; all I know is that I kept company with this young woman, and I gave her money, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at one time, to buy what she wanted, and I bought the ring; I gave 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for it, and she has got it; I gave it her to take care of till such time as we were married. Then, another night after that, I gave her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., more, and money to buy different things for the house. After she got the money she set up to laugh and jeer at me, and always pretended she would keep my company as usual, and get married to me. This night I was drunk and knew nothing about it. My belief is, that what the policeman says is wrong; or if I did say what he says it was through his ill-usage, for I was insensible at the time. I did not feel myself in my right senses for three days afterwards, from the blows I had on my head.</p>

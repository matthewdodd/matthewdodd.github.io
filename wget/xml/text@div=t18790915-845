                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I am first mate on board the Planteur—on Saturday afternoon, 6th of this month, about 5.30, I was walking along St. George's Street in the East with a basket of provisions—I saw the prisoner there with two other men; one of them asked me for some tobacco—I cannot say that it was the prisoner because the others were pushing me—I said I had no tobacco—I went on my way, and then in the small street near St. George's Street, before I arrived at the London Docks, the prisoner put his hand into my right hand pocket and ran away—I found my portmonnaie had gone; it contained a sovereign in gold, sixpence in silver, two francs, a sou, and a golden cross—I cried 'Thief,' and ran after him—a policeman also ran after him; he ran into a little lane where we lost sight of him—I went to the station and gave in formation—at a later period I went with the policeman; eight person were placed before me and I picked out the prisoner as the man who had done it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi> by the Prisoner. I said that you were the person who ran away—I do not know which of the three persons had put their band in my pocket, it was done so quickly—I am sure you are one of the three—I certainly said just now that you were the man that took the purse—you ran away, therefore you are the thief—I don't know what became of the other two, I ran after you—I don't believe you had a hat on when I identified you—I did not see the detective take off your hat, go past me, and then put it on your head—I was asked whether I knew any of the eight persons; it took me about four seconds to look round, and I immediately said you were the man—I did not point out any one else—the policeman said "Are you sure that is the man?" and I said "Yes."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant K</hi>). I apprehended the prisoner on the 8th of this month—I had received a description of him—I did not know him before; he was at the corner of New Gravel Lane and St. George's Street, near the place in question—I told him I should take him into custody as answering the description of a man who was concerned with others in robbing a Frenchman on Saturday evening last at the corner of Glasshouse Yard and St. George's Street—he said "What time was it?"—I said "I think it was about 3 o'clock"—he said "I was not there, I was having my tea in St. George's Chambers at that time"—I took him to the station in King David Lane and placed him among seven others—I sent for the prosecutor and he identified him at once; he pushed the others away from him and left the prisoner standing by himself—I could not understand what he said—I stopped in the room at the prisoner's request; they were all standing up and all had hats on—Wilcox afterwards came in and immediately pointed out the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not ask the prosecutor twice to look again, I could not speak his language—the inspector who brought him in could speak French—I stood at the corner away from the eight persons—there were seven besides you; you were in the middle; I don't know who they were, they were men picked out of the streets—when I took you you said "I wish to make my defence, I was having my tea at St. George's Chambers at the time."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate.</hi> "The constable when he apprehended me said he was not sure as to the time, that it was between 4 and 6. I said I might have been in the chambers having my tea. On Saturday I saw two men following the Frenchman. I heard one say to the other, 'He has it in his outside coat-pocket.' They went down to the bottom of the street One asked him for something, what it was I could not tell I saw him shove the man out into the road. He went to him again and said something, and the other man ran up and put his hand into his pocket. What he took out I could not say. He then ran up Glasshouse Yard. I turned round and went up Leman Street, walking rather quiet I was making a cigarette. I saw the policeman looking at me rather sard, as if he had a suspicion of me, and would recognise me again, I then went into Wells Street to see a man who had promised me sixpence, and he gave me sixpence."</p>

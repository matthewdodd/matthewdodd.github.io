               <p>Q. In what part of the house was this case of instruments, and the twenty 
pound note - A. In the back parlour on the ground floor.</p>


               <p>Q. Was the bank note in a drawer - A. It was in a drawer in the desk; the desk was locked; I had seen the bank note between ten and eleven o'clock on the evening before; it was then safe.</p>
               <p>Q. On what time of the day on the 23d did you miss it - A. Between ten and eleven in the morning. The shagreen case was kept in the same desk, and the lancets in the case. The steelyard-beam was in the same room, in another drawer, locked. On missing these things I went to the Bank to stop payment of the note, immediately I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. As this desk was locked had the lock been forced by violence, or was it picked - A. I do not know; it was not wrenched open by a crow.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that you had locked the desk when you last saw the desk - A. Yes; I am quite sure I had locked it.</p>
               <p>Q. As you gave notice to the Bank to stop it, how long was it afterwards that you heard of it - A. It was stopped at the Bank the first day I missed it. I went to the Bank between eleven and twelve in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the note again - A. I do not recollect how soon afterwards. I had no particular mark of my own to know the note by. I had the bank note at Sir

            . I am one of the marshalmen. I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner at Mr. Barton's house; I found the prisoner at work there, painting. I told the prisoner that I had a very unpleasant circumstance to relate to him, that Mr. Barton was suspicious that he had taken a twenty pound note out of his desk. The prisoner said he knew nothing of it. I told him I must search him. I did search him, and found nothing upon him of consequence but a key; I asked him what key that was; he said, it was the key of the door; I told him I must search his apartment; I took him with me, and went to the room in Camomile Mews. I opened the door with that key.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body there - A. No one. There was nobody in the room when we entered it; his wife was not at home. I then proceeded to search. The first thing I searched was a chest of drawers, or a bureau; the first thing I found, that Mr. Barton identified, was a case of instruments, which I produce; he claimed it, and he said it was in the desk where the money was. I then found a pocket-book in the same drawer, it contained ten one-pound bank notes. I enquired of the prisoner, before that time, if he had any money in the house; he said he had a little. Upon looking at them notes I found each note had a particular stamp at the back, as if they all came from one person. I said to Mr. Barton, I am satisfied that this is part of the property; he has changed the note. The prisoner said nothing. We then proceeded to search further, and in a deal box, not locked, lay the steelyard-beam; Mr. Barton identified it. I then asked the prisoner, whose box it was; he said it was either his brother-in-law's, or a relation's; I cannot say which, but I think, a brother-in-law's. I found nothing more until his wife came in, when we had nearly closed the search. I ceased from searching, and began to look at her; the prisoner was standing by; I asked her if she had got any money in the house; she said she did not know of any, except a trifle that she had in her pocket, a three-shilling piece, and a eighteen-penny piece, and a trifle of silver. I found by the receipts that they had paid away, from Saturday night before, several pounds. I asked her what money her husband brought her home on Saturday night; she said, a guinea and a half. This was the Thursday. I told her I found by the receipts I had in my hand that they had paid away more money than that; she said, that was accounted for by a pound note she had saved up previous; but that did not account for the whole of the money. I then asked her if she had not got some money in her pocket; she said no, only that trifle of silver. I told her to empty her pockets; she did, and pulled out this pocket-book, and in the pocketbook was ten one-pound notes, that makes twenty one-pound notes found in the house; they were all bank notes. Upon examining the notes, I found they answered with the description of the stamp that the others had; they were all stamped. I then asked her how she came by them; she said she had them from her mother, as she was with child, and an expensive time was coming on. I told her I was satisfied how she came by them, and asked her where she had changed the twenty pound note; she said, at the bank that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Her husband heard all this, did he - A. Yes. I then asked her of whom she had the twenty pound note; she hesitated a moment, and said, I must say my husband; he made no reply. I asked him how he came to do so; he said he had an expensive time coming on; he had been out of work some time, and he took it to carry him through his expences.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you go to the Bank afterwards - A. I did not; the prosecutor did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the wife appear to be far advanced in her pregnancy - A. Very near her time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you change a twenty pound note with any person on the 23d of April - A. A person of the name of Thompson changed a twenty pound note. I cannot say whether it was a man or a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. What number was it - A. I have only the entries<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130031"></xptr> of the numbers which were given for the twenty pound note. When I changed it I entered the number of the notes for which it was paid. The party who changed that note had twenty single one-pound notes. I saw the twenty one-pound notes before the Lord Mayor, and they corresponded with the notes I gave for the twenty pound note; their numbers are, 57,758, 28th of September; 18th of February, 38,657; 3d of March, 7,079; there is two of that date; the other is 75,229: 29th of February, 33,150.</p>

I only know the note by the name. The twenty pound note is in the custody of Mr. King. I neither knew the number or date of the twenty pound note. We have the name and residence of every note we change. I only know the twenty pound note by the name of Thompson; I have no doubt it is the identical note for which I gave the person them twenty one-pound notes. I only entered the name. We ask the name, and the name they give we enter in the book; there is no other entry of a twenty pound note with the name of Thompson upon it on that day.</p>

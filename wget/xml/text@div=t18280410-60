On the night of Monday, the 10th of March, I went to bed about half-past nine o'clock - the house was secured then, but I was not the last person in bed; my mother and the servant were both up - nobody else was in the house: I know the property in question was safe when I went to bed; there were two silver salt-spoons, two silver cruet-tops, two pairs of plated knife-rests, a pair of plated sugar-tongs, a mahogany tea-caddy, and several trifling things; the salt-spoons and knife-rests were on the sideboard - not locked up; I got up about half-past five o'clock in the morning as usual, to go to business - it was quite day-light; when I came down stairs I fell over a drawer which had been pulled out of the sideboard; I immediately went into the next parlour, and found the window shutters closed, the window sash thrown up, and the hasps, which keep it down, broken; a round hole was bored in the shutter; some phosphorus matches were left on the carpet - my mother and the servant were both in bed; the articles I have named were missing; I saw the prisoner on the Friday following, before the Magistrate at Brentford; two spoons were produced - I knew them to be my mother's; the tops, where the initials had been, were cut off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You left your mother and servant up, are they here? A. No; I am certain my mother has no other Christian name - she rents the house, and is a market-gardener - I am not a partner; I sat in the room the night before; the spoons were opposite to me - I could not sit there without seeing them; I remember seeing them - I did not take them in my hand, but am quite certain I saw them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say the tops were gone from the spoons - did you afterwards see any part of the tons? A. Yes; the top of one spoon was produced before the Magistrate, with the initials on it, and it fitted the spoon.</p>

I am a silversmith, and live at Brentford, which joins Isleworth; the prisoner came to my shop on Wednesday evening, the 12th of March, to sell two salt-spoons and two pepper-castor tops - the spoons were quite defaced, the bowls turned in, and the tops cut off both - I had received information of another robbery in the morning, and seeing the initials cut off the spoons, I thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100054"></xptr>it best to purchase them, and give information in the morning, which I did, and the prisoner was apprehended; I knew him very well before - I produced the spoons and castor-tops before the Magistrate, and Mr. Goodenough claimed them; part of a spoon was produced there, which had been cut off one of those he sold me, I am confident.</p>

            . I am high constable of Isleworth. I apprehended the prisoner on the Thursday, in the middle of the day. Mr. Fowler had given me some information, and I apprehended the prisoner in the tap-room of the New Hotel, public-house, at Brentford - I took him and his brother there. I searched the prisoner there, but found nothing on him. I did not, myself, search the tap-room - I was present at his examination before the Magistrate; the examination was taken down. I saw part of two spoons which were produced by Honeybone, and Henderson produced the top of one, which matched with one of those produced by Honeybone. I have them here, and produce them - I have also brought a spoon from Mrs. Goodenough's house.</p>

            . I am a sawyer. I was in the tap of the New Hotel, public-house, on Thursday night the 13th of March, and saw the top of a spoon found there, near the fire-place. I was not present when the prisoner was apprehended, it was afterwards. Swaite picked it up and gave it to me - I gave it to Honeybone next day, and am certain the same was produced before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found part of a spoon when the prisoner was not present? A. Yes; I saw it found. I saw Swaite take it up - I did not see it on the ground; I first saw it in his hand - he is not here; and was not before the Magistrate - he is a journeyman blacksmith. I saw him stoop and pick something up; he gave it to me directly - his face was towards me when he stooped; he was sitting down on the bench; he stooped, and rose up before I saw the spoon - there was several more persons in the house; they were hard working men - how long the prisoner had left the room, I do not know.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HONEYBONE. Here is the spoon which matches the top. I am certain they have formed one spoon - the stamp and letter at the back correspond with the top part and the letter K. - the initials S.F.G. are on it.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL GOODENOUGH. My father's name was Samuel. Here is an entire spoon, which is my mother's, and has the same initials on it; it is one of the same sort - this was not stolen. The curet tops are too much disfigured to be identified - they have been defaced by violence not by wear I have no doubt they are the same; they are exactly the same size, and appearance as my mother's.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST to THOMAS HONEYBONE. Q. How does the top of this spoon fit? A. Silver is of that nature it must be wrenched backwards and forwards, before it can be separated - it has been chopped first with some blunt instrument. I have no doubt of their being parts of the same spoon - I cannot fit them exactly, it would be impossible. I kept them in my possession till morning, and then took them to Mr. Fowler, thinking they were stolen from him.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. From your knowledge of such things are you able to say, they are parts of the same spoon? A. They certainly are.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The first time the property was brought up, it was taken to Mrs. Goodenough's - Cooke brought it back, saying she could not identify it - and at the second examination, Mr. Goodenough said he could only swear to the bit of the spoon, which was marked. I was at home and a bed, at the time of the robbery.</p>

            . I live at Old Brentford, opposite the gas-light - the prisoner and his wife lodge on the same floor as I do. On the night of Sunday, the 10th of March, I saw him come in between ten and eleven o'clock. I saw him go up-stairs, and go out next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday night? A. On the Sunday night - the night of the robbery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What night do you swear to? A. Sunday night; he did not go out till the morning, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember where he was on the Monday night? A. No.</p>
               <p> - SAUNDERS. I live at Old Brentford, opposite Montgomery's timber yard. When I was at work in Kent with the prisoner, he bought two spoons, very much beat about - they were mustard spoons; this was the middle of last summer. I do not know what he did with them, but he said he thought he might get 1s. by selling them in town. I looked at them, but did not notice whether they were marked; they were not half a minute in my hand - he never told me what he had done with them. I should not know them again - he bought them about a mile and a half from Farningham.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Were you present at the purchase? A. Yes; I was never in trouble myself. I will swear that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The property was taken off to Mrs. Goodenough, and they have been broken off since; they sent over to the witness, to say, if he did not swear my life away, he should not do another day's work.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

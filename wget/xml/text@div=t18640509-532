                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi> 247). Previous to Saturday, 30th April, I had received instructions to watch Mr. Sims's premises in Aldersgate-street—I was in company with Pavitt on that morning, and saw Ansell and Beaumont—Ansell went to the premises about ten minutes past 6, and went up the yard adjoining—he had a white cap on, and was in his shirt sleeves—about five or ten minutes afterwards I saw Beaumont—he had his coat on and an apron—he went up the yard and I lost sight of him—about ten minutes after, perhaps, I saw him come out of the same yard, and go down Aldersgate-street—he had a load on his back, wrapped up in a blanket, and tied round with a rope—I followed him, and he went to Mr. Pedrolli's house in Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell, about ten minutes' walk from the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's place—he got there, as near as I can say, about half-past 6, or a little more—the shutters of Pedrolli's shop were down—I could not see whether the door was open—I saw Beaumont go to the door—I did not see that he knocked—he went apparently right in, with the glasses in his arms—he had them on his back first, but he lifted them off his back at the corner of Albion-place, and put them under his arm—I waited till he came out, which was in about three or four minutes—he then had only the covering of the things under his arm—he went up Albion-place, up St. John's-Iane, and into a public-house at the corner of Peter's-lane—I there lost sight of him—he was then in his shirt sleeves—when he went into the gateway he had his coat on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City detective—about Half-past 5 on Monday, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> May, I went with Rowland, Pavitt, and Mr. Sims, to Pedrolli's residence, 45, Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell—he is a looking-glass manufacturer in a small way—I saw Pedrolli there—I told him that I and Rowland were officers, and said, "You can please yourself whether you answer some ques-tions I am about to put to you"—I said, "You had some property brought here on Saturday-morning by a man named Beaumont, which was stolen from Mr. Sims's premises; this is Mr. Sims, and Beaumont and another man are now in custody for robbing him, and remanded"—he hesitated, seemed very much agitated, and trembled and said, 'No, I did not"—I said, "Be careful what you say, for this witness (pointing to Rowland) saw Beaumont come in about half-past 6 in the morning"—after another pause he said, "Well, yes I did, I bought four plates, and there they are at that end of the warehouse; I gave 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for them"—we had examined the plates at that time—Mr. Sims turned to him and said, "You know you have not given half the price for them; you know they are worth more than double"—I said, "Did you question the person from whom you got them?"—he said, "No, I bought them as a job lot"—I said, "Have you any receipt of the transaction?"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said "Have you any book at all relating to it?"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "I shall be compelled to take you into custody for receiving property, knowing it to have been stolen"—he said, "Oh, don't do that; I will give the property up"—he said that several times—these are the plates (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I searched the premises—I did not find any book.</p>

                  </hi>. I superintend the silvering department of Mr. Sims's business—I have seen these plates, they are my employer's property—I stated that they were worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, but I think it is some-thing less than that—as far as I know that is the price in the trade; I don't know the exact price—they are perfect as regards the silvering, but two of them are wet, hardly in a fit state to send out—plates are never sent out from our establishment in that state; they are never sold in that state—my own handwriting is on them—that is what enables me to say they are my master's property—I examined the stock about three days before this; and examined the wet stock after I had been to Mr. Pedrolli's, and found a space where two had been taken from.</p>

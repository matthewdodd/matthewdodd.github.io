               <p>Did she say how she came by it? - We knew they were put in the place in the shop in the morning, ready for the boy when he came; I saw her produce the pot and put it down in the shop.</p>
               <p>When first you saw it in her possession did she hold it open or was it concealed? - It was concealed in this manner, as though I had a quart pot under my clothes.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - She said she did it for want: it is the property of

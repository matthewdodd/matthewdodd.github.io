            . I am a Merchant's watchman. I lost a hogshead of tobacco out of a lighter, that lay along side of a ship at King Edward's stairs Wapping; the ship was bound to France.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of tobacco did the hogshead contain?</p>
               <p>Lake. It contained seven hundred three quarters and eighteen pounds; I had word brought me the next morning that there was an empty hogshead at King James's stairs; I went and found it to be one that I was in charge of; then I went and looked in the lighter, and found one was gone; then I was informed there was some tobacco scattered about at the stairs at Shadwell. I got two parish officers and searched all day, but found nothing; we beset the place all night; the next morning we went to searching a great many houses, but found nothing that day; the next morning I had information brought me; that there had been some tobacco brought to a house in new Gravel-lane; the person's name is Webster; the constable and I went there, and found some and took it away to the Custom-House. I was told that the prisoner had been there that morning, and had taken some money of Mrs Webster for some tobacco. I went and took her up, and Justice Berry committed her for further examination; I think the day after she was committed, we found the remainder of the tobacco in an empty house, joining to the prisoner's apartment; there was between five and six hundred weight of it, and a ladder standing in her yard that went up in at a window into the empty house. The tobacco is of the same quality of that which I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner a husband?</p>
               <p>Lake. She has: I took him up; but I left him in charge of two men, and he got from them out at the door of the house, and at the same time she was going to get out at the window.</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar came to Mrs Webster's on the 8th of June last, in the morning, and asked for a half-pennyworth of snuff; I saw her bring no tobacco in, neither did I see any money paid, but I heard money chink while the prisoner and Mrs Webster were in the little back room together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live with Mrs Webster?</p>
               <p>White. No; she lives at the lower end of the lane, and I at the upper end of it; but I happened to be there at that time; in the afternoon she came again and asked for Mrs Webster; I said, she was not within; she look'd me full in the face, and said, she hoped Mrs Webster would not come into trouble about the tobacco.</p>

            . On the 8th of June last Mrs. Chambers came to my house, and asked me if I would buy a little tobacco; this was at nine in the morning; she had a man with her with a little bag of tobacco; she bid him go away, and I weighed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that man?</p>
               <p>Webster. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's husband?</p>
               <p>Webster. I do, it was not him, it was a stranger that brought it; we weighed it at three times; the first time twenty pounds, the next thirty-four pounds, and the next twenty-one pounds, which I paid her for at six pence halfpenny a pound; then she went away and soon returned with some more in her apron, which weighed eighteen pounds; I paid her for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you which way she came by it?</p>
               <p>Webster. No; she did not, she said, I should come into no trouble in buying it of her; she had an acquaintance among the sailors, and it might be the sailors for what I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lake. Did you see the prisoner near the lighter from whence the tobacco was taken.</p>
               <p>Lake. No, I did not.</p>

I was alone when I first met them; I was passing by them, and they said, I had shot a dog, and with that they hit me on the face; then they wanted me to go back, and fight, which I declined, and then the prisoner came up, and hit me; then I ran down from the River, and jumped over, into a lane, and he pursued me. I jumped over a hedge and ditch; he pursued me alone; he then overtook me, and threw me into a ditch which runs by the side of the lane. I then got out, and he knocked me down again. He then held me until several others came up, and helped him to hold me; there were ten I dare say. I saw him distinctly put his hand into my pocket, and I missed the watch directly afterwards; it was my right hand breeches pocket; I had eight shillings; then they kicked me. The prisoner continued with them. After they kicked me, I got up, and walked away. In the scuffle, I missed the watch; but can't exactly say who took that; I can't exactly tell the moment when I lost it; it was in the lane; I am certain I had it before I was knocked down in the lane, and I lost it while they were striking and beating me in the lane. Then I got up, and walked straight to the Sluice House back again; they did not pursue me. I saw Jefferson, the officer, about five minutes afterwards; I communicated to him what had passed. Then I went across the fields, towards Hornsey Wood; I afterwards saw the officers Vaughan and Rice; I went with them back towards the Sluice House; I saw the prisoner at the bar again that day; I can't say exactly how soon; but they overtook him just before he came to the Barley Mow, at Islington, about two miles from the Sluice House; he was in company with two or three girls at the time, and several persons together. I knew him again; he was pointed out before I got up. I never saw my watch since. I look at the prisoner, and I have not the least doubt about him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. There were several persons in the fields, and they accused me of shooting a dog; I had not shot one. I carry a gun about the fields some times, and go fishing some times. Some words ensued, but not on my side. There were many persons round me at the time. I did not fight. I believe I had about nine shillings about me when I went out; I had felt my money in my pocket, and buttoned my pocket. I don't believe the money could have tumbled out of my pocket. I had had this watch some months; I don't know whether my father knew of it.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. The prisoner pursued me alone, before the rest came up; it was but a short time before they came up.</p>

            . I belong to Bow-street. I happened to be out on the morning of the 7th of April; Vaughan and Rice were not with me; they were at Hornsey Wood House. I saw forty or fifty persons that morning. I saw the prosecutor, Edward Cherry, going over a hedge and ditch, into a lane; it was between nine and ten; he was running. I saw the prisoner and a woman pass me at the corner; they were running also. I observed the prisoner hit the prosecutor, and knock him down in the lane. The woman said, go it Frank, that is him that killed the dog. The prosecutor got up, and was knocked down again by the same person; then about twenty more surrounded him. I saw something resembling a watch in some person hand; I was about the length of this court from them. It was thrown up in the hand from the person who was down, and it appeared at that distance like a watch. Then they all left him, and went away, and came by me; and the prosecutor came up to me, and said, he had been robbed; I told him I knew that. I told him I could not assist him by myself; but I sent him up to Hornsey Wood House for Vaughan and other officers. I mentioned Vaughan's name; he went as I desired, and he returned in about twenty minutes, with Vaughan and Rice. I then went along with them until they came to Highbury-barn; I went down the terrace, and they went across the fields. I was not present at the apprehension of the prisoner; I am positive of his person.</p>

There are many innocent individuals go out on that day for their recreation. I suppose there might be two hundred persons out in the fields. I heard the woman urge the prisoner to beat the prosecutor on account of killing a dog. I I saw something in a man's hand, which I thought was a watch, though it might be a snuff-box, or something of that kind.</p>

            . I am a police officer of Bow-street. The prosecutor came up to me at Hornsey House, and I and Rice went with him, first to the Sluice House, and afterwards across the fields, in company with two persons named Smith; Jefferson continued with us for some distance, and the two Smith's continued with us. About fifty yards off, just crossing the Ball's Pond-road, I saw the prisoner in company with three or four more; he was in company with a girl; he was pointed out to me by both the Smith's; Cherry, the prosecutor, was there. The two Smith's got up first, and then the prosecutor came running up, and cried, that is the man, that is the man, the moment he saw him. We took the prisoner and the girl. Cherry charged him with robbing him, and knocking him down, and the prisoner denied it. I searched the prisoner, and found eight shillings and sixpence on him; I can't say exactly how that amount was made up. The money was produced before the magistrate, and the prosecutor could not identify it.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. I have got eight shillings and sixpence; but not the identical eight shillings and sixpence that I took from the prisoner; I don't say positively but that the amount might be made up by three shilling pieces, and eighteen-penny pieces and sixpences. I know nothing about shooting a dog.</p>

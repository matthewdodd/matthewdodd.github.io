               <p>Jane Richards. She robbed me the Day after Michaelmas-Day; I left the Key in my Kitchen-Door, she opened it, and went in; it was between 4 and 5 in the Afternoon, to the best of my Knowledge. I lost 2 Gowns, one was Linnen, the other was a Danjan, a white Dimitty Wastcoat, 2 Holland Shirts, 4 little Boy's Shirts, 5 Aprons, a Lining of a Gown, and a Hat. I can't remember any Thing else, though I have lost a great many Things which are not set down. The Prisoner came to help her Mother, who is a poor Labourer's Wife, in with some Goods, and while I was gone up into my one pair of Stairs Room to make my Bed, she broke the Lock of the Door, and took my Goods: her Mother saw her carry them away in her Lap. I found nothing upon her when she was taken, for she dropped these Things; I did not see her drop them, but I afterwards found them in the Castle-Tavern Back-Door-Passage, in Fleet-Street, which is just by my House. The Prisoner was taken the Wednesday Night following, in Fleet-Market; I charged her with robbing me, at first she deny'd it, but afterwards confessed, and and said, that the Devil hope (helped) her to break the Lock.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner's Mother. I saw my Daughter go through the Castle-Tavern, in Fleet-Street, with a Bundle in her Apron.</p>

I struggled with him, and in struggling, he twisted my hand, and broke the string, which was wrapt round my fingers. He had hold or my hand to get the string away. I was struggling with him half a minute. He immediately ran across the road.

            . I am a watchman. I heard a great screaming as I was crying the hour of half past nine o'clock. I heard the cry of stop thief; I ran through York passage, into Weston-street, Pentonville; the prisoner was running and several persons after him; and there was a cry of stop thief. I ran immediately to meet him, and he got into the middle of the road; I threw my rattle at his head, which I am not possitive hit him; but I rather think it did; for his hat immediately fell, and the ridicule fell out of it. I picked them up, and delivered them afterwards to Mr. Read.</p>

            , JUN. I am an officer of Hatton Garden. I heard an alarm of stop thief, in Weston-street, and the prisoner ran by the gate where I was standing. He had his hat on then; a great quantity of people was running after him. I came up and took him into custody, when the watchman delivered these things to me at the same time that I took him.</p>

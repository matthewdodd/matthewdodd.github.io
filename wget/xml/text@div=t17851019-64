               <p>Did you make any threatening that you would send them to the Compter if they would not confess? - Nothing of that sort, they offered to replace it, but I would not left them.</p>
               <p>There were no promises or threats? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190105"></xptr> None at all; I went up to the top of the house, I did not chuse to venture out, but one of the workmen went, he is not here.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday evening last a little after five, I was sitting at the window at work, at the upper part of the house, and looking through the window, I saw two men on the roof of the house, next to that which was repairing; I looked at them, I saw one of them get on the prosecutor's house, and the roof being so narrow he could not walk on it, he got astride on the roof, and hitched himself on, when he came close to the chimney he slid himself down, and there was a large sheet of lead, which lay between the roof of the house, and the chimney, he began to pull that off, then I watched him, and he had like to have been down in the street, he slid down half a yard till his foot catched at an arch of the chimney, then he recovered himself and went to it again, and got it quite off, then he folded it up, and handed it to the other prisoner, and he put it into the garret window.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing these men? - Yes, I looked through the window, and to be more particular, I opened the door of the leads of our house, and then I could see them more perfectly, they are the two prisoners, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>How wide is the street across that you saw them? - It is Fish-street hill, it is not a broad street.</p>
               <p>Court to Davis. What quantity of lead was taken? - Thirty-seven pounds, I saw it weighed, I saw the lead in the house down stairs, I did not compare it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was ordered by my master to repair this first old house, to make that tyling good, and so I was going along the gutter and I saw this bit of lead lay so I took it up, and put it into the garret window for safety till my master came.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Warren called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Callen called one witnesses to his character.</p>

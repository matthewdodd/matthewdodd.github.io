            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I went out with my husband about half-past three o'clock, and returned in about half an hour; when I came home I found many persons about the house - when I got in I found all my drawers had been opened and emptied; the property stated in the indictment was laying on the floor, but nothing taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any servant? A. No; nor any children except my grand-daughter, who lives with me - she is eight years of age; she was not in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you take the child out with you? A. No; I went out and locked my door, and when I got out, I met the child in about one minute, and took her with me - I left her with my husband, and came home alone.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and lived in York-street, Stepney, about five minutes walk from Mr. Jefferys. On the 18th of April, about 4 o'clock, I was going home, and went to get a pint of beer; a person came and said there was a man in Mr. Jefferys'. I went there and saw a number of people - Mrs. Jefferys was trying to unlock the door, but she could not - I asked her to let me break the window and get in, which I did; I went in and found two silk handkerchiefs on the parlour-floor - I went up stairs and found the things scattered on the floor - I searched the house, and saw some soot which had come down one of the chimneys. I took the prisoner down from that chimney, and I delivered him to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you entered the house, the door was shut, and the window shut down? A. Yes; I was obliged to ask leave to break the window to get in; whether the prisoner got in before the woman and her grand-daughter went out, and secreted himself, I cannot say - the front door was bolted inside, which was the reason Mrs. Jefferys could not get in.</p>

            . I live in Portugal-place, Dog-row, opposite Mr. Jefferys. On the 18th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at his door - he knocked several times, and no one answered - he then introduced something into the key-hole - he made two or three attempts, and appeared to fail, but the last attempt he made he opened the door and went in - he shut the door after him; I went out and informed the neighbours what had occurred, and several of them collected at the back and front of the house - in the mean time Fortune and Mr. Jefferys arrived - I understood Mr. Dale got in at the window but I was at the back of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the prisoner's back towards you? A. No; he turned his face several times - I am sure he is the man; I saw nothing in his hand - he had his hat on - my house is twenty or thirty yards from Mr. Jefferys'; I was in my house, and saw him through a window - my wife was at a window which was open, and saw him better than I did - she is not here; the prisoner was at the door from seven to ten minutes - he looked round, and I saw him plainly; I have heard he is married, and has two children.</p>

            . I was at Mr. Jefferys' house on the 18th of April, between four and five o'clock; I went into the bed-room on the first floor, and saw the prisoner along side of the bed, in custody of Fortune - the street-door was opened to me by Mr. Goodwyn; I have brought a box which I found turned up, with a few things at the bottom of it; I found this small chissel in between the sheets of the bed - it seems to fit the marks made on the box which was broken open.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I was at the prosecutor's house on the 18th of April, and found these skeleton keys, one of which opens the street-door, between the bed and the mattress in the first-floor room; it was then about half-past four or five o'clock; I got in at the window, and opened the door to Mr. Thompson - it was not bolted, it was only on the lock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was not then bolted? A. No; only on the lock; I was examined twice before the Magistrate; the first was a very short examination; I produced these keys then, as I do now - I was not then sworn; the first room I went into was the front parlour - I had not searched the other rooms before I saw the prisoner, he was then in custody of Fortune.</p>
               <p>Mrs. JEFFERYS re-examined. Q. Were there any picklock keys or chissel in that room when you went out? A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you turned the bed over? A. Yes - I do it every day; I turn the bed quite over, but not the mattress; I did not make my bed till late that day, for I had been washing; I never had any char-woman in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110065"></xptr>my life; I had been in my bed-room a minute before I went out - my drawers were then shut, but not locked.</p>
               <p>Mr. JEFFERYS re-examined. Q. Did you know of any skeleton keys or chissel being in that room? A. No; the value of this shawl is about 7s.</p>

            . I am an officer of Coleman street ward. On Monday, the 18th of June, soon after five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner with a load coming from the back part of Mr. Pollard's premises into Coleman-street, he crossed the street and went into Swan-alley; I followed him, he went into White's-alley. Coffee was four or five yards before me, he stopped him and took the load from him; the prisoner made no resistance; we found it to be cloth, about three quarters of a hundred weight. I asked the prisoner where he was going; he said he was carrying it to a man in Crown-court; I named the names of the men that lived in each house; he said, to Elliott. We took him to the Dolphin public house; I asked him if Mr. Pollard was up; he said, no. From his coming out of that part I supposed Mr. Pollard was his master; he did not deny it. I left the property at the Dolphin and went back to the house, and took the prisoner with me, and found the house left open; I let him go up stairs and I followed; I thought myself not safe, having no stick; I returned to the front door, I called him and he came down; when he came down his fellow servant came with him; the prisoner said, my fellow servant is innocent, I am guilty.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Coleman-street ward. On the morning of the 18th of June I saw the prisoner come out of Whitehorse-yard, Coleman-street, I followed him up Swan-alley; I laid hold of him in Printing-house-yard, I caught hold of the bundle, pulled it off his shoulder, and asked him if he had any bill of parcels; he said not. Mr. Wadman came up and took charge of him. He said he was going with it to Mr. Elliot's in Crown-court. Mr. Elliott, when he heard of this business, left his house two or three days.</p>

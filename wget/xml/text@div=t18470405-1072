                  </hi> I am a carman, and live at Stangate; the prisoners were in my employ. On the 5th of March I sent them with carts to Lambeth—they were to take three loads of sand each—I had some other business at Scotland-yard wharf—the prisoners ought to have arrived about six o'clock in the evening with their loads, and they came at past nine o'clock—I went to Scotland-yard, and found they had taken some sand from there—they had no business to take any from there—one of the horses, which was a vary valuable one, was ill from over-work.</p>

                  </hi> I am a lighterman, and live in Milbank-street. On Friday, the 5th of March, I came with a barge of sand to Scotland-yard wharf—I was in the cabin about half-past six o'clock in the afternoon, and Mark Grover cameon board—I asked him what barge he wanted—he said the one that Mr. Hearn was driving—I said, "This is it"—I went forward, and saw the wash-board up—Jones <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> it up and moved the fly-wheel—Grover then went down and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the sand from the hold, and Jones <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it from the barge into the cart—I said I supposed they wanted to get the barge out that night—they said, no—I saw one cart loaded and drawn away, and the other cart ser in, and the sand thrown into it—it was the sand of James Hayward and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi>Had there been other men taking sand that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, twenty—the prisoners came at half-past six or twenty minutes to seven o'clock—I had never seen them before—I can swear to them—one had a smock frock and a cap, and the other a hat, but I saw their faces—there was a white horse in the shafts and a black horse forwards—it was dark—the horse in the shafts looked white to me.</p>

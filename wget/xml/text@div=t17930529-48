Please you my lord, as I was going to London on Monday morning, I met the horse loose by the Butcher's at Bow, one rein was broke and the other was loose, so I took hold of him and led him along for about half a mile, and then I wanted to do a job by myself,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290099"></xptr>and then the other rein broke for I thought to take him to the Pound.</p>

Sayer, at Winchmore-hill? - I never told him so, I went to a house close by Mr. Barnet's and asked if they knew the horse? and asked the turnpike man and enquired of every body that I saw and nobody knew him.</p>

Gentlemen: The prisoner stands indicted now for a capital offence, for being found at large after the sentence of transportation: There is a defect in the evidence we are not prepared to prove it regularly, therefore he must be acquitted of the capatal part of the charge, but having confessed himself to be the person who was sentenced to transportation; he must remain on his former sentence.</p>

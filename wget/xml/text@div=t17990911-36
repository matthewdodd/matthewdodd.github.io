             sworn. - I keep a sale-shop, I am the wife of Charles Pead: On Friday the 19th of July, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I lost an oiled silk umbrella from near the door, it was hung up for sale; I was behind the counter, and heard something in the street, I came out, and saw the prisoner standing at the window; I suspected him, having seen him several times before; I then heard the ring of the umbrella against the hook it hung upon; I immediately looked up, and saw the umbrella go off the hook; I ran round the counter, as quick as I could, to the door, and saw the prisoner at the bar with the umbrella under him arm, about three or four yards from the door; I then called my husband, who was coming down stairs, and I shewed him the prisoner with the umbrella, and he pursued him; he had thrown the umbrella away before my husband came up; this is the umbrella, I have kept it separate from the others ever since.</p>

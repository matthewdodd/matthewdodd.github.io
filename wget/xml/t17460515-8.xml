            .) Did you lose any Thing on the 31st of March?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Please you, my Lord, I went to Bed, and this young Woman I thought was going to Bed, too. She was with me four Days and no more.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, what happen'd?</p>
               <p>Taylor. At Night I went to Bed, and thought that she was going to bed. In the Morning, when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174605150015"></xptr> I got up, the Door was open, and she had not been in Bed: I had great Reason to suspect that she was the Person that got the Things; and she never came any more.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I miss'd four Napkins, Shift-Sleeves, a Gold Ring, one Silver Salt, taken out of the Children's Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find her out?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Please you, my Lord, she was taken in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you charge her?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Please you, my Lord, there was one Mrs. Ashly who came to see me on Easter-Monday; she took her with a Hat upon her Head, which she own'd was mine; with that she sent for me; and when I came, the Prisoner confess'd that she was in Liquor when she did it, or she should not have done it; which I believe. She said, she sat down at the End of Field-Alley to sleep, and the Ring was taken out of her Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any of the Things that you are sure are your's ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes, here's the Hat; as for the Gold Ring, she says that she has lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any Thing of the Napkins again?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Only one old one that the Gown was wrapt up in.</p>

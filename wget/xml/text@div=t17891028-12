               <p>I am a watchman; last Saturday was a week, I was coming my round, front the prosecutor's house; I found his parlour window broke open, and I put my light into the window, and alarmed them.</p>
               <p>- TREADWAY sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 17th of October, the prosecutor came to me; I went with him, and took the prisoners into custody; and found this property there; two coats and waistcoats, and a pair of breeches, was found at Duke's lodgings, with his father, near Exeter-change concealed under the stair-case; the mussin man took me to his apartments; I took the mussin man first; and I found these halfpence, and a shilling, in Duke's pocket; here is a remarkable shilling, which I put by itself.</p>
               <p>Mrs. M'Carty. This is the shilling I produce; here are the two places I bit in it, that I might know it the next day; it is plain to be seen; I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>(Handed to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>This is the money I took out of Duke's pocket; M'Carty said, that is mine; and Duke said, a young woman gave it me at your house; on the man, Richardson, I found two half crown pieces.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner owned this to be mine before the constable.</p>

               <p>I took them two half crowns in the morning; one opposite Beaufort-buildings, and the other I changed at Norfolk-street; my master is here; I am innocent of the fact; and my landlady let me into my lodging at a little past twelve, and a man that I lodge with; Treadway told Mrs. M'Carty to mark the edge of them half crowns again, so that she might know them; there were two shillings and ten-pence halfpenny on me; and I told them to keep that also, and they would not.</p>
               <p>Court to Treadway. Did Mrs. M'Carty mark these half crowns according to your directions? - No; she did not know them; the prisoner told me he changed them in Norfolk-street in the Strand.</p>

               <p>I was going to Newgate-market to buy some things in the morning; but the country-men not being up, I came back with the money; and these two men came and took me; the things were not found in our room.</p>

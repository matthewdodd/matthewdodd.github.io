I had a pair of sash cills cut in the last week of October, and laid them in the timber-yard. On the 19th of November, I received information, and missed them, I found them at Grinder's, Hornsey-road. In consequence of what he said, I went to the prisoner Eyres's house, and as the officers entered the door, I saw Powell escape by the back window, and run across the field; we stopped him. Eyres was taken on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you call them cills - A. They are cut in the rough for cills, we call them cills, they are 11 feet long.</p>

            . I am a wheelwright, and live in the Hornsey-road. Powell asked me to make him a cart, and he would find the timber; and on Saturday evening, the 16th of November, he sent two pieces of oak, and said they were to make the shafts with. He came to me and said he had laid them in my yard, and asked me to put them into my shop, and on Monday morning I found they were sash cills, and immediately suspected they were stolen. He was at my shop on Monday and Tuesday mornings - I told him they would not do for the shafts - he told me to cut them up and make the body of the cart with them; the cills laid before us all the time. I went for Mr. Viney, who took them away that evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there no other wood laying about - A. Yes, but it was all mine. I had hold of these cills at the time we were talking about them.</p>

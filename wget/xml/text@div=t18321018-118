            . I am ostler at the Nightingale tavern, Lisson-grove. I was there in the beginning of February, 1830 - I had known the prisoner a long time, and knew Moffat; I recollect the prisoner coming two days successively, to look at some horses which Moffat brought there; I cannot say what day it was, but I know they had been two days before the prisoner saw them - one of them had a mark on one quarter, and a bad hough; I saw Moffat lead them out, and show them to the prisoner - I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180065"></xptr>see any money paid, but Moffat fetched them from the stable, and I never saw them again.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were they horses or mares? A. I cannot exactly say - I think Moffat used to come about eleven or twelve o'clock in the day; it was in 1830 - it might be in January; it was not so late as March - the horses were there about four days; they came on a Wednesday, and the prisoner came to see them on the Friday; Moffat had been there a great many times with horses - I had known him nine or ten months; I had never seen the prisoner before nor since; Moffat had a cart, with the name of Thomas Moffat, Reading, Berks, on it - he said he had been into the country for a fortnight before this, to fetch horses; I told the Magistrate I did not know the colour of this horse, but when I came to see her, I knew her by the marks.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long ago was this? A. I should think very near three years - it is between two and three years; it was the latter end of January or beginning of February - I had known the prisoner by seeing him at repositories and other places; there were several persons in the parlour when the money was paid - persons who buy horses at fairs do not take receipts for them.</p>

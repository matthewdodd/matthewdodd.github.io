                  </hi>. I am a labourer, in the employ of the East and West India Dock Company. I work at the warehouse of the Company, in Jewry-street, Aldgate—it was part of my duty to hand trays of samples to brokers or their clerks who came to look at samples of indigo—there was a show of indigo there on Monday, 5th May, prior to the public sales—they generally came on after the show—I was employed on that day handing trays of samples to the different brokers who came to look at them—I knew the prisoner, as attending the shows for inspecting the indigo—I was placed there that day by the foreman, to watch him—he came about 9 o'clock that morning—three of us go round to one gentleman—I was selected by the foreman, to stand at the table, which is about two feet and a half wide, as near as I can guess—we generally work ten trays; four of them are at the table, three the men had got who draw the indigo from the chest, and three the men who bring them up to the table—one draws out of the chest, one takes them up to the table, and a man stands at the table, and hands them to the gentleman—about four trays are on the table at the same time, sometimes more—the end of the table comes against the window—there is a screen at the side of it, and there is a table to hold the trays, which are full, and hare not been seen, and the returns are placed on the same table—the party who comes to look at the samples of indigo sits at the table—I have a tray, which I hand to him—as soon as he has seen one tray, I pass that to the end of the table, and pass the other up which he has not seen; I pass that back, and hand him up another, which is one of the four or the six behind; some<lb></lb>times</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185106160034"></xptr>
               <p>there are four, sometimes six—that is not the table where the broker sits, but another table by the side, on which the trays stand, a side table—I take a tray from it, and hand it <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the broker for inspection—there are some<lb></lb>times two, sometimes three trays at a time at the table where the broker sits; only one man hands trays to that table—when Mr. Curtis came on this day to examine the samples, he had a box and a paper parcel; they con<lb></lb>tained what are called guides—the custom is for the broker to compare the samples shown him from the chest, with his guides—the prisoner came at 9 o'clock, and I began to hand him trays of samples at about 20 minutes to 10—I handed him a tray of samples from chest 6009—the lot 6009 was marked on the tray—he took a piece out of it, and laid it on the window<lb></lb>ledge by his side—the table is near the window, for light—his guide-box and paper were then on the ledge of the window—he kept the piece of indigo there about an hour and a half or nearly two hours, till we went on to the first-floor; we were then on the second—he ordered me to take it down, with the other samples—he first went on the second-floor, and saw all he had to see by the catalogues—I showed him some other trays after 6009—he took a piece from lot 6029; that was on the second-floor—I went on showing him others, and he took a piece from lot 6050; I then carried his samples down to the first-floor—I took the pieces he had taken from the different trays, by his direction—on the first-floor I saw him take another piece from lot 95—he took no other pieces but what I have mentioned—be left somewhere, about 3 o'clock—when I brought down the three pieces to the first-floor, which he desired me to bring down from the second, I placed them on the window; he did not desire me to hide them—these are the four pieces he took (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is a washing-room, where the gentlemen wash their hands after looking at the indigo—before Mr. Curtis left to wash his hands, he put two of the pieces of indigo in the box, and two on the paper where his samples were lying; he ordered me then to tie the parcel up, and bring his box and the parcel to him in the washing-room; instead of doing that, I went down-stairs with it—Mr. Cooper, the foreman, was at the bottom of the steps—I communicated to him what had passed—one of these pieces has a brand, or mark, on it, "J. S. P."—some of the guides are larger, and some smaller than these pieces; some are about the same size—the prisoner was sent for by Mr. Cooper, and Mr. Williams sent for him from the refreshment-room, or he called him in—I took the box and parcel to Mr. Cooper—this is the box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were vacant spaces to put the lumps in—these are about the size of the pieces; some were a great deal smaller—all the guides have a price on them, but they are not all so in this box—I should say there were twenty here—all in this box have not a mark—the price is marked on the guides for the purpose of testing the indigo which is shown by me to the brokers—the price is not on all—it is convenient for a man to have the price on the sample he brings, to match against the other.</p>

               <p>handed samples in that way to others, but not very often, handing the trays to the table—the prisoner is the first person who has taken samples from trays, and desired me to bring them down to the floor beneath—I never saw it done before to my knowledge, and never knew it done—it did not surprise meat all—I have often worked for the prisoner before—he has attended the sales twelve months, or it might be more, I cannot say exactly—he was con<lb></lb>stantly attending them—neither with him or anybody else has this happened before to my knowledge—most of the brokers who come have a box of this kind, some larger and some smaller—I never saw one much smaller; they are generally larger—some brokers bring some samples in paper as well, and some do not—we bring out the samples on trays—the indigo is contained in chests in the warehouse—there are thousands of chests there—we do not count the samples we put into the trays to hand to the brokers, it is impos<lb></lb>sible—we do not count the number of samples in the box of the person who comes to sample—a tray contains about eight or nine squares of indigo—I did not count the number of samples the prisoner had in his box—for the purpose of trying the indigo, they have to take it up and break it—they break the samples in half, and are allowed to do so—indigo is discoloured outside by handling it—it is so coppery that, to know what it is, you must break it—the person sometimes breaks it to see the quality, but in general we get fresh pieces from the chest—we very seldom let the old pieces serve for anybody else—we have to go to the back of the chest to get fresh pieces out—when a clerk is there to examine samples, he takes out one of his own samples and examines it with the sample produced by us—the piece be takes from the trays he puts in again, and the piece he takes from the box he lays on the window along with the original piece—that is what ought to be done—in the general course, it would be his own piece which would be laid on the window—I do not know how many samples there were in tray 6009 when it was produced to him—I do not know bow many there were in the tray at the end of the show; I did not examine—I am able to say one of his samples did not get into the tray, because I was watching for the purpose, and was placed there by the foreman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having been put there to watch, do yon mean to say you did not examine the number of pieces before you showed it, and after you showed it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not; I was present at the table the whole time, within a few minutes, while the prisoner went to lunch, at 12 o'clock—he was there without me for five minutes—when he went to lunch, the pieces were left in the window, without the least concealment—I did not point them out to any<lb></lb>body—I stopped on the floor while my two partners went to lunch—the prisoner went to lunch about 12 o'clock from the first-floor—he came down about a quarter to 12 from the second-floor—I did not call his attention to the samples—when I got them down to the first floor they were laid on the window again, the place where his own samples were usually put—he did not pay me for my trouble—he might have paid the man in the washing-room—I got my 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I believe the other people got 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; each; that is usual from the brokers—the four pieces of indigo are worth about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner is the clerk to a respectable broker, a man who has been at the warehouse for years—I recollect him about twelve months—the weight of the indigo is 11 1/2 oz.—this box is not in the state it was when he brought it; it was full when he brought it—something happened to it on 3rd May—I suppose it to contain something which was received on 3rd May—he did not take the box away on that occasion—he left it there, with neither lock or key—it was in the washing-room—I do not think anybody could examine it—I cannot say</p>

               <p>what was to prevent them—the brokers go into the washing-room, and to do the workmen—I take the box in—it was not placed there by me that day, but by the man who was showing him that day—sometimes there are thirty Or forty boxes left there—I took the box to the second-floor warehouse for him, in the state in which I found it—it is left in the washing-room on the dock premises in the ordinary course of business.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When do they take the box away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At different times; sometimes they have it away between one sale and another—there are other pieces besides guides in the box—it was left on the 3rd, and remained till the 5th—I took the means to be correct about the numbers of the trays—I put the lots from which he took a piece on the top of my cap—I was put there specially to watch Mr. Curtis, and acted according to the orders given to me by my foreman—if I see any broker take a piece from the tray, my duty is to tell him I cannot allow it; if I do, I shall get myself into trouble—I never allowed any of the brokers to take samples from the trays except on this occasion, then I had my orders.</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal warehouse-keeper at the town ware-house of the East and West India Docks, in Jewry-street. In consequence of information given to me, there was a sample-box or guide-box and guide-paper brought into the refreshment-room—I and Mr. Cooper went to the refreshment-room—the prisoner was invited to come into the room—I laid my hand on the paper which was laid on the top of the guide-box, and said, "Does this paper and box belong to you?"—he said it did—I said, "Do they contain anything which you did not bring in with you?"—his answer was "No"—I said I was sorry to tell him that was not the fact—I am not quite certain whether I asked his permission or refusal to their being opened, but they were opened with his concurrence and in his presence, by Marks, who proceeded to select two pieces of indigo out of the box, and two out of the paper, and named the lot from which each came; the prisoner pointed to three of them, and said, "Those three I brought with me"—they were set apart from the rest—he said he did not know how the fourth came there, and disclaimed any knowledge of it; there is a figure on it in pencil—I did not touch the indigo at all—I do not identify any piece—I said it would be necessary for him to go with me to the secretary of the Dock-house—he went with me—the four pieces of indigo were taken there too, by Marks, who had them in his custody—I know of no authority to brokers or brokers' clerks to take away from the warehouse, or put into their guide-box or guide-paper, any pieces of indigo—the prisoner was then taken to the Dock-house in Billiter-square.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a comb-maker, and live in Union-court, Fashion-street, Spitalfields. I knew the deceased, Elizabeth Mary Oliver, for two, three, or perhaps four months—I know the prisoner also—On Saturday night, the 12th of March, I was at the Catherine-wheel public-house in Essex-street, Whitechapel, as near twelve o'clock as I can say—the pri<lb></lb>soner and the deceased were both there—I saw the deceased dancing, and saw her drink some spirits with a man—the prisoner drank some beer—I did not see the deceased leave the public-house—I saw her again, near twelve o'clock, standing outside on the footpath; and about a minute after I saw the prisoner; just at the side of me, making to run—he was one or two yards from her—he put his hand up and gave her a push—I thought it was not with any violence—I thought it was on the back part of her neck—she fell on receiving the push—I went towards Whitechapel, and the prisoner came directly after me—two or three people were round the de<lb></lb>ceased, picking her up—the prisoner did not say a word when he came up to me, but going along Whitechapel either he or I said, "I think she is hurt with the fall"—she had fallen on her face, and, I thought, more I on her right side than her left—I do not know whether she was drunk or sober—she did not make any struggle—she fell rather heavy on the ground, like people do who are in liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Brick-lane. I examined the body of the deceased on the Wednesday following the Saturday—in my opinion her death was caused by an extensive extravasation of blood in the upper portion of the spinal marrow, in the base of the brain—those symp<lb></lb>toms might be caused by a blow or fall, or it is possible they might have arisen without violence—when I examined the body it was in a state of decomposition—a general concussion of the body might have caused extra<lb></lb>vasation, or a blow in any part of the skull might produce it—the body was not in a state to enable me to see whether there was a bruise in that part of the neck—the decomposition would have prevented my seeing it if there was one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might the appearance at the back of the neck be produced by long, irregular, intemperate habits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have said it is possible it might have arisen from other causes—it might certainly have arisen from general habits of intemperance, which might be reckoned a pre<lb></lb>disposing cause.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Union-street. I examined the body of the deceased in company with Mr. Mean—I have heard him explain the immediate cause of death, and agree with him—I conclude the appearances I saw, arose from a blow—such appearances are not usual from natural causes—a case of apoplexy might produce it—a blow on the nape of the neck I suppose would cause such appearances—there was no external marks perceptible on the back of the body—while Mr. Mears was giving his evidence before the Coroner, I was cleaning the body and sowing it up, and I saw a mark on the nose which had escaped our notice, which I suppose was caused by a fall—the body was in a remarkable state of de<lb></lb>composition, considering death had happened so recently—that would probably arise from her course of life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Particularly in a person addicted to drinking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I think it probable the appearances might have arisen without any blow at all, but it is not a usual part for extravasation which follow! apoplexy, to be found—drinking very often leads to apoplexy—I think it more probable the extravasation would be on the brain itself, instead of on the spine, if caused by apoplexy—but it is not impossible that might have occurred—I think it improbable.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a blow given on the nape of the neck, must it have been violent to produce the extravasation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It need not be very violent, but it must have been an unexpected blow—I think a push could not have produced it—if she fell with violence on the front part of her head, it would be usual to find the extravasation on the back of the neck—that is not at all uncommon—my attention was not particularly directed to the ear—I did not notice any thing there.</p>

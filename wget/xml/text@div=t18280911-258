               <p>ANN BUMSTEAD. I am a widow, and live in Graham-place, Dalston. I was in my upper room on the 18th of August, and saw the two prisoners; Adams was assisting Beven in getting on the roof of Mr. Hankey's coach-house - it was only Beven got on the roof, and he stripped the lead from the roof; I sent my servant to give an alarm: I saw Adams go to the other side of the road, and return with a bag, which appeared to be empty - I did not see them more than ten minutes.</p>

On the 18th of August I saw the two prisoners near the coach-house gate, and a parcel of lead lay on the ground by them; I heard one of them say to the other, "D - n the fellow, why does not he come with a ladder?" I then walked across the road, and had a more full view of them; while I was there Bumstead sent her servant to ask if I thought they were Mr. Hankey's workmen - I said I thought not; I still watched them, and saw Adams pick up some slates; he marched off towards Hackney, and the other began to take up the lead; I walked up to him, and said, "What are you going to do with that lead?" he said, "What am I going to do? I am going after the slater to do a job in Hackney-road;" I said, "What are you going to take Mr. Hankey's lead? No, you shall not step a foot further;" he then threw the lead down, while I had hold of his collar; Mr. Hankey's servant then came out; Adams afterwards told me he lived in Bryan's-buildings, Kingsland-road - we have inquired since, and the address is correct.</p>

               <p>ADAM'S Defence. I was going to my work - I never touched any lead; I had a load of slates on my shoulder, and that gentleman came and detained me, and looked at my property; I told him where I lived.</p>
               <p>MRS. BUMSTEAD re-examined. Q. Are you sure you saw this man help the other? A. I could not swear to his person, but Prest got sight of them before I came down - I saw him get up to them before I lost sight of them; Adams went across the road and got the bag, and then Prest went up to them.</p>

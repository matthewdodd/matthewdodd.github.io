                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, of 144, Fenchuch-street—on 13th instant, about a quarter past 10 o'clock, the prisoners came to my house, and one of them asked for half a-quartern of gin—they both partook of it, and Gorman tendered a base florin—my brother took it, bent it, and gave it to me—I said to Gorman, "This is not the first time you have been here; I shall give you in charge"—they both denied it—I sent for a policeman, and gave them in custody with the coin—they had been there on Tuesday, the 8th, and one of them then called for half a-quartern of gin—Gorman tendered a base half-crown to me—I put the change on the counter, and I believe he picked it up—they both partook of the gin—I held the half-crown in my left hand, that I might not excite any suspicion in their minds, and gave them the change with the other hand—they left, and I rang the bell for my brother, who went out after them—he came back without seeing them—I wrapped the half-crown up in a piece of paper, and gave it up at the Mansion House—I believe the constable has it—I have not the least doubt of the prisoners—I knew them when they came in again, and told my brother so in French.</p>

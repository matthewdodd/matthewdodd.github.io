                  </hi>. I am chief clerk in the booking-office of the Eastern Counties Railway Company—in February, 1860, the prisoner was in the employment of the Eastern Counties Company—his duties were to count the money at the different stations.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any written agreement with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know; I never saw any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it also a portion of his duty, when monies were collected, to take them to the bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the money was sent up from the various stations in cash-boxes—I was a party to sending the money to the bank when it was ready—on 15th February, 1860, the prisoner brought a statement in writing, naming the various coins, in cheques, notes, gold, silver, &amp;c.—that statement contains an account of the monies, the subject of this indictment—it is in his handwriting—it relates to a sum of money which he had in his hands to convey to the bank—the money I had was added to that, and a statement was made out of the total sum I entrusted him with—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; it is in my handwriting; it is 2,510<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it consisted of cheques, 1,263<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. notes, 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; gold, 733<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and silver, 349<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; total, 2,510<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when the book was made up, it was handed to the prisoner with the money—I can state of my own knowledge that that was done on 15th February—he then left—he never returned after that—I am not aware whether any search was made for the book—it was found upon his desk under some papers, I think the same afternoon—when the book went to the bank it was the duty of the bank clork to initial it as being correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where do you get the items to enter in this book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From this rough book—I call this little book the banker's receipt-book—I make entries in the rough-book—I got the items partly from the cheques I received myself, and the other part from the Statements you have in your hand—the money the prisoner had to take to the bank consisted not only of what he had received at the different stations, but also what I had received at the principal station—I make up the aggregate, and enter it into the book and pay it over to him—I keep separate in this rough-book what I receive and what he receives; you will see there a large sum of 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think, and a smaller sum of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under<lb></lb>neath, that is the quantity received by Lumby; and then on the left-hand you will perceive the letters C, and S, C being the notes received by me, and 8 the notes received by the prisoner, and both added together will be the total amount of notes sent, entered in the banker's book—you can trace each entry from that book, I think—1,247<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cheques was received by me that day; under that is the notes received by me and him added together, and then the gold and silver—the word "stations" means the cheques received by him—this is all in my handwriting—I do not know whether I made a mistake originally in adding up this amount—it is merely a rough-book, not an official book—there appear to be some alterations—I copy from this into the little book that the prisoner takes to the bank—I do not receive the actual coin that he brings—I do not count it at all—the banker counts it—no one on the prisoner's behalf, except himself would count it—the amounts coming from the different stations would be counted by the station masters, and checked by the prisoner, so that I can ascertain whether this does pro<lb></lb>perly represent the amounts received from the different stations that day—this 1,133<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the aggregate of the money received by him from the different stations that day—I could, by inquiry, ascertain whether he has given a correct account of the money received by him; but that is not my province—I can scarcely say how many stations are included in that account—it represents nearly all the stations, except the banking stations, such as Norwich and Cambridge, and large stations of that sort; they pay direct to the local banks—the district stations round Cam<lb></lb>bridge</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186111250030"></xptr>
               <p>do not pay to the Cambridge bank, they send up to us—the prisoner had to check all those sums—each box is checked at the station, and then checked again by the prisoner—they should be counted over by him—it comes up in small parcels, and must be counted by him before it goes to the bank—we have a sort of invoice or note sent up from each station—it is the duty of the prisoner to check the amount with the ticket so sent up—he had other duties to perform also; he had to obtain money from the bank in order to send to the different stations to pay salaries and wages—that would come to a good deal—he had to go down to Stratford—he had about 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week to pay there—he had to obtain the money in gold and silver and pay it himself—I believe there are about 1,500 men employed there—he had also to attend at the Brick-lane station every fort<lb></lb>night, and pay the wages there—there are about 700 men there—that would come to about 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—the result of all the business would be that about 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week would be passing through his bands—he had to keep account of all the sums he paid and received—he had the pay lists signed or checked off as having been paid—if he made a mistake he would lose the money—if he paid a man too much, or accidentally gave him a sovereign instead of a shilling, he would be the loser; or if he took any bad coin at any of the stations—it was his duty to examine every bit of coin that came into his hands—I recollect one of the clerks at Brick-lane being deficient in his cash; he overpaid, I think, about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I may occasionally have made mistakes in my calculations; we are all liable to mistakes—this book is manly a rough book, and must check itself before the banker's book is made up, because the two sums added together must make one total; and if we make a mistake in detail it comes out—nobody checks that book, it it merely a rough book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you find out mistakes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have a total say of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that ought to make 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if it is 1,510<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I go through it again—a mistake of that sort must be detected—if I carried out the mistake in the other book, then the banker would check the amount—if I made a mistake in the rough book, and carried out the mistake in the little book, the prisoner would not be the loser.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does he see that you are right before be goes to the banker's with the book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the time; and he also sees the money that I make up—the cheques are called over to him by me—he counts over the money that I give to him—I make the entry from the ticket that he gives me—that ticket is not checked by anybody—I make an entry from the ticket, and he goes to the bank with his money and mine—after I have made out the aggregate in my rough book, the prisoner makes out a ticket for the bank in the way that anybody that has a banker makes it out; so many cheques, so much gold, and so much silver—the prisoner makes it out after I have made out the aggregate in my rough book—he makes out in my presence what is called the banker's docket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you or any of the clerks change money before it goes to the bank, supposing you want change for a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, do you put in the note and take out the gold? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it is handed to the prisoner to cash, the same as you would to any other person—I never take it myself, I hand it to the prisoner—it has never been done when the money has been made up or after the book has been made up; it cannot be done—I am quite sure that has not been done cither by me or anybody in the office—gold has never been given in change for notes after the money-bags have been made</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186111250031"></xptr>
               <p>up, or silver—I never recollect on any occasion that being done—none of the directors could have sent for change and change been given out of those bags after the money had been made up for the bank, and entered in that book—before the money is made up for the bank an alteration may take place, but after it is made up no alteration ever takes place—I never recollect such a thing being done while we were making up the money—to the best of my knowledge it has never been done while the prisoner has been counting his money—no doubt change has frequently been given before it has been made up in bulk—it is not usual to change 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—it—is generally change of a note or cheque—we generally provide from the bank a sufficient quantity of silver to pay the wages—change for a cheque or a note has been given, but no other change has been necessary—it has never been done in the prisoner's absence to my knowledge—I was cashier at that time—I am now in the booking office; that is not so respon<lb></lb>sible a position as cashier—I went from the the booking office to the cashier's and then went back to the booking-office—the clerks are required to insure in the Guarantee Society, not every one of them—I do not—I am an exception—I give security—I believe it is now compulsory upon all the clerks to insure in the Guarantee Society.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How often does it occur that this transac<lb></lb>tion of taking money to the bank takes place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Daily, in the afternoon—when I was the head cashier it would be the prisoner's duty to come and bring his documents and whatever money he had collected—the whole had to be taken to the bank—before that was done the prisoner separated the money into the different divisions, in my presence, or during the time I was in the office—it was part of my duty to take his statement and to enter it in the book; and then the ticket was given in accordance with it—I had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. salary as chief cashier—he was under me—he had 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never knew him complain of having received a false note, or of having had to make up any money deficiency—he never appeared again after that day, when he went to the bankers—it would have been his duty to come back to the office again, and he did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About that time was there a station-master at Blackwell who was accused by the company of being abort in his accounts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Somewhere about that time—I think it was at that time—he was a station-master who had to remit a portion of these very monies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But as I understand whether the station-master at Blackwall or anywhere else had been guilty of defalcations it was the-money brought into your office that had to be accounted for to the banker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and that only.</p>

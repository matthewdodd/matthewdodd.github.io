Rose and Co., lime<lb></lb>juice people—after the change I visited the house frequently, several times a month, from the time he took it till he left on 16th May, 1878—he kept ho assistants, only a potman—it is a large house, but a very small bar—it is a full-licensed house—ho had no barman orbarmaid—he was principally in the bar himself—he has two daughters, who assisted in the bar—no barman could have been employed there for a month without my knowledge—I kept observation on the house for certain reasons—I do not know the other two prisoners—I never saw them acting as barmen there.</p>

I keep the Anchor and Hope, Westferry Road, Millwall—in October, 1877, I wanted a barman—Wood applied for the situation—he said he had been living with Mr. Humphries at the George by the Commercial Dock for about eight months—as he seemed a very likely young man, I asked him if Mr. Humphries would come over to me, as in consequence of an accident I was unable to get out—he said no; he would bring a note from him if I liked, and early after midday he brought this note.

                  </hi>. I keep the Star, Aldersgate Street—a day or two before 10th December, 1877, Kate Condon applied for the situa<lb></lb>tion of barmaid—in consequence of what she said I went and saw Hum<lb></lb>phries at the George—I asked him if the girl was honest, sober, and cleanly, and how long she had been with him—he said six months—on entering he held out his hand and asked how I was—I said he had the advantage of me—he said "Don't you recollect I used to serve you when I was at. Rose's?"—he said Condon was leaving because he was not in want of a barmaid—she entered my service on 10th September—she remained a fortnight.</p>

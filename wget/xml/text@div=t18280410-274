On the 15th of February, at ten o'clock in the morning I went out - I left my room door locked; I returned at six o'clock in the evening and found my little boy there. I missed eight silver teaspoons, one silver table-spoon, three gowns and one shawl; they had been taken from my drawers - I had seen my black gown in the drawer the night before, and the spoons the day before; I had seen the other two gowns in the course of that week, and the shawl I had worn; I have seen them all since, they are in Court - I have looked well at them, and I know them to be mine.</p>

            . I am an officer; on the 15th of February I was in Whitecross-street, at a quarter-past eleven o'clock in the morning: I saw the prisoner turn out of Red Lion-market into Whitecross-street; he had this bundle under his arm, tied up in this handkerchief - he went about twenty yards, and into a clothes shop. I followed him, and saw the bundle on the counter; I asked what it was in it; he said some clothes, which he had bought in the lane; I told him to untie it, which he did; I saw these three gowns and this shawl in it - I told him to tie them up again; I took him to the watch-house with it - I searched him, and found eleven skelton and latchkeys, and eight tea, and one table-spoon in his trousers pocket, and this one skeleton key in his waistcoat pocket; he said he bought them all in the lane; I took him before the Magistrate, and traced the owner of the property.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

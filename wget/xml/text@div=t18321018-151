             (Police-constable S 97). On Friday, the 28th of September, I was standing by Euston-place, and received information, which led me to examine a vault in Gordon-street; it was one of a range of vaults, not covered with houses - I found the prisoner and another in the vault; the other ran away - the prisoner had this roll of silk in his hand; I asked if it belonged to him - he said it belonged to the young man who ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the person who informed you here? A. I do not see him - he gave his name as Harman; I took the prisoner with this silk in his possession, the other man had not hold of it at all.</p>

In the afternoon of the 28th of September I saw the prisoner in the shop; he asked for some silk patterns - the apprentice cut him some; he returned in ten minutes, and said he wanted enough for a full dress for Mrs. Millington, of Bond-street: he said he had lived there two days - I gave him this piece; he went out - the clerk told me to watch; I went, and saw him go over - he rang the bell, and went in - the clerk was not satisfied, and he went to Mrs. Millington's; there were not less than thirty-five yards on the roll - I gave it to him, supposing him to be servant to Mrs. Millington; I gave him no credit - I intended Mrs. Millington to take the quantity she wanted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the quantity for a full sized dress? A. From twelve to fifteen yards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw him go in at Mrs. Millington's door? A. Yes, and then I thought it was all right, but I had my suspicion at first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You would not have given it him at all, if he had not used Mrs. Millington's name? A. No, she is a customer almost every day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do I understand you that if he had not entered Millington's house, you would have seized the property? A. Yes, certainly; I did not mean absolutely to part with it to Mrs. Millington, unless I had met with something farther to induce me to believe he came from her; but when I saw him go in there, my suspicion was at an end.</p>

This was near Enfield highway; half our parish is common field. I left them there about half an hour after seven o'clock at night, and missed one of them about nine the next morning. I found the skin and part of the carcass upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the sheep any marks on it?</p>
               <p>Field. Yes; there was a clip cross the forehead, and some other country marks. There were three particular sheep that always went behind; this was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Field. Yes; he lived at Ponder's-end; he used to be a shepherd and a labouring man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left him in care of the sheep?</p>
               <p>Field. No, I had not. He did not live above half a quarter of a mile from where I left the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250030"></xptr> sheep. I am very clear the skin is my property. I found it cut in two parts; I compared the skin with the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be the skin of a weather sheep?</p>
               <p>Field. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that sheep went into the field with the rest?</p>
               <p>Field. I am very sure of that: When I went into his house, and asked him about the sheep, he was sitting with his wife by the fire. He said, he took the sheep out of the stock, and had killed it. His wife said the same.</p>

               <p>Coming home, my wife and I found it dead in a ditch, and we carried it home.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He said, he catched it at one corner, and carried it to the other, and there stuck it. I found the blood of it where it had been stuck first.</p>

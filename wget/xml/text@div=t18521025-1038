                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Routledge, a cabinet maker, at 71, Brick-lane, St. Luke's. On Wednesday night, 22nd Sept., about half past 12 o'clock, I fastened the doors and windows, before going to bed—the back parlour window was shut and bolted—I got up next morning at a little after 6, and found the woodwork of the shutter of the back parlour window broken off, the corner forced up, so that an entrance was possible from with<lb></lb>out, and the doors which I had left fastened were all standing open—I missed a coat, two waistcoats, two dresses, and when I went to the drawers I missed a great many other articles—they were all my husband's property—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is part of the properly—the back parlour window looks into a yard which leads to an open court.</p>

On Thursday morning, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was sitting at my window and saw a Mrs. Taylor, who is not here, take a bundle into Mrs. Spicer's—in less than half an hour Mrs. Spicer and Mrs. Taylor came down together—they had nothing with them—they went away, and when they returned they both had something under their shawls—they went away again, and I did not see any more of them—in the afternoon, between 2 and 3, Healey came, and went up into Spicer's room—Healey then looked out of the window, and called out, "Ann," to a young woman who came with her—Ann went up into Spicer's room, and she and Healey each took away a bundle from Mrs. Spicer's—they went down the court, and I saw no more of them.</p>

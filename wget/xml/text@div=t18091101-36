I saw him several times take out tea from that chest and put it under his apron. I observed the prisoner take tea from the top and side of that chest; he tasted and smelled it, kept his thumb and finger close and put it in his apron; I gave information of it. I saw the prisoner searched in the accompting-house. I saw a quantity of tea taken from the knees of his breeches.</p>
               <p>GEORGE PERRY. I saw a bag of tea taken from the prisoner by Mr. Clement's on the stair-case. I unbuttoned the knees of his breeches, and from underneath of his right thigh I took out a quantity of tea it is the same sort of black tea as was in the bag.</p>
               <p>Mr. CLODGES. I belong to the customs. I was present when the prisoner was searched I unbuttoned the left knee of his breeches, I found tea there, there is twelve ounces of tea altogether.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

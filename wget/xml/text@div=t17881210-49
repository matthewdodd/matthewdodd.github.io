               <p>About nine in the evening the watchman was crying nine, I came to <placeName id="t17881210-49-crimeloc220">Tavistock-street</placeName>

               <p>Did you see him lay it down? - I did; then he returned to the contrary side of the way again, and was stopped by Mr. James Sansom, then, by this time that he was stopped, I had taken my bonnet in my hand, and I came up, and said, that is the man who has knocked me down, see in what manner he has used me, with my cap hanging in this manner; the watchman came up, and I said to him, take care of him; then he said, he was not the person, that he did not push me down, he did not offend me; to be sure he saw me lay there, but that he did not push me down; then he said, if I have affronted you, Madam, I ask your pardon; says I, young man, the affront you have put upon me, was it nothing else, I am determined you shall ask my pardon in another manner, such insults as these are not to be born; upon that he was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>What distance was he from you when you first saw him? - I might be as far from him as that gentleman who stands by the candle.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - To my knowledge, I never saw him in my life.</p>
               <p>Did you see him all the while? - He never was out of my sight from the time he took my bonnet, till I left him in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Then, upon your oath, could you be sure of the man? - Upon my oath I could single out that man from five thousand; he was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>You lost nothing else? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. Mrs. Partridge, he spoke of what he had done as an affront, which he begged pardon for? - Yes, Sir, and my words were, was it only for the insult, I would punish him.</p>
               <p>Describe a little the manner in which you was thrown down? - I must, I suppose, Sir, be particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100036"></xptr>If you will be so good; it may be disagreeable; it at first had the appearance of an indecent attack upon you; of a rude and immodest attack? - Rather so.</p>
               <p>You conducted yourself, as undoubtedly you are, like a modest woman, who did not chuse such an attack? - I did, it was done so instantly, I had hardly any time for recollection.</p>
               <p>The first attempt was that which, unfortunately, modest women are subject to from low fellows in the street, indecently laying hold of part of your cloaths? - He turned round and met me, with one hand he stooped down and laid hold of my leg, with the other he laid hold of my clothes behind, and threw me down with the greatest force.</p>
               <p>Recollect, and be so good to understand I am not questioning your veracity, tell what the charge was, that you made at the watch-house? - Perfectly well, Sir, I remember the charge I gave; I went with my bonnet in my hand, it was not in a state fit to put on; I waited there a full hour for the officer of the night; in which time I put my bonnet a little straight; I told him he had torn my cap, and had taken my bonnet away; and described the manner in which he took it, and brought it back; how they set down their charge I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was not it knocking her down and otherwise ill-using her, the corner of Tavistock-street? - I believe it might.</p>
               <p>Was not it treated as an impudent immodest thing in this fellow? - It certainly was.</p>
               <p>Did it enter your head at all that this man intended to rob you, or did you charge him with a robbery? - I certainly did, or else I would not have called out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he was searched? - I never saw him searched at all.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know whether there were any weapons of any sort found upon him? - I never heard any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>He did not make any demand of money, or say any thing to you? - He did not speak a word to me.</p>
               <p>Court. You say he ran across the street with your bonnet in his hand? - He ran across Tavistock-street, which I believe is about the width from where I stand to the window; upon my crying stop thief he returned again to the same side of the way, and about twenty yards from me, he laid it down on the pavement, and then returned to the contrary side of the way again.</p>
               <p>There were people in the street, was not there? - My Lord, it was a snowy night, I walked very fast, I passed a gentleman and lady near the middle of the street, I believe they were behind me, they followed me to the watch-house door, but was not admitted; they were the only two people I saw in the street; Tavistock-street is not a very publick street at night.</p>
               <p>Were the shops shut? - Yes, I believe they always shut up there at eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Was he drunk or sober? - To all appearance he was very sober; the constable said to him, young man you seem very sober; he did not say a word to me, till she came down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He went very quietly with you to the watch-house? - He made no resistance at all; he was searched, nothing was found upon him.</p>

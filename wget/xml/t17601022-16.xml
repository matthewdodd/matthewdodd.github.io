            </rs>; +</p>
               <p>Bamber Gascoyne, Esq; At the time of the robbery being committed. I was not in London; but when the prisoner at the bar was taken. I had word brought me in the country part of my goods were found upon him. I had a letter from Mr. Fielding, whose activity was great in it; he had some things brought before him my property, and I had set it forth 20 l. reward.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your house broke open?</p>
               <p>Gascoyne. My stable has a communication with the dwelling house by an arch; the place was broke where my postilion and coachman both lie when in town. I came up, and found the prisoner's wife was committed, and to be transported for another offence, (see No 232. in his mayoralty) and he was to be tried for his life for felony, but it was brought under value, and he was to be transported. I went to look at him, and had him before me at the goal-keeper's house.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Gascoyne. It was some time in September; I charged him with this robbery. His wife having these goods found upon her, and he was taken up with a number of picklock keys upon him (see his trial. No 275 in last Session's paper) the were such, that no lock could be safe where they came. I try'd to move him to give me an account, as it was a very particular robbery, thro' a laundry and places; after a most hardened manner he said, if I would give it him under my hand to get him to be made an evidence, he would. I told him, the law would not admit such a thing, but if I could get it I would; I observed he had a very fine shirt on. The wrist-bands were new put on, and very coarse, and very bad: I imagin'd it was mine; he laughed, and said, it was given him by a person in Cheshire four years ago. I made him strip; when I came to examine it, I observ'd; it having been used in hunting, was oblig'd to be mended. I knew it to be my shirt; I sent my laundry-maid to the keeper, and desired him to deliver it to her, and let the prisoner have any thing else to put on, which he did; as soon as my servant brought it in, she said it was my shirt; and upon her showing me, I saw upon the gusset the letters B. G. where they had been pick'd out, so that I am certain it is mine; the next morning I went to the goal again, in hopes to find him in a better humour; he still remained in the story, that it was given him; I said, I had it in my house on the 16th of April; he said, he had had it two years, and abus'd me again, for swearing to an old shirt, then he fell to one year; still I told him, it was in my possession at that time; I advis'd him to tell me where my things were; and do me justice; still he was extremely harden'd; then he told me, his wife could tell me. She was on board a transport ship; I got her from the ship; she gave-full and ample confession of the whole robbery, and by that I found my things in the pawnbrokers hands almost all over London. One of the women mention'd in the indictment, lost goods to the value of about 30 l. mine amounted to about 200 l. All my servants are here to prove the fastening of my doors, and that it was my shirt which the prisoner had on and the other things pawned at different pawnbrokers.</p>

               <p>Aldridge. No, I believe it had been opened by false keys; it was unlocked, we went into the house, and found the door partly open; then we went and found the next door open; so that we imagined they came in by false keys that way, by the coach-house, I had seen cloths in the laundry over night, the next morning they were part gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the laundry?</p>
               <p>Aldridge. That is over the kitchen, the kitchen is under ground, the stable is level with the laundry; they came from the coach-house to the stable, from the stable to the laundry, and from thence to the house.</p>

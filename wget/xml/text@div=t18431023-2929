                  </hi>. I am assistant to Samuel Cater, a draper, in Well-street. Between five and six o'clock in the evening, on the 23rd of Sept, the prisoner and another person came—the prisoner desired me to show her some ribbons out of the window—I showed them five lengths—I put two of them back, and brought two more—they desired me to cut off six yards—I did so, and the other person paid for tbem—I folded up what I had showed them on the counter, and missed one—I inquired for it of the young man—after that I observed the ribbon coming out of the prisoner's muff that was on the counter—she had her right hand in the muff—this is the ribbon—it is Mr. Cater's, and is what I had been showing.</p>

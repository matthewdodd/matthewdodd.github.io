                  </hi>. I live at No. 38, Adam Street West, Marylebone. On the morning of 29th Sept. I was walking up the Edgware Road with two friends; I met the prisoner, and asked him what time it was; he used an offensive expression—I went towards him, and he struck me with a knife; somebody caught hold of him, and when I was on the ground, having my arm bound up, he struck me on the leg with a knife; I was taken to the hospital, and was there three weeks—he was a stranger to me—he seemed sober at the station—there was a female with him—(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner here handed in a written statement.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, Adam Street West. I was with the two last witnesses—I saw no scuffle—I heard Slark ask the prisoner what time it was; he made use of very bad language, and Jefferys and I walked on; in about a minute I heard Slark call out, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, he has got a knife, and has stabbed me in the arm"—I took my pocket handkerchief, and bound up the wound—I saw the prisoner fling a knife over an area, and showed the spot to a policeman—there was nothing offensive in the way Slark asked the prisoner the time.</p>

               <p>woman, all the worse for drink; the prosecutor rudely accosted me; I passed on, and he followed me some yards, and struck me on the back of my head, which came in contact with the iron palings; I turned to defend myself, and finding that he was much stronger than myself, I was tempted to use that un-English weapon, the knife, which I shall ever regret; I most heartily express my sorrow to the prosecutor, and regret my inability to make him a suitable recompense; I was molesting no one, and had he done the same, this would never have happened; the aggression was entirely on his part.</p>

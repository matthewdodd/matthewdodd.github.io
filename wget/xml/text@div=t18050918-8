             sewed the money in my stays four years ago; the prisoner knew I had the money in my stays; I unsewed them, I wanted to take the money out to put it into the hands of the banker, and there were only sixteen halfpence, instead of the sixteen guineas; she had sewed them up with black thread, such as she sews the carpets with, and the guineas were sewed up with white thread.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that your only reason for suspecting her, because of the thread; did she abscond or leave your lodging? - A. No, she slept with me every night till I had her taken up; I suspected her, because of the thread.</p>

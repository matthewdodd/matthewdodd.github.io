                  </hi>. I carry on business at 466, New Oxford-street, as an ironmonger. I have known the prisoner about ten years—I first became acquainted with him at Munich—I saw him in this country about three years ago—I met him in the street, brought him to my house, and gave him relief—I have seen him since sometimes in the street, but never spoke with him—On 20th Nov.

                  </hi>. I was employed to translate this letter—this is the translation I made, annexed to the deposition, it is a true translation—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"To Mr. Ullman, 437, Oxford-street, Nov. 20, 1851; I beg to inform you that since the 22nd of March, I have been employed by the Trades' Protection Society against fraud and swindle; my duty is to give a true and exact account of such persons who have quitted Germany under suspected circumstances. I have been given to understand you have now established a business in hardware; it can be possible that this business is founded upon solid grounds, but knowing too well the circumstances and situation in which you were placed a short time ago, being too well acquainted for what reason you left Munich, and for which you were several times published in the <hi rend="italic">Augsburg Gazette</hi>, and prosecuted by the law; there are at the present moment not less than six of these newspapers before me, and it is my duty to publish you in my monthly communication. I do not like to prosecute you in regard to your relations abroad, and in particular that I do not wish that a Jew is always the first, and satisfy my conscience and duty, for well do I know that this my communication would do you great injury, and therefore make you this for me unpleasant proposition: will you send me by Saturday 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., then I will destroy this communication. I do not wish for an answer, in fact I shall be glad not to receive one; it is only a pure weakness of me</p>

LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been resident in England? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five years—I am a native of Munich—I resided there about eighteen or twenty years prior to my coming to England—I left for this reason, because I gave my money out at more than 5 per cent.—I was not expelled by the police, nor ever prosecuted—I was not expelled for usury—I came to this country to begin a business here—I was not forced to leave Germany—I was not obliged to leave, in consequence of lending my money at more than 5 per cent.—I was fined a few thousand florins, but I was not removed from the country for that cause—I was not fined much—I cannot say how much—it is possible 1,000 florins; it is possible 2,000—it was not 10,000—I cannot exactly say what it was—it was not 2,000—I could not pay so much—I cannot say anything about it, because it is so long since—I was not fined more than once, I am quite sure of that—there was nothing else for which I was found fault with, besides lending out my money at more than 5 per cent.—I know that the prisoner has been making old stories of me and my wife for two or three months, about the coffee-shops—there was no other reason for my leaving Munich but that of lending my money out at more than 5 per cent.—I came here to begin a business, and now the pri<lb></lb>soner sees I have a business to satisfy him, he begins to annoy me—I carried on business in Germany as a salesman, what you call a merchant—I sold different things, and bought different things—the prisoner was not a native of the same place, he came from about 140 miles off; the Magistrate there gave him 600 florins to get rid of him, and he came to Munich, and the King of Bavaria took him up for stealing his manuscripts—that was the reason he came to London—I knew him for about a year in Munich—when I first saw him in England, about three years ago, I was not in distress—I did not receive assistance from him, he never gave me a farthing—I swear that positively—I have a letter from him in my pocket which I received two years ago, begging for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not receive anything from the Rabbi of the Jew's synagogue in Margaret-street—the prisoner has not been in any employment since he has been in London—I do not know whether he was employed by the Trades' Protection Society—I think not, because I inquired—I had no feeling of unkindness towards the prisoner before I received this letter—I had had no dispute or quarrel with him—I never in my life received any assistance from him, either in England or at home—I know the prisoner's writing, because I have got a letter from the prisoner in my pocket which I received two years ago, begging for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot remember having seen him write—I have not corresponded with him—I did not see the prisoner about that letter after I received it—I have no other means of knowing his handwriting but by receiving that other letter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. EDGAR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you never see him write in Germany? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, yes, in Germany many times—I know his handwriting very well, because I saw his writing in Germany.</p>

               <p>weeks for nothing—I then told him I could not keep him any more, seeing how he went on, he would not work, and I had six children to keep—I came over to this country to commence a business—it was two or three months before I came away that I was fined for violating the laws with regard to usury at Munich—my mother-in-law has got those cases in hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Mendicity Society. I appre<lb></lb>hended the prisoner on Thursday, 27th—I told him it was for endeavouring to extort 152. from Mr. Ullman, of 466, New Oxford-street—he said he would explain it to me—I said it was quite useless his explaining it to me, and I took him to the station—on our way I said to hire, "You do not belong to this Trade Protection Society at all?"—he said, "I never said so"—I said, "You have stated so in the letter"—at the station I showed him a copy of the letter, translated—he said, "That is a true copy; I did write it, and I can give you an explanation"—I found a quantity, of begging letters and other things upon him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

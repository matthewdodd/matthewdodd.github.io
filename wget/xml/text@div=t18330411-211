               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see either Murray or Evans? A. Not till we were at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by PRENDERGAST. Q.Prothero was a Policeman, was he not? A. He was in a Police dress - I do not know whether he was employed in that very part; the Magistrate ordered me to be sent to gaol on a charge of being in possession of bad money; I was there five weeks, and I think I was discharged eight weeks ago to-day, I was discharged at Guildhall by Mr. Alderman Wood; I have been a labouring man all my life - I do not follow birdcatching regularly, only when I have nothing else to do; I have been in regular work - I used to work for Mr. Fenderman while he was alive - I used to work in the brick way - I never was a groom; I have lived about that neighbourhood all my life; when Perkins gave me the parcel, he told me it was money, but I did not know what it was - it was in a bit of paper - I could tell by feeling that it was money, but I did not look at it; I have stated all that he said to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not say before the Magistrate, that Perkins said, when he gave you the paper, that he would show you how to make these things? A. Yes; I forgot that - he said "some things," he did not say what; he told me that, not when he gave me the paper, but at the top of Fleet-market.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You have said some things, was not the expression such things? A. He said some things.</p>

               <p>MR PRENDERGAST. Q. Then he did say that to you? A. Yes; I did not ask him what sort of things he meant;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110120"></xptr>I was not anxious to know - I did not ask him any thing; I have now told all that passed, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember saying before the Magistrate, that Perkins produced to you a bad half-crown? A. No, Sir, he did not produce one to me, nor I did not say so; my wife was in doors the night he came about the bird - I was not there till I was called; my wife was before the Magistrate - there was another person present with Prothero and Scott when I was taken, but I do not know who it was, I was so confused; I have seen Rose to-day - I have heard him say he was there when I was taken, but I do not know; I knew nothing of Rose till this business; we have seen one another every day since this business has been on in this Court, and we have drank on the road; I saw him one evening last week, as I was at work, just by Kennington-turnpike - I was loading a cart; we did not speak to one another for two minutes, as I could not stop - he called once at my house to let me know about coming up to the Session; he did not stop a minute; that was the same night as I saw him on the road - I had seen him at my house once before; I cannot tell when that was - he came down out of the road to my door, and stopped about two minutes; he came inside the door, but the door was not shut - he went into my room; I did not call him, he came of his own accord - he did not bring any message then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, that on that occasion, when Rose called on you, and came into your house, he did not stop more than two minutes? A. It might be two or three minutes - I will not swear it was not ten minutes; we had a pot of beer; we did not talk about this matter - he only asked me how I was, and I said, "I am very well, thank you, I hope you are the same;" he said he only called to see me - I had never seen him till we were up at Guildhall; I did not have any thing to say to him - when he called that day he took a drink of beer, and was off directly; the beer was fetched before he came in at the door - my wife fetched and paid for it; she had taken the money for fruit - I cannot say how long he stopped; I am certain he did not stop half an hour - I do not think it was a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear solemnly he did not stop half an hour? A. I cannot swear what time he did stop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When he told you he would teach you to make some things, what answer did you make? A. I made him no answer at all, for he walked on as fast as he could, to meet his friend, but I was close behind him when he said that; I said, "I don't want to learn to make no things of no kind."</p>
               <p>Q. How came you tell me this instant that he walked on so fast you could not make him an answer? A. I did make him that answer - he walked on fast; I had no notion what things he meant, not the slightest - I have been in the brick way, gardening, and the like, and in digging.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever dig in church-yards? A. No; I was never taken up for any thing of that kind - I was never accused of doing any thing in a church-yard, only they give me the nick-name about our place of a body-snatcher - I have heard they call them recollection men; I do not know no more than what I have heard them talk about.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what is meant by a body-snatcher? A. I really do not know what you mean by a body-snatcher, but what I have heard them say it is body stealing; they give me that nick-name - it is not the name I am known by; they do not say when I go about, "There goes Bill, the body-snatcher."</p>
               <p>Q. You have told my friend that Perkins gave you the money, and desired you not to put it into your pocket, for fear you should be robbed - did you ever say that when he gave you the money, he gave it you as security for the bird, and told you to take care of it till he had sold the bird? A. That is what he told me - he gave me that money to hold till he had sold the bird, and I was to take care of it till he came back with the money for the bird - I told the gentleman before what he said; I have given no different account of it to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I do not object to give you the very words - did you ever say any thing to this effect, that Perkins told you most people knew he was a regular smasher, and he did not wish to have the money about him? A. Not to me - he did not say so to me, nor did I say that he did, to my knowledge; I never said so in the presence of Martin, the City officer, nor to any body else. [Martin was here brought in.]</p>
               <p>Q. Did you to this man? A. No, Sir, I really think I did not; I cannot give you an answer, Sir, it is a thing that I know nothing at all about.</p>
               <p>COURT (reading the deposition)."He said he was well known." Q. Did he say he was a regular smasher? A. No, Sir, I never said so.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You say he said he was well known - was that the reason he gave you the money? A. No; he said when he was going into the public-house, that he was well known there, when he was going to have a pint of porter just at the top of Fleet-market; when he gave me the money he told me to keep it till he had sold the bird.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever say, "Perkins asked me to carry the money, because he was well known?" A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this your mark? (handing him his deposition) A. I cannot read; I cannot say, I do not think I made my mark before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Now he cautious, you were examined before the Magistrate, do you recollect being sworn to what you said, and do you recollect its being taken down in writing? A. Yes, and it was read over to me, but I do not think I put my mark to the paper.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Then you now say that neither before the Magistrate, nor elsewhere, you never said that Perkins begged you to keep the money, as he was well known? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. (reads) "He (Perkins) asked me to carry the money, because he was well known" Witness Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not say to-day, that the reason he gave you for giving you the money was, to keep it till he sold the bird? A. Yes, that is very good.</p>
               <p>Q.Because he was well known? A. He said that when he went into the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You first said he gave it you to hold until he sold the bird? A. Yes, that is the reason I say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that he told you he was well known? A. No Sir, I never said that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not tell me just now, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110121"></xptr>before the Magistrate, you used these words, "Perkins asked me to carry the money, because he was well known?" A. No, I never said no such word.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were before the Magistrate - did you say "Just as we were coming out of my own door at Kennington, he gave me something in a paper that felt like money?" A. Yes, Sir - I also said, he said, "Put it somewhere where it will he safe;" I said, I had no where to put it but my pocket - he said, "Can't you put it into your hat."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say "I put it in my hat, and he shoved it under the lining?" A. Yes, Sir; I said he placed it after I put it into my hat; I said he said it was to pay bill.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had so said, did you not add, "He asked me to carry the money, because he was well known?" A. No, I did not make that answer - Perkins said that when he was going into the public-house - he said he was well known.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say "We came on together, and on the other side of Blackfriar's-bridge, he said he could tell me how to make such things?" A. Yes; I said I did not want to make such things, and he walked on as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>MR. BULLOCK. Q. He did say he was well known? A. Yes, that was at the public-house; there is no foundation for my nick-name - people have no right to call me a body-snatcher.</p>
               <p>Perkins. Q. You stated that the first drink we had together, I paid for? A. You paid for the first two pennyworth of rum; that was on the other side of the bridge from, here, on the left hand side in coming to the bridge - we had no rum in Farringdon-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were before Mr. Alderman Wood, did you not say that I told you I would learn you to make these things; that I showed you a shilling, and that I took some soot and salt, and rubbed it with? A. No; I never said no such word about it; I swore I had seen you three or four times before, and no more.</p>
               <p>Murray. Q. On Friday night last, between seven and eight o'clock, were you not in a public-house kept by Parker, close by Rose's, with your wife and Rose? A. No, not between seven and eight; we parted with Rose at the corner, just by where he lives - we went to a public-house, and had something to drink going home, but it was not at night, it was in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to the fire-place, pull your hat off, fling it about, and say, "Here is the innocent man, and Rose well knows it?" A. I did not; I was not drunk - I have not been tipsy since this happened; I did not call at the Elephant and Castle.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I know none of the prisoners but Perkins; I had seen him once or twice before the 17th of January, and on that evening he came about six o'clock - my husband was up stairs with the lodgers; I called my husband down to him - he had not said any thing to me, but he asked my husband if he had any birds; my husband said Yes - Perkins said "Put one in a bag or in a cage, and come along with me, for I know where to sell it for you for 2s. or half a crown;" my husband said he had no bag, but he had a small cage, and Perkins said that would do - (he mentioned that he wanted a cock linnet) the bird was then put into the cage - while my husband was gone to get the cage, Perkins took half a crown out of his pocket, gave it to me, and said, "Do you think this is a good half-crown;" I said, "Yes, it is good as far as I can see, but my eyes are bad" - he then said, "Should you take it?" I said Yes; my husband was then coming back with the cage - Perkins snatched the half-crown out of my hand, turned round, and laughed; when my husband and he were going out of the door, Perkins said to him, "I shall get you to carry this for me, as I am well known and you are not" - I did not hear my husband make any answer whatever; they then went out at the door - I did not see any thing produced when Perkins said this to my husband.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was the word Perkins used this or these? A.This; and he said he had some more silver in his pocket, which he should give my husband to carry for him.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Do you know whether he did any thing with the half-crown? A. No - he had not been in my house before, that I know of; he had been to my stall where I sell fruit and a few birds - I have seen Rose to-day, but have not been talking to him - and I saw him when we were at Guildhall on this trial; I have seen him at this Court and at Guildhall, but no where else.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him at a public-house last Friday? A. Yes, Sir, at the Rose.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Have you ever seen him at any other public-house? A.Never in my life: I do not know where Rose lives - I never was at his house but once; the Rose public-house is over the way, opposite this Court - we went in there, and had a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you have not been in any other public-house with Rose, except at the Rose over the way? A. Yes, Sir, I have been in one very near Rose's house; I do not know the sign - I do not know the name of the street; Rose lives in the Westminster-road, but I could not find his house again - we were never in any other places together than I have named, to my knowledge; I have never been in any private house with him, nor seen him in any private house.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, upon your oath, has not Rose been at your own house in company with you and your husband? A. No, Sir, he came to the door, but did not hardly stop one moment; that was the last Wednesday that ever was - he came to tell us that we had been ordered to attend the Old Bailey on Friday, which was a mistake; we were to attend on Thursday instead; he did not come in at the door - it rained very hard, and he said he was out on business; my husband was not at home - he was out loading some road-dirt for a gentleman; he came home a few moments after Rose was gone - I never saw Rose at our house on any other occasion; I am well assured he was not - I cannot recollect whether he did, he is such a total stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that he did not come to your house, and remain in the house with your husband and you, and that you fetched beer for him? A. I think I recollect his coming one evening, and we sent for a pot of beer, as he said he was dry; I now recollect it very well indeed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110122"></xptr>but I did not give it a thought before - I think it is a month ago; I think it is since the last Session - I remember his calling, and I was going home with my stall at the time; he sat down a few moments with me and my husband - we did not finish all the beer; I paid for the beer with my own money.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were these at the public-house near Rose's? A. I am sure I cannot tell; there was my husband and me. Rose and his wife, and I believe his daughter - we all went over the bridge together after we were ordered away from here; they said they were going to have a pot of beer - we had one or two pots.</p>

            . I am clerk to the Magistrates at Guildhall. On the 18th of January I took a deposition against Lowe for having bad money in his possession; it was read to Scott and Prothero, and they signed it - there were afterwards two or three examinations, in which Lowe and Rose were made witnesses; what they said is in the depositions.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. After the depositions, were made did you hear the prisoners say any thing? A. I have two or three different statements at different times; on the 2nd of February, after the deposition was read over, Prothero and

             both said they had been led into it by Rose - Evans then said "I know nothing of it; I never had any dealings with the man in my life" - Perkins was there, but he did not say any thing; on the 28th of January Murray only was in custody, and Scott made a deposition against him - Scott said, "I know the prisoner, he came to fetch me to take Lowe into custody; he said, there were two men on Holborn-hill that he suspected had bad money in their possession - I went with him, and he pointed out Lowe, who was standing against the lamp-post; I took him to the station, searched him, and found the bad money in his hat - I have seen Prothero the officer and Murray frequently together; he went with us to Kennington the same evening, when we went to try to find out what sort of a character Lowe was - I never saw the prisoner and Perkins together" - on the 30th of January Perkins was in custody, and Mr. and Mrs. Lowe gave their evidence against him; after the evidence Perkins said -</p>

               <p>Q. Can you, by looking at that paper, so far refresh your memory as to state that was what he said? A. Yes, my Lord, he said at first he had no question to ask of the witnesses; he then said, that on Saturday Lowe had been tutoring his wife - he said they had been employed by Mr. Powell in several cases, and had received about 30l. from him - he said that

            . I am a butcher, and live at No. 6, Charles-street, Westminster-road. I recollect when Lowe was taken on this charge - I had seen Evans about two months, or nine weeks before Lowe's business - Evans came to my house one afternoon, and said,"Are you doing any business now for the Mint" - I said, No, I was not - he said, "Have you any objection to doing business along with two or three friends of mine over the water, who are two City officers?"- I consented, and said, "When can I see them?" - he said, "If you will be in the way to-morrow evening, from six to seven o'clock, I will call for you" - he called the next evening, and I accompanied him to the Horse and Groom, in Blackfriars-road - he had told me that his friends over the water had plenty of money to go to work with - we got to the Horse and Groom between seven and eight at night, and he introduced me to Scott, Prothero, and Murray - after sitting a little while, he said to Scott, "This is my friend," (meaning me) - Scott said to me, "You have done business for the Mint before, I understand?" - I said, Yes - he then said, "Have you any objection to go into business along with us?" - I said not - he said, "Can you get me a man or two over the water for possession (I understood he meant to have counterfeit money on their persons) - I said I could not get them, I did not know where to find them; but I told him I knew two or three informers on our side the water whom I would introduce to him - that was all that passed then on that subject - I afterwards went to the Horse and Groom again, and I introduced

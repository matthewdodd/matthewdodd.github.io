               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not call him a thief, and say he was robbing his master daily? A. No; I dare say I gave him a black eye, for I was obliged to strike him twice him my own defence; I did not throw him down - he tried to throw me down, and I tried to prevent his injuring me; he got down by attempting to throw me - I will not swear I did not kick him when he was down - I believe I did, but not violently; I swear I did not call him a thief - I have no recollection of saying he had robbed his master; Mr. Goodbody, jun. was not present at any part of it - the prisoner began had language to me the moment I entered the shop, without any provocation; if I said he had robbed his master, it is unknown to me.</p>

            . I was in the shop of Goodbody on the 18th of January; Oats was working there; I saw Curl come in between ten and eleven o'clock - I was on the other side of the shop, three or four yards from him, when this occurred; I heard Oats call him a swindler, and say he had been in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140083"></xptr>Whitecross-street - Oats struck Mr. Curl first; the moment he said it he struck him - Curl had made no reply; when he was struck, Mr. Curl hit him again, which knocked him down on the ground; and about three minutes after, he ran up to Curl and tore his coat: he had got up then - after he got up he ran to him, in about two minutes, and tore his coat; Curl instantly told him to be quiet for he wanted to have no more to say to him; I had not heard Curl say anything before - Oats then said "I will kill you, for you know if I can't one you, I will two you" - and about five minutes after it was all settled I saw Oats pick the wedge off the ground, and heave it at Curl - Oats during that five minutes was at his bench working; nothing had passed between Curl and him during that time, nor any blow of any kind; the wedge hit Curl in the face - Curl did not abuse Oats at any time - I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He never called him a thief? A. I never heard it, nor that he was robbing his master; I was near enough to hear, if he said so - I heard him tell him to get on with his work, and not rob his master of his work; the prisoner had two black eyes when he got up - he might have struck himself against the bench; I did not see him kicked, nor observe his mouth bleeding - the prosecutor struck him on the breast, which knocked him down.</p>

When Curl came in, I was at work at one end of the shop; there being forges in the centre of the shop, I could not see, but I heard a terrible noise, and when I ran up to them, Parkin gave the wedge into my hand; I saw Curl come into the shop - it was near ten minutes or a quarter of an hour from the time he came, in a Parkin's giving me the wedge - it happened at the further end of the shop, and I was by the door; I could not tell what was doing - the Policeman took the wedge from me at the doctor's shop.</p>

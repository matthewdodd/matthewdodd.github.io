On Friday, the 1st of May, I packed up a parcel, containing five printed books, one child's muslin frock, and an invoice—I have seen it since—it is the one now produced—it was addressed, "Mr. William Jones, Kirk-street, Odiham"—I sent it to Pickford's on the 3rd, to go by the South<lb></lb>western Railway—it contains now what it did then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the luggage department of the com<lb></lb>pany. On the 4th of May I received this parcel, and gave it to Acres, another clerk—I made an entry of it, "Jones, Odiham"—the prisoner was clerk in the same department—I saw him there in the course of the evening—I can<lb></lb>not say he was there when it arrived, but that was his office.</p>

On the evening of the 4th of May I received some parcels from the desk—I took six-at that time I had not an opportunity of seeing the way-bill—I arrived at Winchfield station in the night, and then compared the parcels with the waybill, and this parcel was missing—it is entered in the office-book, and marked, "P.P.," which shows it came into the office—on the Wednesday or Thursday I saw Larkman, one of the clerks, and he asked me what I had done with the missing parcel—the prisoner was in the office at the time, attending to his business-his place was next to Larkman, close to him, at the desk—he could hear very well what Larkman said, but he said nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale clothier, living in Little George-street, Minories—the prisoner was employed in my service to receive ready-money payments, and deliver goods—when he received money he had immediately to pay it over to me—I mean by "immediately" as soon as he returned from a journey—his journeys were all in London—about the end of June I found certain irregularities in the payments, customers who had been in the habit of paying ready money, prompt cash, became irregular—I asked him to explain—he said the customers had not paid the whole amounts, but on account only—he specified some particular amounts when he handed the accounts in—I then intimated my intention of calling on those parties for the purpose of balancing those accounts—he then replied that it was no use; that the accounts were all paid; that he had lost a sum of money out of his pocket; that he did not think I should believe that if he told me, and that he thought he might make up the amount somehow or other, that of the amount deficient he had appropriated to his own use, but 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the deficiency is about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the accounts in question—we took merely the one account—the name of the customer is, "Moses, Son, and Davis."</p>

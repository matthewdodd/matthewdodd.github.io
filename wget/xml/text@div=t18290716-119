            . I am a constable, and live at No. 29, London-wall. On Wednesday evening, the 3d of June, I was standing in Aldermanbury, the prisoner came along with a sack on his back; I watched him into Grub-street, to a dealer in marine-store shop, kept by Biggs - he put the bag down, and I asked what he had got; he said lead; I asked if it was his own or his master's - he said his master's; that he was going to sell it there by order of his master, and had brought it from a job at Walworth, where his master was; I knew him to be in the employ of Mr. Roberts, a painter, in Wood-street, and I detained him - I afterwards saw Mr. Roberts; I went to a house in Little Love-lane, Aldermanbury, and applied the lead to that house, to part of the lead of the sink, and it corresponded with it, and made the whole complete - it weighed 60lbs. or 70lbs.; I am certain it came from there: the other part has been ripped away, but remained in the kitchen.</p>

I am a plumber and glazier, and live at No. 35, Wood-street; the prisoner was in my employ: about half-past five o'clock that day, I saw this lead at Guildhall; I never gave him authority to take it - I was not employed to move any from Little Love-lane, and know nothing of it; I never authorised him to take any lead from any where - I had no job at Walworth; I had no lead.</p>

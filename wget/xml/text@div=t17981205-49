               <p>JAMES TAYLOR sworn. - I live at Battlebridge, St. Pancras: On the 20th of November last, returning home, after I had collected linen to wash, I stopped for soap, starch, and blue, at Mr. Savage's oil-shop, in Leather-lane, directly opposite Greville-street, I bought twenty-eight pounds of soap; I had not gone two hundred yards into Liquorpond-street, before I observed that my tail-board was loose; I jumped off the shaft, and ran round the cart as quick as I could, I heard the tail-board fall; I then saw the prisoner with it in his hand, he had just picked it up; he said, Daddy, does not this belong to you; yes, says, I, I believe you know it does; he said his wife said that it dropped from my cart; he said he would help me all he could, he was a long while, and I desired him to desist; after I had put up the tail-board, I asked him if he would drink any thing, we were directly opposite the White-hart public-house; he told me he had no objection, and we had a quartern of gin and bitters; I gave him the halpence, he wished me good night, and said, I know all is safe, and wished me safe home; I had two hundred pounds worth of property in my cart; I jumped up on the shafts, and I found all was safe, I went on till I got home; I took off the upper tail-board, and was going to take the lower one down, when a neighbour called out to me that there was a man upon the shafts of the cart, and asked me if I had employed any body to assist me; he pointed the man out to me, and said he was going off; I said, if he is the devil I will have him; I went over the way, got before him, and laid; hold of him; I did not see any thing upon him, but the soap was found within a yard of where I took the prisoner, and about thirty yards from the cart; I found it was the same man that I had treated in Liquourpond-street; while I held the man by the collar, Mrs. Grover came out and picked up the soap.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GOODALL sworn. - (Produces the soap.) I am the headborough of St. James's, Clerken-Well; I was sent for to take the prisoner to Hatton-garden Office, and then it was brought to the office, and a mark put upon it.</p>

            (To Taylor.) When you bought it, had you made such observation of the property as to be able to swear to it? - A. I can swear this is the soap I purchased; it was not packed up, for I was rather later than usual, and I desired them not to mind how they packed it, and they just put a piece of paper round the sides, and tried it up, I suppose there never was a quarter of a hundred of soap went out of a shop packed up so; I can swear further, that it was in the cart when I got to my own door, for I put my elbow upon It when I got out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You leaned upon the soap with your elbow? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But there is no impression of your elbow upon it? - A. No.</p>

               <p>JOHN LANDER sworn. - On Tuesday, the 20th of November, near upon six o'clock, I had a friend called upon me, upon some business, I went out with him, and when I got to the cart, there was not room for us both to pass, I let my friend go forward; I then saw the prisoner upon the shafts of the cart, upon that I called to Mr. Taylor, and asked him, if he had employed any body to unload the cart; he said, no; I said, there is a man at the top of the front part of your cart; upon that he immediately took a bundle, which he had in his hand, and put it under his drab great coat, that he had on; then he went to the horse's head, crept under the house's head, and ran away; I never lost sight of him till Mr. Taylor had got hold of him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050055"></xptr>I then left them together, and went on with my friend.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you see any thing drop from him? - A. No; the cart was between me and him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What time in the afternoon was this? -

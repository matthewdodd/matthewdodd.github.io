               <p>JUDITH ISAACS. I am the wife of Asher Isaacs - he is <rs id="t18300708-175-viclabel985" type="occupation">in the clothes line</rs>

On the 3rd of July I was sitting at tea, and there was a knock at the door - my daughter answered it; an old woman stood at the door, and asked to see my servant - I went and asked her business; she said she had brought twoshifts my servant had given her to make - I called the prisoner down; she came, and the woman said she had brought her a sheet on the Sunday to make two shifts; the prisoner said in reply, it was not a sheet - the woman said, "It was, and you told me your mistress had sold it you for half a crown;" the prisoner made no reply - I looked over my linen, but I could not miss a sheet; I delivered the two shifts to the officer - they never were in my possession as shifts. On the 5th or 6th of July I found a piece of silk and two caps at a pawnbroker's, also the handkerchiefs, the table-cloth, and the stockings, but not the spoons, scarf, orveil; a duplicate of a silk handkerchief and a towel was found on the prisoner on the 3rd of July, when I gave her into custody, but the pawnbroker is not here with them.</p>
               <p>ASHER ISAACS. On the 5th of July Ann Darby called at my house, and brought me five duplicates and a parcel, which the prisoner had left in her care; I went to different pawnbrokers, and found articles of my property - I never saw the prisoner in possession of any of them.</p>
               <p>ANN DARBY. I live in Mill-yard. On the Sunday the prisoner brought me some things, wrapped up in a small parcel, in a bit of rag - I gave the same to Mr. Isaacs on the Monday, and the duplicates.</p>
               <p>MARY SIMMONS. The prisoner lodged with me in February last; when she got this place she was very hare of clothes, and had a great many duplicates; when she had been there about a month, she came and said her mistress had advanced her 12s., and she had redeemed to the amount of 12s. - she said, "Take care of this little book, as there is a great family of children, and they are apt to tear things;" she left me a book, with some duplicates, but I cannot tell whether there were more or less than she had had before. On the 30th of June she came again, and said her mistress had advanced 12s. more, and she released some more things; on the 1st of July my child died - she said her mistress was a very good woman, and if I would call she would let me have a little money; I called, and she asked where I lived; on the 5th of July they called and took the duplicates - the prisoner gave me this bit of silk, and these caps she gave me to make up.</p>

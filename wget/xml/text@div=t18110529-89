               <p>ISABELLA ALLEN. I know the prisoner. she was a next door neighbour to Mrs. Goding. I was nursing Mrs. Goding in her laying in.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time that you had seen these things safe - A. About two o'clock they were safe in the lower part of the house, hanging on a line, and when I came down stairs I missed five napkins and a sheet off the line, and two children's bed-gowns and other things. There had nobody been in the house I went to the pawnbrokers with Mr. Goding, we found a bed-gown, and two children's bed gowns.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER BURGESS. I received the bed-gowns in pledge of the prisoner for one shilling and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in the habit of going into the prosecutor's house every hour in the day; I do not deny taking them two articles; I did not mean to defraud them, I meant to return them.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Allen. When she was asked whether she had pawned any thing at the pawnbrokers, she denied it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

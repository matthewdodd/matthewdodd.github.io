            . I am a servant to Mr. John Frederick Robinson; he lives in Old Burlington-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at home on Tuesday, the 7th of March - A. Yes; on the evening of that day there was a great assembly in the street; I could not see them; I could hear a great mob in the street, about half past eight or nine in the evening, as near as I can say.</p>
               <p>Q. What prevented you from seeing what passed in the street - A. I could not get at the windows to see.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any expressions made use of by the people in the street - A. I heard the mob say, if they could get in, they would murder every servant in the house; this was after the mob had been some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house for its protection - A. Six private soldiers and a corporal, besides me and my fellow servants, The mob began attacking the house in pulling down all the pallisadoes on Monday night, and on Tuesday morning a door was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday night or Tuesday morning, were the soldiers sent for - A. On the Tuesday; on the Monday the mob was there; on Tuesday they forced open the door of the house, and threatened to murder every servant if they did not tell were their master was, they would murder us; they forced open the door, and took away a chair, table, and other fixtures of the hall; they threw a large ball at me, saying they would murder me if I did not tell where master was; they forced the railing down on Monday night.</p>

               <p>Q. Were these outrages the occasion of sending for the soldiers - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the mob threating - A. Yes, and I heard the corporal address the mob,</p>
               <p>"that if they would not be quiet, they must take the consequence of it."</p>
               <p>Q. The corporal is

            , is it not - A. Yes. I heard the people say they would pull the house down if they could not murder us all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them say any thing about the soldiers firing - A. I heard them say the soldiers dare not fire, any thing but powder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any firing take place, and how soon - A. There was firing took place; they fired blank cartridges, as they told me, when they forced open the windows that were nailed up; that firing was from the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any pistols taken possession off - A. My fellow servant, the butler, he had a pistol; I saw him go to the window, and discharge it. The mob were coming in very rapid at the time; he drew back, and told me he had discharged the pistol in the direction of the area door; he told me he thought he heard them breaking in below; I, myself, thought I heard the same. I heard the reports of several guns firing, and the mob attacking the door: after the discharge of the pistol, they did break open the door; they threatened they would if they could. The pistol was loaded again; I saw it loaded, it was loaded with shot; me and my fellow servant loaded it together; one of the soldiers as the mob were so very rapid, took the pistol from my fellow servant, Ripley's hand, he took it, and discharged it; one of the soldiers asked me for shot; I gave it him; it was the same soldier that took the pistol from my fellow servants hand, his name is Mathews; at the time that he discharged, there were several pieces discharged, and after they were discharged, I heard say, there was some body killed or wounded; that was the last firing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were was it you got the pistol and the shot - A. The pistol from Lord Buckingham's servant; Ripley, my fellow servant, sent me for it; as we had nothing but one pistol to protect ourselves; he said we were left open to the street.</p>
               <p>Q. During this time you had no opportunity of seeing the mob so as to know their numbers, or to know their persons - A. No, I could not; I heard some of the soldiers say they hoped some body was gone for the horse soldiers; if not, they should not be able to protect my master's house, and their lives; I know the pistol I brought from Lord Buckingham's servant was loaded when I brought it; that charge was drawed, and some of the shot fell on the ground in drawing it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Q. What hour was it when the mob first attacked your house - A. About half past eight, or nearer nine; I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master was at that time attending his duty in Parliament - A. He was away from home, and I believe him to be there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it upon the first attack that the mob tore up the iron rails and used them as instruments to break into the house - A. Yes, and they did get in at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke of some of them throwing a large ball at you - A. The ball was from a large lamp in the hall, it has two large weight to pull it up and down; they threw that weight at me, and threatened they would destroy me if I did not tell were my master was. On Monday and Tuesday I was confined at home very much for the protection of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you saw chalked on the wall an exhibition of your master upon a gibbet - A. Yes; I had seen that in different parts of the town; I saw it on that very Monday, I saw it on dead walls, and I have heard there was chalked up a reward of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050013"></xptr>five hundred pounds for Mr. Robinson's head.</p>
               <p>Q. After the attack on the evening of Monday, was the attack renewed again on Monday night, or Tuesday morning - A. The mob returned on the Monday night about eleven; on the first attack about nine, they succeeded in tearing up the pallisadoes; they carried out the furniture, and broke it in the street; there was a carpenter in the house, he nailed up the shutters; we made the house as secure as we could; they broke the fastenings by throwing brick bats in. When they returned on Monday night between eleven and twelve, they threw in iron bats then, and brick bats, and broke the fastenings of the house, and other materials were thrown in that had been torn up in front, and drove us completely back. They came again on the Tuesday; in the mean time the house had been put in a state of security as well as we could by a carpenter. When they came again on the Tuesday, on a third attack, they attacked it with the same violence as on former occasions; on Tuesday morning near nine, they tore open the shutters again, they succeeded in breaking the fastenings, and driving us backwards; afterwards the mob dispersed. They had taken a large figure for a lamp; we could not prevent them from taking the figure, had we attempted to prevent them our lives I believe would have been sacrified; I believed so then, and I state it now. They broke this figure into fragments in the street, and then used it to break the windows at the upper part of the house, as high up as possible; at the time I heard the mob withdraw, I thought I heard somebody call out, the horse soldiers were coming; their retreat was occasioned by supposing that the cavalry was coming upon them; when they found the horse soldiers were not coming, in spite of all the resistance we could make, they broke into the house again. They came into the house very rapid; I was driven back with brick bats, and iron bars; they faced the inner door, and attempted to break into the parlour, where the furniture had been stowed away for safety; they did not succeed in breaking open the parlour door; while they were breaking open the parlour door, the cavalry came upon them; they retired using very bad expressions, and saying that they would have my master's head before night; they retired, and we got a carpenter, he put the house into as good a state of security as he could. They renewed the attack on Tuesday, between eight and nine in the evening, in the mean time, the foot soldiers had been introduced into the house for its protection.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the attack on Tuesday evening - A. A violent attack was made at the shutters that had been fastened up, with brick bats and iron bars being thrown at them, which burst them open, and fell into the room; the soldiers fired several times; nobody was hurt as I heard; the soldiers fired blank cartridges; the mob shouted, and said, the soldiers dare not fire any thing but blank powder; the corporal then warned them that they had ball cartridges if they did not disperse, they must take the consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. If the soldiers had been disposed to fire wanted only to destroy life, were they not able to fire ball cartridges - A. I heard them say ball cartridges; I think they fired to protect my master's property, and to save our lives, they were protecting my master's property. From the mobs declarations I apprehendded the greatest danger to our lives; I do not believe we should have been safe, if the soldiers had not fired more than blank cartridges; I thought so then, and I think so now.</p>

            . Q. Were you at the house in Old Burlington Street, on the evening of Tuesday the 7th of March - A. Yes, about eight o'clock; the attack was made upon the house, by the people in the street, between eight and nine, the mob attacked the house by throwing stones and brick bats; after they broke through a little; a soldier was placed to prevent their coming in; the stones and brick bats, broke open the shutters; the mob kept on throwing stones and brick bats for half an hour before any fire arms were used; I saw the soldiers fire, but I cannot swear who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what they fired with first - A. No, I could not tell; I heard the soldiers say they fired with blank cartridges; the soldiers told the mob if they did not disperse, they must fire with something else, the mob kept violently throwing brick bats and stones, which forced open the shutters several times. The soldiers fired again, but what with I cannot tell; when the last firing took place, I was in the dining room backwards.</p>

               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. Were you there on the Monday night when the riot begun - A. No, I was not; I came home a little after eleven on the Monday night; I saw the riot on the Monday night; from the violence of the mob, I considered my life in great danger; we were oblidged to retreat backwards to Mr. Wood's, to save our persons; iron railings as long as my arm were thrown in upon us; if one of them had hit us, it must have killed us, on Tuesday morning; and Tuesday evening the riot continued; they called out for Robinson; I heard the soldiers fire, and I think the firing was necessary to save our lives, and to save Mr. Robinson's property.</p>

            Your residence is in Old Burlington-street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday, the 6th March, were you under any apprehension of any attack from the mob - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you learn that any attack had been made - A. I believe it was between nine and ten, when I was at the House of Commons, I was then informed of the particular circumstance attending the attack; I then wrote from the House of Commons to the Secretary of State, informing him that my house had been attacked by a mob; I requested<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050014"></xptr>that he would send protection.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any military had been sent before he received your letter - A. I believe there might.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see what they had done that night - A. No, I did not. On the next morning I think between ten and eleven, the footman, Sutton, came to me; in consequence of the information I received from him, I wrote to Lord Sidmouth, requesting that whatever protection was sent to my house might be there permament, as I understood that some of the soldiers who had been sent there on the Monday night, in consequence of the first attack had withdrew from the house at an early hour on the Tuesday morning, and that the house had been subsequently entered by the mob; which I received the intelligence by my footman. I should think, in an hour I went down to the Secretary of State myself, to represent the danger which I received, to present the state of the case as it reached me. I understood that protection had been sent to my house, I requested into the course of that morning; I told the footman, and I believe the butler also, that it should be taken care; that they should have some thing to eat and to drink.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you seen the state of the your house - A. I saw it some days ago, after it had happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the state of the house when you saw it - A. At the time that I went into the house all the windows almost in every floor were broken to pieces; it was manifest to me at last, that great violence had been used against the windows and the doors of the dining-room, and the wall in front of the house was also down; in the hall and in the passage near the foot of the stairs, there were marks of stones, brick bats, or things of that kind, having been struck with violence against the walls; on one door, which is a very old one, one which communicates between the dining-room and a room backwards, there were similar marks of violence, and on the pannel of that door, there was the mark of some sharp instrument having been forced through it; a window also on the stair case about half way up was also broken backwards, and a figure which had stood in that window had disappeared, and some pieces of furniture which were in the hall, chairs, tables, and a lamp that hung there also disappeared, and I saw some fragments of broken chairs. This was some days after the affair had happened; and the doors and windows were very strongly barricaded in order to prevent a renewel of a successful attack.</p>

            . Q. Where do you live - A. No. 2, Duke's-court, Duke's-street, St. James's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in Old Burlington-street on the evening of Tuesday, the 7th of March last - A. Yes, I entered the street about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of your going there - A. Merely to look at the houses which had been injured, on the Monday evening, first I went into the the Square; they said it was Lord Darnley's House. Then I came down Bruton-street, and looked at a house there, which they said was Mr. York's; I then came into Old Burlington-street, and went in it at the end of Clifford-street, in Old Burlington-street; I went, and stood up at a step of a door almost opposite Mr. Robinson's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of people were assembled in the street at that time - A. The Horse Guards were riding up and down the street; they did not remain long in the street after I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any other person on the step where you stood - A. The deceased was standing on the same step with me; the door was open, and the servants of the house where standing at the door; Mr. Robinson's door was almost opposite of the step where we stood; I had a conversation with the deceased; I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the subject of that conversation - A. We were merely saying it was a pity that they pulled the houses to pieces, for we should all have to pay for it; I said, it was a pity that people should let their children out, because I heard it was done by boys; it was done concerning the Corn Bill. I heard stones throwing several times, and I saw the shutters open a small space a great many times, when the stones or bricks were thrown, they said it was done by boys; I did not see them myself. The deceased and I left the steps, and walked up and down the street towards Clifford-street; there was a small quantity of people in the street, there was not an hundred, I do not think there were more than fifty, if there were fifty, they seemed to be walking to and fro; I was at the end of Clifford street when they fired.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that they fired was the deceased with you - A. She took hold of my arm as we stood at the step of the door, and never loosed it until she fell from the firing of the gun.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you walk in the street together - A. A short time, we came and stood upon the step again, where the servants were standing at the door; after that, I was proceeding to go home, the deceased said, she would walk to the top of the street with me, and with that we left the step of the door we were walking up the street as the gun was fired; we were at the fourth door from where we were standing, as she fell from my arm, at the firing of the gun, we were walking to go home about four doors from the step where I had stood, one of the guns fired, and she fell to all appearance dead; the Horse Guards came up almost immediately; I did not know what to do with her. The Horse Guards said it was best to bear the body away: I found myself in a aukward situation, I was covered with blood from a wound in my face; the deceased was carried to a chemist's shop, in Bond-street, and from there to St. George's Hospital; I never left her.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the street were the persons collected together - A There seemed to be no one but what was passing and repassing before the doors they seemed to be chiefly on the pavement by what I could see.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any person say any thing about the Corn Bill - A. No. I heard a riot, and that some person was taken into custody, that throwed a stone.</p>

I remained there about half an hour. Before we were posted centry at the kitchen door, we were inside of the house. The corporal called me up stairs between nine and ten o'clock to assist him above stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were below, did any thing happen to attract your notice - A. Nothing happened were I was. I heard what passed above. I heard a great many brick-batts and stones thrown into the house above. I heard them coming into the house all the time; I was below. Immediately I came up stairs the Life-Guards came up directly; the officer of the Life Guards ordered us to fall into the street, and after that we were ordered into the house, and there to remain until the morning. I had twenty-one rounds of ammunition myself; when I came up stairs the shutters were open, and large stones and brick laying about the floor; it must have been a large man to have thrown them. I returned all my ammunition.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any conversation between the soldiers and the people - A. Not at that time; afterwards I did. Between the first time of my going to Mr. Robinson's house and the second at the end of the street, there was a fire; with that I walked down to the end of the street; there was no mob then; I returned from the end of the street; I think it could not be above three or four minutes.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050016"></xptr>when I got to the post of Mr. Robinson's house, that fire was considered as an alarm to disperse the people at the end of the street, it was considered, so I returned to the front of Mr. Robinson's house, at that time I made a stop, the people were coming both ways at that time, there were about a dozen people collected at the front, I made a stand; I looked down into the area, I saw a soldier stand at the right hand parlour window, and at his right hand there was a man with a black or blue coat; I saw the third person behind them, I saw a third person between them in the back parlour there was a light behind; I heard one of the men out of the twelve men standing in the front of the house this man out of the twelve was rather joking to them, he said they had no business to fire we heard the report five minutes before that he was saying it in a jocular way that he had no business to fire with ball, he had better to load his piece with bullocks blood, and something was said about eighty shillings, with that the soldiers said, you had better mind how you act, or what you are about, or you will find the contrary, or something to that effect; the moment the soldier spoke I considered he spoke in such a manner I thought myself in danger, I made off momently my brother had come along with me, I thought we were in danger. I took an oblique direction from the front of the house right oblique across the road. Before I got three parts of the way across the road, a stone, or a brick or something was thrown against the house; it hit against the wood, and the moment the stone reached the house there were three successive fires at one moment, I heard the report, I ran, and then this unfortunate woman fell before me, or rather inclined on my left side I stooped down and laid hold of the persons head; I saw she had received a wound on the right temple, there was a person with her, I held her for the space of a minute and a half, there was an immence quantity of blood, and I conceived brains, it must have been congealed blood, or else she could not have lived so long as she did. I was very much affected, at that time, my brother called me, he came and laid hold of me by the shoulder and pulled me away, I left her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Your brothers object, and your object was the same - A. Yes, to see the havock the public had done to Mr. Robinson's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you happened in the course of your walk towards Burlington-street, observed any writings on the walls - A. Yes, many.</p>
               <p>Q. Among others perhaps fifty pounds for Mr. Robinson's head - A. I do not recollect any such thing I saw chalkings on the walls, his effagy exibited upon a gibbet against the Asylum wall.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see a copy of your deposition - A. Yesterday, it was not exactly correct. I gave that book to one of the constables in attendance, he lent it my brother.</p>

I had been in the street no great while, when I heard the report of a pistol, or a gun, I cannot say which, it was there were fourteen or fifteen people faceing of Mr. Robinson's house; I heard a conversation pass between the people who were in the front of Mr. Robinson's house, and the men within.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not no whether that was the man that fired the piece, that man was a soldier I suppose - A. I do not know, there was a soldier at the window, I heard the man in the house wish the people to keep off the pavement, I cannot say, whether he was a soldier or not, the people seemed to signify the pieces were not loaded with shot, and they considered that they ought not to fire, without the riot act had been read; I heard somebody make use of these words, very soon a stone or brick was thrown in the window, they fired immediately three successive fires, at the first fire I made away from the house I went down Burlington-gardens, when I got into the street, I heard the cry of murder, at last I saw my brother, and the deceased young woman in his arms, she was wounded, and I considered she was dead; I got my brother away; some horse soldiers came into the street; that was after the firing there were hardly any one in the street then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. When they desired the people to go off the pavement from withinside of Mr. Robinson's house, the people said, they did not think their pieces was loaded with shot - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not get your brother away until the horse soldiers were coming - A. No.</p>

            . Q. What have you to relate upon this subject - A. I was in Burlington-street on Tuesday evening, the 7th of March, in company with two other persons; I, and the two persons with me, looked down the area of Mr. Robinson's house; we had hardly got there, before a voice from the opposite side of the way said, come away from that side; we came from that side of the way, and crossed to the persons on the opposite side of the way, to Mr. Robinson's house; I staid looking there some little time nothing particular took place. The people seemed to stand out of curiosity; there were some boys running in and out of the people tossing, they noisy and troublesome to the people standing about, the boys were not standing together as a mob, they were standing in little lots of three and four; the mob or assemblage, were composed of men and weman, some of whom had children in their arms; they were people that seemed to be assembled out of curiosity. I suppose, in about five minutes after I had been in the street, a stone was thrown from just behind where I stood, the stone hit the broken fragment of glass, it was not a large square of glass that was struck, it sounded as if it was a loose piece of glass at the top of a pane; it came tinkling down from the top of the house; I remained there a little while longer and a person said, there was a corporal and a file of men in the house; we went further on, and something was thrown of a soft heavy substance like clay, it hit the shutters, of one of the windows; as soon as that was thrown there was a musket discharged; I saw the flash, and I heard the report, and as soon as that musket was discharged we moved further on, and stood on the steps of a door way; on the report of the musket, the people went up the street, and some down the street, the boys hooted and hissed and were very noisy; several stones were thrown in succession, at no time did I hear stones throwed more than one at a time. There were no volley of stones; the mob returned again; I saw no peace officers there, except about ten o'clock there were two officers and horse soldiers opposite of Mr. Robinson's house they turned down Clifford-street; the throwing continued; there was a substance came against the boards or shutters as I before described, that had a dead sound like clay, as soon as that was thrown, there were four muskets discharged from the parlour window of Mr. Robinson's house, there were not discharged in a volley, but in succession sharp, one after the other, the instant they were discharged, the people begun to run.</p>

            's Defence, read.</p>
               <p>May it please your lordship and gentlemen of the jury; my counsel being prevented by the law from either observing on the evidence offerded against me or laying my defence before you, I am obliged to have recourse to this mode of defending myself against a charge of wilful murder. Considering the painful situation in which I stand; the discussion that our cause has undergone out of this court, and the various publications respecting it, which have lately been most industriously circulated through this town, I am sure you will pardon my requesting you to dismiss from your minds whatever you have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050018"></xptr>read or heard of this transaction before you came in court, and that you will give your verdict on this evidence that you shall this day hear. Let me also entreat of you to separate our case from a subject that has lately been the topic of much discussion, and on which there has been a great difference of opinion.</p>
               <p>Neither I, nor my fellow prisoners, had nothing to do with the Corn Law. We were ordered to defend a house; the felonious distruction had been attempted; and we are brought here to answer with our lives, because we have faithfully discharged the trust committed to our care, and the duty imposed upon us.</p>
               <p>Our defence rests upon general principles; you, the Jury, and every member of the Community, have an equal interets with me, and my fellow prisoners, in supporting these principles; if these principles are broken in upon, or brought into doubt, the security of property is distroyed; and the peaceable and well disposed men of society, will be at all times at the mercy of a furious and inraged populace.</p>
               <p>The crime of murder, as the language of the record itself informs you, consists in killing a fellow creature with malice aforethought; I learn indeed besides, that direct malice against an individual, which is made out by direct proof, and is called express malice; the law in certain cases, presumes the existence of malice, and describs it by the term of implied malice; From express malice our cases must be entirely free; we could by no possibility have had any knowledge of malice against or disposition to injure either the unfortunate deceased or any other person that were before Mr. Robinson's house on the night when she unhapily met with her death; I think I can with equal clearness, shew you that there is no pretence for saying there exists any implied malice. The Law which I am about to state cannot but be familar to the Learned Judges, but I trust I shall be forgiven in shortly bringing it before their review for your information in the humble hope that it will receive your Lordships sanction, and desiring only that as it is sanctioned by them, it may be acted upon by you in the decission of our case.</p>
               <p>I submit that every man is justified in the use of fire arms in defence of his life, or protection of his own property, or that a fellow subject in whose assistance he is called against the commission of a felonious attack. It is not necessary to delay the use of arms until the felonious attack be actually made; it is only necessary to wait till the immediate intention to make such an attack be manifested by some open act. The principle of Law is bottomed on our nature, and is recognized in that sacred act which establishes the liberty of our Country.</p>
               <p>In the Bill of Rights it is expressly declared that the subject of this Country, may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions. Lord Chief Justice Hale, one of the most learned and humane Judges that ever sat in Westminster Hall, says, if A had attempted a burglary upon the house of B with the intent to steal, or to kill him, or had attempted to burn the house, if B of any of his servants, or any within the house had shot and killed A, this had not been so much as felony nor had he forfeited ought for it; for his house is his castle of defence, and therefore he may justify assembling persons for the safe guard of his house.</p>

               <p>The case made out against us, if made out in fact, comes completely within the doctrine of Lord Hale, as the law stood with regard to the breaking of houses in his time. After the house had been broken in the manner in which it was, in the continuance of this riot; after the threats uttered against Mr. Robinson and his family, what could those who were in the house expect, but that if the populace succeeded in forcing admission, they would kill those whom they found in it, who had endeavoured to resist them? But since Lord Hale wrote, the law has made it a capital felony for any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together, to demolish or pull down any dwelling house. Some writers have, with universal approbation, carried the doctrine of Lord Hale beyond the case of burglary. The only injurious breaking of a house known in his time to any felony committed against or in any house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Foster says, in the case of justifiable self-defence, the injured party may repel force by force, in defence of his person, habitation, or property, against any one who manifestly intendeth and endeavoureth, by violence or surprise, to commit a known felony on either. In these cases, he is not obliged to retreat, but may pursue his adversary till he findeth himself out of danger, and if in a conflict between them, he happeneth to kill, such killing is justifiable. The right of self-defence in these cases is founded in the law of nature, and is not nor can be suspended by any law of society, (Foster, 277.) The words now read to you, are those of that learned and excellent Judge Mr. Serjeant Hawkins, in his Pleas of the Crown, says, the owner of a house, or any of his servants or lodgers, may kill any one who attempts to burn it, or to commit murder, robbery, or any other felony, I Hawkins, c. 28, p. 21.</p>
               <p>It has been generally understood, that the great Lord Mansfield, in consequence of the riots which so long disgraced this metropolis in the year 1780, declared, that he was astonished that it could ever be doubted that soldiers called upon to preserve the public peace, and to protect the lives, houses, and property of his Majesty's subjects, did not stand precisely in the situation of any other individual, and had not a right to repress force by force, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as the owner might have done.</p>
               <p>Let me now, Gentlemen, intreat you to apply this law to the case you are now called upon to decide. For many days before the spirit of disorder broke out into acts of riot, attempts were made to intimidate the members of parliament from exercising their judgment on a measure then depending in the House of Commons, among various other means, placards, and writings on the walls, threatning those who suggested or supported the measure. Among others that were seen, Mr. Robinson was exhibited on a gibbet, and rewards was offered for his head. The fury of the populace were directed against him, and those<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050019"></xptr>who should protect him, or his house or property. On Monday, the 6th of March, in the evening, his house was, by a large concourse of persons attacked, broken and entered. In the middle of the night of the 6th the attack was repeated with increased violence. On the morning of Tuesday the house was again attacked with increased violence; the house was entered, and furniture and property publicly destroyed. On the evening of Tuesday the attack upon the house was renewed with increased violence; on these occasions the windows were broken, the pallisadoes in front of the house torn up, the doors forced; some of the mob broke in and destroyed a a part of the furniture which they used in committing fresh acts of violence, and the lives of Mr. Robinson and his servants were loudly and repeatedly threatened. The frenzy which directed the rioters was increased, and their mischievous designs were aided by the advance of night. An attack of a most alarming nature was again commenced, and those to whom the care of the house was entrusted would, as I humbly submit, have been justified in taking the strongest measures for dispersing the rioters; instead of this, it has already appeared, that blank cartridges only were fired; this was found rather to provoke insult than repel aggression. The mob encouraged each other to still further acts of violence, by calling out, that the soldiers did not dare to fire ball.</p>
               <p>Felony upon felony had already been committed; for I believe my Lord will tell you, that every tumultuous breaking of any part of the house is a beginning to demolish, and a felony within the law; and the next thing to be expected was the entire destruction of the house, and the murder of those who defended it.</p>
               <p>If it should occur to you that the deceased was not engaged in these riots, his Lordship I conceive will tell you that makes no difference in our case. If a man, meaning only to resist felons, unfortunately kills an innocent person, such killing is not murder; that case was expressly decided in the case of Lovett, cited in Coke, c. 538. It may perhaps be said, by some persons, that there was not sufficient violence to justify firing from the house; if that be said, it must be by persons who stood only a short time on the scene of action. In all alarms there are short and dreadful instances of calamity. Your attention, if after what you have heard, you shall think it necessary, will now be called to those who witnessed these transactions from the commencement. On the Monday night again, on the Tuesday morning, and the Tuesday evening, which unfortunately terminated in the death of the deceased, these witnesses can only present that entire case, on which alone your judgment can be formed. With these observations, Gentlemen, I leave my case in your hands, perfectly satisfied that I shall receive from your justice a verdiot of not guilty.</p>
               <p>Burton, Herbert, and Mathews's defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord, we have not any observations to trouble the Jury with. We were called upon to assist in protecting the house; that we acted with caution, moderation, and care, for the lives of our fellow subjects. After blank cartridges had been fired without any other effect on the mob than to encrease their violence and defiance; at length, two pieces, one a pistol, was fired with shot, when our lives was in the greatest immediate danger. The object of this was to intimidate; and we regret as sincerely as any men can do, that any person should have been mortally injured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Hampton. On Sunday morning, the 2nd of January, I went into my field at eight o'clock, and saw a great quantity of potatoes taken away from my potato bed—I traced tracks across the fields, went to a policeman, who traced them across the field into another field, over the road into another field, and into a gap—the policeman went to a house, and asked the people if they had any potatoes—they said yes, but they were not mine, and after going to several</p>

               <p>houses, we inquired for the prisoner—we found a quantity of potatoes under the stairs at his house—I took up several, and said, "They are mine, "be<lb></lb>cause I have several different sorts, and they answer to them in colour, size, and description—I fetched a sample—I showed the sample to the policeman—I got a horse and cart, and fetched them all to the station—next day I went to my pit which had been opened—I have brought some from the pit, and some from his house, but the largest were taken away—here are five or six different sorts, all of which I had in my pit—I knew them directly—there were as many different sorts in his house as there were in the pit—I have no mark on them, but I can swear to them by being different sorts of potatoes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 267.) I went with sergeant Churchill and the prosecutor to the prisoner's house—I found 3 cwt. of potatoes under the stairs—the prosecutor immediately identified them—I took the prisoner into custody, and after he was taken, he went out at the back of the house, got over a fence, and ran across two gardens—I went after him, and took him again—the sample the prosecutor brought exactly corresponded with the several sorts which were in the prisoner's house—those found in the prisoner's house were wet as if just taken out of the heap.</p>

I noticed the track from the potato-pit across two fields, across the main road, into another field, which led up to the back of the street the prisoner lived in, but in the street we could not follow the track any further—I went to two houses before I went to the prisoner's—the track led direct to the end of the street, and there was a gap through the hedge into the street—I know him to be a bad character.</p>

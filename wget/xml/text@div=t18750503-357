                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller, and live at 11, Spring Grove, Chiswick—the prisoner is my father, he and my mother reside with me—there were only us three in the house, we keep no servant on the morning of 1st April, I came downstairs, about 6.30, my father was down at that time, we had some cocoa together—he had got it ready for me—I then went out into the garden to look at some plants that I was going to take up to town and then went into an outhouse to wash my hand-when I rose from washing my hands I felt a blew behind, after the report of a pistol—I put my hand behind my head" and found it was all blood—I turned round and saw my father standing, about a yard behind me, with his back to the door of the outhouse which opens inside, the door was open—had a pistol in his hand, holding it with his arm extended and pointing towards me—I flew at the pistol and caught hold of the barrel—we had a tustle outside, and in the course of the struggle I pushed him against the fence that divides Mr. Flack's garden from ours—it gave way. beneath our weight, my father then let go of the pistol—I did not fall; I found myself in Mr. Flack's garden, and I went and knocked at his door with the pistol in my hand—no one came, and I went back again through the fence—I did not see my father, but I received a cut on my cheek-bone with a chopper, this is the chopper and the pistol (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the chopper was usually kept in the outhouse—I had not seen it that morning—I had used it on Good Friday—when I received the blow I flew on the chopper—my father had it in his hand—I got hold of one or both of his wrists and straggled with him; we went up against the door of the outhouse and fell together—while we were on the ground Mr. Flack came out and held him down, while I got from underneath him; my right leg was under him—I got up and went for assistance to a neighbour's—I believe I put the pistol on a box in the yard—two constables came and Dr. Weatherhead, who attended to me and sent me to the West London Hospital, where I remained till the 26th—there had not been any quarrel between my father and I—I know of no motive which could induce him to attack me—he has an annuity of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I believe he had had a larger sum which ceased, but I don't know that—I used to pay the rent</p>

               <p>and the principal expenses—my father used very often to apply to mo for money, the last time was about two months' ago, that is, a month before the 1st April—he then asked me when I came down in the morning if I had got any money—I said "No"—he said he had no money, and he was in debt—I said "More shame for you to say so"—the conversation then dropped and it was not referred to again in any way—I did not keep any money at home.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Spring Grove, next door to the' prisoner and; his son—shortly before 7 o'clock in the morning of 1st April, I heard a knocking at my door and a cry of murder—I came down and saw the fence that separates the two yards broken down—I then saw the prisoner and his son lying before the doorway of the outhouse, the prisoner partly lying on his son's legs—he had this chopper clasped in his right hand, and his son was holding, his wrist tightly to prevent his using it any further—he said "He has shot me"—the prisoner made no remark—I said "For God's sake what is the matter"—I took the pistol from the son; he was holding it in his hand; straight away from him, and holding his father's hand with the other—I then relieved the son and continued to hold the prisoner down till some one arrived—wrested the. chopper from the prisoner and threw it on one side, they were both bleeding, the prisoner from the forehead—he said it was done in the scuffle—I asked him several times what made him do; this, but got no reply—I kept talking to him all the time till the constable came, what a wicked thing it was, and what made him do it, and he said he might as well he without brains as to be without money—I should think I had charge of him half an hour before the constable arrived.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not witness the scuffle, I was in bed when it hap<lb></lb>pened, I came down from the alarm at the back door—they appeared to be both exhausted when I saw them on the ground, the prisoner was lying partly on his son—I should imagine there had been a violent struggle by the appearance—I have, lived next door to them nine years, the prisoner was always a very good neighbour; what I saw of him—four years; ago he had a paralytic stroke and since then he has seemed wild and has not been the same man—I can't say that I have noticed any singularities in his demeanour since; he has not been so calm and collected as he was pre<lb></lb>viously; since the paralytic stroke he has had a very wild appearance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> on this morning he looked very wild and his eyes appeared to project from his head—he did not attempt to escape while.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 2, Claremont Villas, Kew Bridge—on the morning of lst April I was called to 11, Spring Grove, I got there a few minutes past 7 o'clock—I saw the prosecutor in the front room standing up—I found three small wounds on the back of his head; they were bleeding very slightly—I went out into the scullery, got some water and washed the back of his head, and clipped his hair—I found the skin blackened; I probed the wound, and to the best of my belief found three bullets, one in each wound; I detected them with the probe—they were in a triangle, at a rough guess, about the size of the palm of my hand—on the left cheek bone there was a small cut and the side of the face was bruised—also examined the prisoner and found a cut on his forehead—he said "It was caused in the struggle, we fell through the fence and I cut my head"—I found this pistol on the mantelshelf in the front room—I said to the prisoner ""'Have you had the pistol long?"—he said "Many years"—I asked him when it was last charged—he made no reply—I said "How many bullets were there in the pistol?"—he did not answer—Isent the prosecutor to the West London Hospital—we were looking for the chopper, and I said to the constable "Where is the chopper?"—the prisoner said "It is in the wash-house," and it was found there—the wounds were not in themselves dangerous—I had never seen either the prisoner or his son before—when I first saw the prisoner he was on the ground detained by Mr. Flack—his appearance struck me; I believed myself to be in the presence of a man affected with progressive general paralysis of the insane—I was led to that conclusion by his unnaturally calm manner under the circumstances, a child like expression of face, and eyes that I can only describe as being hot, chronically inflamed, but not such inflammation as would attract common attention, not acute inflammation—when I spoke to him I noticed the trembling lips and the halting manner of speech characteristic of general</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187505030108"></xptr>
               <p>paralysis—I afterwards saw him walk, he had a shuffling, staggering gait which would tend still more to coufirm my impression—he seemed to have no idea whatever of the gravity of the offence he had committed—when I told him that he would be taken to prison he asked for his spectacles so that he could read there—I saw him afterwards the same morning at the Hammersmith Police Court and he seemed like a man in a dream—the opinion 1 formed was that he was affected with general paralysis of the insane—I had no reason to suppose that those appearances were assumed—I did not see him afterwards until I saw him here yesterday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am a member of the College of Surgeons, a licentiate of the faculty of Glasgow, and a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company—when I saw him yesterday in the dock he still had the same appearance of face, a face almost without wrinkles—I was for nearly four years resident in the City of London Asylum, during which time I had many cases of general paralysis of the insane under my. charge—the symptoms I observed in these cases entirely coincided with those that I observed in this—I do not con<lb></lb>sider that I had sufficient opportunity of observing the prisoner to come to a definite conclusion as to his mental state, but his bodily condition would lead me to believe that his mental state was affected—I have found persons of this kind suffering; from, delusions; it is frequently a marked symptom—those delusions take several forms; I have known it take the ft form of intense dislike towards members of their family without any apparent ground—I do not consider a person in that state of health to be of sound mind—the delusions existing in such cases are very numerous; a common delusion is that they are in danger of some violence, or of being attacked, and they provide themselves with means of resisting the attack.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The earliest age at which I have known progressive paralysis of insanity is twenty-eight, and the oldest sixty-six—speaking from my own experience, the average age is between thirty and forty-five—the symptoms are not generally preceded by a paralytic stroke or seizuro—you seldom have those symptoms after a long interval in a person who has had a paralytic stroke; it. is generally the result of a damaged brain—I should not expect to find delusion manifest itself previous to an act of violence—I have known the; delusion to manifest itself suddenly—the patient in, these cases is usually insane some time before it is noticed, and. some indecent, violent or murderous act, brings the patient before a Court of Law; then in some caaes he is recognised as being insane; in others cases he is tried, con<lb></lb>victed and sent to prison, and afterwards found to be insane and sent to an asylum—I am speaking of instances I have seen in ray own experience, cases in which I have been professionally engaged—I was assistant medical officer at the City of London Asylum, one of the two, medical officers in charge that is eighteen months ago.</p>

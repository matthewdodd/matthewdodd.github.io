I am a traveller living at 23, Church Street, West Ham—the prisoner was in my employment five months ago—on Saturday night, 27th March, I went to see my aunt, Mrs. Hayes, at 44, The Grove Stratford, and from what she told me I fetched a constable—the prisoner went into my aunt's service when I discharged her—I went upstairs with the constable and searched the prisoner's box; she was present—we found a pair of steel sleeve links, a steel buckle, and she was wearing a pair of gold. earrings—I identify those; they belong to my wife—she said she did not steal them, and afterwards she said she did.</p>

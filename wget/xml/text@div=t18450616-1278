                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife. One Sunday afternoon, seven weeks ago, I was taking tea with Mr. Patteson and my husband—there was my brother-in-law, whose name is Bolton, and a friend in company—four of us were at tea between three and four o'clock—we had been drink<lb></lb>ing all the Saturday night and all the Sunday morning, as well until tea-time—I had some whisky—I was not with my husband all the time; I</p>

               <p>was in Whitecross-street along with another neighbour—there is a place open all night—I was there all Saturday night and Sunday until I came home away from my husband—I was in Whitecross-street till between eleven and twelve on Sunday—I then came home—my husband was not at home when I came home—our party of four assembled between three and four-my husband began to cut the bread and butter—he had given me some money to buy the dinner with, I had spent it in drink, and he was asking me about the money—he complained of it, and I called him very bad names, which made him angry—he was cutting bread and butter, and flung the knife at me—he was on one side of the window, and I on the other, and the table between us—I was very aggravating, calling him very bad names—the knife hit me in my bosom—it gave me a little bit of a cut—I felt no pain in it—I could come out the next day, and have not felt pain ever since, or any inconvenience—my husband ran for a doctor, and ap<lb></lb>peared sorry for what he had done—he had been drinking also, but not much—Bolton, my brother-in-law, was in the room at the time—he it a bonnet-box maker, and my husband is in the same trade.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the prisoner's place, on the 4th of May, taking my tea—the prisoner was cutting bread and butter—he had been drinking, and his wife also—she began to abuse him in the most dreadful language, calling him very bad names indeed—he appeared very angry, and told her to hold her tongue several times, but she still continued, and be threw the knife at her—it struck her in her left breast—he went for I medical man, and came back with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was assistant to Mr. John Smith, a surgeon, it the time in question. The prisoner came to the shop, and asked me to go to a person who was stabbed—I hesitated about going—he pressed me very much, and was very anxious I should go—at last I went, and saw the prosecutrix—she was wounded in the breast—it was an incised wound, more or less punctured—she bled very little or none—it was a seven wound—it was in a dangerous place—the prisoner appeared to be very anxious about her.</p>

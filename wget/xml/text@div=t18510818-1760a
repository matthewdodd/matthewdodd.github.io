                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Shaw, a hay-salesman; the prisoner was also in his service. On 10th May, I sent him out with a load of hay to sell—he returned between 7 and 8 o'clock—I asked him whether be had sold it, he said he had—I asked whether he had the money—he said no, he should have it in a fortnight—on 21st June, I was at Smithfield-market, and had three loads of clover there, which I sold to a person we call <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;—I told the prisoner to go with him, and <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> said, as soon as the clover was unloaded there would be <hi rend="italic">ready tin</hi>—I said, "Do you mean money?"—he said, "Yes"—I sent the prisoner with the load, and in the evening I met the prisoner and <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> in the Old Kent-road, and asked him if he had got the money—he said he had got 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that the old woman had got no more, and the old man was not at home—he gave me the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not state the person's name to whom the clover was sold—he remained in the service a couple of weeks, and then left of his own accord—three or four days after he was taken into custody.</p>

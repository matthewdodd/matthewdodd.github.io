I am barman at the Alfred's Head, Newington Causeway—on the night of 14th October I was serving and saw the two prisoners between 12 o'clock and 12.30 in the bar—Bush asked me for half an ounce of tobacco and gave me a bad half-crown—I showed it to my master and he broke it—he gave it me back and I gave it to Bush—he gave me a shilling and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—they had half a quarter of gin between them, and while they were there a constable came and they were given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single; I was in the Refuge for the Destitute, but left last Saturday week; I know the prisoner Sharp. About six weeks before I was before the Magistrate, I had been living with him—he gave me in charge for robbing his aunt, and I was put in the Compter for three days—I was examined before Mr. Alderman Gibbs, and was let off—in Dec, 1844, I was out with Sharp in Gos well-street—I was living with him at the time—Sharp stopped at Mr. Cowan's shop—Sharp was looking in at the window, and I too—he went away and left me there—he came back, and took up some boots from Mr. Cowan's shop door—I believe there were twenty-four or twenty-five pairs—he went away with them up a turning which I believe is called French-alley—I saw him again in about three hours—he asked me to go to my sister's with him—we went there—he then went and fetched the bundle of boots—he asked James Connor, who was there, if he would buy a pair—he did not buy any—Sharp said he had dropped a pair, and a boy picked them up and went away with them—he then said he knew a person who would buy them, would I go with him—I went with him to Mr. Ryan's, in Peter-street—Sharp carried the boots—he asked Ryan 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, and Ryan gave him 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw that—we left the boots at Ryan's, and Sharp and I went up to my sister's again—my sister asked Sharp where be got them—he said, "Not five minutes' walk from here"—my sister said, "Did you buy them?"<hi rend="italic"></hi>—he said it made no matter to her—the policeman came, and Sharp was taken into custody for taking things from a furnished lodging—the policeman said I was to go as well, and he took me too—my sister followed us, and, as we were going along, Sharp said, "Oh, Mary, if they had come five minutes sooner they would have catched me with what I had got with me"—my sister said, "What, the boots?"—he said, "Yes"—she asked him where he got them—he said, "Out of Goswell-street"—the next day I was going down Peter-street with Sharp—we saw Ryan—he said to Sharp, "I had you to <hi rend="italic">rights;</hi> you know what I gave you for those boots; I have sold four pairs to Mr. Green at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is a pair"—Sharp said, "You had me for a</p>

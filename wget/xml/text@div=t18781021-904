                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). In consequence of numerous complaints I kept observation on Hollis's house, in Old Street, St. Luke's—on the afternoon of 11th September I saw Connody come there with a costermonger's barrow and two bags full of something—he took them into Hollis's shop and left them there—he then went into the Griffin public-house close by, in Leonard Street, Shoreditch, where he was joined by Davis, and afterwards by Hollis—they remained together about 20 minutes—Connody and Davis then came out together, leaving Hollis behind—I followed them, and eventually stopped them in Moorgate Street—Connody was wheeling a barrow—I told them I should take them into custody for obtaining goods by fraud—Davis said "You have made a mistake"—Connody said he had only been moving the goods for Davis—I took them to the station, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards I went to Hollis's premises with Sergeants Miller and Fielder—I saw Hollis in the front shop, a workshop; he is a carpenter's bench maker—he was at work, and I think two, men besides—it was about 7 o'clock—Miller told him we belonged to the police, and asked him if he had got any glue, or bought any glue—after a little hesitation he said yes, he had, and he pointed to two bags which were on the shop floor covered with some wood—I told him we wanted a good deal more than that, had he got any more, as we should search his premises—I asked if he had any receipts for the glue, and he took this one out of his pocket and gave it me—his wife took these five other receipts off the file—I asked if he had any more—he said he had not—he and Miller then went upstairs and I followed—I asked if he knew the person from whom he bought the glue—he said "<hi rend="italic">No</hi>"—I said "Do you know his name?"—he said "No, the man called on me one day, and I think he left me a card"—I asked if he knew where he was living—he said "No; if I could find the card I could tell you"—he asked what the bother was about—I said "This glue has been obtained by fraud, and you will be charged with receiving it with a guilty knowledge"—he became very much excited, and said "Well, well, it is a bad job"—I then took him to the Old Street Police-station—upstairs I saw a quantity more glue, 14 bags altogether, which I assisted in taking to the station, 13 1/2 cwt. in the whole—there was no other glue in the place—the whole of it has since been identified by the witnesses, and I have seen cheques relating to it all—a cramp was also found upstairs at Hollis's of the value of about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that has been identified—I had been watching the premises for about four months—I believe I saw Davis in the shop one night, but I am not certain.</p>

The receipt which Hollis took out of his pocket relates to the two bags of glue that were on the floor of the shop which I had see delivered that afternoon; they were not far from the door; I did not see them till they were uncovered, his coat was on them—about two and a half bags of glue were on the first landing and the remainder on the top floor—I believe he has lived in that street 18 months—when I told him we wanted some more glue he said there was some upstairs—he took Miller upstairs—I did not hear what took place with Killer—a two-shilling piece was found on Connody.</p>

I went with Marony and Fielder to Hollis's shop—I told him we belonged to the police, and had come about some glue—Marony pointed out two bags of glue in the shop by the left<lb></lb>hand side of the staircase, partly covered with some wood, some benches—we asked if he had a receipt, and he took one from his pocket and gave to Marony—he was asked if he had any more—he said no, and his wife took some more off the file, which Marony took—I asked if he had any more glue; he said "Yes"—I said "Where, because we are going to search your place?"—he said "There is some more there"—on the right<lb></lb>hand side there were two and a half bags more totally covered over with some wood—I said there was more, and he had better show us where it was, to save trouble—he said "I have got some more; it is upstairs"—I went upstairs with him—on the first floor we found nothing; they were living and sleeping rooms—there was a narrow staircase leading up to the top floor, where was a warehouse full of wood; he lighted the gas; there was the appearance of there having been a fire in the stove, and there was a small glue pot and a bench—I saw an empty glue bag on the top' of some timber—I said "I suppose the glue is here?"—he said "Yes, it is"—there were about 20 heavy planks of wood, under which the glue was; I had to move all that wood before I came to it; it was completely covered; I passed the place twice without seeing it—I said "You are sure this is all?"—he said "Yes, you have got it all now"—I asked if he had anything else of the same people—he said "No"—he said he had all this from the same people—Marony remarked that the receipts were in different names—he said when he bought the glue he had not taken notice of the names on the receipts—he was told he would be taken to the station and charged—I afterwards went again to Hollis's with Connody, and found a cramp—I told Hollis of that at the station, and he said "I forgot all about that; I bought it of the same man."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Davis's Defence</hi>. it has been hinted that no money passed between me and Hollis. Where is the witness to prove that? Whenever I went to his shop with the glue I always found him and gave him the receipt and he gave me the money; on no occasion has he failed in giving me the amount' in fact, I took over and above the amount on the receipts. Mr. Hollis, being no scholar, did not deduct the 5. per cent I always had the money for every ounce of glue that was taken, even to the last We went into two other public-houses and joined friends, and I met a third man and gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that accounts for no more than 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. being found on me.</p>

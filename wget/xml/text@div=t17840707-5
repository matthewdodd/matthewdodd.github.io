               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - I beg to go nearer him, being near sighted; (after going close up to the prisoner) Yes, perfectly; I was robbed on the 8th of June, about five yards above <placeName id="t17840707-5-crimeloc23">Coleman's theatre</placeName>

               <p>What time was it? - Between nine and ten, I came out of the theatre, and was turning up the <placeName id="t17840707-5-crimeloc24">Haymarket</placeName>

I attended at the office in Bow-street the next morning, and gave information in hopes of recovering my property, and described the prisoner so exactly that Sir Sampson Wright's men went and apprehended him in about a quarter of an hour after, I waited in Sir Sampson's Office, the prisoner was brought in and many others.</p>
               <p>Are you positively sure that that is the man? - Most positive my Lord, if nature forms one man so much like another, I am sure my situation would be more disagreeable than his. I never got my watch again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What was the value of your watch? - It was a very remarkable watch, a time keeper, it was a very improved watch, made by Mr. Comyns.</p>
               <p>You never saw the person before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>This was a pretty severe land engagement, Captain? - A great scuffle; there were five of them had their hands upon me at one time, but there were more there than a dozen.</p>
               <p>Might not it have happened that the hand that was applied to your fob was the hand of some other person and not the prisoner's? - It is possible it might have happened, but by no means probable.</p>
               <p>If the man was forced upon you in the manner you have described, it should seem as if that would have incapacitated him from taking your watch, and that somebody else took it? - If the force had not been intentional.</p>
               <p>Can you ascertain exactly and with precision, so as to say that it was not involuntary force; might he not have been forced by the rest of the mob? - No.</p>
               <p>You was not at all apprehensive as to personal danger, I believe I may say so, Captain, from your known character and courage? - I rather smiled at the oddity of being assaulted by such a number of people at such a time of night, I was not at all apprehensive of my life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I think, my Lord, there is a case where the prosecutor expressly swore he was not put in fear.</p>
               <p>Court. It is taking by force, which is the same thing as taking by fear. Suppose a man is knocked down and never sees the hand.</p>

               <p>Court. It is not necessary to examine him, the gentleman has sworn positively to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the Council for the prisoner endeavoured to get from the prosecutor, that he was not alarmed or put in fear, but in point of law it is sufficient to constitute a robbery, either if your property is delivered by fear, threats, and menaces, or if a man comes and takes your property from you by violence on the road; and at this time of day it would be a very doubtful case, whether the objection would hold if a person delivered his money with his own hands, and said he was not put in fear; but that is not the case here: whether he was put in fear or not, if a man parts with his property, either from the effect of terror or force, it is equally a robbery in either case.</p>

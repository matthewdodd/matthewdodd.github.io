               <p>I happened to be out till half past ten last Sunday week, when I came home I found my house broke open; I had fastened all secure. I live at Clapton, in the parish of Hackney, I fastened it up at half past eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any body in the house? - No, I am a single person, I live by myself, there was nobody in the house when I left it. I am a hair dresser; the house consists of one ground floor only.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any buildings over it? - No, it was one room only, in that room is my bed and shop; the house was untiled, there was neither door nor window broke.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of it was untiled? - About five or six tiles were taken off.</p>
               <p>Q. How high may these tiles be from the ground? - Seven or eight feet from the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this house is a mere shed? - It is built as one.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss from it? - One box broke open, there were no clothes in that box, only persumery, and two guineas that was taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150025"></xptr>Q. When had you seen the two guineas before? - I saw them before I went out that very day; I had powder and pomatum keeping in that same box, I put it in that same night; the money was laying open in a till in the top of the box, there was nothing that I missed there; there was a trunk broke open, and the clothes taken out of that trunk, they took out a hat, a green cloth coat, four cotton jackets, two waistcoats; one was a striped silk and cotton, and the other was a kerseymere, two pair of nankeen breeches, one pair of kerseymere breeches; there was another place in which my things lay besides, neither in this box or trunk, in an open box, from thence they took eight pair of silk and cotton stockings, four pair of cotton stockings only, and three shirts; my hat was worth about ten and six pence, the green coat forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of finding your house broke open? - I was very much frightened indeed, and did nothing, but the next morning when I heard the man was in custody, I went with them before the justice.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patroles belonging to Hackney parish; I was with Samuel Sims on the evening of Sunday the 6th, accordingly I was just going out, Sims came down to the watch-house, and asked me to go along with him to this stack, to see who came after these things. We waited there till a quarter past six in the morning, at a quarter past six the prisoner at the bar came, and I laid hold of him, accordingly as I laid hold of him he cried I am dead, I am hung; accordingly he told me where he brought these things from, that he had broke open into Mr. Mitchell's house, that he took the tiles off from the house; the man is a bricklayer's labourer in Clapton, he works for one Mr. Peel, who lives near where Mr. Mitchell lives; he said that he got down from the roof of the house, and after he got down, he broke open two boxes, they were both locked; it was much about ten o'clock in the evening that he got those things out, and brought them down, and laid them down behind the hay stack.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any promise to him if he would tell you where he got them? - No, he confessed, I suppose through the fright, and cried and begged of me several times to let him go, he seemed very much alarmed, he told me he was then coming with an intention to take these things away, that he had rather overlaid himself, or else he thought of being sooner. We took him down to the watch-house, and there we searched him, but we found no property at all belonging to Mr. Mitchell.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find the two guineas? - No, we did not find any thing of the money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I know no more about it than a child unborn; I got up about half past six, to go to work as usual. I lodge at Hackney, at the Mermaid; I had to go to work at Lee-bridge, as I was going to work I went up to the hay stack to case myself, and the watchman jumped out and catched hold of me, and said O, you are coming for your prey, are you, and they shook me, and hustled me, and then they took me into the public house, and had a pot of purl, and they made me quite stupid, and every thing they said, I said yes to, then they took me into the watch-house, and then they brought me some gin.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did they give you the purl? - At the watch-house, the purl and the gin, after I had been in the watch-house about half an hour; I stopped there, the constable and the watchman came, and the constable took me to his house, and had a glass of gin, and they gave me some breakfast; and then the men came and said that whatever they said I must stand to; I was quite stupified, I did not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Court to Griffiths. Did he make this confession before he drank this purl, or after? - Before he got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Jury to Sims. Did the bundle remain under the hay stack the whole night? - No, it was taken to the watch-house by me about twelve o'clock; from that time to this it has been in my custody.</p>

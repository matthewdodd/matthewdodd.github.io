                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 343). Since February last my beat has been the lower part of Fleet-street and Bride-lane—during the month of May I saw all the defendants there—they were there with books in their hands, receiving bets, and passing books to the bystanders, containing a list of horses—there were a great many people round them the chiefs part of the time they were there; I mean round each of them: sometimes perhaps half-a-dozen, and sometimes a score—I have seen them there almost every day since February, not every day, from about 11 o'clock or a little after, up to 1, 2, and 3—it is very bad indeed for passengers to get through the lane—it is so crowded, that people cannot get through without they squeeze themselves through; the passage is blocked up—I have noticed vehicles passing—they cannot get through without stopping and shouting for them to get out of the way for a yard or two—the people have been standing in the roadway, collected round the defendants—when vehicles have been passing they have been obliged to squeeze up against the houses to let them through, and to walk behind the vehicles to let them pass forward—the lane is not wide enough at this end for more than one carriage to pass—the foot<lb></lb>way is not much over a yard or a yard and a half wide—I have had com<lb></lb>plaints from the inhabitants and people passing up and down—they are obliged to go round instead of going up the lane; they have complained of the nuisance of so many people crowding in the lane—the lane has an opening into New Bridge-street—I do not know that it would save anything to persons going from the north part of Fleet-street to the bridge to go along Bride-lane—if they come into the passage leading to St. Bride's Church, and down by the churchyard, they would save a little—I was on duty there at the latter part of 1851, all 1852, and the early part of 1853—there was more traffic passing through the lane then in the middle of the day than there</p>

               <p>is now, because they cannot get through now—the obstruction has been about the same ever since the spring; I have not noticed much difference—have seen the defendants with books in their hands, small books that they hand to one another with cards relating to the horses—I have seen them make entries in their books and I have seen all of them receive money.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Used you to go down there in plain clothes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, in uniform—I am on duty in Fleet-street and part of Bride-lane—I have seen the four prisoners there, in different parts of the lane—I have seen them speaking together sometimes, once or twice—they were standing a little apart, each with a small number of persons round him, about ten or twenty, thick enough to block all the lane up—they were close up together, so that they all joined together through the lane; they were not far enough apart to be separated—they were all standing up and down the lane, passing one from another—each of the persons with books in their hands stood separate from the others with books, having persons round them with whom they were betting—sometimes I have seen a dozen persons, and sometimes more with books, in which they were apparently entering bets; each with a cluster of persons round him, a great many more than ten or twelve—I have never tried to clear the lane—I have asked them to get out of my way a good many times, but they took so very little notice that I do not ask them now, I generally push them out of the way—I was never directed by the City authorities to clear the lane—I never attempted it—it would be impossible for one man to do it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

In consequence of instructions I received from my superior officers, I went to Bride-lane in the course of May this year—I was there continuously for several days—on those occa<lb></lb>sions I observed the four defendants there—from 12 o'clock in the day till 2 is the busiest time in the lane—on 6th May, I have got it down in my book, that there were about 400 in the lane, and next day I counted 470 up the lane—upon different days, when I have been there, there was such an assem<lb></lb>blage of people as I have spoken of, more or less—the defendants had books in their hands making bets—I have seen them, besides talking to the people in the lane, at other times talking to each other, in the evening—I have not observed the defendants when together making entries in their books—while talking to the other people they have been separate from each other, then each man had a book in his hand—I have seen each of the defendants having a book in his hand talking to the persons in the lane, and apparently making bets with them—at such times the public thoroughfare has been impeded or obstructed, both the footway and carriage way—I have myself witnessed a difficulty on the part of the persons getting through—I have had complaints made by the inhabitants and by passengers.</p>

               <p>them—I have seen one of them go away when the number of persons was getting large—that was Newcomb—I saw him run away one afternoon, so as to avoid having so many people round—when I have asked them to move they have moved about a yard, and immediately my back was turned they stood again—I have endeavoured to clear the lane, along with the constable that has been on duty with me, by walking down the middle and telling them they must get out of the lane, and the instant we pass them they come back again to the same place—I have never taken down a sufficient force to endeavour to clear the lane—I know nothing about our having power to do so—I try to remove the orange-women and all the obstructions that come in my way—I never warned any of these persons that they would get into trouble if they persisted in being there.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a builder, at 3, Bride-lane—during May, June, July, and August, I have observed daily a large concourse of people there—on nearly all those occasions I have seen the defendants there with books in their hands, receiving money and making bets—the thorough<lb></lb>fare has been so far obstructed by this congregating of persons, that it has been as difficult to get through it as it would be to get out of a theatre or a church; the crowd has been very great indeed—I have seen persons incom<lb></lb>moded by it, struggling with great difficulty to get through—I have taken the dimensions of the lane—it is fifteen feet wide, and sixty or sixty-four feet in length—the crowd is such, that at times the whole of it is blocked up—that is that one half of the lane—there is a bend in it, one half in generally occupied, the other is comparatively free, unless the half nearest Fleet-street is so far full that there is no room for them—many persons have refused to come to me in my business in consequence of this assemblage of persons.</p>

On the 20th of May, between twelve and one o'clock, I went out, leaving my little girl in the house - the back door was open; I returned in about half an hour, and met my little girl coming to me at the corner of the street - I saw the prisoner come from my back door, out of the garden gate; I said nothing to him then - I went into my bed-room, looked into my box, and a gown, which I had seen there half an hour before, was gone - the box was not locked; I ran out, caught him by the arm, and told him he had been into my bed-room, and taken a gown out of my box; he said he had not, that he had picked it up in the garden; and then said a brick-making looking man gave it to him; I said it was no such thing, that I had seen him come out of the house - my little girl said, "You have got the gown between your black bag;" he said he had not - he took the bag from under his arm, and the gown dropped down; I picked it up - I sent my girl for the Policeman; he got from me, and ran up Tottenham-street - he was out of my sight for five minutes; I then saw him in the custody of the Policeman - I am positive he is the man; when I went out I had left my bedroom door latched, but not locked - it is on the ground floor; I left nobody but my little girl in the house - she is not twelve years old.</p>

               <p>EDWARD HARROP. I am a Policeman. I was in Kingsland-road - the prosecutrix's daughter called me; I pursued, and took the prisoner - Mrs. Green gave charge of him for stealing the gown, which she gave me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was stopping there for him to come, but he did not, and I went on purpose to see him. Witness. He was running, and I stopped him.</p>
               <p>REBECCA GREEN. I was left in care of the house by my mother; I had been out about ten minutes, and was coming back with my mother; I saw the prisoner come out of the house - I know the bed-room door was shut when I left, for I tried it, and am positive it was latched.</p>
               <p>MRS. GREEN. I found the bed-room door shut when I came home; this is my gown - there were other things in the room, but not in the trunk.</p>

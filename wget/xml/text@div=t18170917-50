            . I live in Crispin-street, Spitalfields. On the 12th of September, about twelve o'clock at night, as I was going along I took my watch out and put it into my coat pocket, the prisoner, Kempshaw put her hands round me, took it out, and ran away, the other prisoner stood by - I asked her where her companion was gone, but she would not answer. I gave her in charge. The next day I met Kempshaw at the Mansion-house, and gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>JOHN BURCH. The prosecutor gave Williams into my custody. I saw Kempshaw and Williams pass me together that night.</p>

               <p>WILLIAMS'S Defence. I knew nothing about it, and told him so.</p>

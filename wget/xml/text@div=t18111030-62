            . I am watchman of St. James's, Clerkenwell. On the 10th of October, about one o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner when I was upon my beat, it was very dark; I heard some beasts coming down Corporation-row, it was the prisoner with two heifers, he told me he was going to take them to the Green-yard, it being an unseasonable hour I stopped him. I put the beasts in Mr. Austin's yard, the skin-market, and took the prisoner to the watchhouse; he said he picked the beasts up in a court in Corporation-row.</p>
               <p>JOHN AMOS. I am foreman to Mr. Kent at the Angel, he takes in cattle for drovers and butchers; the drover said he had put two heifers in the field; the field has a gate to it, and if that was secured the beasts could not get out.</p>
               <p>Inglestorff. I put these beasts in the field at half past four on Wednesday afternoon, I shut the gate after me, and told Mr. Amos of it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Amos. Is this gate locked - A. No; the outer gate is locked of a Sunday night and Thursday night, it is upon the latch of other nights. I saw the prisoner twice in my hay barn about six weeks before; I turned him away.</p>

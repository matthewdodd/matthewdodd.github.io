                  </hi>. I am the wife of Job John Miller, he keeps the Union, in Mint-street, Borough. On the 3rd of Nov. the prisoners came there together between six and seven o'clock in the evening—Williams said, "Have a pint of beer," and Baker said, "No, have gin"—I served them with gin—Baker put down a half-crown and took it up again, and gave me a shilling—I took the shilling and rang it on the counter—I left it there while I gave the change—I then took the shilling up to put in the till, and thought it was a bad one—my husband was gone into the parlour with a pot of beer, and I put the shilling under the gin tap, till he returned—I then asked him if it was bad or good—there was no one there who could have got to the gin tap—I afterwards gave it to the policeman—I never intimated to either of the prisoners that I thought it was bad—they staid ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, after I gave them change—the shilling was under the gin tap all the time.</p>

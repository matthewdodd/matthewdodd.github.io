I have not seen it since indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the prisoner took it? - There was no other person in the shop when the watch was missing excepting him; he came and brought a pair of reins of a one horse chaise to fell; says he, these are a pair of old reins that my master gave me; says he, will you buy them? I said, I don't know, I will step and ask my master, who was in the yard at the back of the shop. I took them into my hand and went backward; my master said, they are not stolen goods, are they John? I said, I think not, because I know the person; I was absent about two or three moments, the prisoner followed me backwards; I cannot say that he was out of my sight; my master and he agreed for the goods. When I came forward, in less than five minutes after he was gone, I missed my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it hanging up when he was there? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the shop door, is it kept open or shut? - There is a little half door with a bolt to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it with my counsel.</p>

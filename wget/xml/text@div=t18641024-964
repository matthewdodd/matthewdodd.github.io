                  <hi rend="smallCaps">PHILIP HENRY BENETT</hi>. I am a member of the firm of Leigh ton and Co.—our offices in Loudon are at 19, Mark-lane—the head quarters of the firm are at Shanghai—we deal with the Imperial Government of China, in exporting cannons, guns, &amp;c.—I believe we do all their business—I know the defendant—I may have known him a year and a half or two years—I was introduced to him by one of our clerks—I believe he is a commission agent—I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for giving instructions in book-keeping—I after<lb></lb>wards gave Captain Blakely an order through Mr. Marshall—he would be en<lb></lb>titled to commission upon that from Captain Blakely—he made a claim on Captain Blakely of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for commission, which Captain Blakely disputed—that was litigated at Guildford—Mr. Marshall wished me to be arbitrator—I said I did not think it was fair that I should, because I had already made up my mind that he was not entitled to more than Captain Blakely offered, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—Captain Blakely hearing that offer was made, wrote and accepted me as arbitrator, and then Marshall wrote to say I had not accepted the office—the trial came on in the summer—I can't say whether it was in August or not—I had some conversation with Marshall just before the trial came on—I told him that I thought the whole of the just claim against Captain Blakely would be liquidated by what Captain Blakely offered to pay him, and I did not think that by going to law he. would do anything else than run himself into expenses—I did not offer him any bet of a 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to one; most decidedly not—I do not remember any<lb></lb>thing about a bet at all; either my offering or Mr. Marshall accepting a bet—I do not recollect anything about the matter—I don't think it was possible that I could have bet a 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi> to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't remember such an expression passing—whether it passed or not, I can't say—I am per<lb></lb>fectly positive and certain that I made no bet—on the day of the trial I stated to Mr. Marshall's attorney that it was very inconvenient that Mr. Byrne, who is our head clerk, should be away from the office at the same time as myself—I think he then said he would take it into consideration—he afterwards came into my room at the hotel and told me that he intended to keep Mr. Byrne—I represented to him that his evidence was the same as mine, and asked him if he had power to keep him—he said, "I will keep Mm in gaol"—I said, "You walk out of my room, and don't come into it again"—I asked a friend of mine who was there, Mr. Pope Henessey, whether Marshall's solicitor had any power to put Byrne in prison, and he. said no.</p>

               <p>asked to be allowed to take copies, and I told Mr. Byrne to let him take copies of anything he liked—both parties had power to take any copies of anything in our office connected with the case—400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd was paid to Mr. Marshall—it was a verdict by consent between the parties—it never went to the jury—I have seen Mr. Marshall write, and know his handwriting mode<lb></lb>rately well; it is my belief that this letter, dated 8<hi rend="italic">th</hi> August, is his hand-writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read: "</hi> 53, New Bond street. August 8<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1854. Dear sir,—If you have any demand on me for the expense of your attendance at Guildford, I beg you to send me the particulars at once, in order that my solicitor may in<lb></lb>clude them in the costs to be taxed against Captain Blakely. I have delayed writing to you on this subject as I have been in daily expectation of the receipt of a cheque for the amount of your bet on the result of the trial, which I must say you seem to have spared no pains to make safe. Yours respect<lb></lb>fully, William Marshall. P. H. Benett, Esq. ")—This next letter was written in answer to that, by Mr. Byrne—(" 19, Mark-lane, E. C. 8<hi rend="italic">th</hi> August, 1864. Sir,—In reply to yours of to-day, Mr. Benett has desired me to say that he has no expenses to charge, as he considers that Captain Blakely has been <hi rend="italic">very</hi> badly treated, and that should the present verdict be adhered to, Cap<lb></lb>tain Blakely will have quite enough expenses without his adding to them; and with regard to the bet, Mr. Benett recollects making some offer, but was not aware that you accepted it. I am, sir, yours faithfully, Robert H. Byrne. W. Marshall, Esq. ")—That letter is not consistent with the orders I gave Mr. Byrne—I did not tell him that I acknowledged having made a bet at all—it is partly correct—I told him to say that I did not wish to increase Captain Blakely's expenses—I was in a great hurry at the time, and I said, "I neither recollect any bet, nor Mr. Marshall making any."</p>

") I was subpoened by the defendant—I went into the witness box, but did not speak a word—I was not sworn—(<hi rend="italic">another letter from Marshall to Benett, dated 23rd August, was here read, stating that, as he had received no reply to his letters, he should take proceedings against Benett for the payment of</hi> 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—About 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> September I received this printed document, with a written document in this envelope—(<hi rend="italic">the written document stated that Mr. Marshall was about to submit the enclosed to the Stafford and Jockey Clubs, and to the Circle, and to circulate it in London, Shanghai, St. Petersburg, and every commercial emporium in the world, and invited Mr. Benett to add any-thing, to modify, or contradict any portion of it. The printed document was as follows:</hi>—"Statement of facts arising out of a wager between Mr. Philip Henry Benett, of the firm <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Leighton and Co. of London and Shanghai, and Mr. William Marshall. Mr. Marshall having a considerable claim upon Captain Blakely, arising out of a contract for the supply of cannon, ammuni<lb></lb>tion, &amp;c. for the Imperial Government of China, he was compelled to resort to legal proceedings to enforce payment of it Mr. Benett, who is intimately connected with Captain Blakely, took great interest in the question. The attorneys employed to defend the action were the attorneys of Mr. Benett as</p>

               <p>well as of Captain Blakely. On the 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> August, on the very eve of the trial, Mr. Benett offered a bet to Mr. Marshall of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that he would not recover more than 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which Mr. Marshall accepted. On 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi> August the cause was tried at Guildford. Mr. Benett and his clerk, Mr. Byrne, were suhpoened as witnesses for Mr. Marshall, the plaintiff Both attended accordingly, but Mr. Benett, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Mr. Marshall's attorney, sent Mr. Byrne away, and he returned to Loudon before the cause was called on. Mr. Benett, however, remained, and during the whole day was in constant communication with the defendant's attorney, whom he supplied with invoices, letters, and other documents for use in the cause. To the surprise of Mr. Marshall, Mr. Benett entered the box as a witness for Captain Blakely. The counsel for the defendant did not, however, ask him a single question, and the jury without hesitation found a verdict for the plaintiff for 475<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which, with the costs, has since been paid. The following correspondence subse<lb></lb>quently passed between Mr. Marshall and Mr. Benett"—(<hi rend="italic">the letters were then inserted</hi>). I never wrote to Marshall—I am not connected with the turf—I go to races—I never made a book in ray life—the last race I went to, was the first day at Goodwood—I shortly afterwards received this statement and letter—it is the fair copy of the proof of the same circular—I received it immediately after the other one—this was addressed to the firm.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Will you take upon yourself to say that address is the handwriting of the defendant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it is my belief that it is his writing—I am a member of Tattersall's—an order was given to us for the Chinese Government, through Mr. Marshall in the first instance, and we supplied two 9-pouuders, described as Blakely's guns—I afterwards gave Cap<lb></lb>tain Blakely orders, through Mr. Marshall, for the sake of giving Marshall a chance of getting a commission—he told me he would be satisfied with 2 l/2 per cent, and he squeezed 15 per cent, out of Captain Blakely—I think Captain Blakely was able to make his own arrangements, but I do not think he understood the arrangement between Mr. Marshall and myself—I should have to pay the amounts by bills and otherwise to Captain Blakely—I had a subpoena on the part of Marshall, and I believe I had a subpoena on the other side, but I was at Guildford at the time—I did not hand a single paper or invoice to the defendant's attorney on the day of the trial, nor did my clerk—I ordered the attorney out of my room, because he said if my clerk attempted to leave he would put him in gaol—I sent my clerk up to Loudon immediately, although I knew he had been subpoened as a witness—I am a director with Captain Blakely of the Tavistock Iron Works Company—I cannot swear whether Cunliffe and Beaumont are the solicitors to that Company—the business of the Iron Company has been carried on at 19, Mark-lane for ten days past, the offices are being repaired—I was just leaving my private office when I told my clerk to write that letter which has been read—I had read Marshall's letter then—it came in with the other letters—I have no doubt I read it—yes, I read that letter—what I said to Byrne, as nearly as I can recollect, was, "Here is a ridiculous letter from Mr. Marshall; write and tell him that I think Captain Blakely has been very hardly used. I have no expenses to charge, in fact I think he will have quite enough expenses to meet without them; and with regard to the bet, I neither recol<lb></lb>lect making him any offer, or his accepting any"—I read the next two letters from Marshall—I don't know whether Byrne was present when I read the one of 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> August—I did not, upon reading that, ask him what he had written to Mr. Marshall—I may have spoken to him about it before I re<lb></lb>ceived the printed document—I never recollect making an offer of a bet of</p>

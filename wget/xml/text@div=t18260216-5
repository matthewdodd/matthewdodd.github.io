On the 7th of February, about nine o'clock at night, I was in my parlour - two men came in, but I could not see them - I know there were two men; somebody came in and put both his hands suddenly over my eyes and mouth. I know there were two, because I heard the other shut the door while the other held me - neither of them spoke a word; the first continued holding his hand over my eyes and mouth, while the other stepped up, put his hand into my pocket, and took out five half-pence, which was all I had about me; they still held me - I could not call out as he stopped my breath - they were about five minutes in the room - I made a kind of moan, as well as I could, and the lodgers came in - they ran out - one escaped, and the other, who was the prisoner, was taken in the passage. - I could not move the protect my money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. I suppose your sight is bad? A. Yes, being old. The prisoner had no business whatever in my room - he once lodged in the house.</p>

            . I am an hostler, and lodge in the prosecutrix's house. On this night, about nine o'clock, I was with my wife in my room, which is exactly over the parlour; I heard a groaning noise, like a person in an apoplectic fit - my wife followed me down with a candle; I tried the room door, and asked Mrs. Hill, three or four times, what was the matter, but got no answer. I burst the door open with my feet, and the first man I attacked was the prisoner; there were two of them, but the moment I seized him the other man rushed out, and snatched the candlestick out of my wife's hand: the prisoner and I were down in the passage for five minutes, and the other man was five minutes before he could find the door. I succeeded in detaining the prisoner - he had no right in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could you tell whether the other man was older than the prisoner? A. I consider him younger - he left his hat behind, and it would hardly fit a boy sixteen years old.</p>

About half-past nine o'clock I was sent for - Simpson gave the prisoner into my charge; on the way to the watch-house I asked what induced him to go into the old lady's premises - I neither threatened nor promised him; he said with intention to steal - that he was out of work and could not starve.</p>

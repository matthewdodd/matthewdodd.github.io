The prisoner lived with us six or seven months, and left on the 26th of February. I believe my father gave him warning. I know King, her father is a silk dresser in our neighbourhood. On the 1st of December last, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, she came to our house for change for a 25 l. note - I gave her change. I was in the bar, and went up stairs to my mother, and got change. I wrote her father's name on the face of the note -</p>
               <p>"Mr. King, Worship-street, December 1, 1820," - and put it in the till, which I did not lock. The bar will not hold above two or three people - Our friends sometimes go in. My mother came into the bar at three o'clock - I had been out of the bar into the tap-room, several times before that, I do not know whether any one went in while I was absent, as I cannot see the bar from the tap-room. The prisoner and female servant used to go into the bar, to draw beer, and fill pipes of tobacco. When my mother came at three o'clock, she looked in the till I looked also, and found the note was gone. I do not recollect asking the prisoner about it. He remained in my father's service till the 21st of February.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Clifton-street, Finsbury-market. The prisoner used to bring me beer from the prosecutor's. About the 1st of February he had a pair of boots of me. He came to pay me for them one day, I cannot tell the day - he put his hand in his pocket, pulled something out, and then paid me 16 s. or 18 s. in silver. He pulled out at the same time, what appeared to me to be a piece of an old newspaper, which he left on my floor, and went away. He returned in about fifteen or twenty minutes, and said he had lost something - and then looking towards the place, said,</p>
               <p>"Here it is" - taking up the paper, he opened it. I was sitting at dinner, and could not see whether it was a 25 l. note, or what, but he said it was a 25 l. note. I could see it was neither a 1 l. 5 l. or 10 l.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went and apprehended the prisoner, in company with Attfield and another person, on the 13th of March, at No. 1, Luke-street, about two hundred yards from Weston's house. We found him there. I told him what I wanted him for. I was searching his box - he said, there was no occasion to search his box. One of his sisters said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, if you know any thing about it, tell Mr. Weston." I said nothing to induce him to say anything. One of his sisters wanted to go out. I told Mr. Weston to let no one out. He then said the boy at the White Hart, Clifton-street, had got the 25 l. note. He did not say who the boy was. I left him in Attfield's care, went to the White Hart, and found Charles Paveley there, and told him what the prisoner had said. He pulled out his pocket-book and gave me this 25 l. note. He said he could not read, and had never looked at it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. Q. He told you about it immediately he was desired - A. Yes. I did not know the prisoner was the boy's brother till afterwards.</p>

            . I have heard Garton's account - it is correct. I employed the prisoner to carry out beer, at 5 s. 6 d. per week, and gave him board and lodging. When he left me I paid him about 11 s. I generally paid him once in three months, or when he asked for money. I discharged him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know he cannot read - Q. I do not know. We missed the note on the 1st of December, and found it about the 13th of March. He left me in February. I keep the house myself - it is in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>M. A. WESTON. It is my father's note, and that I received from King - it has my writing on it.</p>

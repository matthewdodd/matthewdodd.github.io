                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Walker, a weaver, of 11, Cheshire-street—on Tuesday, 10th May, between 8 and 9 in the evening, I saw the deceased bleeding from the head, at her own door—I took her up-stairs and washed her head—I saw the prisoner in the passage—he said, "She struck me first, and I struck her back."</p>

I am the wife of William Henry Blake, and live at 5, Ramsay-street, Bethnal-green—on the night of 19th May, I went to the deceased, and helped to bathe her temples—the prisoner was there—I asked what he had done to her—she said he had struck her, but she had struck him first—I don't know who said it, but I heard it said in the room that it was done with a broom—they were both a little under the influence of liquor—I met the prisoner next morning, and he told me to mind my own business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—I saw the deceased when she was admitted there on 19th May—she lived six days—she had a severe scalp-wound on the top of the head; that wound produced erysipelas, which caused her death—her internal organs were in a most diseased condition; that also caused erysipelas—the two causes com<lb></lb>bined, the condition of her body and the wound, caused the erysipelas, which ended in death—I made a post-mortem examination—there was ex<lb></lb>tensive fatty degeneration about the heart, liver, and kidneys; the other organs were tolerably healthy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the kidneys very much diseased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; in a person who had diseased kidneys, any slight wound will cause erysipelas—the lungs were congested, but that was quite secondary—in almost every death the lungs are congested towards the last—erysipelas frequently comes on without any wound, but in this case the wound caused it; there would have been none without—she was somewhat advanced in life—in this case the erysipelas commenced around the wound; in common erysipelas it commences about the face—there are exceptions to that; it may occur in any part.</p>

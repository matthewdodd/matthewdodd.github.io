                  </hi>. I am a Frenchman. I live in Gloster-grove, West, Old Brompton—I had a female named Barrett, in my service. On the 10th of Sept. I gave her some directions about a coat—I had worn it on the preceding day—there was a purse in the left pocket, containing a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, two sovereigns, and about twenty shillings in silver—I had changed a sovereign—there were three half-crowns and one sixpence; and the remainder in shillings—one was new—we could not find that coat—I missed that and another—I spoke of it to Mrs. Besset and the servant—I went to town, and returned in the evening—I sent for the police, and they came about seven or eight o'clock in the evening—they put some questions to Barrett, which she answered, after which the police left the house, and returned with the prisoner—the police-sergeant asked him if</p>

I was on duty at Old Brompton on the morning of the 10th of Sept., about six o'clock, and met the prisoner in the Brompton-road, between Brompton-square and the Grapes, coming in a direction from Old Brompton—I cannot rightly say whether he had anything under his left arm or not—the prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Mary Abbott's, Kensington—I first received inti<lb></lb>mation of this robbery between ten and eleven that same morning, from sergeant Poynton—I was afterwards ordered to go to Mr. Besset's house—I went about four that afternoon with a brother sergeant—I saw Barrett there, and Mrs. Besset, but as I could not get the number of the note that was lost, I called again about seven in the evening—I then heard my brother sergeant put some questions to Barrett, and in consequence of her answers my brother sergeant went and apprehended the prisoner at the Cock, in Tothill-street—the constable on duty brought him in custody to Mr. Besset's, between ten and eleven that night—he was brought into the parlour first by himself—I stated he was wanted on suspicion of a rob<lb></lb>bery that had been committed the night before, at Mr. Besset's home—I had learnt from Mr. Besset what money he had lost—he described the coin particularly to me—I told the prisoner I wished to see what money he had in his pocket—he took out his purse—it contained two sovereigns, three</p>

               <p>half-crowns, one sixpence, and ten shillings, one shilling was new—the coin tallied with the description Mr. Besset had given—the prisoner and Barrett were taken away together—I told him I knew him to be in the neighbourhood that evening—he admitted that he was there, and left about half-past nine or ten o'clock, but denied being in the house—I said the female servant had admitted he had been there, and remained in the house all night—he then said he had—he said at the station-house that he could account for the money, for he had had some recruits.</p>

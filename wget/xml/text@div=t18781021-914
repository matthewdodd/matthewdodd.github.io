                  </hi>. I live at 64, Weston Street, Bermondsey—on 25th August at 12.30 at night I was at a coffee-stall at the top of Duke Street, near London Bridge—I saw the prisoner there—he pushed against me as I was drinking some coffee, and upset it over me—I merely shoved him away and told him to go home—I had seen him before, but did not know him—he said he would pay me for that, and went away, as I thought down the Borough, I lost sight of him—I lit my pipe and went down Duke Street—when I was three parts down I heard somebody behind me, and it turned out to be the prisoner—he was about a yard and a half behind me with a knife open in his hand, and he said he would rip my guts open—I made an attempt to get the knife away from him, and he suddenly got behind me and stabbed me in the neck—I felt the blood trickling down my back—I put my left hand over my shoulder, and found that I was bleeding—I called out that I was stabbed, and I should have fallen if somebody had not come to my assistance—the pri<lb></lb>soner ran away after stabbing me—I had not heard him following me till he was two or three yards behind me, that was about 60 yards from the coffee-stall, and between two and three minutes after I had left it—he was drunk—I was not drunk—I knew what I was about—I was not quite sober—I recollect no more till I found myself in Guy's Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, of 2, Church Path, Waltham-stow—about a quarter to 1 on this night I was in Tooley Street, just by the railway arch—I saw the prisoner and prosecutor struggling at the corner of Duke Street for two or three minutes—I heard McCarthy say. "I am stabbed," and the prisoner ran away—I ran after him, he fell down, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187810210138"></xptr>
               <p>I caught hold of him, and said, "You have stabbed that man;" he said, "No, I have not. I said, "Yes you have, give me that knife." He said, "I won't;" I said, "You had better"—I had a struggle with him for twenty minutes before I could get it away from him, it was open—he made two or three attempts to put it into me—I got it at last from his right hand, it was covered with blood—two men came to my assistance and secured him till a policeman came—I helped carry McCarthy to the hospital—when I saw them struggling McCarthy was dodging round the prisoner, apparently trying to get away from him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was coming up Tooley Street through the subway—I was about 15 or 16 feet off when I saw the struggle—I did not see your full face, only your back—I am not embittered against you because you have had my character inquired into, it is no more than you ought to have done, I should have done the same if I was in your place—I did not strike you—you did not give me up the knife directly, I was struggling with you quite 20 minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at Guy's Hospital when McCarthy was brought there about one o'clock—he had a punctured wound on the side of the neck, about half an inch in extent, it would be caused by such a knife as this—it was a dangerous wound—he was not bleeding freely—he had fainted and consequently the hemorrhage had stayed—he is quite well now.</p>

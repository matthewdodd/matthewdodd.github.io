                  </hi>. I am the wife of Allen Frost, an upholsterer, at No. 18, Cirencester-place—we had a lodger named Parker. On the 10th of February the prisoner came to ask for a lodging—I said we could let him have half a bed—he said that would do, that he worked at Mr. Zetta's, a pianoforte maker, that he had been lodging at a public-house for a week, and had an uncomfortable bed-fellow, a tipsy man, and he was a teetotaller—I told him to call again at night, and I would consult my husband and lodger—he went away and did not come till next night, about nine o'clock—Parker had just come in and I introduced him to him—after some time the prisoner wrote his name down as Mason, and referred me to Zetta's—I said, "Of course you do not wish to sleep here to-night, as I have not your reference"—he seemed to stand and hesitate, and wish to sleep there—he said nothing—I said, "I always make it a rule to have a reference with lodgers before I take them"—he said certainly, he thought it was right—I showed him a light to the door—I said again, "Of course you do not wish to sleep here to-night"—he said he must get a fresh lodging if he did not, at a coffee-shop or public-house—I said it was a pity for him to go to bed there, as there was half a bed empty—I liked his appearance very much, and felt satisfied—I said I would go for the reference in the morning, and allowed him to remain—he went to bed with Parker—I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> At the office did you say I resembled the person, but you hardly knew me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I swore to you—I was not in the least doubt—I went to the cell to see him before I went before the Magistrate—I do not remember saying, "Now your worship I am ready to swear to him"—as he came to the door I saw his full face—I did not know him till I saw his side face—I knew his voice directly, and directly I saw his side face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and lodge with Frost. On the 11th of February when I came home in the evening, I saw the prisoner and had a conversation of some length with him—he told me he was a teetotaller, and worked at Zetta's pianoforte manufactory, in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood—I afterwards saw him write—he gave the name of Mason—it was at last agreed that he should sleep with me that night—I awoke next morning about a quarter or twenty minutes after seven o'clock, he was then dressing himself—he said nothing, but went away in a great hurry—I got up in about a quarter or half an hour and immediately missed my coat, which had laid over the back of a chair when I went to bed—I did not miss the waistcoat till evening—I went down and said I was afraid I was robbed—I afterwards went to Zetta's, and could hear nothing of the prisoner—I have never found my coat or waistcoat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What did you detain me for after I was discharged by Mr. Rawlinson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On suspicion of this robbery—you went quietly to the station—an old woman was produced against you, but not on these indictments—I did not go behind her, nor did the Magistrate say "Do not prompt the witness"—a young man named Wilson saw you—he said he could not swear to you.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was apprehended on a charge and discharged; as I left the office the policeman called me back; not knowing what it was for, I went back; he placed me before an old woman, above ninety, who could hardly see, she said she knew me by my carroty whiskers; I was taken to the station, and next morning he brought this woman before the Magistrate, who asked her when the robbery took place; she said on the 28th of February; the Magistrate said that could not be; the chief clerk said, "Was it the last day of January?" she said, "Yes;" the police<lb></lb>man was behind her ready to put the words into her mouth; the Magistrate said, "Do not let me see you do that again;" he introduced a man, who could not swear to me; I was remanded till Monday; on Thursday I was in the yard, and a man came to look at me; he said. "He resembles the Person very much, but he is not the person;" I was proved not to be</p>

I dispense the drugs for Mr. M'Murdo, the surgeon of Newgate—I am not a surgeon—I have seen the prisoner every day—I go round the gaol—I was present when Mr. M'Murdo examined him when he came in on the 17th of March—he had no appearance of disease at that time, and I am not aware of any since—I could not form an opinion whether he had had disease before—Mr. M'Murdo would not give him a certificate to that effect—his linen was not clean—there was nothing on it to lead to the conclusion that he had anything of the kind—he said he understood when he came in that Mr. M'Murdo would give him a certifi<lb></lb>cate—he applied for it several times—Mr. M'Murdo refused—not that he had any doubt about it—he wanted it to produce in court.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It is not likely a person could be in the beastly state the woman describes, and get rid of it in a month; it was not much more than a month after that I was apprehended—she says I was respectably dressed at her lodgings, and when she came to see me at the office I was ragged; do I look ragged now? this is my dress I was taken in, and have remained in ever since; the man says he saw roe dressed when he got up he missed his coat, but did not miss his waistcoat till evening; would he not have looked at once, and not left it till evening to look for his own property? I have no witnesses now, the persons are obliged to be away; the woman could not swear positively at the office; she said she sus<lb></lb>pected," and "she should say," but did not positively affirm or swear to me, till about an hour after she had been with the policeman. <hi rend="largeCaps">

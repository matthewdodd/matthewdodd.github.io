I was coming from Woodford in Essex, last Sunday was a month; a man overtook me, and we drank a pot of beer together. When night came on, I was wanting a good lodging; a gentleman told me he could help me to a very good one. He took me to the <placeName id="t17700530-31-crimeloc161">Black Boy on Saltpetre-bank</placeName>

The prisoner at the bar was laying in the same bed. Seeing her in bed, I said, I would not go to bed, but I would lay upon the bed. I laid down without pulling off my clothes. I soon felt her hand in my breeches. I removed my money into my coat-pocket, and laid upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see you move it?</p>
               <p>Smith. Not as I know of; my money was in a little leather purse, and that in a large one. I felt her hand going to one side. I put my hand in my pocket, and found my money was gone. She was going off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to sleep?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, I never slept at all; I was not in the room above half an hour, and I had not laid down above ten minutes before I missed my purse. I laid hold of her when I missed it, and a man came up and sell to beating me about for some time, and in struggling we all fell down stairs together. Then the woman of the house came and beat me with a poker about the head. They turned me out into the street, and I was knocked down once in the street. I begged of a man to let me be in his house, or I did not know but I should have been killed. I went to bed, and there lay till morning. The next morning a man asked me what was the matter? I told him. He said, Could you know the person that took your money? I said, I should. He went into the house, and brought the prisoner out directly. I knew her again. He ransacked her; what he found, I do not know. I was told she had money in her stocking, but I never could know the truth of it; I never saw it since. There was five guineas, a six shilling and nine pence, and a nine shilling piece. There was some silver, but I do not know how much.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by so much money?</p>
               <p>Smith. I saved it at my labour; it is what I could save out of two years wages; I lived with a farmer.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your business in London?</p>
               <p>Smith. I came to seek for work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Smith. I was very sensible and very sober; they behaved very well till after I was up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her take your money?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; I felt her hand in my fob. When she was before the Justice she said, she knew nothing of me or my money either.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never saw the man in my life till the day I was taken up before the bench.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Are you sure this is the woman that took your money?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177005300019"></xptr>Prosecutor. I am very sure; the blood that came from me by their beating me was upon her clothes in the morning when she was taken up. I bled very much; I could hardly see out of my eyes.</p>

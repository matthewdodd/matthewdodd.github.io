               <p>No. 165, Borough. I know the prisoner, he has come to our firm three or four times for steel—on the 12th of January I saw him there—it is my duty to make out the invoices, which I did for these goods—I do not know that the prisoner spoke to me—he presented me with a written order for the goods now produced—he said nothing—be<lb></lb>lieving it to be genuine, I made out a bill for two bundles of spring-steel, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not remember his saying any thing—he took the steel away—he had had goods before—not on his own account.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ five years ago, as hammerman to his father, who worked for me—I have not seen him since—he was discharged five years ago—I dealt with Messrs. Moser then, and do so now—this order is not my writing—I never authorised any body to write it for me, and none of the goods ever came to my premises.</p>

            . I am foreman to the prosecutors. On the 16th of February, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was showing some brooches to a lady at the counter, at the further end of the shop, the prisoner came in, and asked to look at a bunch of rings which were in the window - I told him to wait until I had done with the the lady; he waited about five minutes, and when I was putting a brooch in a box and paper for the lady, and giving her change (it came to 13s. 6d.), the prisoner ran to the further end of the shop, and made a sudden grasp at the brooches in the tray - I was the only person in the shop; I ran round the counter, he ran out immediately, I pursued, and caught a glimpse of him turning into the next shop but one, which is a jeweller's, I followed him into the passage, and attempted to lay hold of him, he pushed me down and ran away - I pursued, calling, stop thief. I never lost sight of him. Before he got across the road he fell himself, about five yards from me, I came up and secured him, I clenched one of his hands, which I found shut, brought him into the shop, and took him into the counting-house - I kept his hand close till the officer came, who took fifteen brooches out of it, all of which have my mark on them, and are worth 5l.; nine more were found on the floor in the shop.</p>

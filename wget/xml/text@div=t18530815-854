                  </hi>. I am a waiter, at the Gresham Club. On Friday night, 1st July, about 12 o'clock, I was on Holborn-hill—the prisoners came up to me, and I went with them into a public house to have something to drink together—while we were at the bar I felt a slight tug at my guard,</p>

               <p>which was round my neck, and saw Burke rush out at the side door—I put my hand to my waistcoat pocket and found that my watch was gone—Hill remained, she did not move—it was an Indian-rubber guard; I found it was cut—I have not seen my watch since.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a City-policeman. On 2nd July I took Burke into custody, on Holborn-hill—I did not search her; she was searched at the station, but nothing was found on her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter at Bacon's Hotel, Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. I was with Whatley, ray brother-in-law; the prisoners spoke to us on Holborn-hill, and we went into a public-house about a quarter to 12 o'clock—I went out, leaving Whatley and the prisoners in the house—as I stood in the middle of the street I saw Burke rush out at the side door—she went over to the corner of a court not far off, and was in the act of stooping, and putting something into her pocket—I missed her, and then saw Whatley coming out of the public-house, detaining Hill.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Burke handed a paper to the Court, stating that the prosecutor and Nicholls were so drunk that they offered the prisoners a penny each to help them up Holborn-hill, and that Nicholls stated before the Magistrate that it was Hill who ran out of the public-house.</hi>)</p>

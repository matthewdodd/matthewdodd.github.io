                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300043"></xptr>Q. Do you pay rent and taxes for it - A. No, unless in consideration of the salary I receive; I have an accompting-house in the workhouse, it has two windows looking into the yard, they are fastened by a spring-latch. I had about twenty shillings in penny-pieces and fifteen shillings in paper by the side of them, in the accompting-house, I missed twenty shillings of penny pieces, Malpas, one of the boys acknowledged the theft, and Heath finding that Malpas had acknowedged it, he came to me and said he would show me where the penny pieces were; he took me to a hole under the stone stair case, he said it was hid there, he could not exactly tell where, a boy of the name of Evans had hid them; Evans came and pulled a great many penny pieces out of a hole, apparently like a rat-hole, to the amount of sixteen or seventeen shillings. The prisoner said that he got up himself about one o'clock on the Sunday morning, and broke the accompting-house window, Malpas was with him, they got in and and took the penny-pieces away from a cupboard of mine in the accompting-house; he told me he had done so repeatedly. He is a pauper in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What could induce the boy to tell you this - A. Finding that Malpas had confessed it. I told Malpas if he would tell who it was he should not be hurt if he told me the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Malpas go and tell him - A. No; a gentleman took him of oneside while I examined Heath. These are the penny-pieces that Evans took out of the hole by the direction of Heath.</p>
               <p>MR. HAMBLIN. I am one of the overseers. I found thirty-penny pieces in the ward in which the prisoner slept.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I should not have taken them if I had victuals enough; I was obliged to buy victuals every day.</p>
               <p>Bowen. They have three quarters of a pound of broad every days and meat days five ounces of meat, and an ounce of cheese every day, and rice mills, and a full pound of rice pudding on Wednesdays.</p>

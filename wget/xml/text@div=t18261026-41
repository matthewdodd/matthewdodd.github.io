               <p>Q. Did he use any force? A. No; he ran against me, and gave a pull at my watch - he must have ran against me wilfully; I ran after him up the alley, calling Stop thief! he was taken in less than five minutes - I lost sight of him, but am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long was I in your sight? A. Not half a minute - I had been drinking a little - I was sober enough to go home, and to know him - I had drank part of two pots of beer between two of us, and we had a glass of gin each - I might be two hours sitting over the beer.</p>

I was in Edwards' company, and had been drinking with him - we were going home at about a quarter past ten o'clock; I was not drunk, nor was he - the prisoner came out of a court, and attempted to snatch at his watch; the gas-light, which was very near, shone upon his face - I saw him plainly; I saw him snatch at the watch; the chain broke, and he got the seals - he rather ran against Edwards, but did not do him violence - he ran up Bell-alley, and I after him - I lost sight of him for five or seven minutes - the watchman secured him; I am certain he is the man - I had not seen him above a minute before the robbery.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Bellalley - I heard a cry of Stop thief! went out of a court, saw the prisoner running down, and stopped him - he said, "Let me go, you bl-y fool, I have done nothing but broken a window;" I held him, and a young man came up and beat me about the head, and desired me to let him go - he got his hand into my neck, and held it so tight, I could not call out; he put his fingers within my handkerchief, but I kept hold of him; that man took my hat and ran away with it - I sprang my rattle; Edwards and Hemus came up - Edwards said to him, "Where is my seals, I want my seals" - Hemus said, he was the man who had robbed Edwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I the first man who ran up the alley? A. I cannot say; for I was in another alley - Edwards was certainly intoxicated, but knew what he was about; he was very much in liquor, but Hemus was not; it was the prisoner who said, he had broken a window.</p>

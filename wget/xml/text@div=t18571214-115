I saw her give her two sixpences—she put them between her teeth, and said, "These are bad, and you gave me two bad ones this day week"—I sent for the beadle, and I saw a piece of paper drop from the prisoner—a lad and I picked it up; it contained a bad sixpence—I went with the prisoner, and as she was going into the dock I heard something rattle; I stooped, and found a bad sixpence—I gave them to the constable.</p>

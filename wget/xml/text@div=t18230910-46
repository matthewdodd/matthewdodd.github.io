            . I have a house in the City, but live in Spa-fields. On the 23d of July, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I was going home. I had been drinking in the early part of the evening, but at the time in question I was not so much intoxicated - feeling myself giddy in the head, I stopped in the <placeName id="t18230910-46-crimeloc257">Pig-market</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18230910-46-crimeloc257" type="placeName" value="Pig-market"></interp>

I turned round, and saw the prisoner close to me - I had a view of his face and his person; he had white trowsers on; he began to ask me a variety of questions, in a hurried manner, and during that time I felt my gold seals and chain either snatched or cut from me - I felt them go; the chain was attached to a ribbon; I immediately charged him with the theft, and he ran away; I ran after him, calling</p>
               <p>"Stop thief," and secured him less than forty yards off, I suppose. I got hold of him, and at that moment the watchman came up, and finally secured him; I had not lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it a dark or a light night - A. It was neither day nor twilight, but there is a strong gas light in the centre of the market.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you identify the man? - A. He had white trowsers on, and the suddenness of the transaction led me to notice him; he could not have been above three or four yards from in yet any time.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call the early part of the evening when you were very much inebriated - A. About four or five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Were you not so drunk at twelve o'clock, that you did not know what you were about - A. Yes, I was; I understood the Jury to ask what time I left my residence; I had not been drinking at four or five o'clock; I admit that at twelve o'clock I was very drunk; I spent the evening at Mr. Smith's; near Moorfields; I have only been there three or four times, and don't know the sign of the house. I was there the whole of the time; I cannot say at what time I left; I paid for something next day which I had broken at Smith's. I will not undertake to swear that I recollect anything that passed there - the ribbon was attached to my watch, and the chain next the seals.</p>
               <p>Q. When your watch was down in your fob the ribbon could not be seen - A. Certainly it could, it was a very large ribbon. I have been told that a person at Smith's put my seals into my fob; I will not swear that I recollect leaving Smith's, or where I might have rambled before I went into the pig-market; I was finding my way home; I might have gone to the west end of the town to find the pig-market. I took the prisoner first; I never said that the watchman took him first; I was resting my stomach against the pens.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said that immediately on turning round you taxed him with robbing you - A. I have not; I did not strike him; I believe I attempted to do it after he was in custody of the watchman, not before - I never said that I turned round and struck him immediately, saying nothing about his running away. I did not come up to him in Long-lane; I am not aware that anybody was with me, or talking to me in Long-lane. I went before the Alderman next morning; the hearing was put off, because it was said I was much irritated, but I swear I was sober; I have said I was sorry this occurred, on account of the prisoner's family. I have said I was sorry for this proceeding, but I coupled it with that remark. I went to Guildhall, thinking the examination would be there. I remember apologising to a person, believing I had been rather rude to him, being irritated. I never said I was come to quash the business; I have been at Smith's house; I was not drunk both times; I never charged any man with robbing me who was assisting me home when drunk. I know that on one occasion I was very ill at Smith's house, but did not lay on the floor, for Mrs. Smith offered me a bed, and I went to lay down. I never laid on the floor drunk there, that I recollect; I have spent the evening there three times, and called in twice, but only had a glass of cider and beer.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Who is Mrs. Smith - A. I had been to her house; she is the landlady of the public-house. I was there one morning, and she said</p>
               <p>"I did not think you would have gone so far." I was with nobody till I arrived at the pig-market. I never expressed a doubt of the prisoner's robbing me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From the time you found his arm round your body till you stopped him did you see any person till the watchman came - A. There was no other person.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watchman came up, did you say to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"Where is your pall" - A. I believe I did at the watch-house, from the observation which the watchman made. The impression on my mind was, that in these cases there is always more than one person.</p>

            . I am a watchman my beat is in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100028"></xptr>Long-lane, and part of the pig-market; part of it comes into Smithfield - there are some rails there. On the 23d of July, I recollect seeing Mr. Gregory leaning on the rails - it was rather better than half-past one o'clock; there was a person on his right side, standing up, but what he was doing I cannot say. I was about ten yards off; it was not day-light - there was a gas-light in the centre of us; I could have distinguished them without that light, as there were other lights near. I heard the prisoner ask Mr. Gregory several times where he was going to, and which way he was going; I am certain of his person - the last question he asked was if he was going towards the bridge - I did not hear Gregory reply, but the prisoner jumped away from him, and Gregory went after him directly, calling Stop thief! Gregory stopped him himself. I never lost sight of either of them; he caught hold of him by one side, and I on the other. Gregory said he had robbed him of his seals and chain; he said he had not. Gregory accompanied us to the watch-house, at St. Sepulchre's-church - he told me not to collar him; I held his cuff, and he went on quietly. When we arrived at the watch-house Gregory laid the charge before the officer of the night; the prisoner said he had not robbed him; that he was a respectable man; he was searched, and his own watch, a penknife, and nineteen duplicates were found on him - I do not recollect whether the knife was in his waistcoat or trowsers pocket. I left Gregory at the watch-house, returned to the pig-market with my lanthorn, and went to the place about where the prisoner was stopped, which is between twenty and thirty yards from where they were at first - I could not see anything in the passing where the people pass, but went aside, and saw Godfrey pick up a gold seal in the enclosure, five or six yards from the path - it was thrown over the rails, nearly opposite the spot where he was taken, and two or three yards further on I found the chain, part of a ribbon, and the seal - I cannot say whether the key was with it; the ribbon appeared to have been cut rather slanting. I went to the watch-house - Godfrey would not deliver the chain and seals to Gregory till he described them, which he did satisfactorily, before he saw them. I believe he was a little in liquor; but he seemed more overcome with passion than liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time was it when you first saw them together - A. Better than half-past one o'clock; I had been in Long-lane that night from ten o'clock. I saw nothing of Gregory till I saw him leaning on the pens; the prisoner stood by his side, asking him questions, but I never heard Gregory answer; I did not see him shew fight, or any blows pass. The pens are gathered up together. The seal was found near a wall, by a house; the other was two or three yards further on, on the left hand side, not on the spot they walked. I have seen Mr. Gregory twice since at the Mansion House, and twice at Guildhall, and saw him one night when he was going home, when my box was at the Bull's Head, public-house, at the corner of Smithfield-bars.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have any conversation with him - A. I had no business to have conversation with him. He told me the people wanted him to make it up; his wife said it should not be made up; she was with him. This was a little after ten o'clock one night. I never heard him ask the prisoner where his pall was, to the best of my knowledge I swear I never told him that he did. I had a glass of gin that night, but he drank none - I did not think it odd for him to treat me. I never saw him drunk at the examination. I cannot say whether he was drunk or sober. 17 s. or 18 s. were found on the prisoner; every thing found on him was returned. He was dressed in white trowsers, and a surtout coat; the coat was unbuttoned at the watch-house, to get to his waistcoat pocket. I cannot say whether it was buttoned when he was stopped.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the ribbon you found fit the ribbon of the prosecutor's watch - A. It corresponded with it, and appeared fresh cut. He had a bundle of papers in his pocket.</p>

            . I am superintendant of the watch. Williams brought the prisoner to the watch-house between one and two o'clock; Gregory and the watchman came with him; Gregory charged him with having robbed him of a gold chain, two seals, and a key, and stated that he was coming through the pig-market, was taken very ill, and leaned over the rails for ease, and on a sudden discovered some person behind him; turned round and saw the prisoner, who had his hands round him, and he thought for improper purposes, but very shortly after he missed his seals, and on turning round, the prisoner ran away; that he immediately pursued him, calling Stop thief! that he caught him in the footpath, and at that instant the watchman came up and secured him; the watchman agreed to the statement, the prisoner denied the charge. Gregory was in liquor, and gave his account rather in a violent manner; he accounted for it by saying, he felt so indignant at the prisoner, supposing he wanted to use his hands to an improper purpose, that he was enraged. I went to the spot with Williams, and found rather a large gold-seal; Williams picked up a gold chain, seal, key, and piece of ribbon attached to it; there is an enclosure on one side of the footpath; these things were found about six yards from the footpath, both on one side, in such a situation as they would be if thrown there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Where were the seals found - A. On the left hand side of the pathway coming from Barbican, on a vacant spot of ground in the pig-market, and about six yards from the path; there is a gate at the further end, which is generally shut, except on market days, to keep people from the vacant space; if shut, a person must get over to get into it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prosecutor got to the watch-house, do you remember his trying to strike the prisoner - A. He was prevented; I remember his saying at the watch-house</p>
               <p>"Where is your pall?" I have since told him that he did say so; I think he acknowledged it, but will not swear it; the first examination was between twelve and one o'clock, and was put off on account of his demeanour. The prisoner had a variety of papers about him in different parts. I cannot say whether his coat was buttoned. I think the knife was in his waistcoat pocket, it was not open when it was found.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Among the things found was there a watch ribbon - A. A ribbon was attached to the chain, it appeared to be cut as clean as possible; the prosecutor's watch had part of a ribbon attached to it, and it exactly corresponded with that part of it.</p>

            . I was officer of the night. Williams<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100029"></xptr>brought the prisoner in about a quarter to two o'clock; Gregory charged him with taking his chain and seals; Gregory seemed rather violent and a little in liquor I think; but he gave his statement exactly as at the Mansion-house. I found a watch, chain, seals, seventeen shillings, nineteen duplicates, and a small penknife on him; he denied the charge, and gave no particular account of himself; Godfrey and Williams went out, Gregory remained with me till they returned, and brought what I now produce in the state it was brought in except that; the large seal was off separate, I have a piece of ribbon which I took off the watch in Gregory's possession; he described the seals and chain exactly before he saw them; I took the prisoner to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Will you put the ribbon together, and say where they correspond - A. It has been rubbed about at the different examinations, the ends have been tezaed out, and do not correspond now, but they did; they appeared to me to have been cut; his coat was buttoned to the bottom when he came to the watch-house; I could not get at his waistcoat pocket without unbuttoning it - he had papers in his breast pocket, and in different parts. I will not say whether there were any in the same pocket as the knife. I believe Gregory said to him,</p>
               <p>"I suppose you have a pall, where is your pall." I believe I told him at the second examination that he had said so - he said he did not see any pall, and did not know of any, that he might have used the expression, but did not think that he did; he talked very sensible, but seemed a little intoxicated, and in a great passion at the watch-house - he was the worse for liquor next morning at the examination, which was about twelve o'clock, the Alderman adjourned it because he was irritated in mind. The ribbon appeared to be cut clean, not torn.</p>

            . They are my property, and were in my possession the night in question - I know it was safe before I was attacked; the watch was protected only by the ribbon.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long might this person be near you in the pig-market - A. I cannot say, I went to Smith's next morning, before I went to Guildhall, and drank some porter, nothing else. I do not think I drank a quart; I drank nothing else prior to going before the Alderman to the best of my belief - I have no recollection of taking spirits, a man named Keeve was with me; that the street-keeper was there, and drank with me. I did not have a glass of brandy, and another of gin at Smith's.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in a long defence stated the case, he had witnesses to prove, that he left Golden-lane at half past one o'clock, and overtook the prosecutor and another at the end of Barbican; they asked where he was going, he said over Blackfriars-bridge, and he said he would walk with him; but on arriving at the sheep-pens, the prosecutor proposed going to the Bear public-house to drink, after which he stopped to lean against the pens in the pig-market, and on the prisoner enquiring if he was going on, he placed his hands to his small-clothes, and said,</p>
               <p>"You have robbed me of my watch;" that the prisoner called him a scoundrel, and he might have struck him; the prosecutor called the watchman, and gave him in charge. The prisoner then stated the evidence he should produce, as appears from the following witnesses.</p>

            . I am an oilman, and live in Golden-lane. On the 22d of July, at seven o'clock, I came home and found the prisoner at my house; he came to settle some accounts for me, and when he had done that, he had some business of his own which he wished to do up stairs at my house, as after that he should be able to spend the evening with me - he came down between eight and nine o'clock; we supped and had some grog; he left my house at half-past one o'clock, he lives near the Coburg Theatre; he had a frock coat on, and some papers in his waistcoat pocket, supported by the flap of his coat; it was a single-breasted coat, and being buttoned tight, was the only way he could secure the papers; he said at my house he had lost some papers before, and took pains to button his coat, so as not to lose these - he buttoned it down to the bottom, nearly to cover his waistcoat pocket. I saw him mend his pen that night with a knife, which I believe he took from his waistcoat pocket; I do not know where he put it; it is five or six minutes walk from my house to Smithfield. Smith's house is the Golden Key, in Tenter-street, about ten minutes walk from the pig-market.</p>

            . My husband keeps the Golden Key, public-house, Tenter-street. Gregory was at my house the night he was robbed, and left about half-past eleven o'clock, the house was closed at eleven, but it might be twelve before I got him out; it was not above ten minutes past twelve I am positive; he was very much intoxicated, I do not think he knew what he was about exactly, he had been there three or four hours drinking. He was at my house three months before; he was drunk when he came in and went into the skittle ground; three bowls of punch were taken there, and when he came out he was very much intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at any time lay on the ground at your house - A. Yes, that was three months ago. He was then so insensible, that I got two men to go and order a coach for him, and when they came in he had fallen down by the side of the door - he jumped up and accused them of robbing him. They had only lifted him gently up. He asked whether they wanted to rob or murder him. I could not get him out of doors for two hours. On the night of the robbery, before he went away, Mr. Smith told him his seals were in a very dangerous state, as he was not capable of taking care of them, and they were fastened into his waistband; but he was so intoxicated that before he went he took them out again, and went out with them in their usual state, the chain and ribbon were visible. For three months before, when he was in the skittle-ground, he lost the ring which fastened the watch to the chain, and I fastened it to the chain; the chain was shorter as the ring was gone. On the night in question no part of the ribbon could be seen, when his watch was in his fob. He broke a pane of glass which he has since paid for, he did not recollect breaking of it; and, moreover, he said he was a complete madman when drunk. He called next morning and apologized for his conduct, and paid for what he broke, and drank some ale and a glass of brandy; he drank some porter with some gentlemen who were playing there, and vomited in the parlour. Keeve was there at the time. He left our house at twelve o'clock that morning, and was by no means sober; he said he met a man in the pig-market, and felt his arms round his waist, and he felt so indignant that he turned round immediately, seized and held<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100030"></xptr>him tight; I said</p>
               <p>"Was it possible you could hold a man in that state." After he came from the wall, he said the man ran two or three steps - he has said many times that he was sorry for what he had done, and the proceedings might be quashed, and he should not have proceeded if it had not been for the officers. I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Gregory, I am sorry you should have proceeded so far - you have not lost your property, and consider the man's family" - he said, if he had the least shadow of a doubt he should not have proceeded, but the officers had urged him on. I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he not say he was sorry for the proceedings on account of the man's family - A. He did.</p>

            . I travel round town for a silk shawl warehouse, in Maiden-lane. On the morning after this circumstance I called at Smith's, between ten and eleven o'clock, Gregory was there playing at bagatelle with the street-keeper. They and another person drank a pot of porter or half-and-half. I played one game with him myself for a glass of gin - all four had a glass each. Gregory was taken ill, and had a glass of brandy before - he certainly was in liquor; he said he had been robbed in the sheep-pens; that the person came to him and put his arms round his waist while he was sick; that the man ran a distance from him, but he overtook him - I had nothing particular to do, and accompanied him to Guildhall - nobody asked me - the Alderman requested him to come next day, that he might be more on his guard, and not quite so irritated. I told him if he would be advised by me, he would drop the subject - but I knew the officers had urged him on, and he has told me he would not have gone further if they had not urged him. I have seen the prisoner before, but never spoke to him.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, and live in Tenter-street. I saw Gregory at Guildhall on Thursday morning. The officer asked if he was inclined to proceed in the same kind of way as he had the day before. He shrugged up his shoulders, and said he should not - that he was so drunk the day before, he hardly knew what he was about, and must make the best of it - that he did not intend to proceed farther, and must put an end to it - that is the substance of what he said.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. We wish you to give us the exact words - A. That is the substance - he said he must make an apology for the behaviour the day before. The officer told him to go to the Mansion House.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Cannot you tell us the name of the officer - A. No. I lodge with Smith. I am not in any business now - I merely mentioned being a linen-draper, as I was servant to Messrs. Kinder, of Cheapside, eighteen months ago, since which I have been arranging accounts.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to go to Guildhall - A. I heard the circumstance stated by Keeve, and from the description given of the violence of the prosecutor, and the respectability of the prisoner, I went from curiousity. The prisoner was a perfect stranger to me. Keeve mentioned about his respectability. It was talked of commonly in the house. I was a linen-draper on my own account for three years - that is five or six years ago.</p>

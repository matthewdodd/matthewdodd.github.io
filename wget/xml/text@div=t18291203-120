I do not live at my father's, but called on Sunday - he was not at home; I was going home to dinner, and before I could get to the street door there was a knock - my little brother let my aunt in; I shook hands with her - she walked into the next room, and I walked out; I knew nothing of what was alledged against me till I was taken.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH JONES. I live in Wellington-street, and have known the prisoner nine years. On the Sunday Nutt was robbed, I was going to the baker's for my dinner, and met her - she stopped me, and said she had lost her pocket-book, with ten sovereigns out of her bag; I asked where she lost it - she said she did not know, for she had been at an eating-house, an old clothes-shop, and to Frank Full's house, and did not know where she lost it; she showed me her bag, which had a great slit in it -I said perhaps she had lost it out of there; she said she could not say - this was a few minutes after one o'clock; I asked if she was sure she had it - she said she had it that day three weeks, when she went to a charity sermon, and she did not know what she should do, for she dare not go back to the work-house without it: I am a married woman; it was a black stuff bag - she seemed sober; she is in the habit of drinking.</p>

               <p>MARY NUTT. All she has said is perfectly right, except about the half-crowns; I did go with the intention of relieving her - I had seen the money three months before, and also three weeks; the window was not open - the door was shut when I went out of the room, but open when I returned.</p>

On the 28th of July, about twelve o'clock, I missed six half-crowns, which I had seen safe in a bag three days before - I sent for an officer, and we at last found them between the mattress and the sacking of a bed, in which a lodger used to sleep - the prisoner was making it at that time; they were tied up in a bit of rag; as we went to the office, she said if I would forgive her she would tell the truth; I said I could not.</p>

            . I am the officer. I took the prisoner; on the way to Bow-street I heard her say to her master, if he would forgive her, she would tell the whole truth; she afterwards said at the office that she had taken them, and if he would forgive her, she would tell the whole truth - as we were going along she said if I would intercede with Mr. Platt she knew he would forgive her.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PLATT. All the half-crowns were found, but I had lost some more money in shillings - they were all dated 1825 - the drawer was locked, and I kept the key always in my possession.</p>

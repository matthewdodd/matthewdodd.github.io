On Saturday morning, the 15th of January, between one and two o'clock, I was aroused from my sleep by the bell ringing violently; I got up, went down stairs, and found three watchmen at the door - they gave me information - I went to the watch-house, and there found the constable of the night and watchmen; they shewed me the property stated in the indictment, which is mine - the prisoners were in custody, (examining the property,) it is all mine, and was kept on a side-board in my dining-room, and was in common use, I saw it all the evening before. Here are two 1 l. notes, which were in my iron chest in the front office; Ferguson had been in the habit of going to that chest, and knew where the key was: here is a ring, which was in my own desk, which I found locked, but missed the ring - his own desk was broken open. I saw the notes in the chest the night preceding; I had not fastened the door the night before myself - I had let the back office, where they got in, to Mr. Brocklebank, he had no occasion for it, and they informed me they had locked it up; I do not know what state it was in the night before, I know it was locked up because I have access to it from a door in the passage, and had seen it the day before (the 14th,) it was then fastened; I know of nobody going in after me - the robbery was on Saturday morning, the 15th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Have you any partner? A. My son has been in partnership with me many years, he is insane, and therefore I cannot dissolve the partnership - I rent the house alone - the business is carried on in the front office; most of the property was in my dining-room: my son is in the house, attended by a nurse. The rent and taxes were never paid out of the partnership concern. I let the back office last June; Mr. Brocklebank has returned the key to me since the robbery - he is in occupation now, but does not use the office. I do not think that there was any agreement with him in the name of myself and son; the lease of the house is in my name; I only charge the partnership with a certain sum as rent of the office. I have known Ferguson ten years, he was in my service up to that very night, and bore an excellent character among most respectable individuals. He had a key of his own desk, it was broken open, and mine locked. The door leading from Mr. Brocklebank's office to the passage is merely fastened with a drop latch, and can be opened at any time. My daughter had fastened up the premises, she is not here: I heard the bar of the front door put up that night.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Mr. Gilson's house is in the parish of St. Dunstan in the East. On the 14th of January I came on my beat at nine o'clock and stopped till eleven, when a man relieved me; I went to the watch-house, and relieved him about one, and in consequence of what he told me, I looked at Mr. Gilson's house, and saw a light through the fan-light over the door - I had never seen that before. I went up to the door, and the light instantly disappeared. I crossed over the road, and stood against a door directly opposite, and the light appeared again. M'Carty, another watchman, joined me, he called one o'clock, and the light again disappeared. He went round his beat, I stood at my post, and when he came back I saw the light again - he came towards me, and the light disappeared. I went to the corner post, keeping my eye on the fan-light, and the street door opened; the prisoner Jones looked out first, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170012"></xptr>am certain he is the man; he put his head in, and in a minute or two Ferguson looked out over his shoulder; I placed M'Carty there while I fetched Caffyn, placed them both there, pulled the street door bell, and the door immediately came open. Ferguson came out first, with his two fists doubled, striking before him; he struck Caffyn, who fell against the other watchman: Jones came out after him, I followed and came up to him, with the other watchman, and caught hold of him. He said, "Don't ill use me, nor pull me about, I will go quietly, for this will be a finish." I took him to the watch-house, and saw one parcel of the plate produced found on him by Davis, the constable of the night: he was put into the strong room, and soon after Ferguson was brought in by Brown, a watchman: he told Davis that as he knew him, he would not deceive him, but give him up the articles. He put his hand into his pocket, and took out a crow bar, laid it on the table, and then some skeleton keys, and a phosphorus box - the remainder of the silver plate and the mourning ring. I am sure Jones is the man who came out of the house, I never lost sight of him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Saturday morning, the 15th of January, I was on the next beat to Kayle: he called, and desired me to look after Mr. Gilson's door - he rang the bell - I was going up to the door when Ferguson ran out and knocked Caffyn down. I nearly fell over in attempting to catch Ferguson, but missed him. I had seen him put his head out before, and then shut the door; there was light enough for me to know him; I missed my hold and sprang my rattle, and called Stop thief! followed him down Mark-lane into Seething-lane; Brown stopped him, but not in my sight - I came up and took him from Brown.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was by Mr. Gilson's house; Ferguson came out with his fists doubled, as if to resist any one who opposed him. I do not know that he struck me purposely, but by his forcing his way to escape he knocked me down: I struck at him, but missed him. I followed him down Mark-lane, saw somebody turn into Seething-lane, and heard Brown sing out "I have got him;" and when I came up found him in Brown's charge.

            . I was constable of the night. On the 15th of January, between one and two o'clock. Kayle brought Jones to the watch-house; I searched him, and found a parcel of silver plate on him, and a handle, which was broken off a ladle, which ladle was found on Ferguson, who was brought in in a few minutes, which I was surprised at, having known him so long. I told him I was sorry to see him, but I must search him. He said, "Mr. Davis, you must do your duty; I will give every thing up to you." He pulled these articles out. I searched him afterwards, and found a ring on him. I sent for Mr. Gilson, who claimed them: I went to Mr. Gilson's, and applied this key to the counting-house door, and found it opened it outside and inside. Ferguson's desk was broken open: I applied a skeleton key to Mr. Gilson's desk, and it opened it; and another key opened the side desks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Some plate was produced from the pockets of both prisoners? A. Yes - I locked it up immediately; it has been in my possession ever since; I have had the key of the drawer. I took it to the Mansion House; it was in my custody all the time: it was in the hands of Mr. Cope, the City marshal, for seven or eight minutes - it was in his own office; I gave it into his care. I examined it to see if it was correct; I made no mark on it. The ring has Mr. Gilson's name on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furrier. On Thursday evening, 21st Feb., in consequence of something, I went to a public-house in King-street, Regent-street, and saw a coat there lined with fur, which was to be raffled for—I knew it well, and knew it to be the property of my employer, Mr. Morris Harris—I had not seen it in his possession for about three weeks—I made inquiry, and in consequence went to the prisoner's house—I did not find him, but afterwards saw him at a public-house—I asked him about the coat, and he said he had told the officer all about it—I went with him and the officer to a place to look for a person, but could not find him—this is the coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I swear to it, every skin is marked—it is worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Addington-street, York-road, Lambeth. On the Thursday or Friday in the week before I was before the Magistrate, this coat was brought to my employer's by a man named Croft, who offered it for sale—it was left all night, and returned to him next morning—shortly after that I went to Croft's house, and there saw Croft and the prisoner—Croft introduced the prisoner as the owner of the coat, and the prisoner wanted me to purchase it—he said he had taken it in exchange for a watch—he asked 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; I refused to buy it, and left it—Croft came after me, and offered it me for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I bought it for that, and the prisoner gave me a receipt for the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not find it of any use, and wanting to dispose of it by raffle, I sent it to a public-house in King-street, Regent-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you tell the prisoner you should send it to King-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not mention that street; I said it would go to the West End to be raffled for—I should not think it is worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I put it up at 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did say I should send it to a house in the neighbourhood of Recent-street—there was no concealment about it—I have known the prisoner five years—I think he deals in watches—I know he winds up clocks for people in the neighbourhood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and know the prisoner. He brought this coat to me, and said if I could dispose of it among my customers, I should have a few shillings for myself—I showed it to several customers—it was at last sold to Watts for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Byworth sold it, but I negociated the sale for him—Watts said it was going to be publicly raffled for—the prisoner said he bought it of a salesman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 151). On Saturday night, the 23rd Feb., I went to a public-house in Mason-street, Lambeth, and saw the prisoner there—I asked him how he came possessed of the coat—he said he bought it of a Jew, and gave a watch and chain worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I asked where the Jew lived—he said he did not know, without going home, but his name was Ben<lb></lb>jamin—we went to his house in the Westminster-road, and he brought this paper out, and gave it me—"L. Benjamin, 3, Fishmongers'-alley, Borough"—he said he asked him for his address at the time he made the exchange—we then went to the public-house in King-street, and the coat was shown me there, and I saw Crispe—I and Crispe then went to Fishmongers'-alley, and saw a man named Solomons, who I have known some time, and believe to be a respectable man; he said he did not know a man named Benjamin, in the alley—I went to several other places, but did not succeed in finding any one of that name—we then went to Tower-street station, and Crispe preferred the charge—I searched the prisoner, and found on him a watch, four sovereigns, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a knife.</p>

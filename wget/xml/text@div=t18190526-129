            . I am a dealer in harness, and live in Crawford-street. On the 13th of May I was informed a man had some harness to sell, and went to the prisoner at the Castle, public-house, in Chapel-street, and told him that I had been informed that he had got some bridles and saddles to sell; he said,</p>
               <p>"I have; I don't think they are altogether right - they are crossed," which I understood to mean stolen; he said he had let a man have 1 l. on them - I said I would buy them. He took me to a cottage in Bell-street, near the Edgware-road - the saddle laid on the floor. He went towards the window, lifted up a board in the floor, and pulled out two new rugs, two bridles and a martingale; he put the rugs back again and put the board over. I said they were not good enough for me, and if he had any better another time I would buy them. We came away and left the things there without replacing them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who let you into the cottage - A. He let himself in with a key, and locked the door again when he went away. We parted, and I gave information to Shackle; on the Sunday morning I went with him and the constable. I left them in the street, went to the cottage, and asked for Shippen; they said he was in bed, but they would call him. The prisoner looked out of the window, and said,</p>
               <p>"I will be down directly." I said I had a customer for the things - he said he had not got them, but they were at a house just by in a bag - we went to a house a few yards off, and he brought the bag out. We went to the Castle, public-house, and sat down in the harbour; he was in the act of pulling them out, when Wales came in and asked him whose property it was? he said it was his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. A man named Hazlewood sent you to the prisoner - A. Yes. The board was sawed out of the floor. The place was not like a scuttle.</p>

             I am an officer. I went in search of the prisoner with Spendlove; he fetched him out and took him to the Castle, public-house. I followed them, and asked the prisoner what he had got there? he said they were that man's, pointing to Spendlove - Spendlove said he was about buying them of the prisoner. The prisoner then said they were his, and he had let a man have 1 l. on them, and he had not seen him since. The bag contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

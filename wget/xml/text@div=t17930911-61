               <p>Q. Have you seen the bank note since? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was you in Whitechapel? - After five o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part about you was the note? - In my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the money in the same pocket? - I had the money in my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know exactly the time you lost it? - A little after five.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean you missed it then? - I had no more of it in my hand after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discover that you missed it as soon as it was gone? - Whitechapel was all in an uproar, and I looked every where for it in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that uproar made on the discovery that the note was gone? - I bought myself a halfpennyworth of currants in Whitechapel, and then I missed the note, and I took some people up, and took them up before the justice, and these people were discharged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp Did you know the prisoner at the bar before this transaction? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him during any time that this business took place? - No, I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the bank note was in the breeches pocket? - Yes, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the five pounds in cash and the bank note were not in the same pocket? - The five pounds and bank note were in my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. You said before that the money was in your coat pocket? - The copper laid in the coat pocket, but the five pounds in cash was in my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did not you charge the person of whom you bought these currants with taking this bank note? - I see a paper lay on the ground, and I thought that was the paper where the bank note did lay in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bank note in a paper? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the justice that you saw one of these men draw the paper with his feet? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar was not one of these three? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110102"></xptr>Q. Did not the justice tell the prisoner at the bar, in your presence, that if he could get bails he would bail him for the offence? - I don't understand english, and I don't know what he spoke.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how the bank note got out of your pocket you don't know? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. But you see one of these three men kick it with his foot? - I saw a paper laying on the ground, and I saw some man kicking that paper with his foot, I went from there, and remembering that my bank note was in a paper, I went back and took the men up.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the paper of the same size, colour and sort of paper as you had in your pocket? - I cannot know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it to be the same paper? - It was not in my thoughts; I did not mind it; if I had been sure I would have picked it up directly.</p>
               <p>Q. If you did not believe it to be the same paper, why did you stop the man that kicked the paper? - At first I did not miss it at all, and so I did not take any notice of the paper that lay on the ground then, when I went from there and missed the note, and thought of the man that moved the paper, I went back and took the man up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the paper there when you came back? - It was not, I saw the paper kicked on the ground before I came back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you ever take up this paper to see whether it contained the bank note or not? - I never took nothing up.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore whether it contained a bank note or no you don't know. He charged these three men with taking the bank note and had them before the justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Were not these men, one of which kicked the paper, immediately taken before the magistrate? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they searched? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any bank note found on them? - No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the man who kicked the paper searched? - He was.</p>

               <p>I know the prosecutor, Cohen, I see him on Friday about a month ago, the 16th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. On what account did Cohen come here? - He came twice that day, he came both times that day about a manuscript copy of our law, which I purchased of him, written with his own hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you give him? - I paid him twenty-four pounds I paid him a twenty pound bank note, and the rest in gold and silver to make up the money, I think it was three pounds, thirteen shillings and six-pence in gold, and the rest in silver to make up the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number of the twenty pound bank note you gave? - 839.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know the number of that note? - I had just received that note and another note of the banker's for a draft; I did not book that note, but, I have a great recollection; I am author of the Lingua Sacra; I will tell you the truth, when the man came back and told me that he had lost the note I was as positive as a man can be of a note that he had not booked; I have no doubt but that is the note. I paid Mr. Cohen the note a few minutes after five, by no means did it exceed ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the date of the note? - The date is the 11th of July, 1792.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner at the bar? - On Saturday evening about nine o'clock, the prosecutor called on me, and said that he thought he had found the note, and I went to the prisoner's house in Shoemaker-row; I then, as soon I saw the prisoner told him, I am come about a little business, about a bank note which you had yesterday, which you said you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110103"></xptr>found; he immediately flew at me as a lion in a rage; says he, I found no bank note, I know nothing about a bank note; sir, says I, I don't come here to be abused, I came here to ask a civil question. Pray, sir, says I, was not you yesterday at Mr. Goldsmid's with a bank note? Yes, says he, I was, but it was none of your's; pray, sir, whose was it then? a man gave it me; says he; but did not you tell Mr. Goldsmid that you found it? I did say so, says he, but it was no such thing; I told him I was very sorry to see that he was a very bad man, as he had said that he had found it, and now pretend to deny it; now, says I, how came you by that note? says he, a man gave it me to get cash for him; very good sir, says I, who is the man? says he, I don't know the man; why, says I, that appears very impossible that a man should give you a twenty pounds bank note to get cash for it, and you not know him, nor he you; then he began to be very abusive, and told me to get out, I told him I would get out as fast as I could, but I would take care to bring him to justice for it; in consequence of which I took coach to go home, and called on justice Wickham, and told him the case; he granted me a warrant, and in consequence of the warrant the prisoner was taken the next day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you go with the warrant to the prisoner's house? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was found at home? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. On what occasion did he call on you? - He called on me with a bank note, and I took particular notice of the number, it was about four weeks ago, and produced a bank note, and said that he had found a bank note, and wished to know whether it was a real bank note or a forged one.</p>
               <p>Jury. What time? - On Friday about six in the afternoon; I took particular notice of the number on it, 839, the date I cannot swear to; I told him there was but one thing I could advise him to do, and that was to take it along with me to the Bank, and shew it to Mr. Newland, and get the greatest reward he could for it; I told him I would have nothing to do with it in any other way; his reply was, that he could not give an answer to that, he would consult his sons; and I heard no more of the business from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in point of fact he did not come to you on Monday as you advised him? - I did not see any more of him till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understand that the prisoner at the bar possessed of a twenty pound bank note, came to you, as a person that knew the value of it, and to know whether it was a good one or not, and he shewed you the bank note? - He did, and I advised him to take it to Mr. Newland, and get as great a reward for it as he could.</p>

               <p>Q. You have known the prisoner at the bar before this time? - I have known him several years as a poor man coming for charity, but as for his general character I don't know it, I never knew any harm or good.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the prisoner? - He is a jew.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how old he is? - I do not.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Clapham. On the morning of 14th May saw the prisoner, with two others, looking at every shop they came by, as if they were going to take something—I and some others watched them for three or four hours—they then went to the shop of Mrs. Holford, at Clapham Rise—the prisoner went in—he lifted the window, and took something out when he came out he walked towards me—I could not see what he brought out, but he had something under his coat—when he saw me he ran back at fast as he could run—I ran after him, and chased him about a mile—I saw him take something from under his coat, and throw it amongst some bricks—I cried out, and said, "That man has stolen something"—some person stopped him—I went back to the place where he had thrown something, and found this black sutin waistcoat—I gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow; I keep a hatter's and tailor's shop; I have a foreman, who lives in my house, but he does not dine with me. Last Wednesday I dined about 2 o'clock, in the back part of the house—my foreman was up-stairs at his dinner—there was no one left in my shop—on going from our dinner to the shop, I observed that the waistcoat, which I had placed in the window, was gone, and the door was left open—this is the waistcoat—I had placed it in the window about an hour before—my daughter was the last in the shop.</p>

               <p>THOMAS CHANDLER. I live in Lower Barnard-street. On the 3d of November I was at work at Mr. Dodson's foundery, <placeName id="t18251208-144-crimeloc746">Lower Shadwell</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. Was there not a man named Brooks in your master's service, and was not he a doubtful character? A. Yes - he was seen in my shop at an unseasonable time, and was discharged. I cannot swear to these; the prisoner had been two or three months in my master's service.</p>

            . I live at No. 34, High-street, Shadwell. In consequence of some information from the last witness I detained the prisoner, when he came on the 5th of November, to offer the planes to pawn - he said they were given to him by his brother; he was quite a stranger to me. I detained him, and sent for an officer.</p>

               <p>Chester. You had your hat on when you came into the waggon.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Job Haywood. I live in New Belton-street, Long-acre, I am a sawyer, have known the prisoner ten years, he worked with me three years ago, he was honest, I lost nothing durin g the time.</p>
               <p>Court. He must not only take it but carry it away to constitute the felony, it remained in the waggon, if a man breaks into a house and takes a parcel of goods, wearing apparel or other things, out of a repository or chest, and removes it any distance whatever, in order to carry it away, but before he has actually carried it away, he is detected, and the goods removed out of their original situation, that has been held sufficient in law to constitute a capital offence. The other day a case came before the judges reserved by Mr. Justice Nares, which was this; some where in the Acton road, a person got into a waggon with intent to steal a parcel of goods, which lay as a pocket of hops would, at its length, he had removed it and put it end ways, but not out of the original situation that it stood in the waggon; and he had with some knife or other instrument cut that package, and was proceeding to take out the goods it contained; previous to the time of taking out the goods he was detected, he was tried, and that case reserved for the opinion of the judges, and they were all of opinion it did not constitute a felony. If you find this prisoner guilty of the fact I shall respite the sentence, and state the case to the judges, and the opinion they give upon it will be given to the justices next in rotation.</p>

In consequence of what these persons told me, I went to my house; I found the bed in the room that I had locked up on Saturday; the door had been broken open, and the bed was all over dirt; I locked the door myself, and saw the bed in it on the Saturday.</p>

I could not get out at Mrs. Hall's house; I went up Mr. Taylor's house, and over the lids. I saw the bed lying in the gutter, over the ridge of the house; I put it in the window, and brought it down one pair of stairs, and left it in the spot where it was found.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and I live next door to Mr. Taylor's house. About half past twelve, on Sunday the 22d of October, I heard a noise, I looked up, I saw the prisoner upon the house, as I was washing myself on the landing place of the garret; I saw the prisoner opening the garret window of Mr. Taylor's house, he was opening it on the outside, in the gutter. On my seeing him, I was going to rap at him; I recollected what Mr. Taylor said the Friday before, and hearing that Mr. Taylor lost so many things, I did not do it. I pulled off my shoes; I put one leg on the bannister of the stairs, and the other in the chair, and looked through my sky-light; I saw him open the window and get in; he had something in his hand, but what he cannot say. When I saw him get in the window, I ran down stairs and asked a woman in the same house, if her husband was at home; she said not. I said, Mr. Taylor's house is being robbed; she unlocked her garret door, it looks into this gutter. I watched for his coming out as much as ten minutes; then a man of the name of Franks came in. He said, Mr. Hall put your shirt on, you will catch cold; I went to finish washing myself; he holloed out, Mr. Hall, he has a bed on his arm. I directly ran to the window; Franks got out of the window after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see at any place where he was, whether he had any bed with him - A. I could not see; I saw a bed there afterwards lay in the gutter, close by Taylor's window, opposite of my own sky-light. I tried to get out of my door, and my wife cried out, he has got in his brother-in-law's window; the next house in Warwick Square. His brother-in-laws name is Crosley.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a person get from Crosley's garret window, to Mr. Taylor's garret window - A. Yes, they communicate to each other by the gutter.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010033"></xptr>Q. Did you know the prisoners person before that day - A. Never before that day, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he was the man that you saw in the gutter, and that went into Mr. Taylor's house - A. I am certain that is the man I saw get into Mr. Taylor's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think he was within your observation - A. About two or three minutes in getting in, and then he looked about him before he went into Mr. Taylor's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a view of him two or three minutes - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he looked about to see if he was observed - A. Yes, and he looked down into Mr. Taylor's room. When we took him he was undressed, we found him under a dresser in the kitchen below.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he is coat and waistcoat off - A. Quite undressed. It was about two o'clock when we found him; I gave the alarm; they refused opening the door at Crosley's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you break the door open - A. No, they opened the door after some time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the dresser conceal him from you - A. Yes, there is a door that opens underneath; he was concealed entirely under the dresser. His brother-in-law denied him very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his brother-in-law deny him being there in the room where he was - A. Yes; he denied it all through.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when you laid hold of him - A. I stopped till he was dressed. I said, my friend you have not got the same clothes on now, as you had before; then he bursted out a crying. I asked him whether he saw me through the the sky-light - he made no answer.</p>
               <p>MR. GLEED. What window is that the prisoner in it - A. That is a casement window; he was trying to open the window for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. This house was under repair - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on Sunday. You do not know of your own knowledge about the fastening of the window - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you saw him trying to open the window some time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the window was sufficiently closed, to exclude any person from getting in - A. Yes, the window was shut to.</p>

            . Q. Do you live in the house with Mr. Hall - A. Yes I do, it is next door to Mr. Taylor's. On Sunday the 22d of October, I came home about twenty minutes to one; when I came up stairs, my brother's wife informed me there were thieves in Mr. Taylor's house; I got out of the garret window.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Mr. Taylor's garret window open at that time - A. Yes, I watched out of the window in the same room where Mr. Hall was. I saw a man coming out with a bed; he got the bed entirely out of window; I got of the window as well as I could.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he hold of the bed at the time that you first got sight of him - A. Yes he had, he was pulling it out of the window, there was no other person with him, he was alone. I got out of the window after him; in the time I was getting out, he ran towards me - I was getting out as fast as I could - he run over the houses - I lost sight of him - he left his shoe behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you lose sight of him - A. Only just as he turned round the chimney and jumped into a window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him get into the window - A. No I came back again; I lost sight of him; I heard Mr. Hall sing out that the thief had got in at the window; then I turned back.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure, that the prisoner is the man that you saw come out of Mr. Taylor's window - A. I am quite certain.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to that window where Mr. Hall told you he get in - A. No, I went down below.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose window was that which Mr. Hall said he went in - A. That is his brother-in-laws, Mr. Crosley's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Crosley's house immediately - A. I did, he refused opening the door; I told him what I wanted; they said they were sure he did not come in there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you got admission to go into Crosby's house - A. I told him I wished to go in then, he did let me in, and I went up to look for the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner there - A. No I returned, and when he was found, I was fetched to know whether I knew the prisoner, I was sure at that time, that he was the man, he was the very man, I said so - then he was putting on clean linen; when I saw him he was shifting himself, he was secured, and the bed was carried into Mr. Taylor's house.</p>

               <p>Q. This bed you say was not kept in the garret. - A. No, in the second floor.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of your bed. - A. Three pound, it is an old bed, I have had it about a year and half, I bought it second hand.</p>

Yes; It was an external repair, all the goods were in the house, the master carpenter had one key and I the other, and I have returned there again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mary Moore, and live in Clerkenwell; we are gold and silver chain-workers; the prisoner was in our service a little better than four months. On the evening of the 17th of March I wound up some silver wire, and put it on a board where the prisoner and several other hands worked—I saw the prisoner cut a few links off the wire, and he put the rest into his skin, which is used to catch the waste in—some of the girls then asked for some links, and as the prisoner did not bring the wire out I wound up some more, and gave it them—I then sent the prisoner out on an errand; I looked into his skin, and there were the links of wire—when he came back he sat down to his work till ten minutes before eight o'clock—he was then going away—I went to his skin, and the wire was gone—I ran up stairs, and caught him at the street-door—I said, "You have something belonging to me"—I caught hold of his collar—he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out this wire, and dropped it—I called Mrs. Moore, got a light, and found it—this is the wire he dropped on the floor—it is worth about half-a-crown.</p>

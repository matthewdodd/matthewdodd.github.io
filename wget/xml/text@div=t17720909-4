            . I saw the prisoner on Friday the 17th of July standing under an arch way, in Bell Yard, Broad St. Giles's, by himself, with a bundle in his hand; I lifted my clothes as I passed him for fear I should touch him and give him any offence; he said, how do you do? I said. I believe you don't know me; he said you are well dressed; he asked me my name and where I lived; he said his name was Conway, and that he lived in Cheapside; as I stood with him, he asked me if my buckles were silver, I said yes, and Irish made; I asked him where he knew me; he said in Dublin; I said I was a Cork woman, and had never been in Dublin in my life; he said he had 200 l. worth of goods, and if I would sell goods for him, I should get five shillings a day; I said that my husband was acquainted with several master tradesmen that would give us a character to be honest people; I waited, and he went into a public house; I said I had an acquaintance in Ship Yard that would befriend him, to recommend him to sell some goods; he said he knew no place but the Haymarket and Cheapside; he waited in an alehouse till I came back; he called for a pen and ink, and took a direction to find the Mitre Tavern in Fleet Street. I went into a public house with him and had a pint of beer; I told him I had not broke my fast. and it was past six o'clock. I had been a little troubled and had eat nothing that day. Offering to pay for the pint of beer, he said, d - n it, how generous my country people are! I went to a taylor's house in Broad St. Giles's, to see a young woman that was newly married; I came back again to the same alehouse; he had a pint of beer there and paid for it. I had not the key to let him up into my own lodgings. He said he had left six pieces of handkerchiefs with a good natured countrywoman, at a public house, in a street he said he did not know the name of. I found afterwards it was in Coventry Street. He said he must go out of town, and he said if I would go with him, he would give them to me; I went with him; he called for a quartern of mint and carraway; I told him I could not bear liquor; he said it was a cordial and I drank; after that he called for another; when we were going away, he went to the bar, and offered a bad shilling; the man would not take it, so he gave him another. When I came out at the door it was dusk; he went to take hold of me; I told him he should not; I stumbled and fell down, and I found my apron coming from me. I asked him if he saw my apron; he said no, d - n your apron, I will give you a yard of muslin; I said a yard would not make an apron; then he said he would give me three. I crossed over to a tavern in Grafton Street; I was going home; I bid him good night. Then he came to my right side and took my cloak and handkerchief, and took me by my hand; he took hold of me and shook me, and threw me on the flags, and threw me into a deep hole on my side; he picked my pocket, and then turned me over in the channel to pick my other pocket; I had but ten-pence; he took my gold ring off, then he took hold of my feet, and took my buckle from my left foot. A gentleman came up, and said, what are you doing to the woman, are you smothering her in the channel? he said he was going to lift me up, and then he made off. The next day my husband went to the public house, and found out his name, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090005"></xptr> where he lived. I went with my husband and a constable to the prisoner's house, in Ship Yard; a person said the prisoner's wife had put something black up the chimney; my husband put his hand up the chimney and pulled my cloak down. (The cloak produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix) The constable found my handkerchief and apron in a cradle. ( Produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man that took your things from you?</p>
               <p>Duffey. Yes, I should know him from among a thousand.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him before?</p>
               <p>Duffey. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did he accost you?</p>
               <p>Duffey. About six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. It was quite light?</p>
               <p>Duffey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many public houses did you drink together at?</p>
               <p>Duffey. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you quite sober?</p>
               <p>Duffey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he untied your apron, did you feel him?</p>
               <p>Duffey. He put his hand round me, and I saw him draw it from me; I did not lay hold of it, because I thought it was from the motion of my body; when I looked for it, and it was gone, I thought it was vanished; I did not think he had it when I went from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be sober?</p>
               <p>Duffey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening did he take off your cloak?</p>
               <p>Duffey. Between nine and ten; that was in <placeName id="t17720909-4-crimeloc19">Grafton Street, at the top of Newport Market</placeName>

               <p>Q. Were not all the shops open?</p>
               <p>Duffey. There are no shops hardly but on one side; some of them were open.</p>
               <p>Q. Now upon your oath, did you ever cry out thief or murder, or any thing else, while he was untying your cloak?</p>
               <p>Duffey. I said to him don't kill me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you did not cry out for assistance?</p>
               <p>Duffey. He was not a minute doing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into any house in the street afterwards upon your oath?</p>
               <p>Duffey. No my own lodging was very near.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any of the passengers that you had been robbed, and the man had made his escape?</p>
               <p>Duffey. Yes, one woman; I don't know her name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fall down in the street from the effects of the mint and carraway?</p>
               <p>Duffey. I am a sober woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink a little of it?</p>
               <p>Duffey. I drank a full glass.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you stumble the first time?</p>
               <p>Duffey. I was pulling myself from him and stumbled upon my knee.</p>
               <p>Q. Who helped you up?</p>
               <p>Duffey. Myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have not you charged two or three other people with this?</p>
               <p>Duffey. No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the Fountain that evening?</p>
               <p>Duffey. No.</p>

I live at No. 2, George Yard, Golden Lane—I am a widow—I have known the prisoner about five weeks—ho has been living with me—on Monday, 3rd May, we went to bed about 12 o'clock—the pri<lb></lb>soner had been drinking in the day, but was not drunk—we had a quarrel on the Friday before, about some man who had been home with me—a short time after we had been in bed on the Monday night, he got out; I told him there was somebody calling him—when he had been out of bed a minute or two, I said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, it's only a joke, you had better get into bed again"—he got on the side of the bed, put his hand on my forehead, and drew a knife across my throat; I bled directly—it was in the dark, I could not see the knife—I jumped out of bed, unlocked the door, and ran down stairs into the court—I went into a lodging-house where I used to live, and from there I was taken to the hospital—the prisoner had threatened before this that he would cut my throat; the last time he said it wan about 11 o'clock that same night—he assigned no reason for it then—he had said before, it was because he found me in bed with another young man.</p>

I am surgeon to the G Division of Police—on the morning of 4th May I was called to the house, 2, George Yard—I saw the prisoner in bed there—he had an incised wound in the throat, about five inches in length; the windpipe was not cut, it was merely through the skin, a superficial wound: the upper portion of the windpipe was exposed—I dressed the wound, and he was sent to the hospital—it was a dangerous wound—such a knife as this would produce it—I believe it to have been self-inflicted.</p>

I washed myself and went down stairs, and never said a word. On the night this occurred, as I was getting into bed, she said somebody was calling; I got up, but heard no one. I went and got my knife and some tobacco, and sat on the side of the bed, cutting it She asked me would I forgive her the affair of Friday morning. I told her I would, and to drop it. She kept pulling me, and asking me to lie down; at last I made a hit at her, forgetting I had the knife. She said I had cut her throat, and went down stairs and told the people so, and drove me regularly distracted, and I know no more till I came to myself in the hospital.</p>

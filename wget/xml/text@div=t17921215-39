             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Thursday the 8th of November, about the hour of four in the afternoon, I met the prisoner coming out of the house with her apron tucked up; I asked her what business she had there, and if she was a lodger; she said, she was not; I pursued her into Oxford road, and asked her what she had there? She said, what is that to you you scoundrel; I said, I was determined I would know, because she came out of my room; and I found on her a cotton bed gown and two check aprons.</p>
               <p>Q. They are the sort of things your wife can swear to better than you; is your wife here? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. And did your wife say nothing about these things. You did not open the bundle, nor get the things of her till you stopped her in the street. Was the bundle opened in the presence of your wife? - My wife did not pursue her, but I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you safely swear that this cotton bed gown is your wife's? - I can, I bought the stuff in Oxford-road out of a shop; and my wife made the bed gown up. One of the check aprons my wife had to wash; it belongs to a Mrs. Hatch; it was in my wife's possession to wash.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that your wife had an apron to wash, but you cannot swear that that was the apron? - I can swear there was an apron in the possession of the prisoner, and my wife had an apron to wash, and it was missing.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a cordwainer; I saw this woman come out and Mr. Riley after her, follow her about fifty or sixty yards from the corner of Oxford-street, he laid hold of her and took the things out of her apron, a cotton bed gown and two check aprons, which were given to Mr. Riley's wife.</p>
               <p>Court to Riley. Was the bed gown given back to your wife? - This was the check aprons; I have had them in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman has accused me very wrongfully; I went up into the house to look for a person that lodged there; I came down stairs, this gentleman stopped me in the passage and asked me what I went up there for; the things laid on the bannisters of the stairs; but as to taking them from me he did not, as God almighty knows; the gentleman has swore my life away very false.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. On your oath did you take these things from the woman? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court to Leadbetter. Did you see them taken from the woman? - I did.</p>

I was called into Nunn's house, and saw Jennings in his custody; as soon as he saw me, I said "Is that you Bill?" he said "I know you are an officer;" I was then going to search him - he put his hand into his right-hand breeches-pocket, pulled out 10s. which he counted, and said he should keep that: I said I did not want to take his money; I searched, but found nothing on him: Nunn delivered me a handkerchief, this hat, a lantern, and crow-bar, in his presence - I have had them ever since; I afterwards compared the crow-bar with the drawer which was locked, and also to four doors, and they exactly matched with it; I sent for my handcuffs - Jennings said "I will walk with you, but if you handcuff me you shall carry me;" I was obliged to send for a coach, and take him to the watch-house; from the description Nunn's brother gave me, I went with Perrence and him in pursuit of the other man - we went to the Globe, in Steven-street, Lisson-grove, looked into the tap-room, and saw six or seven people; I charged Nunn to be particular, as I would not take away the liberty of any innocent person - he looked round, and pointed out Giles immediately; I called to him, and said "George;" (I knew him before) - he then came to the bar: I again said to Nunn "Be positive, for I won't take an innocent person's liberty away" - he said he was the man: I then took him - he walked very quietly with me to the watch-house: I searched him, and found a common latch-key on him - I examined Nunn's premises, and over the wall there is one brick fresh broken off, and just to the right, out of the yard of Sewell, a carpenter, where the jump was made from the wall, there were footmarks of shoes half-soled - there were the marks of the slip where the jump was quite fresh: when I got him to the watch-house, I asked Giles to take off his shoes: he said I might take them off, which I did - I compared them next morning with the place, and they tallied - there were the very impressions exactly, and here they are with the mud on them still.</p>

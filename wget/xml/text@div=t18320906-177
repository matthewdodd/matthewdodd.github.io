Last night, about a quarter-past nine o'clock, I was in my bed-room, which has a full command of the wharfs; I heard footsteps in the yard, and looked out at the window - I saw the prisoner Grove in the yard talking to the prisoner Hitch, who was standing outside the gates, which were locked; Grove then went down the yard, and took four pieces of pig-iron from a quantity at the bottom of the yard; he brought them up the yard from the gates, put one pieces under the gates, and said to the prisoner Hitch, "Bill, take hold" some person appeared to be taking it under the gates, and Grove was pushing it under, but it was too large and would not go through; upon which Grove said,"Bill, let it go," and pulled the piece into the yard again, and tried to put it under another part of the gates, and called out,"Bill, pull it" - upon which a voice answered, from outside the gates, saying he could not; Grove replied, "You must, now I've got it;" and then threw it into the ditch - he also said he had thrown some pieces in the cut, and could get them out afterwards with a fork - he then asked if any one was there; at that moment the bell rang - I went down stairs to the door, and a neighbour gave me information; I saw the prisoner Hitch walking towards the bridge - I waited at the door about five minutes, watched the prisoner Hitch, and saw him return towards my door - I then went up to him, collared him, and told him I wanted to speak a word with him: he asked what about; I told him to look under the gate, and he would see - at that time one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060085"></xptr>of the pieces of iron was half-way under the gate; he looked at the door, and said he knew nothing about it - I sent for a Policeman, who took Hitch into custody; my husband came home, and went into the yard with a Policeman in search of Grove - I afterwards saw Grove in their custody; I can positively swear to both the prisoners - when I went to the door to answer the bell I saw three pieces of iron placed against the wall, within about a yard of the gates - the other piece was still under the gates; I saw the Policeman take possession of them - they are the same now produced.

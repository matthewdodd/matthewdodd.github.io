                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, of 13, Thornhill-terrace, Pentonville—on Saturday afternoon, 3d March, about a quarter to 3 o'clock, I was in Fenchurch-street, and saw the prisoners and two men—the two men left the prisoners, and walked ahead—Wilkins then went up to the side of a lady, and put her hand into her pocket—Davis stood about a yard and a half behind her—Wilkins turned round and said something to Davis, and they both walked away together—I spoke to the lady, and followed the prisoners till I met an officer—the prisoners entered a passage—the officer and I went round, and entered the passage in an opposite direction—as soon as we entered, I saw that the same two men had joined the prisoners again—as soon as the men saw Green enter the passage, they turned round and said something to the prisoners, who ran away—one man seized Green by the collar, and one laid hold of me—I got away in a few minutes, and ran after the prisoners—I saw Green catch Davis in Lime-street—I followed Wilkins, who ran into a public-house at the corner of Lime-street, and out at the side door—I caught her—she was running as hard as she could—I am sure I caught the same person.</p>

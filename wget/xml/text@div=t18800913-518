Henry Montague says</hi>: My wife knows nothing about it; whatever has been transacted has been done by myself with some one else, and I have never broken into the houses which I am charged with. I do not know where some of them are. I certainly did assist to carry one or two things, but I was not aware the houses were broken into. I was asked to wait at the station, and the things were brought to me, so that I might take them by train. Some of the things were sent to me, and many different things were sent to me to be got rid of, but I did not know where to do so. Some of the things were given to me for assisting in bringing the things. I bought some of the dresses from these parties, which I gave to my wife. I was not aware any<lb></lb>thing was wrong until I was taken into custody. During the time my wife was maintaining herself in Ashburnham Grove I was endeavouring to</p>

I found I could not do so, and was obliged to come home, and at the time I had the things, was about six weeks before I was taken into custody, and one of the men stated I was to keep some of them until he came to lodge in the house I had taken. He was to have the back bedroom and use of the sitting-room. This is also my answer to the other charges." <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth Montague says</hi>: "Last year I maintained myself and bought a dress and under-clothing for my husband at Stagg and Mantle's and different shops.

                  <hi rend="italic">The Male Prisoner, in his defence, said he had been drawn into the affair by becoming acquainted with a man named James Fletcher in the middle of June, who said he would give him</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week if he would take charge of some of his property; that Fletcher then asked him to take a house, and he would give him</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week; that he took a furnished house, and Fletcher sent several parcels to be taken care of; that Fletcher stated he had lots of things for sale, and his wife was dead, and some of the things would suit his (prisoner's) wife, and some would suit him, and that he purchased some; that with regard to the Maze Hill charge, Fletcher asked him to meet him on the Friday to assist him to carry some things home, that he did so, and that Fletcher left a parcel in a room he was to occupy. He then left, and prisoner's wife was then asleep, and did not know that he had been out; that he called the servant, and had a good row with her because she did not get up; that he never knew the things were stolen; that he had plenty of opportunities to get away from Saturday morning to Sunday night, and if his wife knew it, she would have gone away. With regard to the velvet dress, his wife was wearing a black silk dress trimmed with lace material the whole afternoon. The other charges he knew nothing about, and did not know where the houses were situated, and it was physically impossible for him to break open houses and bars, as he had been suffering from a weak arm for four years.</hi>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take this pot? - I did not, I found him on the 4th of April, I have forgot the day of the week, it was that day that the terrible thunder storm was; I believe it might be between two and three o'clock; I was standing at the Adam and Eve gate at Tottenham-court-road, and there was a man came over to me, and said, there were three men gone by, and had got a copper pot, in consequence of that I pursued them, and when I got to the Goat and Cups, which was about two hundred yards further. I turned my head, and I see this prisoner with the pot in his possession, in consequence of which I immediately went to him, and secured him, the other men I did not see; I took the pot from him, a copper kettle and cover; I have kept it to now; the prisoner said that he had bought it of a man that had been quarrelling with his wife, and he gave ten shillings for it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner.

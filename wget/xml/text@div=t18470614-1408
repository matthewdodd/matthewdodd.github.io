                  </hi>. I am the wife of James M'Donald. On the 19th of May, about twelve o'clock, I was walking home, and saw the prisoner in the street—I am quite certain she is the woman—she followed me—I inquired my way home of her—she said she was going the nearest way, and I walked by her side about two minutes—she then put her foot against mine, and tripped me up—I fell on the ground, and she tore my scarf from my shoul<lb></lb>der, and ran away with it—it had been pinned on my shoulder—I called a policeman, who came, and ran after her—I could not run as my knew was very much hurt—the policeman brought her back with the scarf which is now produced.</p>

                  </hi> I am a policeman. About one o'clock in the morning on the 19th of May I was on duty near Marylebone-lane, and heard a cry of "Police"—I went up, and found the prosecutrix lying on the ground bleeding at the mouth—she said that woman had robbed her of her scarf, pointing in a direction in which the prisoner was running—I ran about one hundred yards, and caught her—I asked what she had been doing with that woman—she said "Nothing; I am going to get her some coffee"—I asked what she had under her shawl—she said "Nothing"—I took this scarf from under her shawl.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Pelham-crescent, Notting-hill—on Monday, 21st November, I went to stay at The George Hotel, George-yard, Skinner-street, Snow hill—about 5 o'clock that afternoon, I went upstairs into my bedroom, and on the landing I met a man named Clarkson, whom I have since seen at Holloway gaol—I am sure he is the man—he asked me for a light—I left one on the landing for him—he said, "Never mind; I dare say I can find my way in the dark"—I then went to my bedroom, divested myself of my mantle and placed it on the bed—the value of it is about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I closed the door and came down stairs—I then saw two other men standing at the bar—I could not swear to the prisoners being them—they left in a very few minutes after I came down—about half-an-hour afterwards I went upstairs again, and upon going into my room I saw that my cape was gone—there was a bright coke fire, so that I could see everything in the room—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cape—I know it to be mine—I have no doubt about it.</p>

I am the daughter of Mrs. Bennett, landlady of the George Inn—between 5 and 6 o'clock on 21st November, three men came to our bar; Russell was one of them—he ordered half-a-quartern of gin, that is two penny worth—there was some warm water mixed with it, and sugar—that takes some little time—I fetched the water from another room—I have not seen Clarkson—one of the men asked me for some waste paper and I gave him some—he went out into the yard, and after that I saw him go towards the stairs—I remember that man coming back again—they all three left then at once—the convenience upstairs is used only for the family and lodgers that we know, not for the public.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Lawler, pawnbroker of 78, Farringdon-street—I think I am right in saying that it was on Monday evening, 21st November, that this velvet mantle was brought to be pledged—I have seen it here—it is the one that was pledged to me, and, to the best of my belief, by the prisoner Wood—I would not swear that it was Wood, although I gave a very minute description to the constable when he applied to me about it—he gave the name of Richard Wood—the duplicate is "Velvet cape 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Richard Wood."</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a lodging-house, and reside at 5, Mexican-terrace, Caledonian-road—on Tuesday, 8th November, the prisoner, Wood, came to me to hire lodgings, and he introduced Clarkson to me, the man who is now in gaol—they took the apartments and both resided there—the second week after that the prisoner Russell called on them—Mr. Wood was not at home—Clarkson went out and spoke to him—they seemed friendly—I did not hear what they said—on Wednesday, 23d November, Russell called again on Wood but did not see him, because he was in custody—he called five times altogether and did not see Wood once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Russell's Defence.</hi> Wood and Clarkson happened to meet me with a friend in the Caledonian-road; I had known Wood some years ago to be a respect<lb></lb>able man in the city, but when I met him I did not know him; my friend introduced him. We went to a public-house for some refreshment, and there Clarkson told me he had a large shop in Somers-town, and that I was the man to introduce them to certain houses to get goods. I said I could do so if their references were satisfactory; and they said they would pay half cash. I afterwards recognised Wood. We parted on this Sunday night, and they promised to call on me in a few days and let me know how they pro<lb></lb>gressed. They did not call; I happened to be passing by where they lived, and I called and asked if Mr. Wood was in; Clarkson came out and said he was not in, but he would call at my house; they called there on the following Sunday, and we had a few minutes conversation. I said "I will meet you to-morrow at one o'clock;" I met them about half-past one on the Monday, and we entered into the affair. I was to introduce them, and they were to pay half cash for the goods. We waited at a public-house about two hours, and then we went towards St. John-street-road; Clarkson wanted to go into some house, and I went in with them; he asked for some paper at the bar, and walked directly up stairs as if he knew the house, the landlady and other people behind the bar looking at him full in the face. Why did they not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185911280037"></xptr>
               <p>stop him if this was a private place? he came down, went right out of the house, and beckoned to the man to follow him; he did so, and one of them said they should be back in a minute; I stood at the bar but they did not come back; I then went into the yard and saw Clarkson standing there; he said, "Oh, he has gone on a little business, we shall see him presently at another place." He took me down to Salter's Hotel; I never knew it before; we went in and called for a chop; Wood came in and whispered to Clarkson for some time; he then left the room, and, according to the evidence of the head waiter, he missed a coat from the rack; Clarkson then offered to treat me to a glass of gin and water, and we went into the smoking room, and, it getting rather late, Clarkson wanted to get rid of me. I went out at the door and went home; afterwards Clarkson went into the passage, and was taken into custody. I told the officer that I had not been into any hotel in London for twelve months.</p>

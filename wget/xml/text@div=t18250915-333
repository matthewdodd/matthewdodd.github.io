On the 22d of July, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner with two other men about the house, and sometimes at the corner of Basinghall-street - I continued to watch them till about five o'clock, I was then about to leave the shop to go to the parlour, when I turned my head and saw the prisoner taking the cotton - I lost six pieces; I ran into the street, and saw him endeavouring to cover it with his apron - he turned up Moor-lane; I afterwards saw a gown on the back of the woman he lives with, made of some of the same cotton - he was taken on the 2d of August - when he committed the robbery, he had a fustian coat like a shooting jacket on, and a leather apron with a bib to it. I had observed him about the house previously to that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Were there not three who engaged your attention? A. Yes, the other two had blue coats on. I particularly observed the prisoner - he was dressed different to the others. I have not said that the gown I have seen is not to be bought in a shop in London. We buy our cottons in Queen-street, and I do not know how many thousand pieces of the same cotton<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150124"></xptr>may be sold. I was the only person in the shop that day, and was not out the whole afternoon. I was watching the shop, as I have been robbed four times since Christmas, in a very audacious manner. I did not see the prisoner have a double-barrelled gun and a little pointer with him. We have not tried to make up this matter. I have not seen him but in custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you correct in stating that you had seen the prisoner, and two others about your house in the course of that day? A. Yes - I said when the prisoner was taken up that he was the man.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 1st of August I received information that Wilkinson was wanted. I went and searched his premises, but I found no jacket nor cotton. I found two leather aprons, and one has a bib to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find any close shooting jacket? A. No; I saw his father, who is a decent man.</p>

            . I live at No. 83, Fore-street. I saw the prisoner lurking about No. 82, with two other persons - he had a leather apron on like this, and a shooting jacket with pockets in it - I saw him turn round many times - I do not know whether he had trousers or breeches on - he had no gun - I had noticed him about there for a week before, in the same dress - I was called in by my grandmother at the time of the robbery, and did not see the cotton taken - I gave information of it the same afternoon - I saw the prisoner again on the 2d of August, in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the day of the robbery I was at work with my father. Her husband stated at the office that he had lost three pieces, and she comes and states she lost six - it is not likely I could steal one hundred and sixty-eight yards of cotton and run away with it.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE BATES. The property was taken as near five o'clock as possible, on the 22d of July. I did not see the man who took it till he was apprehended - the apron was not then produced.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How was the cotton taken? A. He came into the shop, and took it from a pile at the right hand of the shop - they were tied flat and close in different ties, squeezed tight on one another.</p>

            ; I said to him, d - n you, you are my prisoner; you shall go with me to the watch-house. We had a struggle together for near five minutes; he held a pistol up to my head and snapped it; it struck a light, but did not go off; he d - d my blood, and said I was a dead man if I did not let him go; I let him go upon his saying that; then he stumbled up the two steps of the Monument-yard. I made a blow at him with my staff, but missed him; Lyons was near; I called out, Watch help me. Lyons ran down Fish-street-hill; I pursued him, calling out, stop thief. At the corner of St. Martin's-lane, Lyons fired a pistol and said, d - n your blood, I have another for you. I said, d - n you fire. He still ran on, and I kept crying out stop thief, knock him down. He made an attempt to fire another pistol off, when a watchman in Candlewick ward seized him, and knocked the pistol out of his hand, I said, that is the man I want; bring him back to our watch-house; the fact was done in our ward. They said no; he was catched in their ward, and should go to their watch-house; they took him to their watch-house; the officer came and searched him, but searched him very slightly, only on the outside of his pockets; he found nothing on him but the pistols. As they were taking him from the watch-house to the Compter, when he had got about four or five yards out of the watch-house, he dropped an iron crow. I had hold of the flaps of his coat.</p>
               <p>Was the iron crow such as he could have concealed about his cloaths? - I imagine it must, it is small.</p>
               <p>Who were in company then? - Two watchmen besides the officer?</p>
               <p>Then it must be one of that company that dropped the iron crow? - Yes; I heard it, and thought it a bunch of pick-lock keys by the gingle of it.</p>
               <p>Do you swear you knew the faces of the men when you saw them come out of the house? - No, not till I came up to them; but I swear the men I came up to, are the men I saw come out of the house; I never lost fight of Lyons from the time that he came out of Mr. Smith's house, to the time that I lodged him in the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You struggled with another man for five minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not the other man endeavour to run away? - No, he stood still three or four yards from us.</p>
               <p>He never attempted to run away? - No; he stood still by the Monument.</p>
               <p>What time of night was this? - Two in the morning.</p>
               <p>The man might in five minutes have got a great way from you? - Yes; but he did not.</p>
               <p>When Lyons was at the watch-house not only you, but every person there searched him I believe? - No; the officer of the night, when he was first taken into the watch-house, only made a slight search.</p>
               <p>But a crow is a thing easily felt?</p>
               <p>Court. Produce the crow.</p>
               <p>[The crow was produced in court; it was about nine inches long, with a very strong purchase.]</p>

Do you apprehend that Lyons stood by when you was struggling with Miller, with an intent to aid and assist him to get out of your custody? or did he merely look on as an innocent spectator? - I know him to be one of the men that came out of Mr. Smith's house. At the time I had Miller by the collar, I kept my eye upon Lyons, left he should come and give me some fly blow, or do me some mischief.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>He did not say any thing to you? - No.</p>
               <p>You was struggling with a man whom you thought to be a bad man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not you at all afraid of that man's hurting, or doing something to you? - When I had Miller by the collar, I said, d - n you, you are my prisoner, you shall go to the watch-house with me. After I had struggled five minutes with him, he held a pistol up to my head and snapped it at me: Lyons stood two or three yards from me at the time.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, you were as clear then about it as now? were not you at all agitated or frighted? - When he snapped the pistol at me and said, d - n your blood, you are a dead man, I let him go, and directly holloa'd out, Watch help me, knowing Lyons to be one that came out of the house; I called out directly, That is one; upon which Lyons jumped off the pavement, and ran down to Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Before this Lyons had not said any thing to you, or interfered in the least? - No; but I all along knew him to be one who came out of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you sober at the time, because I observe you swore a good deal? - I was sober.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>You have not informed us what became of Miller; you quitted him to pursue Lyons: was Miller taken that night, or did he get off? - He ran across Monument-yard, and got off that night.</p>
               <p>You did not know Miller before? - No.</p>
               <p>You now swear to him from having laid hold of him at two in the morning, and during the time you had hold of him, you kept your eye upon another man? - When I had Miller by the collar, I looked wistfully in his face; I then turned and looked at Lyons for fear he should give me some private blow or other.</p>
               <p>Have you heard that there is a large reward depending upon the conviction of these men? - None at all.</p>
               <p>You never heard any thing about it? - Not till after Miller was apprehended.</p>
               <p>When was he apprehended? - An advertisement in the papers came out the day after Christmas-day, and he was apprehended the Friday following.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there light enough to enable you to distinguish the faces of these two men? can you swear to the person of Miller? - I do swear to Miller; and as for Lyons I never lost fight of him.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Lyons was brought into the watch-house at about two in the morning, between the 18th and 19th of December last; I asked the watchmen of our ward, what he had done; they said that he had fired two pistols off; there were several watchmen of Bridge ward came in and said, they believed he had broke open a house; I did not immediately search him, but taking him out of the watch-house I heard something drop; when he was about two or three yards from the watch-house, I said he had dropped something; I turned about and picked up that iron crow; I am certain it was dropped by him; I had hold of him on one side, two watchmen had hold of him on the other, and one had hold of his coat behind: the crow was not dropped more than two foot or a yard from me; I picked it up; there were none but him and I and the watchmen present, and the crow was warm when I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Who were the watchmen? - Radford and Goodall were two. I took Lyons to the Compter; then I went to Mr. Smith's house with some of the watchmen, where I observed a mark upon the door like the mark of a crow: the door was broke a little, and the screws to the box which the bolt of the lock shoots into, were forced out.</p>
               <p>Did you take the crow with you when you went to Mr. Smith's? - I did. I tried it. I thought the marks on the door corresponded with the claw of the crow; the door was a little broke.</p>
               <p>[The two pistols, one a small pocket one, and the other a horse pistol, were produced in court.]</p>

               <p>I am porter to Mr. Neale. On Friday the 19th of last month I got up at about seven o'clock in the morning; I found the warehouse door fast; I unlocked the door; going down the yard, I saw some dirt on the lower part of a window frame in Mr. Smith's house; it had been painted but the day before, and some paint was rubbed off. Then I went towards the gates; I saw a bale had been cut open which was safe in the evening; the rope, which was about the bale was cut off in two or three places, and at the top of the bale the mats were cut open; one piece of Russia was taken out and flung into the kennel. I went and informed Mr. Neale of what I had seen; he came down and saw what was done; then I went to the gates and found them locked fast, so that there was no other way, all the gates being shut, of getting to this place, but through Mr. Smith's house.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Smith. You have removed no furniture into this house? - I have some there to the value of 10 l.</p>
               <p>Did any of your family sleep in the house? - No.</p>
               <p>There was no servant, or any servant appointed by you to sleep in the house? - No I intended to go in myself in three days.</p>
               <p>Were the goods you had in the house what you had bought with the house, or new ones? - New ones.</p>
               <p>Lyons. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Miller. I leave it to my counsel.</p>

               <p>I am a cabinet-maker; I have known Miller five years; he is a <rs id="t17780115-69-deflabel370" type="occupation">shoemaker</rs>

On the 18th of November he brought me home two pair of shoes which he had mended for me; we went to the ale-house to drink; we sat there a considerable time, as there was pastime going on; the landlord of the house was going out, and it was half after eleven o'clock before Mr. Wright the auctioneer had done the business for him, and when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712150043"></xptr> they had done the business they gave us some beer to drink, and about one o'clock Miller was very drunk; I went to see him home; I came back again at about a quarter before two, and went to bed. I saw him the next morning, and have never seen him since. I went to see him to his own house, because he was so drunk. The public-house is about three hundred yards from where he lives.</p>
               <p>What street did Miller lodge in? - He kept a house in Long-alley, Moorfields.</p>
               <p>The reason why you saw him home, you say, was because he was very much in liquor? - Yes, we had the liquor given us; he was not able to walk when he came out in the air, but he was pretty well whilst he was in the house. I knocked at the door; his wife opened it; he went in, and there I left him.</p>
               <p>Was he in a condition, to your view, to have walked near a mile without tumbling? - No; I was in liquor, but I was better than he was; it is not usual for the house to keep up so late as that.</p>
               <p>Court. On what day was it that you say you went home with Miller at half past one o'clock? - It was on Wednesday; O no! the Thursday night.</p>
               <p>What made you take particular notice of the day of the month? - On account of the landlord's going out of the house.</p>
               <p>I suppose the landlord is here to confirm this? - No.</p>
               <p>You swear you was with Miller till one o'clock on Friday morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that he was then as drunk as you was? - He was drunker than me; when I went out at the door along with him, the watchman was crying past one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Where was the public-house? - The Dial in Long-alley, Moorfields.</p>
               <p>You think you could not have walked to Gracechurch-street yourself at that time of night? - I don't think I could, and I was the most sober.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>What character has this young man born since you have known him? - I never knew any thing amiss of him.</p>
               <p>Court. If you was so very drunk how do you recollect the time? - The man that worked for me recollected the time; we have searched into it since the man was taken: I recollect too the time that I was with him.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner your journeyman? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Because at the Mansion-house the prisoner was very insolent; he said he was neither a master nor a journeyman, but something between both, a chip; you see he says his trade is something like your name. Where do you live? - In Long-alley Moorfields, next door the to Dial.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you a house-keeper? - I keep a part of one house, and have a shop over the Dial.</p>
               <p>Court. From what time was you there with him? - From five in the afternoon till one in the morning.</p>

Miller keeps a house just above the Dial.</p>

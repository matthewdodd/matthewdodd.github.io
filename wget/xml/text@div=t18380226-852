                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Lumley, and live in North<lb></lb>ampton-street, Clerkenwell—we deal in ladies' wardrobes. On Saturday, the 3rd of February, about a quarter-past eight o'clock in the evening, in consequence of information, I went into the street, and examined my parlour window—I found it broken sufficiently to admit a man's arm, and missed about thirteen yards of silk—I had seen it safe at twenty minutes after seven o'clock—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the silk</hi>)—I can swear to this—I know it by the selvage in particular, and my servant can prove it also.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I went to No. 8, Peter-lane, Cow-cross, on the morning of the 7th of February—I was searching the shop, and saw a quantity of rags and pieces of old coats and trowsers, under the counter, and under them I found a box, locked—I asked the prisoner for the key—he said he had not got it—I proceeded to break it open, and some distance down, covered with flannel and other articles, I found this silk—I did not ask how he came by it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did you go there to look for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For stolen property, it did not matter what—I had information—I had appre<lb></lb>hended a brother-in-law of the prisoner's the evening before, who referred to him (the, prisoner) for a good character—I did not know of Kirk's robbery when I went, nor of this—I did not take away all his property—I took the wedding-ring off his mother's finger, and a keeper—I do not know how much property I took away altogether—perhaps 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I took it to the station-house—a large portion of it has been identified as having been stolen from different people—I cannot exactly say what has been identified—I think a quantity of table-eloths with marks picked out, and towels and other things.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When he asked me for the key I could not find it, and asked my wife for it—there was nothing near the box, and I told him to break it open—my wife kept the key—I bought the things in open market where anybody can buy—nobody has a better character than I have—I am as innocent of it as any man in the world—there is a fair held in Petticoat-lane in the afternoon—all strangers go there, and pawnbrokers' goods are brought there for sale.</p>

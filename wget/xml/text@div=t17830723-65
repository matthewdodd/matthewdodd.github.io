               <p>Court. How did she catch hold of you? - She caught hold of me by the middle, and when she turned round to go from me, I missed my watch, she took me round by way of a hug, I am sure I found my watch go from me, I seized her, and told her, she had got my watch, she denied it, and she then sat down on the ground, or lay down, and on her rising up I saw the watch on the ground, I had drank a pint of porter before I had the drams, I was neither drunk nor sober, I did not see the watch in her hand at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Then by possibility in her catching hold of you, it might come out of your pocket, and fall to the ground? - It went out of my pocket, but in what manner I cannot tell, I charged the watchman with her.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman, the prisoner clung round the prosecutor's waist, and begged he would forgive her, and she would never be guilty of the like again, and would treat us with a gallon of beer.</p>
               <p>Court. How did the prosecutor appear? - He seemed to be compos mentis at the time.</p>
               <p>How was you? - We have very little to drink in our watch-house, the gentleman seemed in proper spirits.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose by that, you do not look upon him to be quite sober? - I thought he was capable to transact any business.</p>

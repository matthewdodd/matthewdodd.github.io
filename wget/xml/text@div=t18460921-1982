I saw the prisoner steal the coat, on Monday night, the 14th of Sept., at a quarter before nine o'clock—I had watched him for a quarter of an hour before—I was in plain clothes—I was looking at him very minutely—I could not take him on account of so many persons being in the road—it was the Surrey Zoological Gardens night, and I could not get across—I know it was him—I had watched him three nights—he had some difficulty in getting the coat off the blind—he took it with two hands.</p>

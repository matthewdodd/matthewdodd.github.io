               <p>I am a printer: Mr. Becket rents a warehouse of me, the staircase of which is fronting my parlour window; I had an opportunity<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177707020011"></xptr> of course of seeing people go, up and down the warehouse stairs; I saw the prisoner bring down a very large load of books upon his shoulder at about half after ten in the morning last Monday week, the 23d; I believe I had left Mr. Becket at his own house not ten minutes before; seeing him turn a contrary way to his master's house with the bundle, I suspected he had robbed his master; I followed the prisoner to a Cheesemonger's shop in Blackmore-street; when he went into the shop I passed by the door; I did not take any notice then for fear he should see me dodge him, might take the books up, and pretend he was going to his master; I watched at the door and saw him weighing the books off in the Cheesemonger's shop; then I went into the shop and asked him whether his master gave him those books to sell for waste paper; he was confounded and could not give me an answer; I brought him back, after telling the master of the cheesemonger's shop, that I knew he had robbed his master of that property; I brought him to my house and sent for Mr. Becket; Mr. Becket was not at home, his son came; I went back with him to the cheesemonger's shop; the son owned the property.</p>
               <p>What said the prisoner? - He said nothing, but begged that I would let him go.</p>
               <p>Mr. BECKET. When I returned home I found the prisoner in my house in custody of my son; I went to the cheesemonger's that afternoon; I saw the paper there; the bundle was tied up, and there was marked upon it 102 pound.</p>
               <p>Was it printed paper? - Yes: it contained part of the numbers of the Monthly Review, which I publish; I believe there were near 600 numbers; they were books I printed which I am accountable to the proprietors for every number at nine-pence each, which comes to upwards of 20 l. and in another shop I found equally the same.</p>

               <p>I am a cheesemonger in Blackmore-street, Clare-market: I was below in the warehouse selling some goods; my servant weighed that paper in order to buy it; I had frequently bought paper of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>What was the weight of it? - 102 lb. as I received the weight from the man; we were to pay 2 d. a pound for it.</p>
               <p>I suppose the reason you did not pay for it was Mr. Noys coming? - I certainly should have paid for it if Mr. Noys had not come in; I have bought of the prisoner before, and never had any suspicion of him.</p>
               <p>Was you by when he brought it? - No: I was in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner in your shop? - I did not see him that morning he brought the paper.</p>
               <p>To Mr. NOYS. Did you see the paper? - I did.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to that paper? - Yes: that is part of the paper; I know it by a mark which I put myself upon it at the time I detected the man, and at the same time I told Mr. Ward that was the property of Mr. Becket.</p>

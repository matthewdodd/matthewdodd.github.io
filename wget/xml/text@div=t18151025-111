The prisoner is a stranger to me; I never saw him until I apprehended him. On Wednesday evening, at about eight o'clock, a knock came to my door; which the servants answered; one of them came up, and had hardly got into the drawing room to deliver her message, whatever it was, before I heard the banging of the door. The servant went to the head of the stairs, and immediately returned, exclaiming,</p>
               <p>"the coats, a man;" that was all she said. I instantly ran down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any coats hanging up - A. I can speak to two coats; mine was hanging up in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other hanging up - A. A great box coat, belonging to Mr. Pheipher; it was hanging up a little after five o'clock, when I hung up my own; there was also a silk umbrella, belonging to my brother. I ran into the street, and soon after, I saw a man near Thames-street, coming down St. Andrew's Hill, with a coat in his possession. I was returning, thinking the pursuit fruitless, when I met him coming in a direction from my house; by the colour of this coat, I thought it was Mr. Pheipher's; I seized the man, who was the prisoner, and asked him how he came by that coat; he said. he picked it up at the top of the street, pointing up St. Andrew's Hill. I said, if you found it. I will shew you where you took it from; the back of my house runs into Addle Hill. I took him in the back door, and the servant immediately said, that is the man, in his presence. Upon that, I immediately sent for a constable of the Ward. He denied he was the person, and said he picked up the coat. Now, the weather was very dirty; and had he picked up the coat, it must also have been so.</p>

            . I was called up at about eight o'clock in the evening, by a knock at the street door; the person to whom I opened the door, was the prisoner; he came within the door; when he came in, I am confident there were two great coats and an umbrella hanging up in the hall. I can't swear there was more. He said, he came from Mr. Gould, a hatter, on Ludgate Hill, for a hat to be cleaned. I had some recollection that I had seen that name up. I asked him to wait until I went to enquire. I observed the person's features when I was speaking to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look round the court, and tell me if you can see him in court - A. Yes; there he is, (pointing to the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion - A. I rather doubted, but was under no alarm. About two minutes after, I went up to the drawing room where my master was. I heard the door slam. I immediately ran to the top of the stairs; the person was gone; I cried out, oh! the coats! a man! I missed the coats. In a few minutes, my master ran out, in pursuit, and in about five minutes he returned with the prisoner, whom I know to be the man. I saw the coat my master brought back; I knew it to be one of the coats that was hanging up in the hall. None of the other coats nor the umbrella has been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am not the person who knocked at the door; but I would wish to know whether she shut the door after that person came in - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Then you shut the door while that person was in the passage - A. Yes, while you were in the passage.</p>

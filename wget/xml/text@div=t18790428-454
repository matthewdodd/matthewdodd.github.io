                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Prescott, who keeps a stationer's shop and post-office at 42, Drury Lane—on 6th March, about 4.30 p.m., the prisoner came and asked for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of stamps; he tendered a florin and two sixpences—I bent the florin in the tester, and told him it was bad—he said "I got it in change for a half-crown from a man of whom I bought a pennyworth of oranges"—a gentleman in the shop went out with him to find the man; they returned in about ten minutes, and the prisoner said "I cannot find the man, but if you will return the money I think I shall be able to do so"—I went to the door, saw a policeman, and gave the prisoner into custody, with the florin, which I marked—this is it Frederick Groombridge (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 444). I was on duty in Drury Lane—Mrs. Prescott called me in and gore the prisoner into my charge; he said "I did not know they were bad; I have no more"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found a piece of leather used by jewellers and six black envelopes, but no money; he told the inspector he got the stamps to send to his sister in the country, and gave his name as James Newman—he was taken to Bow Street next morning, remanded till 10th March, and then discharged, as there was only one case against him—this is the florin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Hodgkinson, a fish<lb></lb>monger, of 46, Bed Lion Street, Holborn—on 11th March I sold the prisoner four oysters, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a florin; I tried it with my teeth, which left marks on it, and said "This is a bad one"—he took it from me and said, "I took it in a shop in Holborn"—he ate some of the oysters, but walked out without paying for them—a fortnight afterwards I saw him going by the shop in custody, and noticed a scar on his forehead—I am sure he is the man.</p>

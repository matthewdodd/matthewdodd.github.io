                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Richard Farmer and John Gorbell, ironmongers, Clerkenwell. On Saturday, the 3rd of April, the prisoner came to the yard about half-past nine o'clock in the morning—he delivered me this order—he said he wanted 2 cwt. of iron and four bars—he asked me if I knew him—I said I thought I did—he had a truck, and there was a person with him—I delivered him the goods, and helped him to put them on the truck—the prisoner then went into the shop with me to get</p>

               <p>an invoice—I booked the goods—I did not see the invoice delivered to the prisoner—he stopped for it, and afterwards went away with the truck and the goods.</p>

I did not see him deliver it—I did not swear that I did—I heard the prisoner say before the Magistrate, that he was not the person who was there—I heard the policeman say that the prisoner had said so to him—the clerk is not here—I have not sworn to-day, and altered my evidence in order to make it not necessary that the clerk should be here—there is not a person in Mr. Dudley's employ who is very mush like the prisoner—I do not know that there is a person named Joseph—I heard of this on the Saturday—Mr. Dudley came to me, and asked if I had served any<lb></lb>body with some iron—I said, "Yes"—it was our clerk asked me, in Mr. Dudley's presence—Mr. Dudley knew it, because he sent in some work, and this iron was set off against it—I heard something about an account in which 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid by mistake—when the prisoner came for this iron, there was no one in the yard but me—I suppose our clerk gave him the invoice—I did not see him—there are seven or eight persons at our place—no one is called to identify the prisoner but me—the other were at breakfast—I saw the prisoner again on the Sunday afternoon, at the station—I had seen him come to our place before—I do not know the writing on this paper—I can swear it is the order the prisoner gave me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am partner with George Dudley, my brother—we are whitesmiths, and live in St. Luke's. The prisoner had been in our employ, but he had left one day before this transaction—I do not know this note—it is not my writing, nor my brother's, or any one authorized to write it—it is not written by any one establishment—I have sent the pri<lb></lb>soner for goods of this description—I did not send him for the goods men<lb></lb>tioned in this paper.

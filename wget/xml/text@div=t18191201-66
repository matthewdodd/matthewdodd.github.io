            . I was the prosecutor's carman; I left the reins in the cart in the yard when I had done work - I and all the men left the yard together, leaving the prisoner behind. Next morning I missed the reins; - I ought to have put them into the stable. I asked the prisoner if he knew any thing about them? He said he did not, and told me to hold my tongue, for somebody had hid them, and they would be found; after that the prisoner and I had a dispute about putting some casks into a cart, which were too heavy for me - I said I would not do it. He was angry, and went and told my master that I had lost the reins. Next morning Mr. Mornay asked me about them, and I said I dare say the puppy had dragged them away - 8 s. was stopped out of my wages for them, but I applied to the Magistrate, and it was paid to me - I was discharged. On the 28th of October, I was at my father's, and saw the prisoner drive his cart by; I knew the reins on the horses by the girt buckle - I went out, examined them, and knew them. I told my father, then went to the collar maker, and he said they were the reins. I went with somebody after him to Bethnal Green, found him there unloading his goods, and asked him to deliver up to me Mr. Mornay's reins. He said he had none, and ran away with the cart. He said they were not Mornay's, for he had bought them at Mr. Blacket's sale. He afterwards said that he bought them of a man in a long brimmed hat.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Ann's. Hopson and Bass came to me on the 28th of October, and I followed the prisoner to Church-street, Bethnal Green, where he was unloading his cart of household goods. Bass went and asked the prisoner for the reins; he took them in his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010045"></xptr>hand, and said he bought them at Blacket's sale - he said Bromley and Ward sold them. I took him in charge, and as we went by Bromley and Ward's he turned in there. The clerk examined the books, and found that no reins had been sold. He then said he bought them of a man in a long brimmed hat, the next day, when he went to fetch his goods, the gentleman said if he would say what goods he had bought, he could perhaps find the man out. He then said that he did not know that he had bought any. He at first said he gave 3 s. for them, and then 4 s.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them at a public yard, where there is a sale every day. I left him with a good character. I drive by his premises every day, and live close by.</p>

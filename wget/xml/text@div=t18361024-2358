About half-past two o'clock on Sunday morning I heard a noise in the yard—I went into the passage, and met the prisoner in the passage-way with a bundle, and umbrella over it to conceal it—he quite obstructed the passage—asked who was there—he said, "A friend"—not being able to get past him, I put my hand up, and felt the bundle—I said, "What have you got here?"—" Nothing, "said he—I took the bundle from him, and took it into the parlour, and it proved to be a blanket and a rug—he then begged forgiveness—I went for a policeman, and he was taken to the station-house a sheet was taken from round his body, and another he gave out of his hat himself—all this is the property of Thomas Grout—they were left in my care—I do not know how be got in—the door was open</p>

I saw a person jump from the paling adjoining my premises; I was thirty or forty yards from him, and cannot swear to him; I had no idea who he was; the prisoner lived servant with me for three or four years, and left on the Saturday night week before this; when I got to my own door, I knocked for more than ten minutes; the prisoner's wife and my servant were up stairs - his wife did not live in the house, and had no business there; I had left the servant in charge of the house; they did not open the door to me - I knocked for ten minutes, and then broke the door open; the servant came to me and said something; I went up stairs, and found my drawers broken open, and missed all the property stated in the indictment, which was secure when I went out; I had left nobody but the servant in the house; the prisoner was apprehended, and when he was in Newgate, I received this letter, which I believe to be his hand-writing; I have seen his hand-writing in several of my customers' bills; I received the letter on the 5th of April, though it is dated the 3rd.</p>

            . I know the prisoner quite well. I was playing near the prosecutor's house on Sunday, the 7th of March, and saw him return home in his chaise, and saw the prisoner Clark jump from a gateway by his house; I am quite certain of him; he had a small bundle under his arm, and I heard something jingle - as he jumped from the gateway his clothes caught in the spikes on the top of the gateway.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who told you to say it was the 7th of March? A. My mother - I cannot tell how long ago it was; I have often seen him - I live in the same court as him; I do not know his wife; he did not live at the prosecutor's at the time I saw him jump from the gateway.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was this on the Sunday evening that Mr. Amsdell came home in his chaise? A. Yes, and I heard the house had been robbed that evening.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Can you recollect how he was dressed? A. A black hat, a black coat, and light trousers - I am sure he had a black hat on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you see whether it was a black or blue coat? A. No, it was dark; I was within a yard of him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 9th of March, about half-past nine o'clock, at the Red Lion, Whitechapel-road - I told him I wanted him for a robbery at Mr. Amsdell's, at Poplar; he said he knew nothing about it - I asked where his residence was; he said no where - I then asked where he slept on Sunday, the 7th of March; he said at the Unicorn, Shoreditch - I made inquiry there; I took him to the watch-house, and took his shoes off and on the 10th I went to Mr. Amsdell's; there were some footmarks on a waste piece of ground adjoining his premises - I compared his shoes with those marks, in Amsdell's presence - they corresponded right and left, and the nails in the heels exactly corresponded, the toes being towards the gateway; it was a clayey soil; there are nails on the gateway adjoining the premises - I examined his trousers, and found a tear about an inch long; they were lightish trousers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you mean by lightish - were they the colour of this book (brown)? A. About it, not quite so dark as that - the waste piece of ground joins Amsdell's premises; it is enclosed, and not a thoroughfare.</p>

            . I was present when the shoes were compared with the ground - they tallied with the marks in every respect; the marks and the nails corresponded; I have no doubt the impressions were the footmarks of those identical shoes - I value all my property at 25l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner did visit your house? A. Not with my consent - his wife was there without my knowledge.</p>

            . I am a Thames police officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. On Monday, the 4th of December, before day light. I was keeping watch on the river; I saw a boat coming from towards the tier in Shadwell dock, about four tiers from where the Commerce laid. I rowed after that boat. I saw the prisoner in that boat when I over-took it. The first thing I saw in the boat was a bucket, and four pieces of pork in it. There was nobody in the boat but the prisoner. I asked him how he came by that pork at that time in the morning. He said he was a Greenland man, and he was going to carry it on shore to a poor person where he lodged. He said, he took it from the ship William. He pointed and said, there she lies, off there. He pointed to the tier where I first saw the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he on the Middlesex side when you first laid of hold him - A. Yes. After that, I saw two bundles of clothes in the boat. I then said, whose are these. He said, one is mine, and the other belongs to a lad that was going to make his escape from the vessel that day. I knew it could not be legal for them things to come on shore to a poor person, where he said he lodged. I lodged the prisoner in the office. Then, after that, I went over to the tier where he said the ship, named William, laid. I could not find any ship of that name laying in the tier. There was no vessel at that time of that name laying in the tier. I went further down, and then I learned that the ship Commerce had something stolen from it. The goods were afterwards claimed by Mr. Stanhope. This is the frying-pan, the bucket, and the pork.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The bucket, the frying-pan, and the pork, belongs to the ship; they were under my charge as master. The two boys are here that belong to the clothes.</p>

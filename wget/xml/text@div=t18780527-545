                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, at 23, Lincoln's Inn Fields—I am also clerk to the Cutlers' Company—I had a clerk in my employment named Clement Allen; he has since absconded—in June last the Cutlers' Company were indebted to Mr. Sawyer, the contractor, 206<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a cheque for that amount was drawn in his favour, signed by the Master and Warden of the Company, and countersigned by myself—that cheque was given to Allen to hand over to Mr. Sawyer in the ordinary course of business—the Company was also indebted on 20th February to Messrs. Ring and Brymer 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a cheque was drawn in the same way, signed by the Master and Wardens, countersigned by myself, and handed to Allen for the purpose of payment—the cheques were payable to bearer, not crossed—on 16th January, 1878, the Company was indebted to Messrs. Thomas and Sons 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a cheque for that was also drawn and signed in the same way, and given to Allen for payment—he had no authority to deal with those cheques otherwise than according to the instructions on the face of them—I had great confidence in Allen—neither of those three cheques have been paid according to the directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Allen had been in my service four or five years—he managed the details of the Company under me, and I had confidence in him—the morning before the prisoner was arrested Swanson, the detective, came to my office with the prisoner—there was no warrant out against him at that time; he was not in Swanson's custody—I had not a long conversation with him—I did not say a word to him; he sat out in the clerk's office; he did not come into my room—Swanson told me that he had called on the prisoner that morning—at that time I had not made up my mind whether or no I would charge the prisoner—I think Swanson told me that he had been watching for the prisoner, and trying to find him—he said he had a long conversation with the prisoner at his house at 9 o'clock that morning; he repeated to me the substance of the conversa<lb></lb>tion—he did not tell me that the prisoner had told him that he believed Allen was in a good position, and that there was nothing wrong in the cheques—he told me that the prisoner said that latterly he knew there was something wrong about the cheques, that he had had an anonymous letter warning him to go out of the country—I told Swanson that he had</p>

               <p>better take the prisoner round with me to Mr. George Lewis, which he did—there was hardly a word said between Mr. Lewis and the prisoner—he went into Mr. Lewis's room with me and Swanson—that was for Mr. Lewis to make up his mind whether or not the prisoner should be charged—Mr. Lewis said to him that if he gave an explanation of the matter which was satisfactory he should not be prosecuted—he commenced by telling him that anything he said might be used against him, but that I had not at that time made up my mind whether to charge him or not, that the course I should take would depend very much upon the explana<lb></lb>tion he gave—he was given into custody there, either in the outer office or in Mr. Lewis's room—Swanson did not tell me that the prisoner said he had not changed any cheques for Allen lately because he had quarrelled with him about a partnership account between them in re<lb></lb>ference to an invention called "the wheel of beauty;" I think he said that the prisoner told him he had not been intimate with Allen lately because they had had some quarrel—I believe the prisoner lives some<lb></lb>where at Camber well—I don't know that Allen lived next door to him four years ago.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Miller, a draper, of 64, East Street, Walworth—on Tuesday evening, 29th September, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I served the prisoner with half a yard of black ribbon, she gave me a florin; I said "This is a bad one"—I went with it to a gentleman next door and then told her that she might keep it—she said that I might and went away—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced)—I</hi> gave it to the constable—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

I am a widow and keep a draper's shop at 4, East Street Walworth—on 30th September I sold the prisoner a pair of white stockings she gave me a florin, I told her it was bad and sent for the last witness who lives in the same street—I sent for a constable and gave the prisoner in charge—I then said "I believe you are the person who was let off last night, I know you by your shawl and hat and I must send up the street for the person"—she said "Oh, dear no I am not"—I said "I believe you are"—she said that a man gave her the coin and I think she said last night, and that she got her living in the streets.</p>

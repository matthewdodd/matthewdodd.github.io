            . I live at Brazier's Hall, No. 81, Coleman-street - it is right opposite Mr. Peckham's. On Sunday, the 23d of March, I saw Mr. Peckham and his family go out - I saw Mr. Peckham lock the door, and put the key into his pocket, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards a short man went and knocked at Peckham's door; he then went to the next door, and met with two other men- all three came back to Mr. Peckham's door together, and knocked again, and two men stood before the short man, while he (the short man) opened the door - all three then went in; the door was just shut to, and one man came out- that was a tall man - he stood at the street door; they took a light up into the drawing-room on the first floor: I then went and fetched Mr. Peckham from the chapel in Silver-street, Wood-street, as I knew where he was - I was not more than ten minutes gone; I found Mr. Peckham there, and came home with him - I told him what I had seen; a constable followed us to the house.</p>

            . I am a constable, and was at Silver-street chapel, on Sunday, the 23d of March. I saw Garratt there - I followed; Mr. Peckham home, there were several persons near the house; when I got there, I placed myself against the street door, and kept my station: there were a good many people in the street there - I suppose an alarm had been given - I kept the door; Mr. Peckham tried to get in with the key, but the door was fastened inside - soon after that the persons inside opened the door a little ajar, and shut it again; in about ten minutes after that, the persons within threw the street door open, and called out,"Here they are - here they are; come in - come in;" I went in and found the two prisoners there in the passage, and kept them in front of me - there was nobody else in the house at that time, but some officers, who had got in at the top of the house, and were coming down stairs - I knew them to be officers; I called for assistance, and one of the officers was with me in a moment - there was nobody in the house but the officer and the two prisoners; I secured them till an officer came to me - they never got away; Henman came to my assistance, and we put the prisoners into a little room, and then he turned (the people who had come into the passage) into the street, and shut them all out; my brother officer searched the prisoners, and found nothing at all about them; I saw Mr. Peckham with the wine strainer, shirts and stockings - they were found on the ground floor by somebody. The prisoners said the mob had driven them in, and they wanted to get out again, but they could not get past me, assistance came so quick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not a great mob got into the house, and pushed past you? A. No; I will swear that not one went past me, either one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were trying to push into the house to see what was the matter? A. Not one at the time this happened - not one passed me while I was securing them;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100015"></xptr>they might get in after the prisoners were secured, but not before - nobody attempted to get in before - I know nothing of Krelle.</p>

            . I am a warehouseman, and live in Philip-lane, Aldermanbury. On Sunday, the 23d of March, about seven o'clock, I was walking down Addle-street the witness went and spoke to the officer, who charged me in the King's name to aid and assist - I went with him to Mr. Peckham's house, and tried to enter, but we had no key, and the door was closed. Henman desired me to stay at the front door, till Burgin came, which I did, and in the mean time Henman went to see if he could enter at the back door; I remained at the front door till Burgin came, and took my station - Henman and I then went into the next house, which is a public-house, and we got from there to the top of Mr. Peckham's house, and got in through a trap-door in the roof; we had brought lighted candles from the public-house; we carefully examined every room as we went down - we looked under the beds, and every where; we found nobody up stairs - but there was evident proof that somebody had been there, the things being in disorder; we came down as quick as we could, and had just got on the ground floor stairs when we heard the cry of "here they are, here they are - come in;" I immediately heard Burgin call for assistance; Henman and I were instantly with Burgin, and the two prisoners were between Burgin and us.</p>
               <p>Q. Could there have been anybody in the house beside you? A. Two persons had followed us from the top; I believe they were ostlers - but there was nobody else in the house; the prisoners were secured immediately- the other two persons came down stairs from the top behind us; I did not see the property till somebody gave it to Mr. Peckham - I did not see it found, as I was engaged with Henman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say, that when you came down stairs some persons had not rushed into the house after the officer? A. They had not; there were no persons in the passage expect Burgin and the two prisoners; the door opens inside - it was about half open and half shut; Burgin was forcing it to with his back; I do not think any body outside was trying to get in - but am certain no persons were in the house till the prisoners were secured.</p>
               <p>Prisoner COURT. Q. When we were secured, was there not a whole passage full of people? A. There was nobody till after they were secured - but immediately after there was a rush into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not going to run a sword down my throat? A. No; I had the officer's sword; when the prisoners were secured they were very resolute and called for their friends; they said they would have their friends in - there was nobody but me, Henman and Burgin in the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where the prisoners out of your sight, till they were secured? A. Never. After they were committed from the Mansion-house, I was assisting Henman to take them to prison, and Court said "If I had known what I know now, I would have let the old b-gg-r's guts out;" I am sure the prisoners were secured before any persons came into the house.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At any time when you came down, could anybody have got by Burgin into the street? A. No, they could not.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to Peckham's door with Smith; I did not try to get in, as Peckham said he had tried and could not get in: I left Smith at the door while I went round to the back of the house and found that was fastened; Smith afterwards came to me - we went through the Blue Anchor public-house and entered at the roof; I think another man came in behind us, we were the foremost; we found nobody in the top rooms - we came through a trap-door, which was fastened, I broke it open - I searched every room as I came down stairs; I found a chest of drawers in the second floor front room had been broken open, and the things scattered about the room; I then proceeded down to the first floor staircase - there is a turning about the middle of the staircase; I heard a rush - I jumped and came on a level with the ground floor passage, and saw the two prisoners in front of Burgin; I said "these are the men;" there were no other persons whatever there - I knocked Krelle down and saw Court struggling with Burgin; we secured them and put them in a room - no other persons were in the house till after they were secured; there were some persons in the passage behind Burgin. but not between him and me; those persons were pressing forward, but I pushed them out and shut the door; I am quite certain they had not passed Burgin - no person whatever had passed him; here are two shirts, three pairs of stockings and a silver wine-strainer which Mr. Peckham delivered to me - since that the privy has been searched, and two bags found containing four skeleton keys, and one latch-key - one of the skeleton keys fits the street door and unlocks it - I tried it myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Did you come down stairs immediately after Smith? A. No; I came before him; when I came down stairs, there was me and the two prisoners before Burgin.</p>
               <p>Q. You say a great mob had rushed into the passage? A. They were behind Burgin; I should think the persons had got into the passage when Smith came down, but they had not passed Burgin.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true that nobody was in the passage, except the two prisoners, you and Burgin when Smith came down? A. I should think there were other persons, for the moment I turned my eye, I saw them; they were behind Burgin - there might be six or eight persons, but in the confusion I cannot say; Smith might not have seen them, as I stood before him; the partition might have prevented his seeing them; I was obliged to pass Burgin to put the persons out; the partition might prevent Smith from seeing me till he came forward, which he did after the prisoners were secured.</p>
               <p>Q. If he has sworn nobody whatever had got into the passage, is it true? A. I should think he must have seen the people.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. That was after you had secured the prisoners? A. Yes; there might be persons behind the officer before they were secured - but nobody had passed him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100016"></xptr>- it was impossible for them to pass him, the passage is very narrow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner COURT. Q. You say you pushed one prisoner away, and another the other; I was not secured for four or five minutes, and you picked us out of the mob? A. I pushed Krelle down, Court was struggling with Burgin, and I pushed him towards him. None of the mob could get to Burgin; the prisoners were not among any other people.</p>

            . I am a smith; I searched the privy of the house on the day after the robbery, and found a bag with four skeleton keys; the officer fitted them to the door, but not in my presence - here are four skeleton and one latch key; they were all in this bag, I hooked it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner COURT. He told the Lord Mayor he found only two, and they both opened the door. Witness. The Lord Mayor was gone when I was there; at the Mansion-house I said I found four skeleton and a latch-key - I never mentioned two.</p>
               <p>KRELLE'S Defence. I was going out for a walk, and on coming down Coleman-street I saw a great mob round Peckham's door.

               <p>COURT's Defence. I had been to Westminster, to my aunt's, to see a lady at her house; on my return I saw a mob; this man held the door with the knocker in his hand, and when the door was opened I and another were shoved a - e over head, and went in: at least a dozen of us were shoved in.

            . I live at No. 1, Prince's-place, White Horse-yard, Coleman-street. On Sunday evening, the 23d of March, I remember seeing a crowd of persons round Mr. Peckham's door; there were not above twenty persons, or not so many. I have known the prisoner Krelle as long as I can recollect myself, ever since he was born; I saw him that night; he was not exactly at Mr. Peckham's door, but nearly at it; I asked him if he had seen my little boy; he said, "No, Mrs. Colley;" I asked him what the confusion was about - he said, "Mrs. Colley, they say there are thieves in the house;" I always understood that he bore an honest character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time was this? A. As near as I can recollect about seven o'clock, or a very few minutes after. I am a widow, and work at the tailoring business, at No. 17, Three Tun-court, Redcross-street, for a person named Thomas Daley - he does not keep a shop, but works at home: he has two rooms there; I believe an Irish gentleman keeps the house - there is no name on the door, to my knowledge, but I am not quite positive; I have worked there for the last three weeks - the door is always open, and I go directly up stairs; I do not think there is any name up - I work in the garret; he rents the garret and the room under it: I went home directly after speaking to Krelle; I did not see him taken. I was quite astonished to hear on Monday that he was taken up; I went before the Lord Mayor, but I was not called. I mentioned to his mother that I knew he was not the boy - she was not at the Mansion-house - I did not mention it at the Mansion-house - I went there on account of his mother coming to me on the Monday morning - I believe it was between eleven and twelve o'clock; I went to the Mansion-house directly: I did not tell any body there that he could not have been the person - I mentioned it to his mother.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought she was not at the Mansion-house? A. Oh, yes, she was there; she did not state that I could prove her son was not in the house - the Lord Mayor left, and another gentleman came in and sat in his seat; and went on with the examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, did you mention it to him, or to any of the officers? A. No; I never spoke at all - I did not speak to Krelle there; his mother spoke to him, but they said nothing about my being able to prove that he was outside the house. I went as far as Peckham's door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door open or shut at that time? A. On my word, from the scene of confusion there was, I could not tell, for I was anxious about my son, who is always running about; I saw Krelle near Mr. Peckham's door - he was on the side nearest to Cheapside; I went on towards Cheapside, to go home; Mr. Peckham's door is towards Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any occasion to pass Peckham's door? A. I had been home a little way with a friend, and passed the door to come back; I heard a confusion as I passed - I had not heard that there were thieves in the house before I passed.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the Lord Mayor or the gentlemen who sat in his place, call any witnesses for the prisoner? A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it said there were witnesses to prove anything on the prisoner's behalf? A. No.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did she point any witnesses out? A. No; I did not see Colley there, not to know her; if she had been with the mother I think I must have seen her, but I might have seen her and not noticed her; nobody offered themselves as witnesses; only the mother said she had witnesses to prove he was outside the house at the time, and expressed herself much hurt that they were not called; I told her her son was committed - she was then struck with terror, and said, "What! and call no witnesses for the prisoner! I have a person who will prove he was in the mob;" I have seen Krelle about the streets - I never heard anything against him; I only know him by seeing him about as a neighbour; Krelle said at the Mansion-house that he was one of the crowd outside, and was pushed in by the mob - he did not say he had been speaking to a woman.</p>

            . I am sixteen years old. I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100017"></xptr>known Krelle a good many years intimately; I saw a crowd on the Sunday night opposite Mr. Peckham's door - I was coming through Coleman-street, and in the crowd round the door I saw Krelle; he was eating something - his hands were in his pockets; I said, "Ah! Joseph, how do you do?" - he answered me, and asked how I did; I asked him what was the matter - he said there were thieves in the house; some officers came and stood at the door - I should not know them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, what happened? A. The door went open.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What, while the officers stood there? A. Yes; the officers were outside; I do not know whether the door was broken open, or opened from the inside, but I saw it go open - I was close by in the road near the curb.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How does it happen that you could not see whether it was broken open; you are not very tall? A. Because there was a great crowd before me - about one hundred or one hundred and fifty people stood before me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Before the door opened were there one hundred or one hundred and fifty people? A. There were from two hundred to two hundred and thirty before, and behind me; there were from two hundred to three hundred people.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When the door was opened, did you see a rush of any persons towards it to get in? A. Yes; and at that time I missed Krelle; I had been speaking to him up to the time I saw the rush; I saw the prisoners brought out sometime afterwards, but could not tell who they were; I did not hear who they were till after they were taken to the watch-house; I went to the watch-house- a woman there whom I knew by sight, said Krelle was taken into custody; I said "I do not believe he is, for I saw him standing outside the house, just before the rush."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You went to the watch-house - Did you see the officers there? A. No; one person had a drawn sword in his hand; I did not go in - I did not mention to anybody there, except the woman, that Krelle was outside; it was not the woman who has been examined, it was a very young woman; I have not seen her here.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the people who rushed in turned out? A. About four or five of them came out, and then the door closed.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the people turned out and the door closed, did you see Krelle after that? A. No. I live at No. 3, White's-alley, Coleman-street, with my father and mother; my father is a porter. I did not go to the Mansion-house the next day - my mother was not waiting for me to go; I told her of this directly I got home - she knew Krelle - we were play-fellows together; she would not let me go; she said I should come here if I were subpoened. I work for Mr. Eaton, of Crooked-lane, a fishing tackle maker.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother. On Sunday evening the 23d of March, he came in to tea about seven o'clock; I had not made the tea, and gave him a round of bread and butter, and some cold rice pudding, which we had for dinner - Elizabeth Clementson was in the room, and saw him, and so was my daughter. He staid in the room about ten minutes and then went out. Charles Williams came in in about half an hour and told me he was in custody - I went to the Mansion-house at his examination, and saw Mr. Brand. Witnesses were called for my son, but they were not heard. I told him I had witnesses in attendance; those witnesses were Colley and Williams. -When I was informed my son was in custody I went out as soon as I could find my bonnet. I saw a crowd of people, and made the best of my way to the watch-house: I saw one Lutwich there; he belongs to the watch-house, and is a tax-gatherer; I mentioned that my son had been at home half an hour before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say witnesses were called for your son, what do you mean by that? A They were in readiness to he examined - both Colley and Williams went with me to the Mansion-house; I did not mention to the Lord Mayor, or to the gentleman who sat for him, that I had witnesses, because I thought they would be asked for - I did not know the nature of the business.</p>

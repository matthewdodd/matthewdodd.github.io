            . I am a watch-maker, and live at Brumpton. I was fetched to look at a watch that was offered to sale; the prisoner had it to sell (I had heard a man had lost a watch at Kensington). I asked her how long she had had it; she said she had had it five years and a half; that it was given her by a sailor belonging to the Antelope. I went with her to the Justice; she told him the same story; he committed her to Bridewell; then she called me aside, and said it belonged to one

            . On Wednesday morning, a coachman at my door asked what it was o'clock, I said, about six; said the prisoner, I believe it is not six, for I always carry the time of the day about me, and pull'd the watch out of her pocket, and look'd at it: she offered it to sale to the coachman.</p>

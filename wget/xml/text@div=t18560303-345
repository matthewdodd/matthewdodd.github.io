I hare had a heavy burden with it"—about 11 or 12 o'clock in the morning, Mrs. White came in—she said to the prisoner, "Hannah, where is your baby, and what hare you done with it?"—she said, "It is at No. 23, Crawford-street, across the park"—I said, "Hannah, you have told me contrary to that," with that she burst into tears—she asked me for a new portmanteau, which she had, to fetch the child's clothes—I said if she would fetch the child for my satisfaction, I would nurse it for her—she said she would return with the clothes and the baby—she then left, and I never saw her again until she was in custody.</p>

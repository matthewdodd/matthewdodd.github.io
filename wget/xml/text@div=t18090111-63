            . I am a Thames police constable. On the night of the 31st of December, I was on duty at the West India docks with Pearce, another officer; in going my round a little after ten o'clock, I heard a noise in the lighter, the <placeName id="t18090111-63-crimeloc380">Three Brothers, No. 443; she lay in Limehouse Bason</placeName>

               <p>Q. What was the prisoner Stratton - A. An <rs id="t18090111-63-deflabel381" type="occupation">excise watchman</rs>

               <p>Q. Were there any casks of rum on board - A. Yes; I knew Witsch six years; I asked them if they did not know me; Stratton answered he knew me very well; upon this I left the lighter and bid him good night. It was a moon light night but very cloudy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it sufficiently light from the moon for you to see at some distance - A. Yes; after I had quitted the lighter Pearce and I went behind some paling and secreted ourselves there, where we could see very plain what was doing on the forecastle of the lighter; we had not been watching there ten minutes before I saw Witsch come up from the forescuttle, he handed something to Stratton; Stratton immediately came on shore, he went over the lock gates and walked towards Lime-house; I followed immediately and overtook him, I took him by the collar and told him I must search him, that I suspected he had got something about him that was not legal: upon that he opened his great coat pocket, took out a bladder from his left side and threw it in the bason; I told him he had throwed a bladder in the bason; he said he had not, he insisted upon me letting him go; I told him I would not; he put his foot across and attempted to throw me in the bason; I drew a pistol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110048"></xptr>and told him I would shoot him if he made any resistance; Pearce came up; we gave him in charge of the centinel.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did this take place from the lighter - A. I suppose about thirty yards. After I had put him in custody I saw Witsch come aft, go down below, bring something up and throw it overboard; I took a boat and a light and searched that part of the bason where Stratton had thrown the bladder in; I there found a bladder containing a gallon and a half of rum; this is part of it. I went on board the lighter, there was a great many puncheons of rum on board the lighter; I found a spile in one of the puncheons, the spile was sticking out seven staves from the bung hole; we afterwards took Stratton and Witsch to the round house; Stratton was very earnest for me to let him go; he wished me to keep the rum and to say nothing about it.</p>

            . I am a constable of the West India docks.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 31st of December were you on duty with the last witness - A. Yes. A few minutes after ten in the evening I heard a noise on board the lighter, the Three Brothers, No. 443, the owners names were Drinkall and sons. George, my brother officer, went on board and stood on the foresheets, I remained on the key; the lighter touched the shore; I knew Witsch before, he was a servant of Drinkall and sons; George asked him if he had been bleeding any of them; Witsch answered, d - n you, no; 
               <persName id="t18090111-63-person648">George</persName>
             the officer then came on shore, we left the lighter and secreted ourselves behind an iron gate, commanding a view of the lighter; we looked through the railing, in a few minutes I saw Stratton come over on the lock gates; George ran from me and stopped Stratton, I heard something fall into the water after he had seized Stratton; when I went to George's assistance Witsch went from the fore sheets of the lighter to the stern sheet, went down below, and came up again immediately, he leaned over the quarter of the lighter, near the stern, but I did not see him heave any thing over board.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he able from the situation he was in to lay any thing on the surface of the water - A. Yes; he then went and learned on the pump; I went and searched Witsch, I found only a knife on him; I brought him on shore and gave him in charge of the centinel. I saw George pick up a bladder that was floating on the north side of the bason; we searched the lighter and found a spile in the quarter of a puncheon, sticking out seven staves from the bung hole. As we were taking the prisoners to the watchhouse Stratton told us we knew such things were done, we had no cause to make it so bad without we liked; he wanted for us to take the bladder and let them go; that is all that past. Witsch said nothing, he behaved very well.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 2nd of January did you examine a puncheon of rum, No. 39 - A. I did; I observed a spile in the quarter, seven staves from the bung hole; there would have been no spile put there except there had been a worm hole, and this cask appeared to me to be sound by the guage; I found it had lost the key allowance, from a gallon to a gallon and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find the full contents of No. 39 - A. One hundred and thirty two gallons was what the cask was capable of holding; in it was one hundred and twenty five gallons; that is giving no tenth to the trader; if you give the tenth to the trader it should have another gallon. I guaged No. 30; I found it fifteen gallons deficient.</p>

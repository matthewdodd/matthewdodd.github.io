               <p>Q. How was the man dress that went into the house? - A.Exactly like the prisoner, in a smock frock; I went towards the house when the officer was in the act of handcuffing them together.</p>

             sworn. - I am a City constable: On the 11th of November, Mr. Colebatch came to me in the morning, and in consequence of his request, I went into the Borough, about nine o'clock or a little after, I had a brother officer with me, Mr. Davis; we waited in the Borough for the cart coming, the prisoner was driving it; I let him pass me about twenty yards; I followed the cart, and sent Davis to get a warrant; when I came to the Fishmongers' Alms-houses, at Newington, I missed the cart, and stopped opposite Miles's; the carman was behind the cart about six or seven yards, and the horses knew the door very well; they stopped very naturally at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any call out to the horses to stop? - A. No, none at all; the prisoner came up to the side of his cart, and stopped against a stall where there were some old iron things laid upon a board; Miles's house is in a sort of a garden, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100028"></xptr>there is a wooden bridge to go to the house; on each side of the bridge were benches where he exposed his goods; the prisoner looked over a few articles upon the bench, and after he had done that, he stood a little while, and turned himself towards London again, to see whether he could see any body coming, I suppose; Miles them came up to him, after a little conversation Miles went into his shop, the prisoner followed him, they stopped together about five minutes, and the prisoner came out; I observed him go to the near side of the shafts, and take off a coat, he took it into the shop, he returned, after some time, with the coat upon his arm as he took it in, he staid at one of the stalls about a minute, Miles came out also, and stood by him, and I apprehended them both; then Davis and Collingbourne, another officer, came, and on the right hand, in a little room, upon a round table, I found the ironmongery named in the indictment; I perceived upon the fire some paper burning, but I could not get time enough to take care of it; by that time Mr. Colebatch came and claimed them; there were some deals standing in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no deals moved? - A. No, there were none; we searched the prisoner's lodgings, and, under the bed, found the horse-cloth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What distance were you at the time the cart stopped? - A. I suppose, about a dozen yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that horses will stop upon being spoke to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that the carter had not called to the horses? - A. Yes, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up, was he not bargaining, for some time, for horse steams? - A. He did take up many things.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not take up a pair of horse steams? - A. He might, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in the house? - A. I cannot particularly say, he might be four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not his own great coat that he took out of the cart? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he not tell you he wanted to leave that coat there, because it should not be dirtied with the wheels of the cart? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What money was found upon him-five shillings, was it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the duty of a carter to take home a horse-cloth when it is done with? - A. It may be so</p>

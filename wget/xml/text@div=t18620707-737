On the evening of 16th June, I was called to a disturbance in the Brunswick-road, and saw a man named Nor<lb></lb>man—Pickering came about a minute afterwards—he was near me—I fell down in the struggle, or rather was knocked down, and the prisoner came with a pitchfork and struck my brother constable on the head, saying, "You b—r, I will knock your b—y brains out;" and he ran over to the stable behind—I saw the blow distinctly; I was lying on my back—Norman was lying on my left, and Pickering pulling him—I had observed the prisoner before, and when Norman said God strike him dead, but he would have our b—y lives; we should not take him in custody, the prisoner went and fetched the fork from the stable, and was under my notice three or four minutes before I took him in custody—I had not known him before—Pickering was in the act of pulling Norman off me, when he was struck—this plan represents the place, but there is another little bit of a nook just here, and we laid here; the stables inside form a kind of a square—I am positive of the prisoner; he was the only one stripped—he had neither jacket nor waistcoat on.</p>

I am a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons, of Montague-place, Poplar—on 16th June, between 7 and 8 o'clock, Pickering was brought to my surgery with a lacerated wound about an inch long on the back of his head, and going down to the bone—I dressed it for him—it was quite in the middle of the back of the head—it was such a wound as might be produced by a pitchfork—it was contused and lacerated—it would require a violent blow to produce it—it was not very dangerous—it has incapacitated him from duty up to the present time, but he will be fit for duty again shortly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BEASLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any business in that yard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Alter the attack I walked in, and saw a good many men there—I knew some of the persons up the yard—I saw Norman brought out of the yard by the policemen—I did not come up first at that time—I must have been there before, because I saw them fell before that—they fell at the right-hand stable, and I stood at the left-hand stable, about fifteen yards from them—I saw them all three struggling together—I saw no pitchfork in the yard—the person who threw the stone came in at the right-hand stable, and I was at the left—the man came in, heaved the stone, and ran out into the road again—I caught hold of his coat; but he got among a great many others dressed like him—the gates were afterwards shut for a minute or two—the foreman pushed them all out, and he got the horsekeeper and took him out—I know the prisoner's brother; he is a tall young man—I cannot say whether he assisted the foreman in shutting the gates; it was after she stone was thrown that the gates were closed—I went out at the gate after the man, and after the stone was thrown—the gate was open at that time—I went back into the yard, and the man came and pushed the gates to, violently, so that persons should not interfere with the police and insult them any more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a herbalist, of 1, Brunswick-road—I saw Norman taken in custody—he was between two constables—they went into the stable together—I then saw the shorter policeman of the two, when Norman was going quietly, draw his staff from his pocket: he wielded it right over his head, and struck Norman on the side, who fell, but not to the ground, as they had hold of hire by the collar—I halloed out of the window, "Young gentleman, you shall hear of using that staff unnecessarily hereafter"—he said, "You had better go up and state that to the Judge"—I said, "I shall, and you shall hear me"—after he struck Norman, and went by my window, the girls Butler and Miller, and Mrs. Bussey, went up the road—they were inside Mrs. Sheehan's railings before that, and never came out till after Norman was taken to the station-house, and then they rushed out and gave information; but they never were inside the gates—the gates were shut, and they were never opened till the man was brought out by the police—I was outside my window cleaning it, and I never left it—I cannot say what took place inside the gates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is your house nearly opposite the gate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Within thirty or forty yards of it—my attention was first called when the policeman came past my house—I saw a man with a white jacket—he whispered into the policeman's ear, who then went in at the gates, and he was not in two minutes before they were shut—that was the cause of Norman being taken—it seems he rushed out to challenge Norman to fight—the whole of it did</p>

               <p>not take three minutes—the gates were closed the moment the police went in, and these two girls were inside the fence; even a bullock could not have got inside the fence, let alone two girls.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert McGregor, an engineer, of 10, Brunswick-road—I saw the two girls, Butler and Miller—I was standing at my door with my husband, and saw them inside Mrs. Sheehan's fence—there was a every large crowd—the gates were shut, and they stood there until these men passed up the street with the two policemen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did your husband see it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he is not here—he has had to go to Southampton to repair some engines—he was not before the Magistrate—Mrs. Sheehan's fence is in the front of the house—I was not in the yard—the girls were standing inside the fence at the time the policemen brought the prisoner out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

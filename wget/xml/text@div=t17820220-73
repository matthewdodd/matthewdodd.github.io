               <p>A man came to our shop and asked me to shave him, with a coach harness on his shoulder, he asked me if I knew any body that would buy them, then I went and fetched a man and they could not agree. I said I would take them to a coachman; I met Lealter in Whitechapel, he bid me come home; he said he could not look at them in the street; says I, you are nearer my master's house, and you can speak to the man; says he, bring them to my house;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200089"></xptr> when I came there, he said his brother was not home, he came home soon; he bid me 11 s. I asked him a guinea; I went back to let the man know; I came back and asked him 16 s. He would not give any more than 13 s. I went back again, and the man said I might take 14 s. one shilling for myself, and 13 s. for the harness. The man said, my master gave me two guineas, and I have lost the money. Lealter said, he thought he was imposed on, and had given too much.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Does Lealter usually buy pieces of harness that you went to him?</p>
               <p>No, only I had known him these three or four years, I thought him a proper man.</p>
               <p>Court. I hope the officers of justice will keep an eye upon Mr. Lealter, if he is not more careful he will be brought here himself.</p>

             shaved him, he whispered to him, and he told me this Harris has got something to sell belonging to horses. I said, did this fellow come honestly by them, as I had only seen Harris two or three times. Harris told him his master had given them to him, he had a new carriage and the old harness and things belonged to the servants, he said he had pawned his new buckskin breeches and gamed the money away in the Lottery-office, and now he must wear his new breeches, and must take them out of pawn, therefore he wanted to sell this harness. The prisoner then said, let me fetch one that lives in our neighbourhood to look at them. I told him to go and not stay; he went and fetched one Simons to look at them; he asked 16 s. for them. Harris shewed them to Simons, he said they were not worth so much, so he would have nothing to do with them. Harris said to the prisoner I will leave them with you till tomorrow morning, he said if you get above 14 s. keep it yourself, and if only 14 s. I will give you 6 d. In the afternoon he carried them to Lealter, and shewed them him. I know no further. Harris said he was a coachman belonging to the same stable next the Saracen's Inn, I did not ask him to whom.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you enquire who this gentleman was?</p>
               <p>No, my Lord, his stables was next the Saracen's Inn, his master kept his carriage there; I enquired after the lad was brought into trouble; I went to look after him and he was in prison. I have shaved the prosecutor, I asked him where Harris was; he told me that he came once or twice to clean horses, they said they knew nothing of him, they knew nothing of the lad Harris, but now he knows nothing of him; one is the prosecutor himself. I learned his name was Harris at the Saracen's Head.</p>

               <p>Court. He did not speak it in a whisper, but spoke out loud? - There was no whispering at all; and Harris told him he should have something for his trouble. Then the prisoner fetched one Simons, he came with him, and they could not agree; I do not know what he asked; Harris asked the prisoner to shew them to any body else; after his business was done he went with the harnesses; Harris left them with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200090"></xptr> prisoner to sell for him; he brought them home again; Thursday morning the prisoner took them out again. Whilst the prisoner was out, Harris came for the money, the prisoner came home and gave it him.</p>
               <p>What was Harris? - An hostler; he said he worked for the George Inn, in Fenchurch-street; he said his master had got a new coach and the harness was his.</p>
               <p>What master, the master of the George Inn? - I don't know; he said he would not have sold them, but he lost his money in the lottery time; he said he wanted to buy him a pair of boots and a pair of breeches; he said his master gave him money to buy them, but he had lost it in the lottery. The prisoner is no relation; I am journeyman to my brother; he was by, we were all shaving the customers; he spoke loud, he did not whisper; my brother could hear well enough himself; he told me in the hearing of my brother that he belonged to the George Inn.</p>

On the 20th of October I let the prisoner a house for a week or ten days until he could suit himself with another. He came to me a few days after, and wanted to borrow a pair of scales that were in the shed, but I refused; a few days after, I missed them - he still remained in the house. I sent a man to say if he did not return them, I should get a warrant against him, and he said he would. I found them at an auction room in Brown's-lane. Just as I was leaving the room the prisoner came in, and said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want here?" I said I would let him know - Haynes, the auctioneer, refused to give them up unless I prosecuted him; the locks and other fixtures were stolen from the house. I could not get him out of the house, and applied to the Magistrate, who said he could do nothing it, and that I must indict the prisoner if I did not like his decision.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long have you been out of gaol - A. I was in gaol about two years ago. I did not lend him the scales, or carry them to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell the officer not to take the prisoner, that you might say he ran away - A. I said if he would quit the house I would not trouble him.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Haynes, who is a broker, and has an auction room in Brown's-lane. The prisoner brought the scales for sale, and I advanced him 6 s. 6 d. on them; he bought them in several times, and said he would have them back as soon as he got money - he paid 4 s. 6 d. in part, and after that Howis came and claimed them.</p>

            . I am a potatoe merchant. Howis had a pair of scales in his shed; I went to borrow them of him, but he said he had sold them to a man, who wanted to sell them again, and took me to the prisoner's house. The man, whom I think was the prisoner, said they were not at home, and I borrowed some others.</p>

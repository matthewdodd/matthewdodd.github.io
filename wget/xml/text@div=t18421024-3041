                  </hi>. I am a woollen warehouseman in Addle-street. On the 13th of May Shackleford came to my warehouse—he pre<lb></lb>sented a card with a reference to Mr. Bachelard, in George-street, Man<lb></lb>sion-house; "R. W. Beaumont, of Week-street, Maidstone," was on the card—he said he wished to purchase goods of me—he said he was about opening a shop at Maidstone—he said the shop was taken, and he wanted some goods—I did not see him write the name of the referee—I promised to go to Bachelard—I went there that day—I saw him, and he said he knew Beaumont, that he had about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the business, and his wife had some property in houses in Sloane-street—I was satisfied of the solvency of Beaumont, from the account be gave me—Shackleford looked out goods that day, part woollen goods, and part trowsers—they amounted to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they were sent to the Swan-with-two-Necks, by his direction—my porter, James Steel, took them—I will not say how they were ad<lb></lb>dressed—on the day after, there was another parcel to the amount of 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he paid my salesman 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 13th, and in all he paid 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—106<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the balance remaining due—the witness came to me from Mumford's and Patey's for a reference—I was induced to give a satisfactory account of Beaumont, by having a reference myself, and being paid part of my account.</p>

               <p>me every evening whether they wanted me, then I did what was wanted, and looked in again—I knew nothing of them previous to the 11th of June—there were four or five mats in the cellar which had had furniture packed in them—I did not see matting round the furniture—I was the only servant in the house—I was cook—there was a woman there on the first Saturday—I set up grocer again as soon as I could get a situation—I am not a grocer on my own account—Gosbell did not continue in the house so long as Mr. Beaumont—Goshell did not leave directly after Mr. Mum<lb></lb>ford came down—I do not recollect his leaving till one Friday afternoon, which must have been the latter end of July.</p>

            . At half-past six o'clock in the morning of the 27th of June, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Fowl's, with the picture on his shoulder; I went and gave information - Dorrell came out and pursued him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DORRELL. I am a brush-maker, and live in the same house as Stephens - she came and told me what she saw; I pursued the prisoner, and took him with this picture; I said, "I suppose you have been to a sale" - he said Yes; he appeared confused, and I took him back.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that a man had employed him to carry the painting from the house - saving that he was fearful it would be seized for rent, and had promised to follow him.</p>

I am a clerk in the service of the United Kingdom Electric Telegraph Company, Limited—they have offices at Gresham House—the prisoner was engaged there as the cleaner of the offices—I missed several things from the offices—I do not myself know of the towels named in the indictment—the pair of compasses were taken from the secretary's offices—I had not missed the candlestick until it was produced by the officer—I then recognised it as belonging to the Company—we had had gas put up some time since, and had not used the candlestick—these tin boxes were afterwards produced—the glasses we had in, no doubt, from somewhere, and as they were missing, we paid for them—they were discovered in pawn—I missed this stile; it has a wooden handle with an agate point—we were con<lb></lb>tinually missing stationery of the description produced—I had no idea that these were lost until they were shown by the officers—these knives are</p>

               <p>marked with Purssell's name; we had lunch sent in from there, and had to pay for them—here is a brush, which we had made expressly for cleaning the instruments—I had not missed them before, but here are two terminal points that we had made expressly—they form part of the galvanic battery; they are for securing the ends of the wires—this note paper has the Company's heading on it—we have lost a very large quantity of it—here is a letter clip which resembles one that; we lost—these four boxes I can swear positively to; they are sent from Germany, containing a peculiar ink for use in the instruments—here is an inkstand which resembles one we lost some time since—I cannot identify it beyond that.</p>

I went to the prisoner's lodging, in Eldon-street, Finsbury, on, I believe, 22d January—I saw her there—I asked her whether she worked at the offices belonging to the Gresham Com<lb></lb>pany—she said, "Yes"—I told her she was suspected of having in her pos<lb></lb>session things belonging to the United Kingdom Electric Telegraph Company—she said, "Nothing that I am aware of"—I told her I must search the place—I found a pair of compasses, a brush, these brass instruments, this stille, some sealing-wax, these boxes, some paper marked "United Kingdom Electric Telegraph Company, Old Broad-street, Limited," a candlestick, the fitting of a galvanic battery, and a paper stand—after a farther search I found a quantity of china cups and saucers, tumblers, wine glasses, knives and forks, marked, "Tom's coffee-house," and "Purssell's, Cornhill"—the prisoner said the paper was left her by her late husband—I asked her how long he had been dead—she said four years, but upon examining the water-mark, I found it to be 1862—I found also some thirty or forty duplicates, and among them those relating to the glasses and towels.</p>

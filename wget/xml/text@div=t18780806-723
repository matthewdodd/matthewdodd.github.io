I am a watchmaker, of 84, St. John Street Clerkenwell—on 18th June I locked up the premises about 10 o'clock, and afterwards went to bed—about 2.30 a.m. I was awoke, came down, and saw three men in the garden going from the premises—everything in the shop was upset and removed but nothing was taken away—the back shutters had been broken from the outside.</p>

On 19th June I was on duty with Dyke in Rawstorne Street about 4.30, and saw some one on the roof of an out<lb></lb>building in St John Street Road—I should not know the man's face again—I left Dyke there, went round into St. John Street, and saw the prisoner in Mr. Varney's yard, 50 yards from where I had seen the man—I jumped over seven or eight walls and followed him to an empty house, when I found him in the first-floor front room—he jumped out at the first-floor window, and I looked out and saw him and Inspector Oliver struggling.</p>

On 18th June about 3 a.m. I ex<lb></lb>amined the prosecutor's house, and found a window broken, and a panel cut out of the shutters—I found footprints in the back yards of the adjoining houses, and a jemmy in one of the gardens, which I took to the house, and found it exactly corresponded with the shutters—I followed up the marks at the back, and they led to where the prisoner was first seen, where I found a rope hanging—a number of footmarks led to where the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

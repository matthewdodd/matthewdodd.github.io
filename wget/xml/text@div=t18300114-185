My money was on the end of the mangle on the 2nd of January; I had laid it there a few minutes before; my wife was in the shop, and I went into the back room; the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for half a pint of beer, and while my wife drew it, he took the 8s. 6d. - I did not see him take it; I went to the door - my wife went into Brick-lane and brought him back.</p>
               <p>REBECCA AGGUS. I am the prosecutor's wife. The prisoner came into my shop, and the instant he was gone, I missed the 8s. 6d. which my husband had laid down for me to go to market - I took the prisoner in Brick-lane, about thirty yards from our shop; he had had half a pint of beer - I had not seen him before, but am certain he is the person; the officer found some money on him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner; I asked him if he had any money - he said, Yes, and pulled out 4s. 6d. some halfpence, some Spanish liquorice, and a ring; I said, "Is that all you have about you?" he said Yes, but I found 3s. more in his gloves.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Had he time to have bought the liquorice and ring? A. Yes, I think he had; I am quite sure the prisoner is the boy who was in the shop - here are two sixpences I can swear to; I had paid some money to the coke-house the day before, and they had been refused.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The officer did not ask if I had any more money; I had been out all day selling things about the street - my mother gave me 6s. in the morning, and I was going to take my basket home at night.</p>

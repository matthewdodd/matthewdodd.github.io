I said, D - n you, you have picked my pocket; upon which she dropped the money out of her hand into Jones's. I then caught hold of Jones's hand, and held them both till the watchman came up; then Jones dropped the money in the kennel. I saw it fall; I had six guineas and a half. The watchman picked up three guineas; we could not find any more. I then counted my money, and said; I missed a half guinea; upon which Sturgess stooped down, and laid down half a guinea; I saw it between her finger and thumb. I took it up, then I counted my money again, and said, I missed three guineas more. The watchman took charge of them. I believe they were not searched; for the watchman said, there was no occasion to search them, for they could swallow a guinea or two upon such an occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Whale. I was quite sober; I spent part of the evening at Leaden-hall. It being late when this affair was over. I did not go to my lodging, but staid the rest of the night in the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a watchman in St. Dunstan's parish; at half an hour past twelve at night, I saw the prosecutor with the prisoner about three yards out of the city, in Little Shire-lane; the prosecutor charged the prisoner with robbing him. I saw three guineas picked out of the kennel, and then half a guinea; the prosecutor then counted his money, and said, he missed half a guinea; I said, that was picked up; then he counted his money again, and said, he had lost three guineas more, and that he had in all fifteen pounds. He was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Did any such familiarities pass between you as to make it possible for the money to drop out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No; my breeches slap was unbuttoned, but the waistband was not; it was not possible it should drop out. Sturgess was pretty nimble with her fingers.</p>
               <p>Sturgess' Defence.</p>
               <p>I am not guilty at all; I was going through Temple Bar with the other prisoner, Jones; she asked me to drink with her; we met the prosecutor with two women in white cloaks, who were singing to him; he came up to us, and unbuttoned his breeches, and the money fell out of his pocket; he said, we should not stoop to pick it up; the watchman came by, and they picked up three guineas; then he said, he had lost half a guinea more, and he stooped, and picked that up.</p>
               <p>Jones' Defence.</p>
               <p>I am not guilty of the crime alledged to me; I know nothing of it; the man was very much in liquor; he fell asleep in the watch-house; we asked him to search us; he would not; he said, there was no occasion for it.</p>

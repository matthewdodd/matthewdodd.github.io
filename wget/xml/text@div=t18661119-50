I am an auctioneer, of the Market Place, Peterborough—I came to London on Tuesday afternoon, the 23rd October, and next evening went to King's Cross, intending to return home—I left my inn, as I thought, at half-past eight, and when I got to King's Cross I found it was only twenty-five minutes to nine, which very much surprised me, but I found afterwards that the inn clock was fast, and that it was a</p>

I am a constable of the Great Northern Railway at King's Cross—on Wednesday, 24th October, I was on duty about half-past eight—Swallow spoke to me, and Bevis came up and asked him whether he was going to Glasgow—he said no; he was going by the Edinburgh mail—she said that she came from Glasgow, and she should like to go there—he said, "Well, you had better go then; you have half an hour before the train goes"—he turned round and walked away, and she followed him—I saw no more of them at that time—I am quite sure she is the woman—I had not seen her before—she was close under two gas<lb></lb>lamps—she came up facing us, and I am sure of her—I was shown several women in a room at the police-station on 31st October, and recognised her at once.</p>

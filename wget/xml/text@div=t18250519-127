On the 18th of May I sent my daughter up to the bed-room, and heard her talking to a stranger; I went up and saw the prisoner coming down stairs, and asked what she had been doing; she said she had been looking for Mrs. Jenkins, a lodger in our house; I said no such person lived there, and I was fearful she had been doing wrong; she kept going down stairs, and said, "I have not injured you." I went up to the linen chest, and immediately missed the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth 30 s., and called to one of my young people - I followed her, and she was brought back; I am sure she is the woman: I do not know how she got in, unless the private door was left open by accident. I had seen the things in their places an hour before; she had moved them from the drawers.</p>

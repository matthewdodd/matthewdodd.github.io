                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, living at 16, Paul-street, Lisson-grove. On Sunday morning, 19th September last, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was looking out of my front window, and saw four or five of these men standing at the door of 21, Paul-street—presently sergeant Thorne came up and said, "Now, lads, go in"—they said, "We will presently"—I could hear every word—I came down, and went to my own door—he gave Farrington a shove, and shoved him into the passage of 20—Farrington came out—Thorne caught hold of him by the collar, and they both went out on the pavement—the sergeant's hat fell off in the road—a woman came and picked up the hat, and went across the road with it—another policeman came and ran across the road, and got hold of his hat, aud said, "All right, I have got your hat"—Farrington and the others then all went in doors, and shut the door—when they shut the door the sergeant and the other policeman came up and stood at the door with a staff in his hand for four or five minutes, one on each side, and the door was not opened—then both of them walked away out of the street altogether—it was after 1 o'clock, I think, when they came back again with seven or eight of them together—they stood on the opposite side of the way, with their backs to the wall, and had some conversation among themselves; and presently one went up to the public-house door aud pulled the bell, and apparently got no answer, and he stood just for a moment—then he pulled it suddenly—he got no answer—he came up and joined the men again—he said, "That is the door, and I insist upon breaking that door"—that was one of the policemen, I do not know which—he pointed to the door of 21—they got their staves out and walked across the road—they went up to the door and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> it light open, and the screws were torn out—I saw it in the morning when I went to help Quinn put it up again—Quinn is the landlord of the house—I saw no more—I did not see what happened in doors until I saw Farrington taken out—they took him out and laid him on his back on the pavement—then they went in again and brought Henley—I did not do anything then—I did not go near them—I thought perhaps I should get in for it if I went near them—they brought out Henley and left him one side of Farrington—some one of the policemen said, "We had better have the stretcher and carry him along;" and one said, "No, take the Irish b—and drag him along;" and they dragged him along—his legs kept dragging along—they laid Henley by the side of Farrington, and carried him along as well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there no stretcher for them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was not—my wife is a laundress, and I had been out late with some work, and came home and had some supper after 1 o'clock—I could not help it, being late—when Thorne came up first I was at my own window—he went up to Far<lb></lb>rington—I had been looking at them a quarter of an hour before—there were five or six of them altogether—they were standing between 21 and 20, just at Quinn's door—I heard Thorne desire them to go in, plainly—he shoved Farrington into the passage—Farrington came out again, and went up to the sergeant—the sergeant caught hold of him by the collar—I did not see Farrington do anything—the hat fell off when he got hold of Farrington and pulled him out on the pavement—I do not know what Farrington went up to him for—I saw a woman pick the hat up, and then I saw a policeman come—I do not know which—he ran very quick across the road—he took the hat from the female—I know Thorne—he and the policeman</p>

               <p>stood at the door, one on each side, when Henley and Farrington and the others had gone inside—they stood with their staves in their hands, keeping guard for about five minutes—after that they went away—they were away about half an hour—I thought I should see no more of them—I did not see Quinn while his door was being broken open—I saw him at the beginning of the affair—I was standing at my own door when the door was broken open—I did not say a word while they were breaking it open—it did not take them very long—I do not know how long; it was not very long, I can assure you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BEST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it take as long to break it open as you have been examined here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It could not take all that time—the footway was not very wide, and Farrington had his back close to the door, and the sergeant pushed him right in—he stood just on the footway of the door—he came out on the pavement, and the sergeant caught him by the collar—I did not see the police far down the street after this was over, just round the corner and then they were out of my sight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sister to Henley the prisoner—I live at 21, Paul-street, Lisson-grove. On Sunday morning, 19th September, my brother was at home—he was at home from. 17th September, with his shoulder hurt—he was quite sober—the following day was Saturday—he laid in bed the whole of that day—at 10 o'clock at night, a friend and his wife came to see him, and they remained for some time till about a quarter past 12—my brother came down-stairs, and I lighted them down-stairs, and put the candle on the landing—when he came back the men that stood at the door asked him how he came to hurt his shoulder—he was telling them, and the policeman came by and gave Farrington a bard blow and knocked him down: and Henley went up-stairs, and I went with him—we came into the room—a few minutes afterwards Farrington came up and knocked at the door—we were having some supper—he asked my sister for some water to wash himself, as he was all over blood—that young woman's name was Ann Brassell—he washed himself, and we sat down to supper—some time after, we heard a noise down-stairs—we all sat in the room, and the policemen rushed into the room, aud gave my brother the first blow on his eyebrow, and knocked him down, and broke the chair that was under him—they knocked Far<lb></lb>rington down—both the chairs were broken—the table was thrown down with the candle on it—the supper was upset and trodden under foot—I lighted the candle and said, "I should like to take some of their numbers"—police<lb></lb>man 228 gave me a punch on the eye, and called me very low language, and he said if I came near him again, he would take my liver out of me—I was hallooing "Murder," and he said if I kept on he would have my life, and I begged him to leave my life for I was left with one child and a widow—I ran out of our door and opened the front door, and hallooed "Murder"—they dragged Farrintgon down-stairs by the head, and my brother by the two legs, and they bumped his bead on every stair as they went—I know he was lifeless—they dragged him out in the street, and then they jumped on him—they dragged him on the ground—they dragged him a little further into the next street, and stripped off his coat and shirt, and left his inside flannel on—this was Henley—I said if they undressed him so he would never be alive again—I felt very bad, and I turned home—as I turned home I met Farrington with two policemen dragging him along—I said what a murder it was to do like that—they said, if I did not get away, they would take me and lock me up—I returned home again, and the policeman came to search my room afterwards—I lay on the bed with my clothes</p>

               <p>on, and the same policeman held the candle over me and said he should like to set fire to me and burn me—this took place after the disturbance in the house—he said he had lost a lantern, and I said if it was there they should have it, but he did not find it there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Paul-street, and have done for three weeks. On Sunday morning, 19th September, I was in the bed-room, folding up clothes—it was something past 12 o'clock, and Farrington came into the room with blood on him, and asked for some water to wash it off—I took the candle and went down-stairs into the wash-house, and drew a jug of water—when I came out again I saw a man in the passage who knocked the candle out of my hand, and then jumped on a fruit-man's barrow, and then jumped over the wall—I came up-stairs, went into the back room, and Miss Henley dropped into the front room for some supper—sitting down at supper, a room full of police rushed in, without knocking at the door; and when I came out to the door Henley was bleeding on the floor, just as if a man was in a slaughter-house—Henley's two sisters were in the supper-room with him, and Farrington—I came out of the back room—before this took place I had not heard any conversation in the passage—I was not down-stairs at the time, I was up-stairs—the two rooms join together—the stairs are quite convenient to the two rooms, stepping out of the room on to the stairs—I did not hear any shouting up the stairs—they pulled Farrington out by the collar, and pulled out Henley by the legs with his hands up, and his head went bump against the steps for fourteen steps—they pulled him along the passage, using low language—I never heard such language in my life, and did not think any men would express such language except they were drunk—it was the police used the language—they got him down the passage, and drew him along the pavement a good distance, then they took off his jacket and his shirt, and undressed him, leaving his flannel about his neck and his arm bound—then they put him on a stretcher and took him to the station-house.</p>

               <p>place—I never found out who that was—it was not one of the police—he had a white flannel jacket—he rushed along the passage to the street-door, stepped on a fruit barrow, and jumped over the wall—he pushed the door in violently—I saw that—he ran through the passage and knocked the jug out of my hand—he did not knock me down—he jumped over the wall into the next yard, and I saw nothing more of him—I told them in the house—I never enquired afterwards who it was, and never found out—Farrington came in with blood on his face—that was before the man rushed through the passage—the blood was running down Parrington's face—I did not see any police in the passage at that time—I think it was a little after 12 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Paul-street, Lisson-grove. On Sunday morning, 19th September, I was there—I was passing through out of the yard with a light in my hand, and it was knocked out of my hand by the police, who were rushing past and going up the stairs—they were coming from out of the street and going up the stairs to the first floor back—they were going through the passage from the front door—I did not hear anything take place before this at the front door—when the police were making a noise at the door I was in bed, but I got up as I was coming to see what was the matter—the candle was knocked out of my hand—I live in a cottage at the back of the yard—I went into my own place again and got a light—when I came back again they were dragging Farrington down the stairs—when they got him to the bottom of the stairs, the policeman beat him across the legs with his staff, and I said, "Good God, don't commit murder"—only one policeman beat him—they dragged him out into the street, and when I returned to see who the young man was, I did not know him being in such a state of blood—he was quite a stranger, I said—they turned his head up, and I said,"Oh good God, I don't know the young man at all"—when I returned, they were dragging John Henley down the stairs—there were four policemen doing that—he had his arms up—they took him out of the bouse and took him away—I did not follow them—I went up-stairs and the policeman came up afterwards and took the fire irons away—they took the poker from the back room, but it was perfectly straight then—I could not swear which policeman it was; I do not know his number; I was too much frightened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in St. Martin's-lane. The prisoner was in my employ—on the 14th of March in consequence of circum<lb></lb>stances, I gave information to the police to watch—about nine o'clock the policeman brought the prisoner into my shop with four pieces of mutton—three pieces were taken from his hat, and one was buttoned up in his coat—I had not authorized him to take them—it was my meat.</p>

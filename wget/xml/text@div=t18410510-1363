Between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning of the 16th of March, the prisoners came into the shop—Price asked to look at some ribbons—she bought a yard of pink satin at 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave her change—they went away together, and I then missed this printed wonted cloth, which I had seen safe on the side-counter half a minute before they came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and live in Corporation-row—the prisoner was in my service. On the 20th of Nov. I charged him with robbing me—he said he had not done so—I put my hand into his waist<lb></lb>coat pocket, and found almost 2dwts. of silver cuttings, and I saw him drop some silver, in going to the station, which corresponded with what he had to use—these boxes are such as enamel is kept in.</p>

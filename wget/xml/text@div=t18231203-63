            . I am porter at the Star, public-house. On the 6th of May, about half-past nine o'clock at night, I came in; Rose was there, rather the worse for liquor; the prisoner sat in the opposite side of the same box. Rose was taken sick. I took him into the yard, and, at the same time, Norton gave me a shove, and took Rose's watch out of his pocket. I could not follow him, because I was holding Rose - my master went after him, but could not find him; he never returned to the house. I knew him before.</p>

               <p>I am an officer; on the 16th of April about six o'clock in the evening, I was coming along Petticoat-lane Whitechapel, I met the prisoner with a basket on his shoulder, I had some suspicion seeing something rather round that there was something there more than tools, I asked him what he had got there? he said what is that to you? it is my own property; I said it is to me and I shall see it, he said I should not, however I pulled it off his shoulder, and on the top of the tools I found this large pewter dish and this copper cover, they were covered over with this green coat that they should not be seen; says I, my friend where did you bring this from? says he, I brought them from my own house at Snow-hill; and where do you mean to take it to? says I; to Snow-hill again, says he; says I, I don't think you give a good account of them, and if you cannot give a better account you must go before the magistrate. I got him into the public house before we went into the office where we keep the prisoners, and there he told me that he had been at work for Mrs. Carpenter; I went to Mrs. Carpenter and found he had been at work there, says I, have you missed any pewter dishes? she went round and she said I miss a pewter dish off my salt pan, and a copper cover from my pot. (The dish and cover deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were some taylors drinking in the house and I was drinking with them, and we drank pretty freely, and we got to sky-larking, and I did not like it, and I had some beer to myself; one of the taylor's came to me at last and said, carpenter you had better take your basket and go home, not knowing what was in it, when I went home I took my basket and did not know what was in it no more then of my dying moment; accordingly I was going home and two men met me as I was going home, and they asked me what I had got in my basket? and they took me away directly and locked me up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character.</p>

This sovereign was in a box in my bed-room; I missed three within about a fortnight - the prisoner slept in the same bed with me; I spoke to Mr. North, my master, about it, and he marked four sovereigns: on the 23rd of November, in the evening; I got up first in the morning, and went into the shop - I returned afterwards, and missed one sovereign; I always missed one at a time - I named it to my employer; he got an officer, and the sovereign was found in the prisoner's box, with the mark on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long was he in your master's employ? A. About two months; I never quarrelled with the prisoner - his principles were rather different to mine; I corrected him when he used to swear - we never went to blows; his box was kept in the same room as mine - I left the key in my box, as I always did, and after the money was marked I wished to ascertain how it went; I generally went to bed after the prisoner - I do not know where the key of his box was kept.</p>

            . In consequence of what Gee told me I marked four sovereigns; I did not see Gee put them into his box - I know this to be one of the sovereigns I marked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were not present at any part of the transaction? A. I went up stairs with the Policeman; the prisoner took the key out of his pocket, and I think opened the box himself - he took out two trays; the Policeman began to search the bottom of the box - the prisoner said, "I have only one sovereign," and produced it; I believe it is his first offence.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did they quarrel together? A. No, except on religious questions; the prosecutor appears very religious, and the prisoner quite different.</p>

                  </hi>. I deal in furniture. The prisoner was in my service in May last—I discharged him on the 9th of Aug.—last Friday week I was attending a police office—the prisoner was there, making a demand of some property, in consequence of which I proposed to accompany him to his lodging, which is at Mr. Redman's, in Church-street, Deptford, to see the property—I there saw the property named in this indictment, and many other things which I supposed were mine, but I could not say positively—I gave these in charge to the officer—seeing my handwriting on these three brushes, I asked if they were his—he said that all in the room was his, and the three brushes he had of Mr. Carter, of Woolwich—I think the next article we came to was the plane, which I think was in one of his boxes—I saw my handwriting on it, and asked him where he got that—he said he bought it at a shop in Deptford—this plane I had marked, and put by in the Spring—he gave me no account of where he bought these knives and forks at the time, nor yet of the mats—this pillow he gave to Mr. Redman, but it was not in the room at the time—I had these three brushes in my possession at the time he was in my service—I cannot tell whether I had ever parted with them—I sell brushes—I keep a general furnishing ware-house—this plane I can swear has never been sold—it has my mark on it, and it was put away—these knives and forks I have never sold a dozen—these have never been sold from my ware-house—they have the maker's name on them—I have a dozen dessert to match them—they corre<lb></lb>spond with what were in my stock, and I missed a dozen—I never sold any of this class of knives, and I had them when he was in my service—this pillow has my handwriting on it—I cannot say that I never sold it—I never sold it to him—this plane and the table-mats I can swear were mine, and never sold—the mats have no mark, but what is rather out of the common way, they are lined with old baise—I bought them in this state, and have the fellows of them in my pocket—I lost nine from my stock, and six of them were found at the prisoner's lodging—I never sold them.</p>

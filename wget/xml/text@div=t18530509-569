                  </hi>. In Jan. last, I was cook in the service of Mr. Hart, of Gloucester-place, Hyde-park. The prisoner was housemaid there—she had been two months in the service to the very day—Mr. Hart has left England—we had a nursery maid, named Frances M'Clowry, and a ladies' maid, named Harriet Mitchell—Mr. Hart is a widower, but his mother lived with him—the nursery maid and ladies' maid have left England for Australia—on Thursday, 27th Jan., the prisoner did not come down to dinner; I was not in the house at the time, but I was told so—after dinner, I went of to her room, about half past 2 or a quarter to 3 o'clock—Dr. Galindo went up with me—he had been sent for; I met him at the door when I came home—I found the prisoner lying on the bed—Harriet Mitchell, the ladies' maid, was in the room at the time, sitting on a stool by the fire—she had a child in her lap; it was alive—she showed me the child, and showed me a wound in the child's throat—it was bleeding—I do not think I spoke to the prisoner then; she was very much excited, and in a great deal of pain—I went down and got her some gruel or a cup of tea about an hour afterwards—I took it up to her—I did not then take the child in my arms; I took it in my arms in the evening—I asked the prisoner why she deceived us, meaning why she had not told us that she was in the family way (she had not told me)—she said, "Oh, Bruford! I knew not what I was doing; I meant to hare thrown the child into the Serpentine, and myself too"—she was very much excited at the time—nothing more passed then—I remained with her about an hour—I went up to her afterwards when the monthly nurse came, but I had no other conversation with her that evening—the next day, Friday, the nursery maid showed me a pair of scissors; I observed that they were stained with blood—I had undressed the prisoner on the Thursday as she lay on the bed; she had all her things on—Dr. Galindo was present at the time—her clothes were very much stained with blood, and there was blood about the room—she was removed to the workhouse on the following Monday evening with the child—the monthly nurse attended her during the time she remained at Mr. Hart's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon; I formerly lived in Conduit-street, Westbourne-terrace. On 27th Jan., I was called to Mr. Hart's, and saw the prisoner there lying on the bed in her room—she was not undressed, to the best of my recollection—I ascertained by examining her that she had recently been delivered of a child—I took the after-birth from her—the umbilical cord seemed as if it had been cut; about four inches of it was left</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185305090028"></xptr>
               <p>attached to the child—I found the child in the room; it was a newly born child—I observed a wound in the front of the neck, about three inches long—it was not a clean cut wound, but jagged, serrated—I think it could have been done by a pair of scissors, in the usual mode of applying scissors when you want to cut anything—I do not think it would have made a clean cut, not on cartilaginous matter like that—the windpipe was cut transversely; the fore part of it only was cut—it appeared to be a full grown child; it was a boy—the prisoner was in a fainting state—I continued to attend her and the child until the following Monday—I saw her two <hi rend="italic">or</hi> three times a day—I dressed the child's wound, and did what was necessary with respect to that—she was removed to the workhouse on the Monday, and the child with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you say the child was a full grown child, I suppose you do not mean it had gone the entire nine months: it might be a fortnight or three weeks, more or less? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might be, because some children are larger and some smaller—I took it to be a nine months' child; it might be eight months and a half—I have not a very extensive practice in midwifery—I know that labour constantly comes on suddenly, very often in sleep—a fall down stairs would be likely to accelerate the birth—I should say, from the appearance of the wound, it must have been produced by cutting—there is no doubt that a woman suddenly taken with the pains of labour would be very much embarrassed, and would have great difficulty in delivering herself—in a natural delivery, the head is usually first presented—the disease called milk fever does not come on at the time of the birth, generally two or three days afterwards—it may be preceded by a great deal of nervous irritation—I found no appearance of any injury about the prisoner's person—it occasionally happens in deliveries, that the umbilical cord crosses the neck; the applica tion of the finger would relieve it—that is what I should do; a woman, to relieve herself, might have recourse to an instrument—it is not impossible that in doing so the throat might be cut, although the cord was cut four inches from the navel; the child might have been bent on itself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a nurse in the workhouse at Paddington.

                  </hi>. I am a physician, and am medical officer for the parish of Paddington. I advised that as soon as she was able, the prisoner should be removed to the workhouse—I attended her there after her removal—I noticed a wound in the child's neck, but at the time I taw it, it was four or five days afterwards, consequently cicatrisation had commenced, so that I cannot speak to the exact character of the wound originally—the child died on 10th Feb.—I presume it died from the effect of the wound—a variety of effects would result from the wound which would probably be fatal—I examined the body internally; every organ was healthy and sound—-in my judgment, the wound was sufficient to cause death.</p>

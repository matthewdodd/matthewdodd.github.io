I saw Patey on 5th March, in White Friars Street—I followed him, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>!"—he turned round, and I said to him, "James Patey is your name?"—he said, "No, you are wrong"—I said, "I believe I am right, your name is Patey, and you live in White Friars"—he said that his name was George Cuthbert Graham, and he lived in Flynn Street, Blackfriars Road—I told him I should take him for being concerned with others in stealing thirteen rods of yellow metal or brass on 12th Feb. from a barge lying off Mr. Vivian's wharf—he said that he knew nothing about it—I took him to the station, and he gave the same name—I searched him, and found on him a dupli<lb></lb>cate of a handkerchief with the name of James Patey on it—he said, "You are right, that is my name; it is no use struggling any further; you cannot blame me for having a fight for it"—on Tuesday, 3rd March, I saw Humphreys I should think about five minutes' walk from Battersea Bridge—I asked him who he sold his brass to—he said that he did not deal in brass, but chiefly in rags and iron, and the only brass that he had sold was about 7 lbs. that he sold to Frost in Clerkenwell; that was the only dealings he had with brass lately, but he sold some about three years ago to Pontifex.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk to Edward Rudd and others, trading under the name of Vivian and Son. On 13th Feb. we consigned to our agent at Rotterdam 300 bars—I have seen the bars produced here today—I find on them the initials that were on our's—this is our brass—the price of this metal is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound; it is sold for bolting together the timbers of a ship—those consigned to Rotterdam were three quarters of an inch—these produced are the same size—our order was for 300 three quarters of an inch.</p>

               <p>I went after them; about 8 o'clock that night I was told they had been there again; they went to a place where I get my living, and went to the foreman, and asked where I lived; I heard they had gone up the court, and I went and found them, and said to the officer, "Do you want me?" he said, "No," and he called me several names; I hit him, and he said, "Go along about your business;" I said that I would not; about 11 o'clock that night the officer and four or five passed me, and he said, "That is one of them," and I was taken; this man who gave evidence against me gets his living by nothing else but thieving; he gets all the evidence he can, to get money—is it likely I should tell him that I committed a crime, who I never spoke to in my life?

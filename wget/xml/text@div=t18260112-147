In consequence of some direction from Limbrick, and some knowledge of a person named Davis, I went to the Coventry-cross, public-house, ine Ptticoat-lane, on the 28th of November; I saw the prisoner outside the house, with a whip in his hand; he clapped his hand on my shoulder and said "You are the man I have been well recommended to, and if you will stop here while I put up my horse and cart, I will let you know what I mean;" I waited for his return, and we went to the Bunch of Grapes, about 100 yards off, because he said there were various people in the Coventry-cross, who knew him, and he did not like to deal there; he called for a quartern of gin, and a man named Yates had part of it; the prisoner said he undersood I came after things, by which I understood bad money - but when we came to understand one another, I said I did not like to deal with a stranger, as I had been done out of 4s.; he said if I commenced dealing with him I should always find he would deal in an upright manner, as he supposed I would with him; I told him if I found he was a person of that sort I had no objection to deal with him; he told me to go back to the Coventry Cross and wait for his return; he said"You cannot deal with Sam now, commence dealing with me;" he asked what amount I wanted; I said three score - meaning three score of bad shillings; he said he would bring me any amount I wanted. I saw him several times afterwards till the <rs id="t18260112-147-cd834" type="crimeDate">19th of December</rs>
                  <join result="offenceCrimeDate" targOrder="Y" targets="t18260112-147-off832 t18260112-147-cd834"></join> - on that day, about five o'clock in the evening, I saw Limbrick, Brown, Edwards, and Patterson - Limbrick searched me in their presence, and gave me two half-crowns and eleven shillings, in good money; I went to the prisoner's house, No. 17, <placeName id="t18260112-147-crimeloc835">Goulston-street, Goulston-square</placeName>

I saw the prisoner in his own room; I sat down, and he asked me how much I wanted - I told him three score; he said his wife was gone to see his mother; he put on his hat, then put his hand to his pocket and said he had not got enough, and I gave him two half-crowns and 3s.; he then left me in the room with the child, and returned in about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes; he then put down this paper parcel on the table and said, "Put that in your pocket - it is all right;" I gave him the rest of the money in shillings, and took the parcel; Patterson was outside at this time, and saw me go in; if he staid where I left him he could see the prisoner go out; when I came out I saw Patterson there; I took the paper to Limbrick without opening it, about ten o'clock, at his own house, Church-row, Pancras - it contained three score of bad shillings, which I mark<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120056"></xptr>ed and gave to him - I appointed to see the prisoner again and he was taken up. I have been in trouble myself on a charge of felony, and was sent for three months to the House of Correction; it was for stealing a piece of pork. but it was not true, and there is not a man in the part of the metropolis where I live, that can have a better character than I can.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You give yourself a good character? A. Yes; I have got my living by hard work; I was a watchman but was dismissed at my own request - I swear that; it may be ten or twelve months ago - I was a watchman in June last, and was dismissed through a false attestation - somebody said something about me; I had been a watchman three years and eight months before that, and had once been dismissed at my own request; I was not on duty when I was charged with taking the pork - I had left home to go to market with my wife. Mr. Careless, the butcher, in Clare-market, was the person from whom I was said to have stolen it. I had a little dealing with Sam for things. I call it honest dealing. I told the gentleman at the office that I had always lived by honest means; before I was discharged from being a watchman I was taken up for ill-treating my wife and leaving her to the parish - it was about three years ago - I was discharged for that. When I went to the prisoner's room, on the 19th of December, I saw nobody but him and three children.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. You have been asked if you had not dealings with Sam - was it not for the purpose of giving information to the officer. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did you state at the office that Patterson was outside the door? A. I believe I did, but I will not swear that - I cannot say whether I said I found him when I came out. I have not been examined since. I have talked the matter over with Limbrick, Edwards, and Lee, but I have not seen them more than twice to my knowledge. I attended with them before the Grand Jury - Patterson was there to state all he knew; I answered all the questions that were put - Patterson was introduced to me by Limbrick.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden. Connell was employed by me, as he has stated. He came to me on the 19th of December, about five o'clock, at the Bell public-house; I searched him, and gave him two half-crowns and eleven shillings; he came to me the same evening, about ten o'clock, at my own house, and gave me this paper, containing three score of bad shillings, which he marked, and gave to me in the presence of Patterson. The prisoner was apprehended on the 22d of December by Edwards and Lee, in my presence - he made a call and somebody answered him out of a window; I went up to the room which the voice came from, where I saw Connell and the prisoner's wife; I brought them down, and put them into a coach - they were taken to the office. I asked the prisoner how long he had known Connell - he said"About five or six weeks" - I do not remember his saying any thing more. Edwards searched the prisoner and I searched Connell, and took from him two half-crowns and four shillings marked, and four shillings not marked. The marked money was what I had furnished him with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On the 19th of December, you say, you saw Connell and Patterson, about five o'clock in the evening? A. Yes, and again about ten o'clock. I had not seen them in the interval, and do not know where they had been. I have seen Connell three or four times since we went before the Grand Jury, but did not talk about this to my knowledge.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw Connell on the 22d of December - I had not seen him before; he was searched, and two half-crowns and some shillings were given him. I assisted in apprehending the prisoner in Goulston-square.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the house in Goulston-street? A. No; Limbrick went in but I did not. I have seen Connell since at Hick's Hall, and here two or three times, but I have had no conversation with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing when he was taken? A. I believe he asked in the coach what he was taken for, and, I believe, Limbrick said for selling shams; he asked what Connell was there for, but I believe no answer was made to him; he was asked if he knew Connell, and said he had known him for five or six weeks, and had drank a pot of beer with him, or something of that kind.</p>

            . I live in Bill's-buildings, Somer's-town, and am a shoemaker. I saw Connell with Limbrick on the 18th of December, and again on the 19th, at the Bell, Battle-bridge, about half-past five o'clock - Connell was then searched, and two half-crowns and eleven shillings given to him - he went away alone, and I followed him about four or five yards off - he went into No. 17, Goulston-street, and when he had been there a short time I saw the prisoner come out - he went a short distance and returned in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and went into the house again; I saw Connell come out and go to Limbrick's house; I followed him about five or six yards off - I saw him searched at Limbrick's - three papers of money were taken from him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You followed him there and back? A. Yes; it was not possible for him to have received this money from any other person in the street without my seeing him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. But you do not know who he received it from in the house? A. No; I can not tell what I am to have for this job - I expect what they please to give me. I am an apprentice to Mr. Clulow - he knows of my having taken to this new line. I became acquainted with Limbrick since I have been with Mr. Clulow, about eight or nine months since, when I went up to Hatton Garden, about two women who stole shoes from our place. I was never charged myself; it was at Mr. Limbrick's house that I saw him; it took me about three quarters of an hour to go from the Bell, at Battle-bridge, to Whitechapel, on the 19th of December, and about two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120057"></xptr>hours to go out the straight road - I was four or five hours gone altogether - I believe it was about ten o'clock when I got back; we did not go any where else - there was no light in Goulston-street. I saw the prisoner come past me - I had seen him on the day before.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. What time did you follow Connell to Goulston-street? A. About six o'clock. I do not know what distance it is; we went down Sun-street, Bishopsgate; when Connell came out I went to Mr. Limbrick's house, St. Pancras, which is further than the Bell.</p>

I apprehended him in June last; he was at that time a supernumerary watchman - I think his beat was in Clare-street - it was Mr. Careless, of Clare-street, who prosecuted him for taking the meat. I would not believe him on his oath - he was discharged from being a watchman, on account of the robbery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and have lodged in Dean-street, Shadwell, for two years. On the night of the 25th of April I slept with the prisoner Collins—I went to bed about two o'clock—I had five sovereigns in my left-hand jacket pocket, and fourteen shillings in my right—I put my things on the top of a chest—Collins awoke me—she was up, and said</p>

               <p>Stewart had taken a sovereign out of my pocket—Stewart was not there then—while I was dressing Williams came in, and, after her, Stewart; and then Collins said Stewart had money belonging to me, and told her to give it back—I said I did not want to have any thing to do with it just then, and I went out of the room—I had lost all my money—I went home—Stewart came following me down—I met two policemen, and I made them stop her from coming—I went home to a young man, as I thought perhaps he had taken my money—he said he had not, and I came out and gave Stewart in charge—a small foreign coin that I had in my pocket was found on Williams—I lost five sovereigns, fourteen shillings, and the foreign Coin.</p>

I was in the room where he was that night, for about an hour; and after he took off his things, and was gone to bed, 1 took his waistcoat, and was going to take the money out, to take care of, but Collins said, "Come, come, I will have nothing of that in my room"—she took it from me, and took the money out—Stewart was there at that time—he had five sove-reigns, and fourteen shillings in silver—I did not know that he had the foreign coin—I went home, and left Collins and Stewart with him.</p>

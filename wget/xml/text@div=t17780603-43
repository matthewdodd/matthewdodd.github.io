            . What name; had she done business with you in? - In the name of Montgomery. People seldom choose to give in their real name that deal with us, and by her appearance, I took her to be a person of property.</p>

               <p>There are a pair of fine sheets there that do not belong to Mr. Broadhead; there is a Bon them, but the owner's name was Blake.</p>
               <p>Mr. Broadhead: When she left my service; she gave up two keys, but not the key of the linen.</p>
               <p>Court to Artz. She pawned these things at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177806030023"></xptr> several times? - Yes; some, two years and a quarter ago.</p>
               <p>Did she ever take any out of pawn again? - Yes, frequently.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My master himself knows I had not given up the keys; I did not pawn them with a view to wrong my master. My master told me in Clerkenwell prison, if I would own it, he would forgive me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Broadhead. I called on her in Clerkenwell prison, as I had bills coming in every day, that I had given her the money to discharge; I went to ask her, if she would tell me what bills were out-standing against me; I said nothing as to the linen.</p>
               <p>Court to the prosecutor. Was there any wages due to her? - Only thirty-five shillings when she left me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old, and live in Elder-walk, Lower-road, Islington. Last Monday week I was picking cinders there—the pri<lb></lb>soner lives in Elder-walk, and goes out washing, I believe—I saw her come out after a boy who had been teasing her, I do not know his name—she was very angry, and was running after him with a chopper in her hand, trying to catch him, but he got away—I was standing on a dust-heap—I had not been teasing her, or doing anything—she came and leaned over a fence which was between me and her, and without speaking, hit me over the head with the edge of the chopper—it was a hard blow, it made my head bleed very much—she then ran away.</p>

            . I was in the street; I saw Allingham put down his basket with a leg of pork in it, against the palings, while he went up an entry - I saw the prisoner, whom I knew, come and take it; I looked well at him - he went down White Lion-passage; I thought he was only playing a trick, but I found he did not come back - I am thirteen years of age; I did not speak to him - I knew where he lived; the gas was lighted in our shop, which is at the corner of the entry.</p>

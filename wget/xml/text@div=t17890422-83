               <p>In November last I went into Kent, accompanied by Mr. Edghill; I had a brilliant diamond ring with me, there was M. Tyron on the ring; I did not miss the ring 'till after my return; I was one day on my journey, and came back the next day; I did not receive intelligence of it 'till the 1st of March.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's Counsel. Have you any recollection of having the ring after the 1st day on your journey to Kent? - I have not; I was only one day on my journey, and returned the next day.</p>

               <p>I let out post-chaises; the prisoner at the bar was my servant, at that time; he drove the gentleman and lady on their journey, and returned back again; I know nothing more.</p>

               <p>I believe he has lived with you 2 or 3 years, what character has he bore? - A very honest man; I always found him so.</p>

I am a corporal in the Royal Engineers at Woolwich—I know the prisoner, he is a gunner in the Royal Artillery—on Friday morning, 7th October, I was asleep in my hut behind the hospital, in Mill-lane—I went to sleep about 11 o'clock on the night of the 6th, and I was awoke on Friday morning about half-past 2 o'clock by some person about my head, shaking the chain of my watch—I heard the chain rattle, and I turned and asked who was there, and a man said, "It is me"—I said "Who is 'me'"—I did not recognise the voice, but I got out of my bed and chased the man; I caught him—it was the prisoner—I gave him in charge of the corporal of the guard—I had lost sight of the prisoner for about 2 seconds—I have not the least doubt that he is the man who was at my head—he did not take my watch, he had it in his left hand—I know he is the man, because there was no way for him to get away.</p>

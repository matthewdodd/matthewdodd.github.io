                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 158.) I was on duty in the Old Kent-road, on the 20th of August, a quarter before eight o'clock, and near the Five Bells public-house I saw a dray standing, and the three prisoners by it—Clar<lb></lb>idge was holding up a sack—Barrett, who was the drayman, took a nose-bag off the dray, and shook something out into the sack—Jarvis, the ostler, stood by at the time—I walked about a dozen yards past, and Barrett came towards me with the sack over his shoulder, towards the back yard of the public-house—he stopped suddenly—I perceived that he saw me, and he turned back towards the dray—he was met by Jarvis, who took the sack from him and placed it on the dray—Barrett then came to me and said, "Well, policeman, what do you think of the night, do you think it will be wet?"—I said I did not think it would—he then said, "Will you have a drop of gin?"—I said "No, I would rather not"—he said would I have any thing else?—I said, "No"—he then went towards the dray, where Claridge and Jones were standing—I shifted my position nearer to them, and heard Barrett say, "All right, go on"—Jarvis then took the sack off the dray, and placed it under the end of the horse-trough, by the side of the road they all three then went and sat down outside the public-house door, and were smoking and drinking for about an hour—while they were there Bar<lb></lb>rett said to me, "I thought you had a certain ground to walk over"—I said, "So I have, but I am waiting for one of our men, I can't well go away"—he then said to Claridge, "We will go the same way home we came, you go on"—Claridge then drove on the dray about two hundred yards—he came back, and said to Barrett, "I shan't <hi rend="italic">go</hi> without you, eleven o'clock is time enough for me"—I waited there some time—when a relief came up I gave Calvert and Jarvis into custody of a policeman, and they were taken to the station-house—Claridge there said it was a planned job between the ostler and the drayman—he was crying, and said, "The ostler fetched the sack out of the house, and I held it up"—I had removed the sack from under the horse-trough—I found one full nose-bag on the dray, and some empty ones.</p>

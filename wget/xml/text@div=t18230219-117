The prisoner was an apprentice on board; I went on board on the Monday, and searched his trowsers pocket, and found a 5 l. note, a sovereign, a crown piece, and two half crowns; I asked how he came by them, he made no answer; he had no way of getting money, the coins were thicker than sovereigns. I dont know their value, there were three different kinds.</p>

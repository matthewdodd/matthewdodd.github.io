The watchman came immediately; I told him I had been robbed, and gave him a description of the men; he went with me to look for them, and two days after Griffiths was taken; I went to a public house in Middle-row, there were nine or ten people there; the watchman desired me to look round, and see if there was ever a person that I knew there, and I immediately picked out the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - It was a fine evening, it was directly under a lamp, and I saw his face distinctly, so much so, that I knew him the moment I saw him by day-light.</p>
               <p>How long might he be with you? - About three minutes; he was in front of me; I observed his face distinctly at the time.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt whether he is the man that robbed you, or not? - I have not a doubt; and when I first saw him, I did not wish to swear to him, if I could have got him to have given up my things, as it would be attended with so much inconvenience to me; I am come all the way from Carlisle now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Where was this place where it happened? - In Charlotte Buildings.</p>
               <p>Was that in your way home? - No.</p>
               <p>Were you perfectly sober at that time in the morning? - As perfectly as I am now.</p>
               <p>Have you always persevered in giving the same account of the knowledge of that man's person, that you have now given, on your oath? - I think I have.</p>
               <p>I should think, if you had been previously sworn as to that man, and did take your oath in the same manner in which you have now done, that you must be sure of it? - I have always persevered in the same story that I have now related, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How often was this man examined before the Justice? - Only once.</p>
               <p>Are you as sure that he was only examined once before the Justice, as you are sure of what you have now sworn? - I am certain.</p>
               <p>Are you equally sure of one as the other? - I am perfectly sure that he was up there twice.</p>
               <p>Will you tell me, Sir, what was the reason, if you swore as positively at the first examination as now, that he was not committed the first time? - He was committed the first time I swore to him, fully committed.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was it that you was first before the Justice? - That I cannot tell, I never paid any attention to it.</p>
               <p>Did you never point out another man to the watchman, and say that he was one of those that robbed you, which the watchman denied? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Was there no trying on of two hats before the Justice; - Yes; but I fixed on the man before, and said the hat he had on was not the hat he had on when he robbed me, and they went to his lodgings, and fetched the other.</p>
               <p>What was the reason, if you was so positive of him the first time you saw him, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260010"></xptr> you should desire to see him with another hat? - I did not desire it.</p>
               <p>Was there no such thing as trying on different coats, that you might know him? - There was no such thing passed.</p>
               <p>What kind of watch did you lose? - A tortoiseshell case watch, a metal watch.</p>
               <p>Did not you swear at first, when you was robbed, that you was robbed of a gold watch, and not of a metal watch? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Were you but one time before the Justice, or more? - I cannot charge my memory with it.</p>
               <p>Were you called twice to make oath of this circumstance before the Justice, or only once? - I was called twice, but did not swear positively to him the first time.</p>
               <p>How came it that you did not swear positively to him the first time? - The reason is, I wanted to get my watch and my papers; if he would have given me the papers, I would have given him the watch.</p>
               <p>Did you, the first time you was examined with respect to this man, know whether he was the man, or not? - Yes, I did; I never was asked positively whether I knew him or not, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon yourself to swear, that upon the first examination you was not asked positively whether that was the man, or no? - Yes, I was asked whether he was the man, and I told the magistrate he was the man; and I told the Magistrate why I did not wish to swear positively to him.</p>
               <p>Was not your reason for not swearing to him the first time before the Justice, that you did not chuse to do it till you had seen the watchman? - No, I did not wish to swear to him; I said before the Magistrate, I wish to see the watchman, to see if I could get my watch and papers again.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not, before you saw the watchman, swear positively to him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you or not, at the second examination, go any further than to say that you believed he was the man? - I swore positively that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Did you swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was this man searched in your presence? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you go to his lodgings? - No, Sir, I did not; I never saw him before that night.</p>
               <p>Court. The reason why you was not desirous of swearing to this man, was the great inconvenience? - Yes; if I could have got my papers, I would not have prosecuted him at all.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman; on the 22d of January, at a quarter past one in the morning, to the best of my knowledge, I was going my rounds, and going up a court, called Charlotte Buildings, I saw three men standing together against a wall; I said nothing to them, nor they to me, and I went through the court into Bell-court, Gray's-Inn-lane, and I heard somebody cry watch! watch!</p>
               <p>How long was it after you saw these men? - In as little time as I have been in court now, it was not two minutes; then I said, who calls watch, and I saw the prosecutor; he said he had just been robbed by three men of his watch and pocket-book; he described the men; I told him I had just passed them, I told him I knew one of them by name; I had seen the others before; the next day I went to the prosecutor, and we went up to Sir Sampson Wright's to give information, and in two days after the prisoner was taken; he was one of the three men that I saw; the prosecutor appeared at the Justice's, and made affidavit that that was the man.</p>
               <p>Was you at the first examination before the Justice? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutor swear to the man then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The witness was not there the first time.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw the three men that were standing there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of them, or not? - Yes, I am very clear he was; I knew him by sight before.</p>
               <p>Was he the man whose name you knew? - Yes; I knew his name, I have seen him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260011"></xptr> in my beat a hundred and five hundred times; I have frequently called the prisoner up, when he lodged in Bell-court.</p>
               <p>How came you not to question these three men when you saw them there at that unseasonable hour in the morning? - I did not say any thing to them.</p>
               <p>Why not? - Because on a Saturday night people sit up very late.</p>
               <p>Do not you know it is a part of your duty, when you see two or three men in company, lurking together, to disperse them, and send them home? - Yes, we often do it; but it was Saturday night; there is a public house, called the Footman in Waiting, that is open very late, I thought they might come from there.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a watchman? - Between two and three years.</p>
               <p>I hope, if you continue, that you will learn to know that it is your duty to question all suspicious people, and if they give suspicious answers, to apprehend them. - I have been knocked down twenty times in my time.</p>
               <p>You must take care to have proper assistance; but it is your business to discharge your duty; if you are afraid, others must be got, who are not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When this happened, you told this gentleman that you knew the name of one of these three? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did it happen that this gentleman thought while he was with you that evening, that he saw one of the men that robbed him? - He said he should know them if he saw them again.</p>
               <p>Did not he say to you, pointing to some men that were going by, there goes one of the men? - I do not remember that, indeed.</p>
               <p>Were you at the apprehending of this man? - Not at the taking of him.</p>
               <p>Did the gentleman tell you what his watch was? - He said it was a valuable watch, and his pocket-book was a great loss to him.</p>
               <p>Did he say it was a gold watch? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did he or did he not say it was a gold watch? - I do not remember that he did; I believe he said it was a valuable watch, or something to that purpose; I was not by when the prisoner was searched.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been turned away from any parish where you have been a watchman? - I never was a watchman any where but where I am now.</p>
               <p>Do you know the name of the landlord of the public house in this court? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - I saw him in the yard.</p>
               <p>Who apprehended the p risoner? - One of the name of Meecham.</p>
               <p>Did not you say before the Justice, that that person, who was one of the three, spoke to you? - The prisoner did speak to me that night; I saw him about an hour before; he said, how do you do, watchman? or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Were you there when the hats were fitted upon him? - No.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner at No. 6, Tennis-court, Holborn, at his lodgings; I searched his lodgings in the three-pair-of-stairs room, and I found nothing. The prisoner made his escape once out of the back window; I took him in the entry, without a coat.</p>
               <p>What hour? - Between twelve and one in the day, on Wednesday; he appeared to have been in bed, or shifting himself, his clothes were off; he had his breeches and stockings and shoes on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You do not know that he escaped, only what was told you? - No.</p>
               <p>Then why did you state it; did not he tell you he was the man you was looking for? - No, Sir, to my knowledge he did not.</p>
               <p>Do you swear he did not? - I do swear so.</p>
               <p>When he was taken to the alehouse, how many hats-were tried upon him? - I believe there might be two hats; the gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260012"></xptr> said he should know him with or without the hats; the two coats were found.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is only one examination returned, and that says that the prosecutor firmly and positively believes the man named Griffiths was the man that robbed him.</p>

On Sunday, the 17th of October, about half-past one o'clock in the night, Baker, the watchman, rang the bell - I got up looked out of window, and saw him at the door with his assistant; we had all gone to bed. I ran down, and let two watchmen in; we went into the shop, and found the prisoner in the cellar, under the house, took him into custody, and searched him, but found nothing upon him. I found some picklock keys, and a crow-bar in that cellar, after he was gone to the watch-house. We tried the keys, and found they would open the street door, and every door in the house. I had seen the cellar shut up on the Saturday night - it is never opened on a Sunday: the outer iron grating is fixed into an oaken cill, with five iron spikes, and is never open - we found that wrenched open with a crow bar, and the cellar window was pushed down; this must have been the way he got in. The grating was safe on the Sunday night, about nine o'clock; if it had been wrenched open then, I must have seen it.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Bishopsgate ward. On the 17th of October I was calling half-past 1 o'clock, and heard a noise at the corner of Skinner-street, against Mr. Stott's house, and on turning round saw a man on his hands and knees, against the cellar railing - I thought him drunk, and went to his assistance, but he got up, and ran off. I perceived the grating half way off. and saw the prisoner coming out of the cellar: I said,</p>

               <p>"What business have you here," and struck him two or times; he retreated into the cellar again - I closed the grating, and shut him in, and alarmed Mr. Stott, who came down. Field, I, and another watchman went in, and took him behind some casks, in the back part of the cellar.</p>

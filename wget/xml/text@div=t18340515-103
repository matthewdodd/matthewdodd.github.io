            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at Somer's-town. This coat was pawned by the prisoner on the 15th of March.</p>
               <p>RICHARD STOPFORD TAYLOR. I am a <rs id="t18340515-103-viclabel571" type="occupation">pupil at the Veterinary College</rs>

This is my coat - I lost it about the 11th of March - I had given the prisoner leave to sleep in my parlour, and in a few days I missed the coat - the prisoner afterwards went out of town - on Friday week last I accused him of it, and said if he did not bring it, I would give him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you been great friends with the other pupils in the college? A. I have only been there once since this happened - I have only been sent to Coventry by his gang - his pot drinkers - I lost this coat from my lodging, at No. 61, <placeName id="t18340515-103-crimeloc572">College-street, West</placeName>

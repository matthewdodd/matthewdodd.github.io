                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and have one partner. Sabberton was in my employ for about a twelvemonth as foreman—Hollis was a bed—i stead-maker. On the 13th of August, I went to my manufactory in Ful<lb></lb>wood's-rents, and missed several of these long pieces of wood—I went to Blackey, the turner, in Baldwin's-gardens, and saw some beech, which is ours—I have two thousand feet bearing the same mark with the branding-iron, it is the initials of the timber-merchant—on the 27th of August I received a communication from Mr. Blackey—in consequence of which I went to his house in Baldwin's-gardens—I waited some time, and saw a carter named Hedge remove the timber in a cart—I followed it—it was taken to Dalston, to Hollis's father's house—seeing where it was deposited, I went to the station-house—an officer came and took possession of it—I went back to my workshop and gave the prisoners in charge—Hedge went with me—when he got to my work-shop and saw the prisoners, he said, "There are the two men that employed me"—they said they had done nothing wrong—this letter is in Sabberton's handwriting I am positive—he made bills out on Saturdays—the letter was delivered to me by a woman—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—" Sir,—With trembling hand I write these few lines, imploring your forgive<lb></lb>ness, not for the sake of myself, but for my poor wife and child. I own I am guilty of a part of the offence for which I am charged. The cause of me and Hollis taking what we did, was, when the beech was got in I came and asked you to let us have some refreshment; yon refused, and there being some over the number, in an evil moment I and Hollis took some of them, but my brother and Mr. Hollis knows no more about it than a child unborn. I have no more to say; but on my knees, let me pray that you will forgive us for the sake of my wife, for she is in the family way, and entirely dependent on me for support, and we will make every recompence in our power.—<hi rend="smallCaps">SABBERTON</hi> and <hi rend="smallCaps">HOLLIS</hi>."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a turner, and work for the prosecutors; I live in Baldwin's-gardens; Sabberton has always been in the habit of giving out work to me as foreman. On the 19th of July I sent my boy—he came with twelve sets of quarterings to my house—in the afternoon the two prisoners brought some pieces with them, and they said part of the pieces the boy brought belonged to them, and not to Mr. Lyon—they both told me they belonged to them, and that they were to be turned into stumps as soon as possible—Sabberton told me I was not to mention it to George Lyon, or any other person in the shop, that the wood was in ny possession—on the 27th of August the two prisoners came—Sabberton selected some of the timber and put it on one side, and Hollis put some on the other side—Sabberton marked his with a saw, and told me to put it down in the kitchen—Hollis paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the stumps I had turned—he was, to Pay me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the three sets—he said a man was to come for them, and he did.</p>

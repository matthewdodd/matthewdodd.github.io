               <p>Did you call watch, or how? - I was so much confused at the time, and the violence of the blow, I do not know whether I did or no; I was knocked down with a fist, they came on my left side; I did not see them till they had done it; they gave me two blows, and when I got up, I saw the gentlemen, they was both together.</p>
               <p>How long were they rifling your pockets? - Not above a minute.</p>
               <p>Are these the same men? - They have not the same dresses on, I should be glad to see them in the same dresses, I would not wish to swear to them in these dresses; I am quite sure the men I gave charge of were the men that stood by me; I would not say any thing to wrong my conscience.</p>
               <p>Were they searched at the watch-house? - Yes, partly searched.</p>
               <p>Was you present? - No.</p>
               <p>Was any body with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Have you ever got your handkerchief or your key again? - No, none of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090092"></xptr>I believe you forgot the handkerchief at Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then this handkerchief you never swore you had lost till now? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you clear as to the time that this happened? - I am clear to the time, by a person passing by after I gave charge to the watchman.</p>
               <p>You say it was half past nine? - I am clear to the time by a person passing by, which I asked.</p>
               <p>Where had you been before this happened? - The last place I came from was the Crooked Billet, in Wych-street.</p>
               <p>How long had you been at the Crooked Billet? - About twenty minutes, I think.</p>
               <p>Where had you been on the morning of that day? - In the morning of that day I had been at Hicks's-hall.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - I staid at Hicks's-hall, at the King's-head, while half after six, or seven.</p>
               <p>I believe all the business there finishes at four, does not it? - The indictment was thrown out between the hour of two and three; I quitted Hicks's-hall.</p>
               <p>Then from the hour of two and three till half past six, you was at the King's-head, amusing yourself with drinking? - I was in company.</p>
               <p>How much might you drink between two and half past six? - I did not drink much.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I will not swear that I drank none; I must own that I had been drinking, but not drinking so much, but was very sensible of what I did.</p>
               <p>Where did you go at half past six? - I went to the King's-head, in St. Martin's-le-grand; I am not clear it is the King's-head; but the person that was along with me kept the King's-head.</p>
               <p>That is directly the contrary way to going home? - He was an acquaintance of mine.</p>
               <p>Then you had a wet with him? - Yes, we had; we left there about eight, or half past; I cannot be positive as to the time.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect where you went after you had been drinking till half past eight, the second wet? - Then we went to the Crooked Billet, in Wych-street.</p>
               <p>I should think, by this time, drinking more, you was not very sober? - I was not drunk; we had a shilling's-worth of rum and water among us.</p>
               <p>Is that all you drank? - I am not very clear.</p>
               <p>How much besides do you think you drank? - I am very positive we had not more than eighteen pennyworth.</p>
               <p>How long did it take you up drinking this eighteen pennyworth? - We did not stay there twenty minutes; we never sat down; all the company in the room drank along with us.</p>
               <p>Did not the landlord of the Crooked Billet advise you that you was too tipsy to venture yourself out any where else, and that you had better make the best of your way home? - No, I do not recollect that; there was there a broker.</p>
               <p>I believe he was pretty drunk too? - I believe he was; he was much drunker than me.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect, at this time, who you went out of the house with? - I do not know the person that I went out with; but I did not go with any body; there were three of us in company; two went one way, and me the other; they left me.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the third man that was in your company? - Never, but that time, in my life.</p>
               <p>What kind of man was he? - A lusty man.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect where you parted? - I recollect we parted in the house; they went one way, and me the other; I went out of the street door, into Wych-street, and the others went up Holywell-street; I went alone from that house.</p>
               <p>Can you tell us what time it was you reached your own house after this charge at the watch-house? - I never went home that night; I was not kept in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090093"></xptr>What time was it that you left the watch-house? - I cannot be very clear in that; about eleven, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Then I should think it is time for all sober people to go home about eleven; however, can you tell us, where you went to, now, at this hour of night? - I went to Piccadilly; I had two pints of porter there, and sat till between two and three in the morning; then I walked about; I went to no house.</p>
               <p>Where did you go? - At three or four in the morning I walked about the streets; I was in such a condition, so bruised, I was ashamed to go home.</p>
               <p>Then you wished to shew to all the world, when they got up about their business, how bruised you was? - I did not shew any body.</p>
               <p>How many hours might you be walking about the streets? - I suppose about four or five hours.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you sent home to your own house to tell them what accident had happened to you? - Never, till the next night.</p>
               <p>Had not you recovered the evening walk, that you could not go home till the next night? - I got along with some gentlemen that were strangers to the business.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you go home then all the next day? - I went home the next day, about seven or eight in the evening; I sent word about two where I was, and a soldier came down to me in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>You say this robbery was committed by two persons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect now, at this time, who you first charged? - I only blame Andrews for robbing me; Phillips was in company.</p>
               <p>Did not you charge Phillips first, before you charged Andrews? - Never.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I dare swear that, I am very clear I never charged him with the robbery; I charged him with being in company.</p>
               <p>You charged no other man but this man? - No other.</p>
               <p>Which of these men is Andrews? - I do not wish to swear to them in these dresses.</p>
               <p>Do you know which of them is Andrews? - The man in the blue coat is Andrews, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He is wrong.</p>
               <p>What is your name in blue? - Phillips.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. After that I will not ask the man a question.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you say you did not see the person that knocked you down at the time you was knocked down, or before it? - Never, but when I got up I saw two men; as I got up they were going about a yard or two from me; I charged Andrews for robbing me.</p>
               <p>How came you to do that? because, if you did not see either of the men before you was struck, or when you was struck, till you got up again, how could you tell which of the men it was that struck you? - Phillips was not close by me; he was a little before, and when I charged Andrews, Phillips came up very pert, and I said I would charge him for being in company; I was clear that I saw Andrews.</p>
               <p>You did not see him strike you? - I did not see him before I had the blow, till I was rising up; there was nobody passing so nigh hand them; and as I rose I saw them.</p>
               <p>They did not run away? - No, they did not seem to run, because I had them in my sight all the time.</p>
               <p>But they did not offer to run? - The watchman came up directly, and they were taken up immediately.</p>
               <p>How many people might be about you when you got up? - Upon my word I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Were they as near you as Andrews? - There was nobody near me when I called out.</p>
               <p>Why, you said just now you did not know whether you called out or not? - I called out, and said it was Andrews robbed me; when I got up, I saw nobody near me but these two men.</p>

               <p>Was he drunk or sober? - He was worse for liquor.</p>

               <p>Court. Was not he drunk enough, think you, not to know what he was about; whether he was not so drunk, at that time, no great reliance could he had on him? - He was very much in liquor, to be sure.</p>

               <p>What do you mean by not giving a thorough charge? - He said he would give charge of this person, and the other person, but he could not recollect the real person that knocked him down, then he put his hand on my breast, and says, I give charge of you.</p>

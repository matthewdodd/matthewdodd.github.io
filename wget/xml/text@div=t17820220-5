I heard somebody in the passage No. 1, I did not concern myself then, passed the place, and went up to work, in two minutes I heard the whispering of two women, at that instant I did not hear what it was, I heard the door open, I instantly looked out of the window, I saw one of the women just come off the threshold of the door, and the other come out by the side of her; I have seen them both I am clear of it, up and down that alley before, it was as clear a moon-light night as ever was seen, it was a full moon, quite a bright night.</p>

            , on Monday night, about eight o'clock; I went, and met the corpse in a shell, in the Eagle and Child alley, I desired them to put it down, they spoke very abruptly to me, and told me I might come into the house, it would be soon enough when he was carried in; I said no time was to be lost, I put my hand down, and felt him, and found he was quite dead; he was taken to the burying ground, I told them it was not a proper place to inspect the body; he was then carried into a room, I then examined him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200015"></xptr>Tell us the cause of his death to the best of your judgment? - I cannot form any idea what was the cause of his death, there was no marks of violence.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the whole of the body? - I examined the whole, I examined the head to see if there was any contusion, there was not; there was another gentleman dropped in belonging to St. Thomas's Hospital; there were no marks of violence at all on the body, that person will confirm the same I believe, if called.</p>
               <p>You cannot say what was the cause of his death? - I cannot form any idea of what was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Did you open the head? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you examine his neck? - I examined his neck, and round his chest and side; I examined about his neck very particularly.</p>
               <p>Were there any marks there? - There were no marks at all, as I saw.</p>
               <p>Did you open him? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you open his head? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear at that time some ideas how this man came by his death? - No, Sir; I heard nothing of those particulars.</p>
               <p>Did nothing pass, from which you might think it material to open his head? - No, Sir; I had nothing occur to me then to make it necessary to open his head: it was all confusion, one saying one thing, another another thing, and another another thing; some said it was murder, and some said not.</p>
               <p>Were any of those people present? - The overseer was present.</p>

            ? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it possible for a man to be strangled, without marks of violence, by a silk handkerchief? - Upon my word I cannot tell that; I cannot take upon me to say that.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Would it be possible to strangle a man with a silk handkerchief, with or without a mark of violence appearing? - In all cases where I was called in, I always saw marks before.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see a person strangled with a silk handkerchief in your life before? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. If a man dies by being strangled, whether with a silk handkerchief or cord, or any thing else, would it not affect his countenance? - I should think so.</p>
               <p>Was this man's face at all affected? - Not at all in the least; he had a very pleasing countenance.</p>
               <p>Was it black? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>In your judgment could a man be strangled with any thing, without having some effect upon his face? - I should think not.</p>
               <p>Court. Would that blackness of the countenance appear immediately after the death of the person, or does it require any space of time before it appears? - I should conceive it would appear instantaneously.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Holborn, sir.</p>
               <p>Do you practice as a surgeon? - Yes.</p>

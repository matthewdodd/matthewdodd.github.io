             (Police-constable G 175). I was sent for to Mr. Hawkins' warehouse, on Monday, the 20th of August, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening -I found the prisoner in the counting-house; I took him to Bunhill-row station - he gave his address No. 21, Britannia-street, City-road; I then took him from Robert-street watchhouse, and told him I intended to search his premises, and asked what part of the house he occupied; he said a room on the first floor, and a kitchen on the ground floor - I went and searched his rooms between ten and eleven o'clock; I found three brass locks in the front room, a door plate, a dog collar, four metal spoons, four metal tea-spoons, two blind movements, some wire and brass, and counters, a punch, stamps, and a brass bag lock in the upper room; and a coffee-mill and two table-spoons in the kitchen; when I told him I was going to search his house, he asked if he could be allowed to go with me - I told him no; on going to the station he asked what I had found - I said various ironmongery goods, and among the rest a door plate; he asked me again - I told him a patent coffee-mill; he said, "That is not Mr. Hawkins', nor never was - I had it before I came into his employ;" he asked if I took any thing else- I told him some ivory Pope Joan counters; he said,"I dare say Mrs. Hawkins can swear to them, for I did take them - I found them laying about, and thought them of no value."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You found his address correct? A. Yes; I had followed him home the Thursday previous - I could not have known the rooms he occupied if he had not told me; I did not let him know that I followed him home.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are they bone? A. Bone and pearl, a mixed set - they were kept in a cupboard; I have no mark on the door plate; I lost a great many things at the fire - the prisoner is married, and has three or four children.</p>

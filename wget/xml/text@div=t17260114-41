             thus depos'd. I had been upon the Loose all Night o' Christmas Eve, so that, I must needs own, that by 4 or 5 a Clock next Morning I was got a little out of Sorts; and then, as I was going along Spring-Gardens, I met the Prisoner, and she ask'd me to give her a Pint, and call'd me her Dear, and her Life, and this, and that, and t'other; and, as I had no great Fancy for going home so soon, I went with her to the Night-Cellar at <placeName id="t17260114-41-crimeloc244">Charing-Cross</placeName>

               <p>The Prisoner thus made her Defence. About 5 in the Morning I met this Fellow in Spring-Garden: I saw he was drunk, and so endeavour'd to shun him, but he follow'd me, and swore he would have to do with me. I, thinking to get out of his Way, went to the Night-House, and call'd for a Pint of Purl; but he came after me; upon which, when I had drank my Purl, I went away towards St. James's, about my Business; and, as I came back, I saw him along with a Soldier, and then he laid bold of me, and swore I had pick'd his Pocket.

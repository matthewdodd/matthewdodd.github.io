                  </hi>. I am single; I live at 243 Strand—I lived housemaid at the Mitre Tavern, Fleet-street, the beginning of this month—this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) ismine—I put it in my box on Tuesday, 3rd Dec., at Rawlings'; a hair-dresser, in Fetter-lane—I locked the box; I wanted that and two other boxes carried to my present lodging—on the Tuesday afternoon the prisoner offered to take them, and he took them about nine o'clock—I saw the box on Wednesday morning, and it had been opened; when I put my key in, the lock came away—on the Sunday morning I missed my watch—I spoke to the prisoner on Monday, and said, "My watch is stolen, if anybody gives me any information about it, I will give them half-a-guinea"—he said he knew nothing about it, and assured me the box was secure when he took it to my lodging—I went to him several times afterwards about it—I told him I could get no information about it—he assured me he knew nothing about it—he at length gave me this duplicate and said, "Oh! forgive me"—I asked him how he got the watch—he said it dropped out of my box as he was carrying it along—this chain is not mine.</p>

I went out of town on the 20th of September - he had not paid it me then; he never told me of any mistake of this kind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Might not this 5s. have been put down in the name of some other person, in some subsequent account? A. He received nothing after that; he left on the 20th of September - I have no reason to suppose this has gone to any other person's name - I am morally certain of it - I did up his book myself, on the 18th of September - I think what he received was, 18l. 19s. 1d., and I received 18l. 17s. 9d. - the rest was allowed to get him some refreshment - I received it, and these figures are mine - I had not discovered this error on the 25th of September, when he called; it was discovered that day by Jones - I suppose I now owe him 6l. or 7l. for wages.</p>

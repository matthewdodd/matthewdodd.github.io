            . I have a sister named Sarah - she is twenty-five years of age. On the 15th of March we were coming from Stafford to London; my sister had two bundles, which contained the articles stated - we met with the prisoner at Dunchurch, near Coventry; she came from there to London; she told us she would take us to the Town-hall, where they gave money to poor people - she took us about the streets, and took us to <placeName id="t18300415-233-crimeloc1293">Worship-street Office</placeName>

               <p>SARAH WYNN. I had the bundles while my brother and sister went into the public-house - the prisoner came and said they had given them some money, I was to give her the bundle, and go to the Castle to my brother; I gave them to her; I went, but could not see my brother - I returned, and the prisoner was gone; I found her on the Saturday night following, and asked her for my bundles - she took me from one place to another, said I was to go to a little street, and ask for James Quim, and tell him I was the person who was to have the bundles; I went, and there were some sailors in the house, making use of very bad language - I came out, and the prisoner was gone; I saw her again on the Monday, on London-bridge, and asked her for them - she said they were at Westminster, would I go there; I said Yes - she took me to Queen-square, and was going to give charge of me, and I gave charge of her.</p>

            . I am an officer. These two women were quarrelling, and the prisoner gave the witness into custody; I examined them, and took them into the office - the witness stated what she has now; I asked the prisoner where she lived - she said no where, and would not tell us any thing.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that she had come to London with the prosecutrix, who had been assisted by the different parishes on the road, and denied that they had any bundles with them to lose.</p>

            . I pawned these books with Priest; the prisoner brought them to me on the 3rd of July, 1828, at Lambeth, where I then lived - I have known him for years; he is a gold wire-drawer by trade, and has been in the habit of selling books on commission; I am a cabinet-maker's plumber, and have sold books for some time - the prisoner was indebted to me, having boarded ten months with me; he agreed to let me have 1l. out of the money I pawned them for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you name some person for whom you have worked within the last three months? A.Business has been very bad, but I have worked for Lazenby and Son; I have not had 2s. 6d. a night for debating at a room in Spitalfields - I do not remember ever receiving a farthing in my life, for debating any where; I did belong to a Mechanic's Institution -I did go away to avoid being arrested for 33l., but certainly did not abscond under the imputation of taking a sum of money belonging to that society - I never went by any other name than my own; I pawned the books in my wife's name, as I thought it not very respectable, and my family are respectable - I have been in pawnbrokers' shops a hundred times, but I never pawned a book in my life that did not belong to me, except in this way, and these I thought did belong to me; I had a library of books when I kept a coffee shop on Clerkenwell-green, and with them, and my father's library I set up a book shop, in April, 1827 - I did live in Oakley-street, and removed to the next street; I was offered a sum of money to leave - I remember attending at Guildhall in consequence of a most injurious report in the Morning Herald, respecting my coffee-shop on Clerkenwell-green, but I am not conscious of attending at any other time; a pickpocket of the name of Smith was there; I did not go to give evidence, I went respecting my own business, but I think Sir Peter Laurie did put a question to me -I did not state that it was my constant practice to receive books, handkerchiefs, and other things from the persons who frequented my coffee-shop, not any thing of the kind - I was secretary to the Mechanics' Institution; my bro- did pay 70l. or 80l., because there was a deficiency in the account, but not to prevent my being prosecuted; there had been three secretaries, and when I returned from Paris, there was a regular arrangement of all the monies paid and received; there was a deficiency of 70l. or 80l., but all the monies I had were given up.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.You have stated you are a bookseller? A. Yes, and have been so for two years; I do not now keep a public shop - my business was very bad, and I was anxious to get into any other; I have been in the tin plate-working business, it is connected with my own - I have followed no other business, that I recollect; since I have been in the book business, I have occasionally pawned books, when I have wanted a little money.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I do not ask who it was, but is the person here who gave the information? A. No; Smee, the officer, who gave me some information is - the prisoner did not tell me he had been just put there by a person who had betrayed him; I know the person by sight who gave the original information - I saw him on Saturday; he is in good health - I know nothing of the prisoner having been put there by him; I found no base coin on the prisoner's person - the room door was opened the moment I called; I saw no disguise or concealment about him - I knew him before.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS. Q. Do you know any thing about how long he had been in the room? A. No.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I accompanied the party to the prisoner's room - I entered the door after my brother, and saw the prisoner sitting by the fire, and saw him put something from his right hand; my brother took this mould from his right hand - he was endeavouring to put it into his pocket; I found an iron spoon in the ashes on the hearth - it was hot, and contained melted metal; I suppose this was what he put out of his right hand - it has been in my custody ever since; I found, on the mantel-piece, this shilling, and a piece of metal; I have had them ever since.</p>

               <p>JOHN FIELD. I am an inspector of counterfeit coin at the Mint. This is a plaster of Paris mould, for the purpose of casting a counterfeit shilling - here is a counterfeit shilling in it; I have seen a great many of these moulds- this has the impression of the obverse and reverse sides of a shilling on it; it is the impression of a lawful and current shilling - the shilling in it has what is called the get or ridge attached to it; it is produced by pouring hot metal into the mould which adheres to the channel - this mould will produce the obverse and reverse sides of a shilling; I have had frequent opportunities of seeing coining implements all my life - the pipkin appears to have had metal melted in it; it is generally done in a pipkin - the metal is at times poured into the mould by a tobacco-pipe, but sometimes with a spoon of this description; this shilling was cast in the mould - I have compared it; it is counterfeit, made of white metal similar to pewter - I cannot exactly say what the other metal is- it is generally made of pewter mixed with tin; it is not silver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not a chemist? A. No; I consider it to be plaster of Paris from its appearance.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a moneyer of the Mint. The prisoner was not employed at the Mint.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been at the Mint? A. Seventeen years; there are now about sixty men and boys employed in the moneyer's department - I dare say there are a hundred persons in the service of the Mint altogether - I will not swear there are not one hundred and fifty; there may be many of them whom I never saw, or whose names I never heard.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLET. Q. Can you undertake to swear the prisoner was not employed at this moment at the Mint? A. No, I cannot - he is not employed in the moneyer's department certainly; that is the department in which the coming is carried on entirely from beginning to end - if he had been employed in the manufacture of coin I must have known it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you the principal in the department? A. No; I have hired the various persons for that department for ten years; there are five others who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030063"></xptr>also hire - I can swear decidedly to each workman in that department.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLET. Q. Is this the sort of mould at the Mint? A. No; nobody could have a mould without authority of some of the moseyer's - there is no such thing as a mould in the Mint; the money is made in a different way - I know every person in the department.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could the prisoner be employed in any way in making money without your knowledge? A. Certainly not; I never saw him about the Mint.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never did such a thing in my life before - I leave it to the mercy of the Court.</p>
               <p>MR. FIELD re-examined. Q.Look at the shilling with the get to it, was that made in this mould? A. Yes, certainly; the obverse and reverse sides were produced by this mould - I have no doubt of the other shilling being also produced from this mould.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Look at the reverse side of the shilling found in the mould, it seems run and rather imperfect? A. Yes, it is an imperfect cast certainly - there is a sinking on the bottom of the head on the obverse side; it is an imperfect cast on both sides - there is no way to refresh the moulds; I have seen much worse shillings in circulation - I remember a half-crown mould being produced here last Session that had been nearly destroyed.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLET. Q. The mould sometimes produces a good and sometimes a bad impression? A. Yes; it depends in a great measure whether the metal is at a proper pouring heat; if it is too cold or too hot the impression will be bad - the shilling found in the room appears a tolerable fair impression for the mould; I think the mould is capable of casting a better impression.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it capable of casting such a figure or resemblance, or similitude as to impose on the world? A. I think it is.</p>

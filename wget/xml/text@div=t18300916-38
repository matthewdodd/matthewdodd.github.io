               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are not these common sail-makers' needles? A. Yes; hundreds of thousands of them are made - here is the name of "Mortor" on them, and "cast steel;" I believe the name Mortor is ground out of this one - I have seen needles of my own make with the name of Mortor on them - when we are marking them a few will drop in without being marked.</p>

            . I am clerk at the Bell inn, Holborn - the Thame coach comes there. On the 1st of June a parcel came in by that coach for Mr. Mortor, Shadwell - it was missing next morning from the office; it appeared to contain needles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. There was not Mortor, East Smithfield, on it? A. It is entered"Shadwell;" I saw the parcel, it was called over to me by Smith, the porter, who is not here; I made the entry from what was told me by him - we had had parcels of of needles come to him from Mr. Shrimpton's - I only guessed that it came from Mr. Shrimpton; I believe he is the only needle-maker in that neighbourhood; the book the entry is in is not here.</p>

            . I live in East Smithfield. I sell needles, and employ the prosecutor to make needles for me; I expected a parcel from him about the 1st or 2nd of June - it did not come; it should have contained about 2800 needles - I had ordered them about a month before; on the 12th of July one Levy called at my shop with a sample of needles - he went out, and brought the prisoner with the parcel; I said I had heard that the coach-office had been robbed and my parcel was missing, and I detained them both; Levy offered them at 1s. 9d. per hundred in the prisoner's presence, that is about a fair price; the prisoner said he had received them of a hackney-coachman at the west end of the town - I gave them in charge on suspicion of their being my needles - there are 2800 of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you counted them? A. No; I only go by what Levy said, having my name on them I told him my suspicion - he brought the prisoner in about half an hour; I have sold a great many needles like these, some marked and some not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ask the name of the hackney-coachman? A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with the prisoner to Paddington-street, where he said he could point out the coachman he bought the needles of; he said he was a young man in a blue frock coat and drab trousers - he did not mention the number of the coach; he pointed out a man with blue trousers, and a black waistcoat and sleeves, who he said sold them - I took them both to a public-house; I told the prisoner to look at him, and be positive he was the man - he said he was; the coachman denied it - I found on the coachman 12l. 10s.; I went to his lodging and searched his trunks, but found nothing to charge him with - the prisoner still persisted that he was the man, and gave that evidence before the Magistrate, but the coachman was discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How did the prisoner go with you? A. He was handcuffed; he asked me not to handcuff him, as no man would acknowledge that he had bought any thing of him, but I did not consider it was safe to take him without; I told the Magistrate I found 12l. 10s. on the coachman - I believe that was on the second examination - it was not till I had been cross-examined by the solicitor; the coachman was not then present.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publican, and live in Crown-street, Soho. On the 24th of December I packed up a hamper, containing the articles stated, and saw it safe in my shop between eleven and twelve o'clock that evening—I had sent it to the coach-office, to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> into the country, but it was shut up, and my man brought it back—I did not miss it till the po<lb></lb>liceman brought some of the things, about one o'clock on the morning of the 25th—this is part of the property—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>)—I have seen both the prisoners, but I cannot say I saw them at that time.</p>

On the 25th of Decem<lb></lb>ber, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, I observed the prisoner Wood passing hastily down Lawrence-lane, towards St. Giles's—he had something bulky in his pockets, and a bottle in his hand—I stopped him, and asked what he had got—I found he had some bottles of gin—he said, there were four of them—that he bought the contents of the hamper for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was not half of what was in it, and that he was to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his share—I looked round, and my brother officer had the other prisoner, with five more bottles in his hand, and this cocoa and other nuts.</p>

On the morning of the 25th of December I met the two prisoners—I saw Wood turn into Church-street—Thornton stopped him—I went after Carney—he was carrying one bottle in his hand—I took him back to Thornton, and he had got some bottles, nuts, and a cocoa-nut—the prisoners were taken to the station-house, and there Carney said to the Inspector that he was led into it by Wood—he said the same before the Magistrate—I found five bottles and a wax doll on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Romford, and deal in potatoes and peas. About eleven o'clock on the night of 22d June, I was going to London with a load of potatoes, and found a sieve of peas on the road belonging to Samuel Seabrook—I know him well, I put them on my cart, and drove on to over<lb></lb>take his wagon—I spoke to the man—he said they did not belong to him—I drove past the wagon with it, and saw four men in the road—the prisoner was one—he came and deliberately took the sieve from the back of my cart—I said, "What are you going to do with it?"—he said,"What is that to you?" or something of that kind—I called "Police!"—he said,"Don't make a noise about it; it fell off, and I pushed it up for the purpose of put<lb></lb>ting it on again"—it is impossible that it could have fallen off, if it had slipped it would have come into the cart—I gave him into custody.</p>

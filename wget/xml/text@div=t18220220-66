On the 31st of January, between eight and nine o'clock, in consequence of suspicions, which we had, while he was gone to breakfast, we weighed a parcel, which I had seen him do up for a friend of his, from whom we had several orders before, and he always took the opportunity of doing them up during the absence of every body. I found the order entered in the order book as 24 lbs. of coffee at one price, and 12 lbs. of another kind, and a loaf of lump sugar; he had called me to see the sugars weighed, which was right; on weighing the coffee there was an excess of 7 lbs - there was 43 lbs. instead of 36 lbs. The invoice was written in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200042"></xptr>consequence of the order entered by the prisoner, for 36 lbs. The parcel was put into the bag as before, and I went to the Mansion-house and got some officers, and on returning found the order was not to go till one o'clock, as he said his friend, Mr. Charles Tousley, (who he said the order was for,) was after a house in Piccadilly, and he, the prisoner would no longer be responsible for him, but if we went at one o'clock, Tousley would be at home, to pay himself. I desired the officers to return at one o'clock, which they did - Marchmont and Harrison waited a few yards off; I brought them in, and gave the prisoner in charge, while I followed our porter with the goods, keeping him in sight all the way; We watched him into No. 147, Ratcliff-highway; the name of Akers was over the door, in which name the prisoner had given us orders before, and afterwards said Tousley had succeeded him, and begged us to continue to supply Tousley on the same terms - I went into the shop, the same parcel was on the counter, and while I was there, a receipt was given to

               <p>"The person you call Tousley is Tucker, and she is your wife;" he did not deny it, but said he had been married since July, 1820 - he was then in custody, and acknowledged having done this two or three times, I said</p>
               <p>"You have certainly been defrauding us for a considerable time, for you have been married to this woman whom you call Tousley." he said,</p>
               <p>"Four or five times Sir, is the utmost, but I must have time." (by that I understood that he was confused.) He said,</p>
               <p>"You may search my premises, and see my books." I said</p>
               <p>"Your wife says you have no books" - he said he had a day book and bills; he was taken away; Marchmont and I then went to the house, and found his wife sorting bills, and in a small place, parted from the shop, we found five or six small parcels of sugar, and things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. He had been some time in your service - A. Nearly four years; I never saw Tousley.</p>
               <p>Q. Here are various receipts you have signed for money paid by Tousley - A. Yes; the coffee was ordered in the name of Tousley, the prisoner weighed the coffee first, and when I weighed it I found an excess.</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding that, it was delivered, and the money paid - A Yes; my servant had orders to deliver it, and receive the money. I did it to ascertain the fact.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you was paid, was the sum you received equivalent to 43 lbs. - A. No; only 36 lbs. The prisoner always said the goods were for Tousley's order.</p>

            . I am twelve years old, and am errand-boy to Mr. Wasp, a shoe-maker. On Saturday, the 14th of June, between four and five o'clock, Mr. Finch brought a letter and wanted to pay the postage; I took the letter to the prisoner at the bottom of the shop, and asked him the postage - he said, 7d.; I then took the letter back to Finch, who paid me 7d., and went out; I was going to mark the letter as paid - the prisoner came up, and took it out of my hand, with the postage, and told me to go to my own board; which I did, and saw no more of the money or letter - there was nobody else in the shop; (looking at the letter), this is the letter; this "Paid 7d." at the top of it, is my writing - on the Tuesday following I was sent out on an errand, and was going to take my pan-pipe with me; but my master told me to lay it down - I laid it down between my board and the prisoner's; I returned in about an hour, and could not find it; I asked the prisoner if he had seen it - he said, master had taken it from me, and would give it to me in the morning; I saw Johnson the female servant, and asked her about it - she knew nothing of it; I at times put bread and butter on my board, and always found it taken away - some was taken on the 16th of June.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The prisoner did not abscond? A. No; he was taken on the Wednesday - he seldom has his meals at the shop; he stays at home all Sunday - he does not sleep at master's; I saw my bread and butter found in the same place as the letters - it was in the shop in which the letters are received; I sometimes seal the letter bags - master always tells me when to begin to seal; I do not mean to say he is always present - the letters are put into a drawer; the key of which was lost when I first went there - it had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030036"></xptr>been found, and the drawer was locked on the Saturday in question; my mistress locked it - my master always managed the letters; we have a book to refer to, to find the rate of postage - a double letter to Tring, would be 1s. 2d.; I take in paid letters now and then - but have not done it since this has happened; I have been in master's service two months - the maid servant never marked letters, nor took them in; master's desk is sometimes left open.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. There is a box in which unpaid letters are put, is that locked? A. Yes; the key is kept in master's-desk; the paid letters are put through a slit into a drawer - the key of that is kept in the desk; the money is put into another drawer, over that - the money drawer has no lock; I saw the letters found under the further cutting-board in the shop, and my brend and butter was with them - we all work at that board.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Wasp. I first heard of Perry losing his pipe on Wednesday evening, the 18th of June, about a quarter to ten o'clock; I asked master about it - he said, he knew nothing about it; I then searched for it in the shop, and under the third board I found two letters - that produced is one of them, they laid together and were both open; I unfolded Mr. Finch's letter, and looked at the bill of exchange - I showed the bill to the prisoner and said "Dear me Thomas, do you know anything about these letters?" showing them to him; he said "I don't know anything about them" - I asked him to look at Mr. Finch's letter and he was so agitated he could not hold it; Mr. Thomas Wasp, Jun. was sitting in the warehouse and called me; I gave them to him - the prisoner staid about a quarter of an hour after this, then shut up the shop and went home as usual; after he was gone I took the candle and found another letter under the same board - it had fallen down; I found some bread and butter in the same place - next day (Thursday) the prisoner came to the shop as usual; I said "Dear me, Thomas, I have found another letter;" he said "Don't say anything about it now;" I had not put the letters or bread and butter there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was nobody present when the prisoner said "Don't say anything about it"? A. No; he had heard my master call me away the night before; he said nothing of the kind then; every body in the shop had access to the board - I have lived there twelve months; I never receive letters, nor seal the bags - the boy sometimes seals them; I never have received a single letter since I have been there - I never heard of the key of the drawer being mislaid; I did hear mistress mention it once - that is all; I know where the postage money is kept, because I saw Thomas once take it down - whether it is kept locked I cannot say; I do not know where the keys are kept - I did not know of the key being mislaid till after the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. When did your mistress mention about the key? A. About a week or a fortnight ago.</p>

            , JUN. My father keeps the receiving house at the corner of Chancery-lane; unpaid letters are put into a box at an opening outside the door - it is not always locked, for the key was mislaid for some time; the paid letters are brought in, and given to a person in the shop, who would put them through a hole at the top of the drawer - the postage would be put into another drawer above that; when we make up the bag we compare the amount of the paid letters with the money in the drawer - if they tally it is right; the money drawer is left open for the purpose of giving change. On Wednesday evening, the 18th of July, Johnson was in the shop talking to the prisoner; I did not hear what she said; she came to me and complained of the prisoner having had the boy's pan-pipe - she was searching for it; the prisoner was shutting up at the time - she found these two letters, which were brought to me (looking at them); they were open, and the wafers quite dry; I immediately told the prisoner it was a very serious thing, and whoever had done it would be placed in a very serious situation, and a very strict investigation must follow - he said indistinctly that he did not care what investigation took place; he kept shutting up the shop, and paid little attention to what I said - he was going away without shutting up the inside shutters, and was called back by Johnson to do them; he appeared in a hurry to get away - a customer came in after he was gone, and Johnson brought me a third letter; the letters were found on a shelf under the cutting-board - I did not place them there; the mark of 9d. on the third letter, to the best of my belief, is in the prisoner's writing - it is not the writing of any other person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where do you keep the keys of the letter-boxes? A. In a drawer in my desk, at the very end of the warehouse, for safety sake; the desk is not kept locked - no one has any business there: every body in the shop has access to it; the paid letter-box was locked on the 14th of June, I am certain, and it was usually kept locked, but the key was missing; it might be missing for six months; I did not get another lock, as there was nobody in the shop but my family, the prisoner, and Perry; I am seldom at home except for about two hours in the afternoon, to make up the bag. I believe inquiry was made about the house for the key, but I do not know - it might have been missing only three months; the boy may have sealed the four o'clock bag of letters, in the presence of some of the family, but not alone; I have at times been absent when it was sealed.</p>
               <p>Q. After you told him a strict investigation should be made, did he not return on the Monday, as usual? A. I understood so - he lived in Great Queen-street; there was nothing to prevent his carrying the letters away, or destroying them.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. A customer was in the shop when he left, was not that the cause of his leaving the inside shutters? A. He left before the customer came; he had lived with us about three months.</p>

            . Q. You showed the prisoner the letters that night, did not you? - A. Yes, before I showed them to my master; master spoke to him about it, and he said he knew nothing about it; he was going away without shutting up the inside shutters - I have at times put them up myself, when there was nobody to do it - I forget whether I called him back.</p>
               <p>JOHN WASP. I am the son Mr. Wasp, and reside with him. It is my duty to make up the letters - the bag is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030037"></xptr>made up at five o'clock. On the 14th of June, I made up the paid letters: this is my money bill (looking at it) it is my writing: the paid letter drawer was locked that day, I am certain - to the best of my recollection the money tallied with the letters: sometimes there is a 6d. or so taken out to give change in the business, and if so I always ascertain that it was so taken out; I do not think it happened that day - I did not put these letters under the board.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The money drawer is always open? A. Yes, for we have to give change for almost every paid letter; the key of the letter-box might be lost for two months, not six; the key of the paid letter-box was found six or seven weeks since - I cannot tell when it was lost; I made inquiry about it, and have no doubt but I asked the servant about it, for I made a general inquiry; I never remember the boy sealing the paid letters; I am not absent once in two months; the prisoner never absconded, but was apprehended at our house - the boy has sealed the four o'clock bag, which are unpaid letters.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS here contended that this indictment could not be sustained by the evidence; the prisoner was not employed by the Post-office, according to the meaning of the Act, nor was the property taken out of the shop; which, in this case, must be considered the office, the letter never having been deposited in any letter-box. - The Court held these objections to be good.</p>

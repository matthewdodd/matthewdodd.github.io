            . On the 9th of June, on Sunday evening, I was coming from Kentish Town, to London; I was walking in the foot path, in the field on this side <placeName id="t17710703-24-crimeloc144">Pancrass church yard</placeName>

I kept my guard; I wanted to draw my sword; but had not an opportunity, least, if I dropt my guard, they should get in upon me; I struck the other man a violent blow on the side of his head, which I believe stuned him; after that as I retreated back he did not advance upon me; this man advanced faster than the other; I changed my stick to my left hand; I thought it my only opportunity to draw my sword; he advanced upon me; he went to make a blow at me, I stept forward and took him a lone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner cock his pistol again?</p>
               <p>Mr. Croker. I imagine not; I kept them in action; I believe they had not an opportunity: after I had made my lunge, having-but just hold of my sword, my sword went out of my hand, I flew up to him, took him by the collar and pulled my sword out of his body, with my left hand; as soon as I had done that, he never spoke but dropt upon his face; when I had drawn my sword out of his body, I was looking to see where the other was; I had lost him, I saw him behind me; I went up to him and said, d - n you, I am ready for you now, advance; as I went towards him, away he went; then he called out to his companion, d - n me, come along.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he see him fall?</p>
               <p>Mr. Croker. I do not know, the prisoner lay upon the ground about half a minute; he got up and went two or three yards and down he dropt again; I did not know the consequence of my staying to take him; I went away and left him there; next day I went to Sir

            . I am a surgeon in St. Bartholomew's hospital; last Sunday threeweeks, the 9th of June about twelve o'clock the prisoner was brought into the hospital; I asked him what was the matter with him; he told me he was wounded in his breast; I asked him how, he told me a coming over the fields, between Pancrass and the Small pox hospital, he was stopt by a couple of footpads, who demanded his money, that he told them he was a poor man and had none; they insisted upon searching his pockets: he told them they should not; upon that one of them stabbed him with a tuck; upon which he fell to the ground, and they then searched his pockets; finding nothing in his pockets they took away his shoes and coat; that he lay sometime before he was able to get up; he got up at last with difficulty; got home, and from there was brought to the hospital; the wound was on the right side between the fifth and sixth rib, it went obliquely downwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it seem to be done with?</p>
               <p>Mr. Iveside. A three edged instrument, and probably a tuck.</p>

               <p>I went out to take a walk along with a particular acquaintance of mine, that I know on the other side of the water, at the time I made an elopement from my wife; he was going into the country asked me to take a walk with him; I condescended to go part of the way with him; we went towards Hampstead, we stopt by the way and had a glass at some of the houses: it was rather late when I got home, it was about half after ten o'clock, when I met with these two men, and received the wound; one was rather behind the other; the first man that came up collared me; he tript up my heels and demanded my money; I told them I was a poor man, I worked hard for my bread and had none; he insisted to have it; he took about nine shillings and some odd halfpence out of my pocket; I changed half a guinea at a house before I left it; he took the silver out of my pocket, and left I believe two or three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030032"></xptr> halfpence, which they found in that waistcoat pocket, when I was carried to the hospital; after they got the money they wanted my cloaths, which I refused to give them; one of the men stabbed me with some instrument in a stick, as I took to be a tuck, or whatever they call it; I fell down, and got up, it deprived me partly of my senses; they stript me of my coat, hat, and shoes; I had plated buckels in my shoes, which I suppose they thought silver. I made the best of my way home; when I had recovered myself I met a couple of people upon the way; I begged them by the tender mercies of God to assist me in prayer, for I was a dead man I believed; they left me; I went away as fast as I could; when I got home they sent for a surgeon; the surgeon said I was stabbed by some means or other; they said as I was a poor man and not able to pay the expences, they would take me into the hospital; my friends carried me to the hospital; the next day this gentleman came and said, I was a man that stopt him upon the high-way and made an attempt to rob him; it was well known I always was a hard working man, and worked hard for my bread; I have no witnesses: I am a <rs id="t17710703-24-deflabel145" type="occupation">shoe maker</rs>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Monday last I lost all the property mentioned in the indictment, about two in the day, the prisoner was brought into my back shop for me to search her; I drew her cloak on one side and she had a piece of muslin under her arm, it was plain muslin, I imagine there was about five or six yards; it was a remarkable wide muslin; it was my property, I know it by the shop mark at the end of it, D. A. it is my writing.</p>
               <p>Court. When you send goods out of your shop do you ever send them with the marks on them? - Yes, if we send the ends on; I never had but two pieces of such muslin in my life, it is a very uncommon muslin, I had them about three weeks or a month: I asked her if she had any thing more about her, she declared she had not; I put my hand on her pocket on the other side of her petticoat, and felt something rather bulky, and I desired she would take every thing out of her pocket; she did so, and pulled out an apron belonging to me, it was a flowered muslin apron.</p>
               <p>Court. What did the piece of plain muslin cost you? - I have under valued it, it cost me fifteen shillings a yard; the apron is worth six or seven shillings; there was no mark upon it, we have been so much engaged lately we have not had time to mark our goods: I did not miss it till it was taken out of the prisoner's pocket; in consequence of that I sent for a constable, and he secured her; she declared she had nothing more about her, but he found a piece of tambour muslin upon her, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110083"></xptr> I knew by the marks: I saw the things within forty-eight hours before.</p>
               <p>KNIGHT BOWMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a journey man to Mr. Leake; this woman came into my master's shop on Monday last, and asked to look at some printed cottons; it was about two o'clock; she said it was for a bed-gown; she then went up to the counter, and laid her clock over several of the things that were on the counter, I saw her do that.</p>

               <p>In what manner? - She spread it a little over the things with her hands under it; I then shewed her several printed cottons, I suspected the woman as soon as she came into the shop; I believe she had one hand on the counter, I did not see how the other hand was employed, but her cloak was covered over it; I then shewed her several cottons, which rather hid her still more.</p>
               <p>Did not she move her cloak before you served her? - Very little; I served her, she appeared to be very difficult, and upon turning my head several times, I once thought I saw her pick something from the ground, not for a certainty, but it appeared so to me, I saw her near the ground, putting something in her pocket, but I was not certain whether she took it from the ground or not; I then observed a finer piece of muslin lay by the side of her.</p>
               <p>Was that the muslin that was missing afterwards? - Yes, that was the plain muslin; on turning my head to look for some more printed cotton, I soon missed this piece of muslin, and soon after that she bought one yard of the printed cottons; she appeared to stoop before I missed the muslin.</p>
               <p>Might she have taken the muslin at that time? - She might, I missed it just after; she bought one yard, I observed to her it was not a sufficient quantity for a bed-gown; she then said, that was quite a sufficient quantity for her purpose; she would buy it for a frock, and if I would give her a pattern of one that was on the counter, she would shew it to a person; I accordingly gave her a pattern; she paid for the cotton, and went out of the shop; I immediately got over the counter and followed her, as soon as she had got seven or eight yards, and brought her back to my master, and informed him, then the constable was sent for; but before that my master began to examine her in my presence, and he threw open her cloak, and found the muslin under her arm, and all passed as he has described.</p>
               <p>Were these things on the counter too? - I cannot answer only for the plain muslin.</p>
               <p>Did the plain muslin and the fine muslin lay together in the shop? - I am sure they did not, I saw the plain muslin before me; it was covered a little with her apron; I stood shewing her more cottons, but she covered several worked muslin with the cottons, but the plain muslin lay alone, I suppose it might be a yard from it.</p>
               <p>Can you swear with certainty that the piece of worked muslin and the plain muslin were in the shop? - I can swear that the plain muslin was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave myself to the mercy of the Court.</p>

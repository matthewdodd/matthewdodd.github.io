            . The prisoner was married pretty near two years ago to a woman of Deptford, whose maidess name I have forgot.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they married, and by whom?</p>
               <p>Douglas. At St. Margaret's, Westminster, by the Reverend Mr. Atwood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you by at the time?</p>
               <p>Douglas. I gave her away in marriage.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know her name if you hear it?</p>
               <p>Douglas. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it Sarah Walley ?</p>
               <p>Douglas. Yes; her father is a sail maker at Deptford.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her last?</p>
               <p>Douglas. I saw her on the 19th of last month.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she then alive ?</p>
               <p>Douglas. She was living then.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see her on the 19th of last month ?</p>
               <p>Douglas. In St. Thomas's-Hospital, in the Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she ill?</p>
               <p>Douglas. I believe she was in a salivation there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been there?</p>
               <p>Douglas. I don't know how long.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they usually let men go to see women there in salivations ?</p>
               <p>Douglas. Nobody endeavoured to hinder me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go on purpose to see her?</p>
               <p>Douglas. I was going that way, and I met with the last wife's brother, who desired me to go in and see if it was the woman that Mr. Fry was married to. She told me she would not appear against him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Atwood. Do you recollect seeing this witness before?</p>
               <p>Atwood. I remember him more particularly than I do the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you marry him by licence or by banns?</p>
               <p>Atwood. By banns. I remember that witness giving the woman away. Here is his name to the register, as a witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his face ?</p>
               <p>Atwood. I do.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you publish the banns?</p>
               <p>Atwood. They were duly published three times, which is always entered in the banns book by the person that publishes them. This was three times entered.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose hand were they entered?</p>
               <p>Atwood. I don't remember whether they were published the three times by me, or by any clergyman that officiated for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you, upon your cath, say you publish'd it any one of the times?</p>
               <p>Atwood. I can't be positive to that, but I can positively swear they were asked, because I have seen them entered in the book. Every Sunday, after the banns is ask'd, the clerk brings me the banns book, when I put down, '' Asked on such '' a day of the month, by me,

               <p>The woman that I was married to first went away from me on a quarrel, betwixt twelve and one o'clock one night, and I have never heard of her since. She left me a young child. I sent a letter to her parents, and after that went to her mother, who told me her daughter would never see my face more. I since heard she was gone to North-America, and after that her mother told me she was actually dead. After that I happen'd to fall in company with this woman, who was more fond of me than I was of her. Nothing would do but I must marry her, and she has intirely ruined both my character and trade.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Onosiphorus Gardner. The prisoner at the bar desired me to go with him once to Deptford, to see his wife's father and mother.</p>
               <p>Q. What are their names?</p>
               <p>Gardner. I can't tell that. I was there, I believe, about two hours, and talk'd to the mother very much; her daughter being gone away from her husband, and not to be found.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you inquire for?</p>

            . I have only known the prisoner since he married the widow Paterson.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character ?</p>
               <p>Campbell. I never heard a bad one of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear a good one of him?</p>
               <p>Campbell. I heard he was a little given to drinking. The widow Paterson was a tenant of mine. After they had been married six weeks or two months, she came to me, and asked me to be so kind as to lend her husband 10 l. that she might get him arrested, and sell her goods and get clear of him, for she was afraid of being murder'd.</p>

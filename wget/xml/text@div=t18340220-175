            . I am a foreman of the engineers to Mr. John Seaward and Co. - on Saturday, the 4th of January, I ordered two quarters and eight pounds of copper bolts to be sent to the smiths' forge were Millard worked, to be cut up for melting, and to be returned to the brass shop - I was engaged in my vice shop, turning - about an hour afterwards I saw Millard near the brass shop, with a piece of copper bolt in his hand, which he appeared to be playing with - I followed him to the edge of the wharf, and saw him endeavouring to put something under his apron - I went to the brass shop and weighed the metal - I missed six pounds of copper bolt - I saw Millard leave the premises at one o'clock to go to dinner - I followed him to Salmon-lane, and went into a new beer-shop, opposite Hopson's premises - I saw Millard pass his premises, and then return back - Hopson has two shops, one is a harness shop, and one an iron shop - Hopson was standing at the door of the harness shop - Millard passed him and went into the iron shop - I afterwards went into Hopson's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How soon did you go? A. I should think in about five minutes - the policeman went in before me, and afterwards beckoned me over - I saw some copper bolt, which the policeman said Hopson took from the scale - when Hopson was told he must go to the station-house he said, "Let us go out at the back door, at all events."</p>

             (police-constable). On the 4th of January, I was directed to watch Millard - when he left his master's, he went home, to a street I do not know the name of - he came out in about ten minutes, and went to Hopson's shop - he went in at the iron shop-door - I did not see Hopson then - there is a kitchen at the back of the harness shop, and you go through the iron shop, and turn to the left hand to go to it - I went in in about a minute and a half after Millard; I saw him standing on one side of the table, and Hopson on the other - the cloth was laid for dinner, and, on the cloth, stood a small weighing machine, and this copper was in the scale - as soon as I got to the door, Hopson grabbed the copper off the scale with his right hand - there was a four-pound weight and a small weight in the other scale, and he took the small weight in his left hand, and put both his hands behind him - he went back a few paces, and stood against the wall - there was no other person in the room but the housekeeper - I asked Hopson, two or three times, what he had in his hands - he said, "Nothing" - I pulled his hands forward, and found these three pieces of copper in his right hand, and this two-pound weight in his left - the copper weighed about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200102"></xptr>six pounds - I said he must go with me - he asked if I was an officer, as I was not in uniform - I said I was - he did not say anything to Millard or to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray recollect yourself - did he say anything to you? A. Yes; he said was there no way of settling it; was there no way of making it up? - I said so to the magistrate - I do not remember his saying anything more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything to you on the road to the station-house? A. In going to Lambeth-street, he said it was in my power to make it as easy as I liked, and he was very sorry I was not a moment later - I asked him, why? - he said he was going to throw it into the street - I went back to his house, after he was in the station, and found this chisel and drill - Millard was taken to the station, and a half-crown, a shilling, and a sixpence, were found on him - there is a board up at Hopson's shop with the prices he gives for different things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is on the board? A."Copper, 6d., brass, 5d." - I think every one can see it - I have stated the same here as I did at the police-office - my words were taken down and read over to me, and I was desired to sign it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure you told the magistrate that he said he was about to throw the copper into the street, that he said, "Is there no way of settling it?" and that he said it was in your power to make it as easy as you liked? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been in the police? A. Four years - there were two examinations, and the depositions were taken on the second examination - on the first time they were taken in a book.</p>

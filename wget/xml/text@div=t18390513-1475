                  </hi>. I am a carter to Mr. Nash, of Hillingdon. About five o'clock in the morning of the 14th of April, I missed from a truss and a half to two trusses of clover bay, from a rick about fifty yards from his house—there were traces of it from the hedge where it was taken over to the road, and then in the road—Broadway followed the track—I afterwards saw some clover hay, which was a little musty—it was just like my master's.</p>

I was going to work, and saw some hay littered in the road—it led up to the prisoner's house—I went with Weedon the constable, and found some hay in a hovel on the prisoner's premises, exactly like the rick of my master—it was clover hay, and a little musty—I know the rick well—I had cut some some time before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. I went to the prisoner's gate, and found there had been clover bay carried in there, and found the hay in a shed in the garden—there were 75lbs.—the witness brought a sample from the rick—it appeared to me to be the same kind, and a little musty.</p>

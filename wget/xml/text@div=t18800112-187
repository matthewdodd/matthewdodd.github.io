                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). On 24th December, about 1 p.m., I was with another constable in the Blackfriars Road—we were in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner and another man—I stopped the prisoner and said, "I want to speak to you"—he faced me and I said, "We are police officers. You answer the description of a man who passed a florin at a coffee-stall the other night. Have you any bad money about you?"—he said, "No, not as I am aware of"—I took hold of his right hand and said, "I shall see what you have got about you"—I put my hand in his outside coat pocket, and took from it a piece of thin brown paper with a florin wrapped in it—I said, "This looks like bad"—he said, "Yes, it is; I picked it up last night"—I said, "Have you any others?"—he said, "No, not that I am aware of"—I unbuttoned his great-coat—the other constable put his hand in his right-hand waistcoat pocket, and took out a piece of paper with three bad florins in it, all wrapped separately in a long slip of newspaper—I said, "These are bad also"—he said nothing—I said, "I shall take you to the statio"—he said, "All right; I picked them all up last night in the road in a tin box.</p>

               <p>I knew they were bad, but I did not know what to do with them"—I said, "Have you the tin box?"—he said, "No, I throw it away"—I took him to the station—he said that he did not know where he lived, but it was in a lodging-house—I said, "Do you know what has become of the other man?"—he said, "No; I was only just speaking about the weather; I just over<lb></lb>look him as you came up."</p>

                  </hi>. These florins are all counterfeit, and these two in paper are from the same mould as the one taken from the prisoner's coat pocket—the coins are blackened over after they are finished, and then packed up in paper to keep them from rubbing, and before they utter them they rub the blackness off.</p>

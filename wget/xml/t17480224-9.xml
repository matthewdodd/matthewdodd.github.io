The Prisoner came into our shop one night, towards dusk, about three weeks ago, under pretence of buying a shift; there was another with her, and the other kept us in discourse while the Prisoner, as I believe, took a piece of check off the shelf. As I was going down Rag-Fair I met this woman and another , each with an apron of the same check; I had not missed it above an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there of it?</p>
               <p>Evett. Thirteen yards of yard and half wide<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174802240010"></xptr> cotton check. I missed it the next morning, about an hour before I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when you saw them with these aprons on?</p>
               <p>Evett. I seized them, got a constable, and took up this woman; she was in many tones; first that she bought it for two shillings and three shillings; and several tales she was in, and at last she owned the taking it, and where it was sold.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say she sold it?</p>
               <p>Evett. Next door to the Crooked Billet, in Rosemary-Lane , to a Gentlewoman who bought it to make shirts of.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Linstead. I live next door to the Crooked Billet, in Rosemary-Lane; the Prisoner at the bar came, with a person she called her mistress along with her, to my door; my maid called me, and told me two women wanted me; they asked me if I would buy a remnant of check; I asked them what they would have for it, they said twelve shillings, and that there was better than eight yards: I told them I would give them eight shillings ; they said they had brought it out of pawn for nine shillings ; I told them to pawn it again, for in my way I could not afford any more: They went away once or twice, and came back again, and took eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the eight shillings?</p>
               <p>Linstead . I laid it on the counter; I do not know which of them took it.</p>

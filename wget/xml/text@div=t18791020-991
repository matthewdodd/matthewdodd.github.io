I am medical officer of the Wandsworth Infirmary—Stone was brought in on 30th August—I found a clean cut deep wound in the face in front of the ear, implicating the nerves of the face and the temporal artery; also several superficial wounds on the neck and face and a wound on the left hand, a severe wound about 2 1/2 inches long—I found several recent bruises on the arms and body and thighs and face—the wounds were such as might have been caused by the table knife produced.</p>

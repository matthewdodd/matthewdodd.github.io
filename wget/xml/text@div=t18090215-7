            . I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's parish. On the 30th of January I was on my duty in Greenhill's Rents; I saw the prisoner sitting on a cask, he said he was going to carry it to the Pied Bull, Islington; he wanted a coach for his master; and while I was speaking to him, a coach came to the corner of Greenhill's Rents; he took the cask up, I said where did you get that cask from, he said a man gave it him at the corner of Long lane; he wanted me to lay hold of it, and lift it upon his shoulder; I would not; I thought if I took the cask, he would run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure the prisoner - A. Yes, I took him to the watchouse. This is the same cask.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Windus. Mr. Windus lives about four or five hundred yards from where the cask was found; it had been in the warehouse, I had seen it within the hour; I cannot say whether the door of the warehouse was open or not; there were some people that came in the warehouse when the cask was supposed to be taken; it is Mr. Windus's cask, it contains six gallons; I marked the cask myself; it is valued at three pounds, that is less than prime cost. The warehouse adjoins the dwelling house, there is an internal communication.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

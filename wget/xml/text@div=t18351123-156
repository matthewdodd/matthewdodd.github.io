                  </hi>. I am a broker, and have lived at Deptford, about fifteen months. I knew where the prisoners live—I know Stagg—I have seen him come to the prisoner's house, eight or nine times, with lead—I have seen the lead.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the service of Mr. Young, a grocer, in Deptford. I know Stagg—my house is directly opposite the prisoner's—In October last, I saw Stagg go to Bayley's house—he had a wheelbarrow with him, and a bag in it, containing some very heavy susbstance—he called Thomas Bayley to assist in taking it out of the barrow—I saw Stagg go away afterwards, and he took the bag and barrow away with him—I have seen him go to the shop about half-a-dozen times, in the course of the last twelve months.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly Mr. Bayley's servant. In October last I called there, and saw Stagg there—he brought some lead for sale—It was in the morning—the lead was put on the counter—I believe it was weighed, but I am not certain.</p>

On the 12th of June, about ten o'clock at night, I was on duty, in plain clothes, round Drury-lane Theatre, in consequence of the Queen's going there—I saw the prisoners in the crowd—Barry attempted several pockets—Leonard followed close behind him—I watched them to Drury-lane, and then saw Leonard attempt several pockets—they went on the pavement—a gentleman and lady were coming down—they turned, and followed them—Barry went behind, took something from the gentleman's pocket, and put it into his own trowsers—he waited on the other side, and made a sign for Leonard to come over to him—I then went and spoke to the gentleman—he went to the station, and wrote his name Wil<lb></lb>liam Scott—I heard him say his name was William Scott, in the prisoner's presence—Barry was taken by Morgan, and I saw this handkerchief fall from him.</p>

I was requested by West to watch—I saw Barry in Brydges-street attempt several pockets—Leonard was close behind him—I watched them into Drury-lane, and saw them both attempt several gentlemen's pockets—a lady and gentleman were coming down—Barry went immediately behind him, put his hand to the back of his pocket, and then put his hand into his pocket, and took this handkerchief out—I did not hear the gentleman's name—I saw him sign it—I seized Barry, and put my hand to his flap, to get the handkerchief—he drew on the other side, and threw it down on the ground.</p>

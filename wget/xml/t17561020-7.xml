               <p>Q. How long was he your servant?</p>
               <p>Vanhonrigh. Above three years. My cloaths were in boxes and trunks in my lodgings.</p>

               <p>Vanhonrigh. I lost four suits of cloaths, I can't say how many shirts. There were five coats, two silk waistcoats, and two cloth ones, a pair of silver spurs, a pair of boots, and some silk stockings missing.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them?</p>
               <p>Vanhonrigh. I did not miss them till he absented himself and wrote me a letter, giving me an account of them, the 7th instant; that he was in distress, and had pawn'd them for twelve guineas. These were cloaths that I did not often wear, so I did not miss them before. I had him taken up on the 9th. I brought him before justice Fielding, and there he told me where he had pawn'd them, being at four places.</p>
               <p>Q. Name the persons names.</p>
               <p>Vanhonrigh. Mr. Morris, Mr. Brooks, Mr. Ashburnham, and Mr. Parker. They are all here, and the cloaths.</p>

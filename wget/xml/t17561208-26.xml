               <p>William Vaughan. I was below in my cellar on the 2th of November, in the afternoon, cutting some wood. I heard somebody go into my shop, which I thought to be a customer; I hearkened a little time, to hear if my wife went into the shop. I went up into the shop, and there I saw the prisoner at the bar, behind my counter. I asked him what he wanted. He held up his hand, and said '' Say nothing, and I'll give you half'' I said, what will you give me half of, and as I was going round the counter he put 5 s. 6 d. into my hand; then I laid hold of him. He shew'd me the place where he took the money, which was out of a till.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you lock the till?</p>
               <p>Vaughan. There was never a lock upon it. I had ordered a neighbour to put one upon it some little time before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the till drawn out?</p>
               <p>Vaughan. The till was standing on the ground. There were in it about ten or twelve shillings in half-pence.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner about two years since he came from sea. His father and mother live near me. I never heard any thing of this kind of him before.</p>

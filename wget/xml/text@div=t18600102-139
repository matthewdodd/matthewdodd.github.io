                  </hi>. I reside at 4, Douglas-place, Northampton-row, Clerk<lb></lb>en well, and am a sub-warder in the Middlesex House of Correction, Cold<lb></lb>bath-fields—on the morning of 9th December the prisoner was in the prison—I was on duty overlooking him and other prisoners cleaning; it was the middle flight of stairs of the second misdemeanour prison they were sweeping—they had done stoning, and had put the stones on the top of the staircase—they had all done except the prisoner; he was engaged in cleaning with the stones—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are similar to the stones used—they are used for rubbing the floors—this was about a quarter-past 11 in the morning—I desired the prisoner to stone the steps down, and, being very wet over night, they were very dirty, and he did them very badly—I was going down the stone steps, and saw they were not clean, and I desire him to do them over again—as I was walking down the stairs, I had got about two or three steps below the prisoner, I heard something fall; I looked towards where the other prisoners were employed, and asked them to be more careful, or they would hit me on the head—before I had scarcely got the words from my mouth I received a blow on the head which knocked me against the wall almost insen<lb></lb>sible, and the prisoner rushed on me, and hammered me, and violently used me, and kicked me about different parts of my body, which roused me again—I caught hold of the collar of his coat and waistcoat, and held him till the other prisoners came to my assistance—after they had got hold of him I went, down stairs and called to them to come down, so that I could get some</p>

               <p>assistance, for I was in the building by myself—the prisoner was secured by the other prisoners—my head bled very much—I was Btruck with one of the stones—he kicked me about my shoulders and chest while struggling with him, and after I had got hold of him by the collar he kicked me three times in the private parts; but the distance was almost too short to do me much injury—at the time he was striking me he said, "Do it again"—repeating the words I had said to him, and he kept punching me all the time he was saying those words.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the House of Correction on 9th December—I was engaged with the prisoner and some others in cleaning the floors—the last witness, Hughes, was there—I was standing at the bottom of the stain witli my back towards the officer and the prisoner, when I heard one of the stones drop before me, I looked round and saw Mr. Hughes staggering against the wall—I went up towards him, and while going towards him I saw the prisoner kick him twice in the body—I pulled a handkerchief out of my pocket, and placed it on Mr. Hughes' head—he was bleeding very much indeed; it flew all over the wall.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the House of Correction on 9th December—two or three minutes before my attention was called to the stairs, I heard the officer tell the prisoner to be particular in cleaning the stones from the edge of the stairs, which it seems he neglected—my attention was called to the circumstance through hearing a deep inspiration, a kind of hiss—I put my head round the wall that supports the floor of the upper passages and saw the prisoner in the act of striking, with a stone in his right hand, the head of the officer—it missed the officer and struck the wall, out of which it took a large piece—the stone in his right hand fell to the ground—with the one in his left he began beating the officer at the back of his head on the right side—they were stones similar to these produced—I was about three stairs higher up—I went down and threw my arms round the prisoner; being stronger than I, he managed to fling me off in a great de<lb></lb>gree, and threw me backwards against the stairs—I immediately put my arms round him again—he said, "Let me get at him; let me get at him; I will darken him"—there were two or three other prisoners in the build<lb></lb>ing helping us and I immediately called out by number to one above me to come down stairs, which he did directly, and he said "He is in a fit"—the prisoner replied, "No I am not in a fit; let me get at him"—there was a cell pot placed on the stairs ready for removal and he struggled very much to get at that, saying, "Let me have it, I will darken him."</p>

I live at 52, Russell-square, and am surgeon to the House of Correction—I examined Henry Hughes at the infirmary on 9th December—there was a severe wound behind the right ear, rather more than an inch in length—it was not very deep—it was not so much the se<lb></lb>verity of the wound as the concussion consequent on the blow that he was labouring under—the wound was precisely such as would be inflicted by such a stone as this—he has been under my care since—he has never been able to return to his duty, he was so severely shaken by the blow.</p>

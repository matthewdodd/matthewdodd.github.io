               <p>Q. What did you give him for them?</p>

               <p>Wilson. I gave at the rate of 2d per lb.</p>

               <p>Q. What weight did you buy of him?</p>

               <p>Wilson. One 100 and 15 lb. (produced in court.)</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think these were yours before?</p>

               <p>Wilson. I can swear they were my hoops and stolen out of my yard; we took up the prisoner and he confessed he stole them out of my yard before justice Bury and justice Scot.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the prisoner access to your yard?</p>

               <p>Wilson. He had free access there.</p>

               <p>Q. What were the words he made use of?</p>

               <p>Wilson. He said he took them out of my yard, from the place where I used to lay them.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that confession taken in writing?</p>

               <p>Wilson. It was, I saw him sign it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it done freely of his own accord, without any threatening or promises?</p>

               <p>Wilson. It was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the justices both sign it?</p>

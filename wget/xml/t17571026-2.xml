            . The prisoner was my lodger; I lost the things mention'd on a Saturday night, but don't know what day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. From whence did you lose them?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. The watch was in a drawer, and the other things were in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the drawer lock'd?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the things again?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. The prisoner was gone when they were missing. I went after him and took him in Broad St. Giles's, at which time he had my watch in his pocket, my breeches on, and my shirt was in his bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175710260003"></xptr>Lloyd. He own'd he took them.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room where the things, where you or where the prisoner lay?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. They were in the room where the prisoner lay.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lodged with you?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Not above nine days or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known him?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I had known him no longer. I thought him to be a very honest man.</p>
               <p>The constable produced the things.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are all my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>On the Saturday night I paid my prosecutor's wife for my lodging. I ask'd her where my shirts and stockings where. She said my stockings lay on a chair, and my shirts were in a basket in the room where I lay, which stood on the chest of drawers; there were three in number; I took them up and thought they were all my own; these breeches lay on my bed, which I took and put on instead of my own, by mistake: As for the watch that never was his, it is my own, and he had lent me two guineas upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at this watch again, whose is it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I bought this watch of the prisoner for two guineas and a half, and was to have it a week upon trial. I paid him two guineas, and was to give him half a guinea more if it pleased me; if not, I was to have my money again, and he his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these breeches lying on the prisoner's bed?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, they were not; they were hanging on a nail.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the shirt?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That was in a basket on the chest of drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your wife wash his linen for him?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She did; he had but three shirts of his own, which he took, and mine too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave his breeches behind him?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, he did not; his breeches were in his bundle when we took him; he had cut the buckle and strap off my breeches behind, that I should not know them, and tied them with a string. ( The buckle and strap produced.)</p>

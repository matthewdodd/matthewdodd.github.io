I came at half after seven, on the morning of the 4th, when I came in the shop the first thing that I saw was Mr. Hobey, he was looking at the pane of glass which was broken above the shutters, I looked and found there were boots missing that had been there the night before.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden office; on the 4th of January I took charge of the prisoner at Mr. Wilson's shop; I searched him, I found nothing upon him. I went the next day to search the prisoner's house; he told me himself where he lived, he directed me to No. 8, Crispin-street, Spital-fields, he said he lived below, in the lower part of the house. These are the boots I had at Mr. Wilson's shop; I found nothing at all at the prisoner's lodgings. While I was there a letter came from New Prison; this is the letter, it says, as there will be some gentleman there put the things out of the way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you not know that upon the oath you have taken, you are not bound to tell that - A. I do not know it; I was desired by the magistrate to mention it.</p>
               <p>COURT. There is nothing in that letter - A. I received the boots from a person of the name of Mills.</p>
               <p>- MILLS. Q. Where did you get these boots that you delivered to Read - A. I saw the boots delivered by Chivers into Mr. Hobey's son's hands; I received them again from Mr. Hobey jun. and delivered them to Read. Mr. Hobey is the maker of them boots; I am sure that I cut them to a measure of a customer of Mr. Hobey whose name is Williams.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say that Chivers brought back that pair of boots to Mr. Hobey - A. I have swore that; I can swear to them because they have my hand-writing, it is marked over here, but upon that part it is quite plain.</p>
               <p>Q. There are clerks who do business in the shop, can you say they were not purchased and delivered - You cannot say how many pairs were delivered out of the name of Williams - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mears. Q. to Shilston. Look at them boots A. These boots are of the same description, and Williams was wrote in chalk on the bottom.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. And because you find no chalk mark now, you swear more positively to them - A. No, they were boots of that description.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you know whether these boots had ever been delivered - A. No, they had never been delivered, I had seen them on the over night, and about half after seven o'clock in the morning these boots were missing.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HOBEY. I am perfectly sensible the boots are of my own manufactory, they were made for Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090037"></xptr>Williams, he was out of town, they hung up in my shop until called for, or to be sent to him when he wrote for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you after your men left work sent any boots out to Mr. Williams - A. Never. They cost me as near as I can calculate from three to four and forty shillings, I sell them for two pound fourteen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The prisoner was a stranger to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep a good many men we all know - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These men go away at various hours of the night - A. Eight o'clock is the hour for all to go excepting one man I pay to stay to see the fires all out.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing you had seen these boots at any distant part of the kingdom, should you have known they were of your manufactory - A. I should.</p>
               <p>Q. You never carry out boots yourself do you - A. Oh yes, I do, I will bring you a pair if you please.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mears. According to the routine of business, as it is kept in your warehouse, would there have been the least possibility of any person being in possession of these boots that were made for a person that never called for them - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the time I brought them boots to Mr. Wilson, I asked Mr. Wilson if they suited him he asked me what I asked for them, I told him thirty-five shillings; he looked at them a great while and then said, which way did you come by these boots, I told him I bought them, he said, where did you buy them, I said, I did not know, the boots might be cabbaged I could not tell, I gave thirty shillings for them, I could not tell whether they were cabbaged or what. The last pair of boots I sold to Mr. Wilson was for a one pound note, I bought them in Petticoat-lane. He asked me where I lived, I told him I kept a shop in Monmouth-street, I stopped in it three weeks, I was obliged to pay twelve shillings a week for the shop.</p>
               <p>Wilson. The prisoner never sold me any boots before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say the prisoner never sold you any boots - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived at the corner of that place - A. Seven years, and in the neighbourhood twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Limebeer of Fleet-street - A. I do not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray has he had any suit against you at law - A. Yes, I know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you were you ever in this court before - A. I have three or four months ago.</p>

About 11 p.m., Saturday, 12th July, I was with Sergeants Smith and Waller in Mile End Road, and saw the three prisoners and some women standing together, apparently examining something—when within 5 or 6 yards of them they saw us, and Maskell and Goodwin moved off towards Jubilee Street—Thompson backed himself against the shutters of a shop which was closed, and tried to sidle off in another direction—Waller caught Goodwin, and Smith caught Thompson—the three prisoners were brought together, and I said, "What have you got about you?"—Thompson said, "Nothing"—I then took this new watch</p>

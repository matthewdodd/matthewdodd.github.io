                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor in this case, and live at 3, Cheeham-place, Belgrade square, and at Masham-hatch, near Ash<lb></lb>ford—in the beginning of October I inserted an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> for a butler, in conseqnence of which I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know the writing; it is the prisoner's—(<hi rend="italic">This was partially read; it was signed John Kirby, and dated 4th October</hi>, 1861. <hi rend="italic">stating the names of several noblemen and gentlemen with whom he had lied, that he had been groom of the chamber to his Grace the Duke of Somerset, at the Admiralty, and referring for his character to Louis Billaud, in his Grace's service there.</hi>)—I consequence of that letter I appointed an interview with Kirby in Chesham-place, on 8th October, when I produced the letter which he had written to me, and asked him if he wrote it—he said, "Yes"—I asked him where his last place was—he said, "Groom of the chamber to the Duke of Somerset," that he had left of his own ac<lb></lb>cord, and a person named Louis Billaud, who was house steward, had authority to give him a character—I addressed a letter to Louis Billaud and posted it, and three days afterwards received this answer—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "October 18th, 1861.—I beg to inform Sir Norton Knatchbull, in reply to his letter res<lb></lb>pecting the character of John Kirby, that he lived in the service of the Duke of Somerset thirteen months and some days. I always found him attentive, sober, and trustworthy; he left by-his own desire. Your obedient servant, Louie Billaud, house steward.")—in consequence of that I wrote the letter and engaged the defendant as my butler—he afterwards returned it to me—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated October 11th, to John Kirby, engaging him as butler at</hi> 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a yeart and</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for beer, arranging as to the repayment of his travelling expenes, and requesting him to come down to the Smeeth station by the</hi> 10.30 <hi rend="italic">train, and to write his answer on the other side.

                  </hi>. I am one of the clerks to the Magistrates at Westminster police-court—I was there when Kirby was charged, and took the notes—he called as his witness a person named Billaud—I took notes of what Billaud said—he said, "I lodge at 8, Palace-street, Westminster—I was butler at the Duke of Somerset's—I left on 10th August—I am now out of place—I left for no fault—while I was there, the prisoner was there also—I was there when the prisoner was discharged—I sometimes hired and discharged servants, and sometimes the Dnke—I do not know why the prisoner left—I remained after the prisoner left—I never saw the prisoner drunk—he applied to me six weeks ago for a character"—he was asked a question by the Magistrate, and said, "I met the prisoner in the park; I had left the Duke's—he said he had applied for a situation, and asked me to give him a reference—I asked him to write me a copy of what I should say, and after that day I received from the prisoner a letter addressed to me from Sir John—I had sent the prisoner to the Admiralty for my letter—he gave it me in an envelope and I was to copy it—I put the copy into the post instead of copying it, as I was' busy"—the document was then produced, this is it—" it was not sealed when given to me—I sealed it—I saw nothing but the truth in it—he did not know I had left—I offered myself for the same situation, 1 did not know that the prisoner had applied—I saw the advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>"—he was then ordered into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I beg to explain as far as I can respecting the facts. In the early part of October, I was reading an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> to apply by initials in Bond-street for the situation of a butler; I went home and wrote a letter, and next day took it and asked the shopman if he knew who it was for; he said that he had no instructions to say, but the letter would be sent; in a few days I received a letter from Sir Norton Knatchbull, but did not know who he was, because there was no name; it was to meet a gentleman and lady at Chesham-place on a certain day. In two or three days I went to see them, and saw this gentleman; I presented this letter, he asked me some questions, went up stairs, and afterwards called me up, and I saw a lady, who said, "Oh! you are the tall man who wrote to Sir Norton, you have lived with the Duchess of Somerset as groom of the chamber." I said, "Yes;" she said, "After living in such a distinguished family, would you like to live in a quiet gentleman's family in the country, in a very large house and a great deal of plate, but not much company?" I said that I would live wherever I was comfortable; she said, "Who shall I apply to for your character?" I said, "The Duke, from his official capacity as first Lord of the Admiralty, seldom troubles himself with, characters, and the Duchess I do not wish to trouble, but Mr. Billaud, the steward, knows enough of me to speak of me." I thought, I do not know who you are, and I will not trouble the Duchess until I know what family</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186112160080"></xptr>
               <p>I am going into. Sir Norton took me down stairs, took pen and ink, and asked me who he was to write to; I said, "Mr. Billaud, the head steward;" He said, "Is he in town?" I said, "I do not know;" he wrote and gave me the note to put in the post; going home I saw Mr. Billaud and ran over the way to him; he said that he was in a very great hurry indeed. I said, "I want to speak to you. I have been after a situation. I do not think the place will suit me. I have taken the liberty of referring the gentleman to you, but I shall write to the Duke or the Duchess." he said, "I do not know what I can say; I cannot stop now; you write me a letter." I said, "I believe the gentleman is going to write this evening;" he said, "You had better call at the Admiralty, and see if there is any letter, and take it to your house." I went home. My wife advised me not to write the copy, but I did, and left it, saying, "If you see him you can give it to him." He called in the morning, when I was dressed to go out, and said, "Here is a letter from this gentleman." Mr. Billaud took the letter away, and I did not see him afterwards. I went to Woolwich next day, and on my return to town there were two letters; one from Sir Norton, saying that he was satisfied with the character Billaud had sent, and another saying that I had not answered. I wrote to say that I had been out of town, which was the cause of my delay. My friends pressed me not to disappoint the gentleman, as he might be having company, so I went down to see how I liked the situation. All went well for eight days, as Lady Knatchbull was away, but when she came home she led me a life which these walls for ever would be nothing to; a dog's life. I afterwards received an unfortunate letter from my wife, which caused me to take some beer. I got muddled, and Sir Norton discharged me.</p>

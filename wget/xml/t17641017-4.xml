               <p>I had been up the Strand, and returning back, I met a young woman that I keep company with, she is a woman of the town. I came down as far as Butcher row with her, and went in at the Thatch'd-house: I gave her part of a pint of beer: she told me, a young man that she used to live with, was gone to sea, and she had a watch of his in pawn, that I might have, if I would fetch it out: she asked me for the money to fetch it out, and I gave it her. I was for going with her to the pawnbroker, being afraid to trust her with the money, but she would not let me go with her. I gave her a guinea and a half, and 5 s. she gave the guinea and half, and put the rest in her pocket. In a day or two after, I had occasion for money, so I went to pawn it, and the man stopt it. I went in search of her and the young fellow, but could not hear any thing of them. The pawnbroker knows I offered it in my own name, that shows I did not steal it.</p>
               <p>Ashbener. He said his name was Smith, and it was his own; that he had had it some time. I asked him how many months he had had it? he said, he had had it some months. After that, he said, he had it of a young woman, whom he kept company with a few days ago.</p>

There were a parcel of people assembled together to see my Lord Mayor; I had not stood there above five minutes, before I found somebody taking my watch out of my pocket; I put my hand down, and it was very near out; the prisoner was standing with his face towards me. I looked round, left I should accuse him wrongfully, and saw no other person could possibly take it out but him, their backs were towards me: he seeing me put my hand down, turned away from me, and was gone for five or six minutes: then he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176410170005"></xptr> came again and stood as before, just before me. I had a notion he would attempt it a second time, and was desirous of detecting him. I took notice of all the people, and saw it was impossible, as they stood, for any to take it but the prisoner; he had his hand down just by my fob: I found my watch move again in my pocket, he gave me a shove with his arm: I put my hand down immediately, and said my watch was gone; he had it in his right hand; I catched hold of his left hand; there was a man stood behind him; I was a little fearful he should deliver it to him. I took hold of that man, and immediately my watch fell to the ground, just by the prisoner's foot; the prisoner desired me to say no more about it, but to go into a house, and he would speak to me about it: I gave the constable charge of him immediately, and he was taken to Guildhall; there he was examined.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Webb, of 80, Beresford-street, Woolwich—on 13th June I had some clothing hanging out in my back garden to dry—there is a gate at the bottom of the garden which was un fastened—I saw the clothes safe between 9 and 10, and about 11 at night I missed two white shirts, two coloured shirts, a chemise of my little girl's, a pillow-case, three white neckties, a pair of stockings, a flannel shirt, and two pocket-handkerchiefs; one was marked—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the same—there was one pocket-handkerchief marked "W. A."—the "W" was picked out and the "A" left in, my mother's name being Ann—I know my hus<lb></lb>band's shirts, and this other handkerchief was only partly hemmed by my little girl; this other one I know nothing about.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Ropeyard-rails, Woolwich, which is opposite to the prosecutor's back gate—on 13th June I saw the prisoner there—she went into three gates before, and then she went into Mr. Webb's.—she had no bundle when she went in—she stopped there about twenty minutes, and then came out with a bundle.</p>

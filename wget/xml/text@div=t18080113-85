On Saturday the 19th of December, at six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner and two others came up to my shop window. They seemed to be viewing what was in the shop window; presently after they came to the door. I had suspicion that they meaned to take something; I went into a dark passage and watched them. I saw them make several attempts; at last the prisoner took a piece of bacon out of the window and delivered it to one of the others. I saw him take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the bacon. - A. It lay in the window on the top of a butter tub; when he had delivered it to one of the others, he began running directly. I came out of the passage and passed them that had it. I said I would have him that did take it. I caught him; I am sure he is the man. I never got the bacon, there was about six pound of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been of an errand, I was running by this man's door and many people ran, he halloaed out stop thief. I stopped, and he charged me with stealing it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

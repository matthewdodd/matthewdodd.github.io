On Friday night I packed up all my dirty linen, and laid them under the table; the next morning my husband went out to work and left the parlour door open, and at the same time the prisoner took the opportunity of coming into the parlour and taking the property out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did your husband get up in the morning? - At six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock did you get up? - About seven, I was all the time awake after him till I got up; and when I got up I went to open my little shop, and Ann Martin was sitting on the stairs at the time, and she took the opportunity of going and taking the things away. In about half an hour after I went for an apron that was in the bundle, and missed the goods and her; and I had a suspicion that she had committed the robbery. I looked after my property, and I met her five weeks after, with my cap and handkerchief on her; I met her in a public house, a good way down Drury lane; I charged her with the watch, and accordingly he detained me in the watch-house, as well as her; and she openly declared, in the watch-house, to stealing my clothes, and selling the whole to one Mr. Stevenson. I thought that she had pawned the things, and that was the reason I said I should be very glad to have nothing to do with her, if she would give me the duplicates; she told me she never had pawned them at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was that woman that was on the stairs that very morning that you lost your things? - Yes. I believe she laid in the passage all night. I spoke to her before the robbery was committed; I thought my little was in danger, by her laying in the passage; she had come in and out of my shop three or four times before.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you keep a clothes shop? - Yes, in King-street, Seven dials. I bought them on the 18th of April, Saturday, about twelve o'clock, of the prisoner I believe; I rather think it is the same, but I have so many people come into my shop that I can hardly tell the features.</p>
               <p>Q. You see her at Bow-Street? - Yes; and I see her in my own shop when the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200141"></xptr>officers brought her. I believe she is the same, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you doubt it in the least? - I don't know as for doubt, I have so many people come into my shop. I think it is the same, but I cannot justly swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any doubt when you was before the justice? - I could not really recollect her features, I think it is the same I bought these things of. I cannot produce them all, I have sold part. I have a sheet, table cloth, pillow case, two mens neckcloths, and two odd stockings. I sold a shirt, a pillow case, and one pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of day did you buy them? - About twelve o'clock, she came and said she was distressed, she had got some things to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she ever been in your shop before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Will you swear that I was the person? - I rather think it is the person, It was the 18th of April, she sold these things, and the 15th of May when the officer brought her in.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 14th of May, I was on duty, and the prosecutor and one of our watchmen brought the prisoner as a charge to me, and the prosecutor there declared, that this cap and handkerchief that was on her person was her's, which I have had in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor gave me the cap and handkerchief, about a week before she said she lost these things, and perhaps she said I might get something better to do than be in the manner I was. When she took me a prisoner, she said, she would hang me, and that the cap and handkerchief I had on was her's. I said, Yes, they were; she said she would to swear to them, and took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This cap had a burn in it by the candle, and I put this piece in myself, the handkerchief had a tare in it when I lost it, the sheet is mine, the things were wrapped up in it, they are all mine.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you give her any of these things? - I tied them all up for my own use in a bundle.</p>

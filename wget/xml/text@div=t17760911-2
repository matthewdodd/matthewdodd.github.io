               <p>On the 24th of July I went to Mr. Foote's theatre; I waited a few minutes in the croud till the door was opened; when it was opened I pushed in, with a number of people; going through a narrow passage which leads to the pit, I was very much crouded; the instant I was in the pit, I felt in my breeches pocket, into which I had put my purse, and missed it.</p>
               <p>What sort of a purse was it? - A green silk purse; there were seventeen guineas and a half guinea in it, two pieces of foreign coin, which were very remarkable, and eight shillings or eight shillings and six pence in silver.</p>
               <p>How long before you went into the house had you felt it in your pocket? - I went in a carriage with some gentlemen; I felt it before I got out of the carriage, and buttoned up my pocket; I am sure it was there when I got out of the coach; after I missed it, Mr. Green, who is, I believe, the box-keeper, called me to the front box, and asked me if I had lost any thing? I told him I missed a purse; he asked me if I had lost any thing else? I then missed my watch; I had not missed that before; he said there was a watch and purse found upon a man who was taken into custody: I found him in custody of

I told them as near as possible; I think I told them seventeen or eighteen guineas, two remarkable foreign pieces, and some silver; they asked a description of my watch; I gave it them; (a watch was produced, but it was not mine.)</p>

               <p>Can you tell who seized him and found the purse upon him? - Mr. Green had him taken.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday the 24th of July, the box-keeper belonging to Mr. Foote's theatre gave me charge of the prisoner: I took him into the box lobby and searched him; as I was searching his pockets, a woman that sells fruit told me he had something in his hand; I looked, and saw a green purse in his hand; I went to take it, and he threw it along the lobby: one of the box-keepers picked it up.</p>
               <p>Did you see him pick it up? - It was so dark I could not; he threw it as far as he could; I saw the motion of throwing it away.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you saw him throw it away, before the box-keeper delivered it to you? - I believe it might be about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Was it so dark that you could not see? - No; the lamps were light; about that time the king was going into the house, and there was a great deal of hurry; the box-keeper brought Mr. Harmanson out of the Pit, and we took the prisoner to Sir

            's, and there we opened the purse.</p>
               <p>Did Green go with you? - No; Mr. Harmanson said, if the purse was his, there were two pieces of foreign gold coin; the purse was opened, and it contained seventeen guineas, a half guinea, eight shillings in silver, and the two foreign pieces.</p>
               <p>[The purse with its contents were produced in court.]</p>
               <p>Mr. HARMANSON. I am confident this is my purse; these are the two pieces I brought from America; I shewed them to several persons in town.</p>
               <p>What coin are they? - I am not certain; some gentlemen I enquired of, said they were Spanish; I brought them with me from Virginia: I had taken twenty guineas the day before I was robbed; I had only spent a guinea or two.</p>

               <p>JURY.

               <p>I am box-keeper at Mr. Foote's theatre: on the 24th of July in the evening, his majesty was coming into the house, and it was very much crouded; I was looking through one of the air-holes from the box lobby that overlooks the pit passage, there is a hatch in the passage to prevent the people coming in too fast; it was shut so as to admit only one person at a time; I looked through, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor both stick fast between the door-way and the wall; the prisoner's face was to the prosecutor's back, both their right sides were towards me; I saw the prisoner put his arm under the prosecutor's arm, and lift up his waistcoat, and put his hand in his breeches pocket up to his wrist; I could see his hand go down into his pocket; I was three feet above him; I had an opportunity of seeing him, he could not see me, at least he did not; I saw him take something out, and then draw back, the gentleman pushed forward, and went under my feet into the pit; as soon as the prosecutor pushed forward into the pit, the prisoner attempted to get out, but it was impossible; then he put what he had taken out of the prosecutor's pocket into his right hand breeches pocket; there was not a person between them and me; as he could not get out, he was standing till I went and informed the constable that there was a pickpocket, and we immediately took him into the pit lobby; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110009"></xptr> left him in care of the constable, and went and told the prosecutor I had seen a man rob him; when I returned, the purse had been thrown away.</p>
               <p>JURY. As you was looking through the air-hole, could you distinguish the prisoner's face? - Yes; it was quite light; I believe the sun shone; the prisoner had on a brown coat; the prosecutor a very light one.</p>
               <p>JURY. Could you see any thing in his hand as he drew it out of the prisoner's pocket? - I could perceive something, it appeared to be black.</p>
               <p>'The prisoner in his defence called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.'</p>

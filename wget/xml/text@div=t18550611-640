               <p>again; he came and presented this book, and said he had come to give notice to withdraw the money—I looked at the entry, and asked him whether the book had ever been out of his possession—he hesitated at first and then said something about his grandmother, during which time I refer-red to the ledger—I then referred him to Mr. Boodle, the secretary—neither of these books are in my writing.</p>

About 5th March the prisoner was brought to me by Mr. Olive with this depositor's book—I asked the prisoner whether he was the depositor—he said he was; I asked him if the book had been in any other hands but his own—he said, "No"—I asked him if he had made all the payments himself—he said, "Yes," he had—I asked him what he considered to be his claim against the institution—he said, "4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I asked him what he had come for—he said, "To give notice for the amount"—I said it was a very serious case, that I should be under the necessity of detaining him at the office to have the matter inquired into; and I wished him to recollect himself, and tell me whether he ever had sent the book by the hands of any other person—he said that he had either sent one or more sums by the hands of his father—a deposit and the book are always sent to<lb></lb>gether, it would not be taken without—I then said that I would keep the hook, and that he and his father must attend before the Board on the following week—he did not attend, nor did his father—I know Mr. Lewis's handwriting is" Lewis" in the first entry is his writing—the other part is not that is Mr. Short's, a clerk, the "one shilling" and the figure 1—the entry in words is "one shilling," and in figures, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the word "pound "is inserted here after the word shilling—that is not the writing of any one in our office.</p>

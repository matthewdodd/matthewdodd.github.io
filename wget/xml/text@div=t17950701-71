               <p>Q. After he had stopped her what became of the prisoner? - Then she ran into Chiswell-street, by a worsted shop; she put her hand into her pocket and pulled something out from her pocket, in a paper, and it dropped down; it was a bit of white paper wrapped up.</p>
               <p>Q. When the paper was undone, did you see what fell out? - Yes, the money fell out; I did not see it, but I heard it fall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing taken up? - Yes; I believe it was six sixpences; I cannot say; I see some of them taken up, three or four by Mr. Fielder that had stopped her. She was then taken to the watch-house by Mr. Fielder.</p>

On Tuesday, the 6th of June did you see the little girl? - Yes, I did, about five o'clock in the afternoon, or a few minutes after, I was coming up Chiswell-street, and there were a number of chil<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010166"></xptr>dren (there are two schools in the street) to the amount of twenty I believe, and this little girl was among them. On her telling her story to me, saying the prisoner had given her a bad sixpence, I took hold of the prisoner's arm, and the child was coming after, but was afraid of coming to the woman, she said, the woman will murder me; the child had a sixpence in her hand, saying, this woman has given me a bad sixpence, and will not change it; my daddy and mammy is gone on some business to the Minories, and will beat me when they come home, if she will not change it; I took the sixpence into my hand, from the child, and have kept it ever since.(Produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. That is the same sixpence? - It is, it appears to have been rubbed? I asked the child where she lived? she told me she lived in Grub-street; from the circumstance of her telling me that her daddy and mammy were out, I took the child to the shop, in order to put the child in possession of the house, and in passing by the hosier's in Chiswell-street, the woman seemed as she would go into the house; I stepped up to her, and laid hold of her by the right arm; I see her put her left hand into her pocket, and she pulled out some paper, I see it was paper before she dropped it; my suspicions were alarmed that it was more bad money, and she opened her hand and dropped it by her side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pull it out so as to avoid your seeing it? - She did exactly; it happened on falling on the pavement that three sixpences sell out, and some of the by-standers delivered the others to me, and I have had them ever since; I marked them.</p>

               <p>Q. You are employed on these occasions to attend, by the Mint. Look at this sixpence first produced? - It is a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any silver in it? - We cannot tell, except it is broke; they make them very bad now, it has been new coloured; the sixpence found in her pocket is the same, and the sixpences picked up also. I am in the silver line.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, I had but two sixpences about me, I offered her a sixpence for the meat, with that she had three in her hand, and she put mine among the three, and she took that into the maid, and the maid said it is a bad sixpence; I looked at it, and I said that is not mine, and so I came out, and the child followed me, and another boy, and the boy struck me; there was another man by, who see it, but I did not know where to find him.</p>

On the 8th of February, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I came down stairs; I was going out; I pushed open the parlour door; I saw the pri-prisoner getting in at the window. I asked him what he did there. His reply was, that he slipped in. His body was in the window; he was overbalanced. I said it was impossible, for the window was shut. I told him he was a thief; he was going to steal. He had drawn the table, which stood in the room, close to the window, with the hat upon it. I said, you are going to steal that hat. His hands were upon the hat, and he had removed the hat. It is a small table, about a yard square. He had removed the table a yard nearer the window. He ran away. Mr. Waddilove pursued him, and brought him back. When the prisoner ran away he left the hat upon the table. I am sure the prisoner is the same person that was brought back, and I am sure he is the same person that I saw leaning in the window. I had been in the room about a quarter of an hour before, and put the window down; there was nothing to fasten it. It lifts up and down, with a Venetian blind to it. No person had been in that room, to my knowledge, but myself.</p>

            . I am the husband of the last witness. I occupy this house, No. 1, Phoenix-street, Hackney-road. I was alarmed by the cry of my wife, saying, here is some person getting in. In consequence I pursued, and when I came out of my door I saw the prisoner standing at the corner of the row. As soon as he saw me he ran away; I pursued, and called out, stop him. He was stopped, and delivered into my hands, and I brought him into my house. I charged him with opening my window, and endeavouring to take my hat. He said, if I would forgive him he would never do so any more. I took the prisoner to Worship-street office; they there knew him very well. This is the hat; it cost me twenty-six shillings. I value it at seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is worth a shilling - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never touched the window at all. The lady has declared all false against me. I was here eighteen months ago for this, and I was discharged by proclamation.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived in Justice-court,' Mint-street, South wark, when this happened—on 27th June, between 7 and 8 in the evening, I came home from my day's work, and went into ray own place, in the bottom floor—the prisoner lived on the second floor—he and his wife were having some words in the passage—they quarrelled very much, and she screamed and hallooed so that I thought she was injured, and I went out into Harris-street, for the purpose of sending a policeman—I could not see one, and I stood there—the prisoner came up and hit me in the head with a pair of tongs—I fell to the ground of course—after I got up I daresay I struggled with him a little while—we were parted—I ran in doors, and thought I would have a turn with him, and I brought out the hammer, and a very dangerous one it was; a chisel at one end, and a hammer at the other, and I meant to let him have it, but as I saw he did not have the tongs, I went back and put the hammer down again in the house—I did not hit him with it at all—I went out again, and I suppose I thought I might have a turn with the fists, and fist him a little, and be took out a knife; at least, he had it out, and stabbed me in several places—I did not see where he took the knife from—I believe he had it ready for me—after he had stabbed me I fell down, and while I was down he stabbed me, I can't say how many times, but I know he did so after I was on the ground—I was afterwards taken to the hospital in a barrow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prisoner has a wife and four children, has he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have lost my wife; I want one—I am a widower—I have some children—I have been rather intimate with the prisoner's wife—I have been blamed by the neighbours for being too intimate with her—the prisoner did not find her in my room that afternoon—she was not there—I don't know about her not being in my room that day—she was not there at that time—she used frequently to come in, pretty well every day—I had his wife here yesterday—I was with her—I did not stay with her from that time till 12 at night—I may have taunted the prisoner about his wife, that I could keep her, and he was not fit to do so; very likely I have said so—I beg you to have mercy on him, and give it him as slight as you can—I declare, on my oath, that I don't know whether or not I fetched out a poker to him as well as the hammer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon——on 27th June last I was house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—the prosecutor was brought there about a quarter past 8 that evening—he had a large incised wound on the fleshy part of the left arm about five inches long, and deep, but I can't say how deep—it was a cut, a clean incised wound—there were four incised wounds about the left wrist, none of which were very serious, but on further examination we found other wounds, which induced us to take him into the hospital—there were ten distinct wounds—the most serious was about an inch and a half long, and it was also deep—there was one wound just over the hip-joint, two on the head, one on the left side, and the other on the forehead,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186408150093"></xptr>
               <p>and one behind the left shoulder blade—they were severe wounds, but not dangerous—he is at present an in-patient, but he has recovered—he has been kept in till the trial should be over—this knife might have produced the incised wounds—I should hardly think it would produce the wounds on the head—I should imagine they had been done by some blunt instrument—a pair of tongs might have done it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 275). I took the prisoner into custody on 27th June—I told him he was charged with assaulting a man—at that time I did not know the prosecutor's name—he seemed very much excited—he was inside his room, and the door was fast—I asked him if he would open it—he said "No"—the door having a very slight fastening I forced it—as soon as he saw me, he said, "Oh, you are a policeman, I will go any<lb></lb>where with you"—I took him to the station and searched him, and found this knife in his right-hand pocket.</p>

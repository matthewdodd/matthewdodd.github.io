                  </hi>. I am chief clerk and cashier to Johnson, Matthey, and Co., assayers and refiners, of Hatton Garden—on 8th August, about 3 p.m, the boy Marshall came and presented an envelope containing these two papers—having suspicions I hesitated to give him the gold demanded, but made up a dummy parcel and gave it to him—he went out and I followed him—he went straight to the prisoner, who was about 180 yards from the shop advancing towards him, and delivered the parcel to him, and as be took it I seized him at the back, and said, "What are you doing with that parcel?" he said, "What is the meaning of all this? What are you touching me for?"—I told "I will go into the matter when I get you into the office"—I took him there with assistance—he said that he knew nothing of the contents of the letter, and said, "Why have you brought me here?"—I had a policeman there—I said, "What do you mean by giving a forged order?"—he said, "I did not know there was any cheque, I received the letter from a gentleman at the end of Hatton Garden, who promised me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if I would give a boy a penny to deliver the letter"—Frederick Jones is a customer of ours—I took the cheque to the bank immediately, and it turned out to be a forgery.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I think he said that if I would come with him to the end of Hatton Garden he would point out the gentleman—I did not go—I know that another boy was sent for in my absence to identify the prisoner, but no charge has been made against the prisoner about that matter that I am aware of—I know that on the previous day another cheque was pre<lb></lb>sented at our office with a similar letter by another boy, which gave me suspicion in the present case, and the boy was confronted with the prisoner and did not recognise him.</p>

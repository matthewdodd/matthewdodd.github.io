On Tuesday, the 22d of April, about twelve o'clock I missed all this property out of my box, which I kept locked; it was not broken open, but the lock must have been picked - I found it still locked - some of the things were almost new; they were worth more than 5l. - I saw Higgs at the Crown and Anchor Drummond-street, Hampstead-road, about three o'clock in the afternoon, with Hales; they were coming out as I went in; I went after them to look at their faces, as Higgs was differently dressed; he turned round, saw me, and then ran off - he was secured, but nothing found on him. As we were taking him to the watch-house Hales came up to him, and said, "Young man, shall I go and acquaint your friends of your being taken;" he said, "Oh, No - I want nothing of you;" he followed him to the watch-house; the officers afterwards went out and brought him in - I found one of my shirts in his (Hales) hat. I had seen all my things safe the night before, at ten o'clock; the officer found two duplicates in Hales' fob - Higgs did not know he was in custody. The coat is worth 38s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Higgs did not know Hales was in custody? A. He did not; we had taken Higgs into the watch-house, about twenty minutes before we came out for Hales - he did not attempt to escape, but denied the charge; he did not lodge with me - I never saw him before; I had left Higgs in bed when I went out at six o'clock in the morning.</p>

                  </hi> I live at Newington, and am the wife of john Misprey Clay—he was indicated for felony twelve months ago—he employed Mr. Games, the solicitor, to defend him—I was not satisfied with Mr. Games—my husband was convicted—I did not exactly send for the prisoner; he came into my place on the 27th of Nov.—I showed him the papers—he said Mr. Games had not dealt right by my husband, he would see into it—he went away, and I suppose he was gone four hours when he returned and said he had consulted three barristers, and they said he was to issue a wait against Mr. Games, and he asked me to give him 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the writ—I thought it was all right, and I gave it him for the writ—I should not have given it him if he had not told me that he had consulted three barristers and they had ad<lb></lb>vised a a writ—the prisoner came the next day, the 28th, and said he must have 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a declaration against Mr. Games—I paid him that—the next day he came again, and took me to some inn in Chancery-lane to swear, and that I paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for—he came again and demanded 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was for something against Mr. Games, but I don't know what—he came again and wanted 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not give him all that—I gave him a 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I certainly should not have paid him these different sums unless I had believed he was proceeding against Mr. Games, on behalf of my husband who was convicted.</p>

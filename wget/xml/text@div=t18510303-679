                  </hi>. I am a labourer, in the service of Messrs. Heron and Rattey, brick-masters, at Hillingdon. On 14th Jan., I placed a shovel, pickaxe, and mattock, in a sand-house on their premises—the door was left locked—next morning I found the rafters had been taken away, and the tools were gone—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 100.) On 15th Jan. I was on duty at Hillingdon, about one o'clock in the night, and saw the prisoner and a young man named James Devonshire coming in a direction from Messrs, Heron and Rattey's brick-field with some tools—the path they were in came from straight opposite the sand-house—Devonshire had a pickaxe, shovel, and other tools—I followed them down to Devonshire's house—Bunce was behind the door—I said, "What! have you got some tools?"—the prisoner said, yes; they had been at work in Mr. Heron's field, and he fetched the tools from there, and had been out drinking—the prisoner had no tools—I left them in Devonshire's house, returned in a quarter of an hour, and they were both gone and the tools also—the same morning, about eight, I received information, and found the tools in a wet-dock leading from the Grand Junction Canal to the brick-field, and about fifteen yards from Devonshire's house—I took the prisoner on 20th Feb.—Devonshire is still absent.</p>

On 14th Jan., about twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner and James Devonshire talking to two females—they parted from them, and went towards the field where the tools were stolen from—they were about a quarter of a mile from it close to both their houses—I expect they were going home—the prisoner must have passed his house when Matteney saw him—they had no tools—I also saw them at half-past one, going in a contrary direction—they had no tools with them then—I knew them both as working in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood for three or four years.</p>

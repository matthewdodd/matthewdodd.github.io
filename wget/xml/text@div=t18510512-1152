                  </hi>. I am a carrier, of King's Arms-yard, Snow-hill. Collins was in my employ eight or nine years, with the exception of being absent two years—Dormer had been in my service seven or eight years—on 4th Oct. Collins had to deliver parcels at different places—before he started, my clerk asked him, in my presence, how many trusses he had; he said, "Sixteen"—he was made to unload his cart, and count them, and there were seventeen—he had first to deliver five trusses at Mr. Addington's, the lower end of St. Martin's-lane—his course would be Farringdon-street, Fleet-street, and the Strand—it would be out of his way to go through Queen-street—he afterwards told me he had met with an accident, and lost a truss—I asked him which way he went; he said, "Chancery-lane, Carey-street, and through Lincoln's-inn, the side nearest the Strand (that is the opposite side to Sir John Soane's Museum), and Queen-street;" that he went to Messrs. Bull and Wilson's with one truss, and missed the truss there—that is in St. Martin's-lane, the end nearest Holborn—he said, when he stopped the cart, he noticed a person dressed in black, with a pipe in his mouth, walk towards it; and when he came out again, he was gone, and he missed the truss—I asked him if he had spoken to a policeman; he said he had not</p>

               <p>seen one, but he bad been to Bow-street—I asked him why; he said Mr. Kempson, of Bond-street, who the truss was for, made him go there—the truss contained three ends of cloth, 108 yards, and was worth 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a yard long, or a little more, and was in a whitey-brown wrapper—next day Turner came to my yard, and taw a number of carts come in, and afterward Collins came in, and he identified him.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Bailey, the curator of the Soane Museum, which is on the further side of Lincoln's-inn-fields—on 4th Oct., about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was on the third-floor, cleaning windows—I saw a cart and a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> standing opposite—the three prisoners were in the cart—Dormer lifted a Urge package, done op in whitey-brown sacking, oat of the cart, and put it into the call—Collins was sitting in front of the cart, looking round partly towards Dormer—Dew was on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the parcel was put in, Dormer got up on the box, and went off, and the cart went on towards the City—next day I went to Mr. Blomfield's, and saw several carts come in—I saw Collins, and picked him out without anybody telling me.</p>

Dormer came, and knocked twice at the door, about two o'clock; Mrs. Warden opened it—he did not go in; he spoke to her for a minute or two at the door, and went away—in ten minutes or a little more Dew drove a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> up—there was no passenger in it—he took out a roll with a loose brown wrapper round it, and carried it into the passage, and then a second parcel, which I should say contained two rolls—the sister-in-law tried to carry the second, but could not, and the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> carried it—I heard her say, "He," or "they will be here presently"—Dew said, "Yes," and drove away—in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes Dormer came, and went up to Mrs. Warden's apartments—while Mrs. Warden was speaking to him in the shop, a person like a porter came—I think he had a knot—he carried away something in the shape of a bed, tied up in a patchwork quilt—Mrs. Warden was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in arrear of rent; she paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that day.</p>

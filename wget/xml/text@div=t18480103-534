                  </hi>. I am in the service of Henry Gold, of Brunswick-street, Newington. On Friday evening, 24th Dec., about eleven o'clock, I locked up some lard, pork, butter, and herring, in the safe in the area—the herrings were in brown paper, on the bottom shelf, and the butter also—about two o'clock next morning I was called up by my master, went into the kitchen, and saw my master, an officer, and the prisoner—I had never seen him before—I found the zinc-work of the safe cut down—the things had been removed, put back again, and all heaped up together on the top shelf—the safe is just out of the back kitchen door—the area is below the street—per<lb></lb>sons could only get in by getting over the area railings—there are no steps—it is about ten feet deep—he would have to drop, or lodge his foot somewhere.</p>

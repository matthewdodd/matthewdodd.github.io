                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in St. Giles's. The prisoner occupied a room in a house in——lane. On the 3rd of June I was as<lb></lb>sisting Mr. Mason, and saw the prisoner <hi rend="italic">chucking</hi> things</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184607060013"></xptr>
               <p>out of the window—I went up to prevent her doing so—I said, "You must not <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> things out of window"—I had not time to speak a word before she flew at me, and hit me in the breast with a knife—she was drunk, I believe—I did not say anything, but tried to get from her; but she got hold of my jacket, and pulled me down on the floor, and fell on the floor herself with me, and stuck the knife right into my leg twice—I was carried to the hospital—my leg is very bad now, I could hardly walk here this morning—my breast was merely scratched—it bled a little—when the prisoner struck me she said, "Take that you w——'s son."</p>

                  </hi>. About two o'clock in the day I heard a noise in the prisoner's room—I saw her throwing things out of the window—the prosecutor came up afterwards—directly he entered the room, she got hold of his jacket, and struck him in the stomach with the knife—there was a scuffle between them for three or four minutes, and both fell on the floor—I ran into my own room to get my boots, and the prosecutor ran down stairs, and cried, "I am stabbed"—he was taken on a barrow to the hospital—the prisoner was very drunk—she had been locked in the room some hours before, in conse<lb></lb>quence of her being drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgoon at the University Hospital. The prosecutor was brought to the hospital on the 23rd—the wound in his leg was not of a serious character—it appeared to be done with a knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The prosecutor's father came into my room, and asked me for the rent; he went away; I drank a pint of brandy, and was insensible; I went to a public-house, and treated him to a glass of rum; I went home, and the young woman, seeing I was in liquor, locked my door; about two o'clock the father came to my door to break in; I resisted his proposals; the wife, and Welch, his son, and four others, came into the room; I had a knife, which I took up to defend myself from the father, and, in my fright, stabbed his son, but not with intent to injure anybody; I am truly sorry for it.</p>

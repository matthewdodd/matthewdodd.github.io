                  </hi>. I live at White Hart-street, Commercial-road, Lambeth. I know the prisoner—on Friday week, I met her in the Strand, and went to a public-house to have some drink—we then went into another public-house—the landlord would not serve her—she took my scarf, and said, "Will you allow me that scarf to put on my shoulders to see how 1 look in it?"—she made use of very bad language to the landlord, said she would fetch a policeman, and break all his windows—my scarf was on her at the time——she went out, and never returned—I went to her house in the morning, and asked her for it—she denied having it—I said it is no use of you to say that, you have—she said she would go to the landlord, and ask him whether she was the party that took it, and when she found I was determined to go to the landlord, her young man that was with her gave her a <hi rend="italic">nudge</hi> to go back—I said, "If you turn back again, I will turn back as well"—I saw her go in-doors by a back door, by which she got out—when I got up into her room the man was gone, and she turned round and abused me shamefully—she would not go to the landlord, and I gave her in charge—she was brought to the landlord, and the moment he saw her, he said, "You are the girl that robbed the poor girl of the scarf"—I can swear to you.</p>

               <p>morning, and called for a quartern of gin—the prosecutrix was intoxicated; the prisoner was not very tipsy—I had had a good deal of trouble with the prisoner, and refused serving her—it is not long since she robbed a gentleman of a watch, which was found in her bosom—she was very trouble<lb></lb>some on this occasion, and made use of very bad words, and said if I attempted to tarn her out, she would smash every b----y window in the place—I got them both out to the top of the court—she was very violent, kicking and knocking at the door—the prosecutrix had the scarf-shawl on her shoulders at the time—I begged them to go away—the prisoner said she would fetch a policeman, and give me in charge, because I would not serve her, for keeping my house open, and not serving my customers—she took the scarf off the prosecutrix's shoulders, and walked away down the lane with it, and said she would get a policeman—a few minutes afterwards, the prosecutrix came crying down the passage, saying she had lost her shawl.</p>

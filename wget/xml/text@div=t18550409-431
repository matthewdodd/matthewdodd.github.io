On Monday afternoon, 5th March, the prisoner came and asked for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco—he gave me a penny—he then looked out a "Family Herald," and gave me a shilling—I found it was bad—I gave it him back, and told him to go—he hesitated, and looked at it, and said he took it in change—he went away—I went a little way after him, and then I sent my sister—he came past the shop afterwards, and I gave him into custody—this is the shilling the prisoner gave me—it has my teeth mark on it.</p>

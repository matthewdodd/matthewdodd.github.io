               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When the officer came to me, he asked if I did not live with Mr. Woollard - I said Yes; he asked what I took from him - I said Nothing; he said,"I believe you did," and I must take you into custody -I said, "Very well;" Mrs. Woollard had often threatened that she would send me over the water - I owed her a few shillings, and I was afraid she would give me in charge; I left her - I did ask for this money, but not in any name.</p>
               <p>MRS. WOOLLARD. He did ask for it for Mrs. Kendall- it was a regular rule to take her women's beer at six o'clock, and at that time he asked me for 2l. 10s. for her to pay her women; I gave it him - he came back, and said she was very busy, and would send the gold by her little girl.</p>

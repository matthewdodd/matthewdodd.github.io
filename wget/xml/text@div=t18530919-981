                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mrs. Richardson, who keeps a chandler's shop. I remember the prisoner coming on 23rd Aug., about a quarter past 10 o'clock at night; another man was with him—the other roan asked for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco, and he paid for it in good money—while I was serving him, the prisoner urged me to serve him, and said, "Make haste, I can't stop"—I asked him what he wanted; he said half an ounce of tobacco—I served him—it came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece—I did not like the look of it—I went to the publican opposite, and showed it him; he said it was bad—it was not out of my sight—he examined it, and returned it to me—I took it back, and gave it to Mrs. Richardson—the prisoner was there—I told her it was bad, and the prisoner ran out of the door immediately;</p>

I saw the prisoner run by when I was standing there—as soon as Mrs. Richardson said he passed a bad crown, I followed him—I told him he was charged with passing a bad crown piece, and he must go to the station—he said he should do no such thing, he should not go—he resisted—he went with me to Mrs. Richardson's, and he wanted the crown from her, and struck at her, but I kept him back—I had to get another officer to get him to the station—I found on him a half crown, one shilling, two sixpences, and 4 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, all good money—I received this bad crown piece from Mrs. Richardson—the prisoner stated his name was Williams, but be gave no address—after that, he stated his name to be Burrows.</p>

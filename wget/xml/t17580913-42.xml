               <p>G. E. On the 21st of August last, the prisoner at the bar picked me up in the street, and we went into <placeName id="t17580913-42-crimeloc221">St. Catharine's court</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you feel her pick your pocket ?</p>
               <p>Answer. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In a public house did you see me, that is false.</p>
               <p>Answer. I did not say a public house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I ran after you, you mean.</p>
               <p>G. E. She confess'd when she was taken, she took it from me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I'll tell my lord afterwards, what you say is not true.</p>
               <p>G. E. She took us to Ann Mac Donnald's, and said to the constable and me, I should have my money again, but the person that she said she gave it to, is gone off, so I never had it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I hope I shall not be cast, for I never was before your lordship before, and I'll take care it shall be the last; he drop'd his money, and I stoop'd down to tie my garter, and saw it and took it up. I'll never pick up any more for your sake ( Pointing to the prosecutor.)</p>

On the 28th of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, the prisoners came into my shop, and were talking to each other about watches; Jones said to me, "Let us look at your watch" - I gave it him from my waistcoat pocket; he took the case off, and pretended to look at the works - he gave Sargent the watch to look at, keeping the case himself; he then pretended to look out of doors, and whipped round the corner - I did not see him go away; Sargent gave me the inside of the watch, and said he would go and look after him, and they both whipped round the corner, and never returned; directly I looked out of doors, they were gone - I received information between ten and eleven o'clock that night, and went to the Queen's-head, Queen-street, Holborn; I found them there with a party, and charged them with taking my case, which they denied - I have not found it; it was silver, and worth 10s.</p>
               <p>Sargent. Q. How long had we been in your shop before a person came to be shaved? A. They were there about seven minutes altogether; I cannot recollect any body coming to be shaved - I had summoned a person to Guildhall about an image he had broken; I did not say I was in debt 18s. - I said nothing about pawning my watch for 1l.; I was once in the House of Correction for an assault, but was never charged with felony, or a dishonest act - I never threatened to cut my mother's throat; I never told you I had stolen a hone - I knew Jones by sight, having seen him about nine months ago, with a neighbour's son; you kept talking to me about the weather, while Jones went off with the case.</p>

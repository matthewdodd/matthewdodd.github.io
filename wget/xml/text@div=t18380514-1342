                  </hi>. I am a livery stable-keeper in Seymour-men The prisoner was in my employ as coachman—on the 7th of March I let a pair of horses to a lady named Arnold, in Duke-street, for two months, at eighteen guineas a month—the prisoner was employed by me at 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week, to drive Mrs. Arnold about—he had no right whatever to go ad get 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week from her for doing it—she was to repay me the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week which I gave the prisoner—at the end of the two months, she owed me 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that included the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week—the job was off on the 1st of May, and on the 2nd I expressed my intention, in the prisoner's presence, of going to receive that amount—he said, if I would allow him to take the bill, she would very likely give him something, as he had been in the habit of driving her about—I gave him the bill, and a receipt for 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he returned, saying, Mrs. Arnold was out, and he was to take the receipt the next morning—he took it next day, and returned and said, that Mr. Arnold, her son, would call and pay the amount the next day (<hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi>)—Mr. Arnold did not call—I took no notice of it on Friday, but on Saturday the prisoner was going to drive a job for me, and he said, "I have just met Mrs. Arnold's butler; he is going to the Bank to get some money, and will call and pay your bill as he returns"—the butler never called, but in the evening I happened to meet him, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of what he said, I gave information to the police, and the prisoner was taken into custody on the Monday following—I told him he had rob<lb></lb>bed me, and asked what he had done with the money—he said he had got part of it by him, and he would give me what he had got—he gave to policeman 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said if I would allow him till Monday he would bring the remainder, and I let him go—I afterwards found out that the receipt was forged, and had him taken into custody again.</p>

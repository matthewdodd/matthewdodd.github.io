On Saturday week last, I was at Islington, going to Birmingham—I was waiting for the waggon to come on the road—I went through Islington to go on the road—and about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I was on the road, sitting down on a step with a bundle by the side of me—the prisoner came up to me—I never saw him before in my life—it was not dark—he asked where I was going to—I said to Birmingham, to my son, and was waiting for the waggon coming along—he asked me if he should carry my bundle—I said no, I was obliged to him, I had not so much, I could carry it myself—I got up and took my bundle, and went hack to see if I could meet the waggon, to<lb></lb>wards</p>

On Saturday night, the 6th of June, I was in the Liverpool-road—I saw Mrs. Cox first at the bottom of Park-lane—she came past the lane, and the prisoner turned up the lane with the bundle—there was nobody with her but the prisoner—he had the bundle under his arm—directly he turned up the lane, the woman came back and said, "Oh, my God! I have lost my bundle"—the man stood up against the wall in, the lane—he said, "Come on; we shall not catch the waggon to-night;" and, they both went further down the road—I stood where I was, and then went down that way, and I saw him coming along with the bundle—he was alone then—he was walking very fast—when I went a little further down</p>

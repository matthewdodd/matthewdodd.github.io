                  </hi>I am a police inspector. I was with Johnson when the eels were found in the prisoner's boat, about a quarter to five o'clock, nearly opposite Wapping—he was rowing it down the river—I called to him, and said, "What have you in your boat? "—he said, "Eels"—I said, "Where did you get them? "—he said, "I bought them of a man at Bil<lb></lb>lingsgate"—I said, "Do you know the man? "—he said, "No"—I said, "What did you give for them? "—he said, "Two pounds"—I asked if he had a knife—he said he had not; and in about five minutes afterwards I saw another boat coming down the river with three empty eel-baskets, and rowed by another man—I called to him, and he rowed towards me—I examined the boat, and found the rope, which bad been recently cut, on the baskets—the other end of the rope was fixed to the vessel they were stolen from—I directed my man to search among the eels, and he found a knife—the prisoner is a drudge-man—they call themselves fishermen, but they go about getting coals and what they can from the barges.</p>

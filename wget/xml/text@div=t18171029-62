On the 17th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, I went into the city, leaving my watch hanging up in my bed-room; I locked the door and gave the key to my sister, who was nursing my wife in the next room; I saw it safe there at that time-it was quite dark. I came home at twelve o'clock and missed it. On the 25th of October, one of the corporals came to me - I got the prisoner apprehended.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 25th of October, I took the prisoner into custody at the Nag's Head, at Knightsbridge; he is a pot-boy there-it is close to the Barracks. I told him he had got Hemsley's watch - I neither threatened or promised him; he denied it, and began crying; I was going to search him - He took the watch out of his pocket and gave it to me. When he was at the office, he said he had been persuaded to do it by somebody.</p>

            . I am pot-boy at the King's Head, it is not the house where the prisoner lived. On Saturday morning the 25th of October, about half-past eight o'clock, I met the prisoner - He asked me where I was going - I said I was going down the lane - He said he would go with me; he pulled a watch out of his pocket to see what time it was - I told him it was wrong - He said he did not pull it out above once a month; I opened and regulated it for him; I asked him where he got it? he said he bought it, and laughed; I said, "Yes you have bought it;" he said, "No; it was one that he had boned;" I asked him what he meant by boning? he said it was one that he took out of one of the rooms where he served beer, and that he took it from the room before you come to the Quarter-master's. I knew the prosecutor lived in that room.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going up the barrack-stairs, a man asked me for a pint of beer, and told me to hold the watch while he went to get the halfpence; I staid there twenty minutes - He never returned; nobody ever enquired for the watch. The next morning, I met Mulford; he asked me to let him pledge it and he would have half of the money. About an hour after, the constable took me.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MULFORD, re-examined. I never offered to pledge it. I am certain that he said he took it out of the room before you come to the Quarter-master's.</p>

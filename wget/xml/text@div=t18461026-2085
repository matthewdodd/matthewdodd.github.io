                  </hi>. I am a mason, and live in Lavender-place, St. George's in the East. On the 1st of Sept., about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was setting some stones in Stepney-causeway—I was measuring with a rule—the prisoner came and asked if he was to go to work there—I said, no; to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> back to his own gang—he came back in about five minutes, while I was measuring the footway, and asked if he was to go to work—I said, "Go away, or I will give you a slap on the shoulder"—he took up a brickbat, and</p>

               <p>was going to hit me—I told him if he struck me I would put him where they would fine him—he said, "You b----y old b----r, I will have your blood before I go home"—at half-past eight o'clock I was going home, down the Back-road—one of our men said, "We will go and have a pint of beer, and have no animosity together"—I said, "I owe him no animosity"—we went, and called for two pints of beer and half a pint of rum, but the prisoner would not drink—it was among six of us—we came out, and wished each other good night—as I turned out of the New-road the prisoner passed me, and said, "I promised you that, you old b——r," and hit me on the eye with a piece of iron like a chisel—I called, "Murder!" and "Police!"—he ran away—I' have entirely lost ray eye—I am sure he had some instrument in his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hos<lb></lb>pital. Connor was brought there—I saw his right eye nearly a month after this happened—he has lost the sight of it—I do not think he will recover it—it appeared to have been cut by some instrument—he was not under my charge at first.</p>

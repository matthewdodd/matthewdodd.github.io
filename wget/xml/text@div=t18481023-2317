               <p>there a short time—it then went up Redcross-street, down Lower Whitecross-street, into Messrs. Houghton and Sons' yard—Groves was with it—in about five minutes he spoke to the prisoner, who was standing in front of a public-house in Lower Whitecross-street—he then went up the yard, returned, and he and the prisoner talked again, went up the yard together, and loaded the van with empty casks, called pipes—I did not see any of Messrs. Houghtons' men about—I could not tell how many casks were loaded—Groves led the van out of the yard; the prisoner walked down at the same time—when it got out Groves got up, and drove it off as fast as he could towards Bishops<lb></lb>gate-street—when the prisoner came out of the yard, he ran across the road sharply, and escaped—I followed the goods—he van stopped in "Widegate-Widegate<lb></lb>the prisoner went into Mr. Godfrey's, and talked to him about half a minute; I saw him close to the van—the van backed into a little street, and went into Half Moon-street, where the casks were unloaded by Groves and others—I took Groves—I took the prisoner afterwards, near Manning-tree, in Essex, about sixty-one miles from London—I said I wanted him for the casks—he said, "I will go quietly with you, I am in it, and must get out of it; I am regularly dragged into it"—he said, "Is Godfrey indicted"—I said, "No"—he said he had known Mr. Godfrey some years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to James Houghton and sons, of Bartholomew-close—the prisoner was in their employ—he left in July, I believe—we keep empty oil-pipes in a yard in Whitecross-street—the priosner would know that—I saw eight oil-casks at the station—they were Messrs.

About 15th Sept. a person came into my shop, in a hurried way, about three or four o'clock in the afternoon—he said he had got some pipes to sell—I believe it was the prisoner, but cannot swear to him—I said, "I cannot take them here, they must go to my place in Half Moon-street"—he said, "I will draw them over"—I said, "Do"—I went in about ten minutes, and they were out of the van—I said, "You have turned them out of the van very quickly"—some one said yes, they wanted the van to do another job—one of them was very inferior—I began to look them over, expecting the man would be over there who had come to my shop—I then saw the officer, who told me the pipes had been stolen from Messrs. Houghtons'—I went to the station, and they locked me up—I had never asked the price of the casks, nor had anything to do with them—I never saw the prisoner before, though there had been many of Mr. Houghton's carmen there to bring loads.</p>

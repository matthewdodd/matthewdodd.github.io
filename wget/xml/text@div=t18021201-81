             brought the dark gown and silk handkerchief to pledge for 8s. soon after Debhus came in, and owned them; On the 2d. of November the last witness came with a shuff petticoat; I stopped her and she took us to the prisoner.(The gown, petticoat, and handkerchief, produced and identified by Dickey and Debus.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I came from Gravesend and stopped at Dartford, and got to London on Saturday; I went to Neptune-street, no knowing where to lay; a gentleman asked me to sleep with him, and took me to that woman's house; I got up in the morning, and saw her in bed with a man; I said I was going, she said she kept girls, and if I was not situated, she would be glad of me; I agreed to stay, and did all the Sunday, but seeing them all in liquor, I thought it would not suit me, and went away with the things she had lent me, and left my own gown behind; I unfortunately happened to take two or three things which were not my own, and that is the truth.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Debus. I have no ladies in the house: she did leave a dark gown behind her, but I neverlent her any cloaths, for any infamy whatever.</p>

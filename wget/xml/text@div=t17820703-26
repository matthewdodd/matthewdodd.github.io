               <p>How have you so well refreshed your memory, as to be able to speak to the person of the prisoner? - I have positively sworn to him, and so has my partner.</p>

               <p>When did you see him before? - At the Rotation-Office .</p>
               <p>At the time you discounted this bill, you had no suspicion, I take for granted, that it was a bad bill? - We had not.</p>
               <p>Then, was there any particular cause which induced you to take any particular notice of the man's countenance or features? - As I did not before know the person, I took more particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Then your reason for taking more particular notice of him was, because you did not know him? - Undoubtedly, when a stranger passes a bill with us.</p>
               <p>Do you think you could swear to the persons of half the people that come into your shop? - I can positively swear to that man, that he is the man who passed the bill with us.</p>

               <p>Take that Bank post-bill into your hand; look at the acceptance of it; do you know Mr. Lateward? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He was a clerk in the Bank.</p>
               <p>Do you know his hand-writing? - Very well .</p>
               <p>Is that his hand-writing? - I am satisfied it is not.</p>
               <p>Was that note issued by the Bank? - It was, but was not accepted by Mr. Lateward, nor any other clerk at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>You have seen Mr. Lateward write? - Yes, I fancy, a thousand times .</p>
               <p>What induces you to swear that it is your opinion that this is not Mr. Lateward's hand-writing? - He wrote a very good free hand, and that is a stiff laboured hand.</p>
               <p>Is there no similitude between this and the manner of his writing his name? - I cannot perceive that there is any in the cut of the letters.</p>
               <p>Can you point out the difference? - Mr. Lateward wrote a free easy hand.</p>
               <p>This appears to be a very free easy hand; is it not? - It does not appear so to me.</p>
               <p>Then it is mere matter of opinion? - I am satisfied it is not his writing.</p>
               <p>Don't you know, that men, writing sometimes with one pen, sometimes another, write more or less alike? - They may.</p>
               <p>Is there any difference in this, as to the turn of the letters? - Mr. Lateward would have written a better hand with a worse pen, even almost with a skewer.</p>
               <p>Can you point out a difference, as to the turn of any of the letters? - The N in Number is made different.</p>
               <p>I am asking you as to the acceptance? - The letters may have the same turns.</p>
               <p>You are of opinion that the letters in the name have the same turns? - They may.</p>
               <p>Then all that induces you to swear as to the difference, is, that this is written rather stiffer than Mr. Lateward usually wrote his name? - A great deal.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Upon the whole of your observation, do you, upon your oath, believe it to be Mr. Lateward's handwriting or not? - I do not believe it to be his hand-writing.</p>

               <p>Look at that bill: do you recollect having seen that bill any where before? and relate to the court and jury the circumstances attending it. - This bill was presented at a lottery-office in Holborn, where I was at the last lottery, by a person that wanted to insure.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect on what day? - No: it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178207030024"></xptr> was about the middle of the drawing of the lottery. I was standing near the person that he gave it to: I looked at it: I saw the acceptance was a forgery: I told him it was. I happened to look over that person he gave it to. Being acquainted with Mr. Lateward's hand-writing, it struck me immediately to be a forgery: I said so at the time.</p>
               <p>Who was the person that produced that bill? - I believe the prisoner to be the man.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - Not much doubt; indeed, not any doubt.</p>
               <p>Upon your making that observation, that the acceptance of Lateward was a forgery, what was said? - The prisoner seemed a little affronted, I thought, and told me, It was not. I told him, I was well acquainted with the hand-writing, and was positive it was. He said, If we did not like it, we were not obliged to take it; and he went away with it immediately.</p>
               <p>Upon seeing it now, are you of the same opinion you were then, that this is not Mr. Lateward's hand-writing? - Yes, I am very clear that it is not.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>How long have you belonged to the Bank? - About ten years.</p>
               <p>How comes it that you are so very conversant with the hand-writing of Mr. Lateward? - I did business with him for a long time at the same book.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Lateward's name upon that bill? - The name of Mr. Lateward is; but it is not his writing, I am certain.</p>
               <p>Are not the letters there turned in the same kind of way that Mr. Lateward usually wrote his name? - There may be some similitude in the turnings: he wrote a very fine free hand: the initial letters he used to cast with a pen in a very free and easy manner.</p>
               <p>How long did you belong to this lottery-office? - I assisted in the evening at a lottery-office in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Then it was in the evening that the prisoner brought that bill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it an office where a great deal of business was done? - Pretty well: not so much as at many.</p>
               <p>There were a great concourse of people continually coming backwards and forwards in that office, were there not? - It was only a small office. There were a good many customers. I was only there to assist in the evenings.</p>
               <p>What enables you to swear so positive to the person of this man? - I believe it to be him.</p>
               <p>When you say you believe it, you mean to say you have a doubt? - No, I have no doubt; I believe him to be the man.</p>
               <p>From what do you believe him to be the man? - I believe him to be the man: he wore a round head of hair; and I think he is the man.</p>

               <p>Was it then accepted by the proper person, whose name now appears to it? - I cannot pretend to speak positively to that; I do not recollect whether it was or not; but I believe it was not. I can swear that the name

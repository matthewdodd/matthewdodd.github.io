                  </hi>. I am the son of Frederick Bowman. He has one partner—they are sugar refiners, and live in the parish of St. Mary Matfelon, Whitechapel—the house in question is situated in Dunean-street—it is a part of the manufactory—it runs parallel with Alie-street, Goodman's-fields—our premises extend from one street to the other—there is a part of the premises called the Russia-house—that is a mere arbitrary name—on the lower part of that story, within the filtering-house, there is a room attached to the Russia-house called the men's dining room—there is a house called the single-house, and a room attached to it called the men's room—the prisoner had ben three-quarters of a year in that depart<lb></lb>ment—he was what is called a scum-boiler—that duty would confine him to the filtering-room—in consequence of some falling off in the trade, we discharged a number of persons—the prisoner was one—on the 22nd of January I paid him his wages, and told him that the times being bad, we were obliged to discharge some men, about twenty-four—I told him we had no fault to find with any of them, and that they might remain (this was on Friday till the Saturday evening, and that if we should work the</p>

               <p>house again, we should have no objection to take him on again with the rest—this was about four o'clock in the afternoon—at that time the work had ceased in the filtering-room for that day—they generally left off be<lb></lb>tween three and four o'clock in the afternoon—it was customary to burn lights in the <hi rend="italic">fill</hi>-house during the night, but in the filtering-house at night there ought to be no light—it was burnt in the day, and put out when the work was over—the gas-light in the filtering-room was on a moveable arm, so that it could be moved at right angles with the wall, or close to it—there was a girder over the gas, which was protected by sheet<lb></lb>ting from the gas copper, and there is a current of air between the copper and the girder—the burner I think was about eight inches under the girder, but the flame came horizontally from the pipe—there is what is called a wall plate, which is a piece of timber four or five inches thick, built into the wall to carry the weight of the girder—the surface of that is flush with the wall—it is unprotected by any sheeting or any other substance—the burner can be turned round and placed close against the wall plate, which is unprotected—on the evening of the 22nd of January, at eight o'clock, I went round the premises—I did not examine the burner in the filtering-room—I looked, and there was no light, and no smell of gas—the burnen were alight in the fill-house, which is contiguous to the filtering-room, where there are two small windows which look into Duncan-street, so placed that a person going round into Duncan-street would be able to see through—they are even with the street—Hillyard came to me at ten o'clock, and made a communication—in consequence of that I went into the filtering-room—I found that the girder and the wall plate had been on fire—they were them out—the watchman (Macquire) was on he premises, but not in that room—he or some one made a communication to me, is consequence of which I sent for the prisoner, and asked him why he had been into the filtering-room and lighted the gas—he was then in the men's sitting-room—I asked him in English, which he understands a little, and I sent for one of the men to interpret it to him—he came readily—I be<lb></lb>lieve one or two went for him—I asked him why he came in and lighted the gas, and set fire to the burner—he said he did not do it—I then asked him what business he had to be in the sugar-house at all—he said he had not been in—I told him he had, for the watchman saw him come out—this was spoken in German—he then said, "Oh yes, I went in to wash my clothes"—I asked him to show me the clothes he had washed—he went a short distance off, and showed me a cloth waistcoat and a coarse apson, which were quite dry and dirty—I said, "These are not the clothes you washed; they have not been washed; where are the ones you washed?"—he said he never said he had washed any—I told him he did say so—he flew into a great passion, held his fists up at me, and was about to strike me, I think, but one or two took him away—I ordered him to be turned out of the premises—a window was afterwards broken, but not in the filtering-room, in consequence of which the prisoner was taken in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am what is called a mould-keeper, in the employ of the prosecutors. In consequence of directions from Mr. Bowman, I went into the filtering-room on the 22nd, a little past three o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon—the first burner in going into the filtering-room was alight—the other was not—the one that was alight was not the one under the girder—I turned it off—the branch that was near the girder was direct out from the wall—the one I put is about six yards from the other—I am quite sure the gas was extinguished—I went into the room again, a little after eight o'clock, and found it was all in darkness, and felt the cocks of both, to see that they were turned off right—the branch was still in the position I had left it—there was not the least smell of gas—I was afterwards in the men's room, in Duncan-street, after eight o'clock—I saw the prisoner there two or three different times, going in and out—Kusel called me about ten o'clock—I was then in the men's sitting-room—I went into the filtering-room—it was full of smoke—the wall plate and girder were on fire—the gas branch was close against the wall—the copper sheathing was in the same situation as it was before—the fire was burning up towards the floor above—there is a leader pipe which comes into the pre<lb></lb>mises, and communicates the gas with the burner, and that was melted by the heat of the fire—that was four or five inches from the cock—here is part of the leaden pipe which was attached to the burner—I an Kusel assisted in putting it out—we were present when he prisoner was interrogated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> About how many men were in the men's room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps thirty—I was in various part of the premises—I cannot tell how many have gone backwards and forwards into that room—Mr. Bowman had given notice to some of them to leave—I turned off both the cocks—I am not apt to make mistakes—I happened to come past the door a second time, and looked in—the door was shut, but not locked—any body might have gone in—the branch is slack, so that you could move it with your hand, it was easily moved—I never heard of the place being on fire three or four times before, till yesterday when it was mentioned by Gomes, one of the men to be discharged.</p>

               <p>men were to the filtering-room—it is thirty or forty yards off—there was a light in the sugar-house—the burner was about six and a half feet from the ground—he could not light any thing at that, without something to stand on—he might reach up—there is something which receives the light, but no glass—there were four forms against the wall, and some in the middle of the room.</p>

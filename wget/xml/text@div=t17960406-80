               <p>I am servant to Mr. Thomas: On Thursday evening, about eight o'clock, a man came to my master's, and ordered some dresses to No. 7, Mary-le-bonne-street; it was not the prisoner, it was a strange man, he said, they must be good ones; about nine o'clock, I took four dominos, two masks, and two hats; when I got into Holles-street, Cavendish-square, the prisoner met me, and asked me if I was going to Mary-le-bonne-street; I told him, yes; he took hold of the hats, and followed me to the house, No. 7; he went into the parlour, and tried two black dominos on, and two masks, he kept them, and tried one of the hats on, with a feather; he said, the dominos were not for him, they were for two other gentlemen; he said, one was up stairs dressing, with the hair-dresser with him, and the other was out; when he tried them on, I told him I could not leave them without the money; he said, he did not know what to do, he could not possibly speak to the gentleman; then he put on his hat, and said, he was going to the gentleman, he took the things under his arm, and said, he was going up stairs; he shut me in the parlour, I looked out, and saw that he was going out into the street, and when he saw me, he came back, and told me to follow, that I might as well go with him, and I followed him as far as Chandos-street; he took two black dominos, a mask, and a hat and feather with him; he went to a door there, and knocked; he told me to stop there, and then went off with the dresses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go in? - A. No; he went away from the door with the things, and told me to stop; he walked as far as New Cavendish street, I followed him as far as Mansfield-mews; when he came there, he took the things, and ran away with them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060066"></xptr>as fast as possible; I cried out, stop-thief, and the watchman here stopped him, and then he dropped the things; a young man took up the things and gave them to me, they were not out of sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. They were your master's property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Four dominos were taken first? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he only selected two? - A. Two black ones.</p>
               <p>Q. And he amused you in the sort of way you have described? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He wanted a little credit, you know? -

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You spoiled his chance of getting to the masquerade? - A. Yes; (the property was produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

            (To Thomas.) I believe this young fellow, except being a bit of a coxcomb, and going where he ought not, is a tolerable honest sort of a fellow? - A. I wish to shew him all the lenity I can.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Thursday, a friend of mine agreed to go with me to the masquerade, I asked him to be so good as order the dominos; he said, he would, the boy was so long before he brought them, that I met him in Holles-street; I went with the boy to a friend's house, in Mary-le-bonne-street, being a respectable house, I thought it better to take him there; my friend did not come so soon as I expected; I sitted the dominos and masks, and made an excuse to the boy; I was thinking, if I did not meet my friend, I would leave the boy at a gentleman's house, to look for him; I told him, in five minutes, I would call and pay for the hire of the dominos; the boy, I believe, suspected something, and instantly followed me; I was making all the haste I could to my friend for the money; I had not sufficient in my pocket to pay for them, and the boy called out, the watchman was at my elbow, and the idea of being put in the watch-house made me run; I concealed my money, and told them I had none; I had two guineas and a shilling in my pocket; the watchman treated me extremely ill; I did not take them away designedly; if the person had called in the morning for the dominos, there would have been the money and the dominos.(For the prisoner).</p>

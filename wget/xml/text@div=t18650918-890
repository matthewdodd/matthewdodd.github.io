I am a compositor, and work at No. 5 and 6, Little Tower-street, City—between 8 and 9 o'clock on the evening of the 28th of August I was at St. Dunstan's-hill—I heard a cry of "Police" and "Stop thief"—I saw a man coming from the direction the cry proceeded—he was siding against the wall as it to keep in the dark as much as possible—I followed him, and when he saw me he ran up Harp-lane, into Thames-street, and then into the market—while I was looking for him the prisoner was brought out of Love-lane, opposite, and then I saw the prosecutor for the first time, and he said, "That is the one that struck me in the eye," and some one behind said, "Step it, hook it," and the prisoner ran from those that held him, through the market, and got under a "dummy"—I assisted in getting him out—he said at the station, "If you will let me go I will never do it any more."</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody, by one of the custom-house officers, about 9 o'clock, on the evening of the 29th of August—the prosecutor charged him with being connected with others in stealing his watch, and also with striking him in the eye—the prisoner made no reply—at the station he said if we would let him go he would not do it again—he refused his address.</p>

On the 22nd of December, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, Mr. Shackle brought the prisoner into my shop, and said, in his presence, that he had detected him in stealing goods out of my window; I immediately examined my window, which I had seen several times in the course of the day - these gloves were about the centre of the window, near the glass - I looked at the window, and discovered the gloves disturbed, they had fallen against the window; they were still in the window - they had fallen from where they had been, and laid slanting against the window, as if somebody had pulled them; the window was broken with a small pointed pebble, which was found on his person - the hole was sufficient to admit any person's hand; the glass had fallen inside - I had seen the gloves before this happened; they were not above 2 or 3 inches from the window before, but when this was discovered they were close against the window, and resting on it; there were about four dozen pairs of gloves in two packets - only the top packet was removed; that was about two dozen, and worth about 3l. - that is all that was removed; there is no area to keep a person from the window - my shop is part of my dwelling-house.</p>

            . On the 22nd of December, about half-past five o'clock in the evening. I saw the prisoner, with another, at the prosecutor's window, close together -I passed them, turned back, and saw them break the window; I saw the prisoner break the window, with the assistance of the other - I did not observe any thing in his hand; I turned away, and then the two parted - I crossed the road, and asked a gentleman to hold my umbrella, and to witness the transaction; I then crossed, and took the prisoner into custody - the other ran away; I took the prisoner into the shop, and informed the prosecutor, who sent for an officer - all he said was with using terrible oaths.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me break the window with a stone? A. No, I did not know he had the stone; I saw him with his left hand, with the assistance of the other boy, break the window; they were ten minutes about it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 22nd of December I was coming up the Strand, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, and took the prisoner in charge in the shop - I found a pebble in his possession, with which I suppose he cut the glass; he had 2l. 10s. 6d., which he said he had received for a plumber and glazier.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking down the Strand, and stopped at this shop to look at something which I thought would suit me; this gentleman collared me, and said I had broken the window - he took me into the shop; he said I broke it with a pebble stone, which is impossible.</p>
               <p>JURY to JOSEPH SHACKLE. Q. Did you see the boy break the window? A. I saw both of them at the window, and both assisted in doing it; I was ten minutes observing the transaction - the shop is between two passages - the prisoner went one way for some time, and stood looking towards the street till he saw his way clear; the other went into the other passage, and they returned to the window which they had broken, and I saw both their hands touch the gloves.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

I am the wife of Wallis Powney, of 50, Kodnej Road, a general dealer—on the night of the 8th June, the elder prisoner came into my shop and bought some bacon; I gave her change for sixpence—then Mr. Harvey came in and from what he said I looked at the sixpence and found it was bad—I ran after her and said "Please this is a bad six-pence, are you not aware of it?"—she said "No, I will give you the half-pence back again," and she gave it to the policeman.</p>

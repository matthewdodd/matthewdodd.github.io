On the night of the 10th of December Mr. Jones came in, followed by the prisoner; he called for refreshment, which came to 9d., he pulled a shilling out of his pocket and paid for it - the prisoner still sat beside him; after he had eaten his supper he fell asleep: it was half-past twelve o'clock at night - after he was asleep I saw the prisoner put her hand into his pocket, take out some silver with her right hand, and put it into her left hand; she put her hand into his pocket again - I said,"You have robbed the man" - she said she had not; I called the Policeman, who found 7s. 6d. on her, and 6d. fell on the floor - Junes was quite drunk and stupid, asleep.</p>

I am surgeon to the X division of Police—on 10th February I was called to the station to see Mrs. Wheeler; she was Weeding very profusely from the top of the head; she was very faint, and appeared much shaken—there was an incised wound about 1 or 1 1/2 inch long, extending to the skull; I stitched it up—the right cheek was very much swollen, and there was an abrasion of the skin—there was a cut on the forefinger of the right hand—she complained of pain in the abdomen, but I did not examine that—she was not dangerously hurt—I was shown a knife and a hammer—they might have caused the injuries I saw.</p>

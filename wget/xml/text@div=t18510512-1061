                  </hi>. I live in Winchester-street, St. Pancras. On Saturday, 1st March, the prisoner came to my shop, between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening—he had a quarter of a pound of cheese, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he offered me a good sovereign—I took it up-stairs to get change, and when I came down the prisoner said he had got threepence—I gave him a halfpenny out of the threepence—I had put the sovereign into a box up-stairs, where I had no other—I brought down the change in a bit of paper—when he said he would pay in coppers, I fetched the sovereign down and gave it him—he then bought half a quartern of flour, and he gave me a had sovereign, not the same that he gave me for the cheese—I put it into the paper that I had brought the change down in, and put it into the drawer, not looking at it—I had no other sovereign in paper in that drawer—I did not find it was bad till between eleven and twelve o'clock, when I was going to bed—I then weighed it, and it was bad—I kept it till 3rd March, when the officer called on me—my husband marked it—he was in the shop when the prisoner came for the cheese and flour.</p>

                  </hi>. I have a shop at 6, Winchester-street. On 1st March the prisoner came for a quarter of a pound of cheese—he threw a sove<lb></lb>reign on the counter, which sounded like a good one—my wife went up-stairs after change, and just as she came to the bottom of the stairs he said, "I need not trouble you, mistress, for change; I have got halfpence enough to pay for it"—he gave threepence, and my wife gave him a halfpenny—he then said he would much rather have the sovereign than the change—my wife went up for the sovereign—he took it, and put it into his pocket—he then turned round, and saw the flour on the shelf—he said, "Now I want half a quartern of flour,"and he took out what she thought was the same sovereign again, and laid it down gently, and said, "Now you must give me change for this"—my wife took the sovereign, and put it into a paper on the counter, and carried it in-doors—she gave me the sovereign again between twelve and one o'clock—I saw her take it from the place where she put it—I marked it afterwards, and gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Agg, a fishmonger, in Somer's-town. On 7th March the prisoner came for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of fish—he gave me a half-sovereign, and I gave him change—he did not remain long—there was some dispute about the half-sovereign—I thought it was bad; my husband thought it was good; a man in the shop said it was good—I then gave change, and the prisoner went away—I put the half-sovereign in the parlour, where I took the silver from; there was no other gold there—I had a suspicion that it was not good; and after we were free from customers, I went and brought it out, and tried it with my teeth—I found it was bad—my husband put it in his pocket—he gave it me in the morning—I put it in a box, and in a day or two afterwards gave it to the officer, after marking it—the box was in my bed-room—no person had the means of changing the half-sovereign.</p>

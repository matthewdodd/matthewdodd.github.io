                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. William Lovick, a pawn-broker, in Crown-street, Finsbury. On the 15th of December, I went to the shop door to take in some things, and missed a pair of trowsers—I looked down the street, and by the light of the lamp, I saw the prisoner running at the corner of Clifton-street, with something under his arm—I followed him down Clifton-street, and through some courts till he came to Long-alley—I took up these trowsers near his feet.</p>

I was on duty about a quarter before five o'clock—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner running towards me—I tried to stop him—he went on one side, and got about ten yards from me, with these trowsers under his coat, and when I caught him, he dropped them directly.</p>

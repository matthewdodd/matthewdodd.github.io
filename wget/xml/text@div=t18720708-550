                  </hi>. I live at 26, Cambridge Street, Hyde Park Square, and am a lodging-house keeper—on 2nd December, 1869, the prisoner came to my house to take apartments—he gave the name of Royston—he said he was a civil engineer, and his brother would be up from the country at the end of the week, as he had business on at Westminster against some railway company for compensation—he said his mother lived in Yorkshire, and he had a brother in Eaton Street, and he gave me the reference in Eaton Square—he said he had an uncle named Watson, in the Three per Cent. Office at the Bank of England—all the luggage he brought was a little paste-board box carefully tied up—he said his brother was coming up, and he was going to bring his luggage—in consequent of what he told me, I let him have the rooms, and tea and sugar and supplies—he never paid me—I have enquired at Eaton Square, he had not got a brother living there—I enquired at every place—I could find out nothing about him—the prisoner stopped from the 2nd December till the 13th—on the 13th he went out in the morning—he was pressed every morning for payment, and he said on the 13th that his brother would sure to be up on the 15th—he ordered his fire to be lit—I never saw him again until I picked him out at the Lambeth Police Court—I believed what he told me, and I took him in because he represented that he was in a position to pay.</p>

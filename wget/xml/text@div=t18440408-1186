On the 7th of March, at half-past seven in the evening I was in my parlour and saw a man at the door with a white apron on—I then went to the door and missed my stockings, which I had hung inside the rail—I ran after the man down one or two streets—some one caught him, and he threw his bat away—he ran further, and was caught again—I took him back to the shop—these stockings were found in the way—they are mine.</p>

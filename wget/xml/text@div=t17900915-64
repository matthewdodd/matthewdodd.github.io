On Monday, the 13th of September, the prisoner stole into the shop, and took the things in the indictment; I was alone in the shop; it is a shop for retailing breeches and waistcoat goods; it was about nine in the morning; I did not see the prisoner come in; but his going out occasioned some noise, and I turned round and saw the prisoner in the shop with a bundle under his arm; I immediately ran to secure my property, and overtook him just as he got out of the door; I ran to seize him; the prisoner dropped the bundle, and asked his way to Fetter-lane; that was after he had dropped the bundle; I immediately seized him, and told him I would shew him the way to Newgate; the shop is one hundred yards deep; I was within two folding doors, with glass, so that the prisoner saw nobody; (the goods produced and deposed to): the goods were at the farther end of the counter, near the glass doors, about twenty-five feet; when I first saw him, he was eighteen feet within the shop; I know these same goods to have been in my shop; they never were out of my shop; I missed them from the end of the counter, where they had been just before.</p>

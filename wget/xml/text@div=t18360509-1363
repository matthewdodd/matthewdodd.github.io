                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went to the prisoner's house, on Monday, the 2nd of May, between two and three o'clock, at the request of Mr. Bedford—it is No.1, Mason-street, Lambeth—I did not take him into custody, at that time—Mr. Bedford and Mr. Barton went to get the magistrate's advice, and on their return, they gave the prisoner into custody, and about nine o'clock, I found this carpet in an upper room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the natural son of the late Mr. William Surman Chambers—I was in the habit of visiting him—I lived in one of his house—he had ten houses in Whitehorse-street, Lambeth—he lived at No. 20—I was acquainted with his articles of furniture—I was at the house two or three times every day, for about twelve or eighteen months, till he went into the country, which was in July, 1834, and he died on the 17th of September following—this carpet was down in his frosst room tip-stairs, which was the room he occupied—about a month before he left, he directed me to take this carpet up, beat it, and fold it up, and put it is the black-room, on the same floor, and I did so before he left—the prisoner lodged in the lower part of the house, and paid the rent to my father—my father generally slept in the front room, and made use of the back-room as a sitting-room—he had no servant—the prisoner occupied two rooms on the ground-floor, and the kitchen—I saw him on the 6th of October following—I went into the back-room, and saw this curpet is the same place as I had placed it in before my father went into the country—I picked the key up in the front room, and the prisoner went in and unlocked the door, and I then saw the carpet there—on the 2nd of May, last, I went with Mr. Bedford to the prisoner's house, in Mason-street, and saw the carpet in an empty top room, wrapped up—we asked the prisoner to allow us permission to see what furniture he had, as we believed he had some belonging to the late Mr. Chambers—he said he had not any belonging to him—I afterwards found the carpet, which I am positive was my father's property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am solicitor to Mr. Herbert. He has taken out an administration to the effects of the deceased—here are the letters of administration with the will annexed, it is dated, 1827—there in no bequest to the prisoner in the will—I went with Mr. Herbert to the deceased house, in October, 1834—we were shown two rooms belonging to the de<lb></lb>ceased by Mrs. Hill—I do not think the prisoner was present—the rooms were both locked—the keys could not be found—it was supposed that the deceased had them with him—but we at last found a key which would open the front room, and in that room we found the will, and took an in<lb></lb>ventory of the things—we left the back room locked as it was—on the 9th of October we went again, the prisoner and his wife were there then—I said he had not got any key, that the deceased had got it with him, as he supposed, and we burst the door of the back room open—the key we got on the 6th was either found about the house, or Mr. Herbert had it with him, having found it in the deceased's pocket—the rooms were locked up—the prisoner did not pretend to have the control of the things at all—the carpet was not there on the 9th of October—I never saw it till the 2nd of May this year.</p>

                  </hi>. On 20th Nov., I gave the prisoner some lace to sew on some sleeves for Mrs. Towers—in consequence of missing some of it, I marked some insertion, laid it on the table in the room where she was, and went up-stairs. I returned in about half an hour and missed part of the insertion where the mark was—I asked her where she had put it; she said she had not got any; she only wished her mother was there, and she would tell me she was not a thief—I said she must be searched, and called the cook, who opened her stays, and this piece of insertion fell down (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is part of what I had left on the table.</p>

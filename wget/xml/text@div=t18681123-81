                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Globe public-house, York Street, Borough—about three weeks before 14th November, the prisoner, who I knew as John Jones, had something to drink, and put down a bad sixpence—I told him it was bad, and said, "Jones, I have taken a good deal of bad money lately, I am determined to find out who is passing it: mind, if you</p>

               <p>pass any money here, or attempt to do it, it will be the worse for you"—he said, "You do not suppose, Mr. Turpin, I should attempt to pass bad money with you?"—I dare say I threw the sixpence back—I afterwards gave instructions to my assistant, Mr. Daw, and on 14th December, he brought me a bad shilling—I saw the prisoner at the bar, and said, "Now Jones, as you have brought me bad money again, I shall lock you up, as I told you I should"—ho said, "Do not lock roe up, Mr. Turpin, you know I should not do anything of the kind"—he offered to give me another; I said, "No," and gave him into custody, with the shilling.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you taken a great deal of bad money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was mostly in shillings—I had received from 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in bad money, in three months—I took none of it myself—I gave the sixpence back to the prisoner, no one put it in the detector—I saw it was bad by looking at it—I said before the Magistrate, "I bent it in the detector, and bent it easily"—I have sworn to<lb></lb>day that I do not know whether it was put in the detector or not—I admit that I have sworn one thing before the Magistrate and another before the Jury—I got muddled about it—I still say that I might have done so, and very likely I did; but I have not sworn falsely—I will swear I gave the sixpence back to him—I do not remember whether he gave me another sixpence instead of it.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Turpin—on 14th November I served the prisoner with a pint of porter, which came to twopence—he gave me a shilling, and having received instructions from Mr. Turpin I put it in the detector—I found it was bad, and took it to Mr. Turpin, who came out to the prisoner.</p>

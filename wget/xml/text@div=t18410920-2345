                  </hi>. My mother keeps the King's Head tavern in Pudding-lane; the prisoner was our barmaid. On the 2nd of August my mother lost her wedding ring—in going up stairs to make the beds I found the prisoner's keys under her pillow—I saw this ring and some silver in a purse in the prisoner's box—the ring is my sister's, Mrs. Boyce—I put the purse in again, and locked the box—my sister went for a Policeman, who found in her box some gloves, books, a pair of mittens, and a pair of stockings—the gloves, books, and mittens are mine—the other things are my sister's.</p>

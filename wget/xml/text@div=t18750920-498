                  </hi>. I live at No. 30, Greenwood Road, and am the wife of Mr. James Higgs—on the afternoon of the 10th August I was walking in the Greenwood Road at about 2.30, and bad a watch and chain with me, when I observed two men, one on either side of the road—one called to the other, and he immediately rushed towards me and snatched at my chain and broke it—I did not see their faces—I screamed very loudly and he ran away, and the other man asked him if he had got it and he said "No"—his companion made use of very bad language, and I screamed again, fearing he was going to attack me—then he ran away, and I followed him—both ran away—I lost sight of them as they turned the corner, but not before Mr. Fiestal had seen them—I called to Mr. Fiestal, whom I saw coming towards me, to stop the thief—I did not promise Felton a shilling to run after the thief and catch him—the prisoners were then taken into custody—I saw Felton taken, and the other was brought into the station when I was there.</p>

At. about 2.30 on the afternoon of the 10th August I was in plain clothes in Greenwood Road with another con—stable, when I heard cries of "Stop thief!" and saw several people running, and saw Felton running—I saw a gentleman stop him, and he knocked the gentleman down, and then I ran after him—he turned round rather sharply and I caught him—he began to kick me—I did not say a word—he said he had knocked the gentleman down because he bad no right to catch him, or something to that effect—the prosecutrix came up and said "That is the man, one of the two who attempted to snatch my chain"—he heard the charge made and said nothing—I took him to the station—he kicked fiercely, but I kept out of the way, I was rather behind.</p>

On Sunday evening I took a constable with me and found him in front of the bar of a public-house in Church-street, Bethnal-green—I asked him to go and show me where he had taken two planks of mine on the Saturday evening—he went with me to Mr. Vallantine, who said in his presence they were the two he brought there, that he had brought three others there about an hour and a half before, and that he had bought a great many of him on former occasions—I found "forty-seven pieces of deal in Vallantine's yard, which are my property—they are rather wider than they are usually cut, and are not very common—Vallantine said in the prisoner's presence that he had brought them all to his house—the prisoner did not deny it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Howell, of Gracechurch-street. About eight o'clock at night, on the 27th of March, I was in Aldersgate-street—a policeman touched my shoulder, and asked if I was robbed—I looked, and found a penny-piece and four halfpence were gone—the penny was marked—I knew it again—I had a fourpenny<lb></lb>piece, some keys, and a pocket-handkerchief; they were left—the penny has a mark on it—I kept it for a curiosity.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 218.) I was going towards Goswell-street—I saw the prisoner following the two females—there were two men behind him with an umbrella, screening him—I looked under the umbrella, and saw the prisoner had got the prosecutrix's dress up with his right hand, and his left in her pocket—I saw him take his left-hand out, and put it into his own pocket—I went and told her she had been robbed—she said she had not—I told her to feel—she felt, and said she had been robbed of 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one penny-piece was marked—I took the prisoner, and found two half-crowns, and this penny, and four halfpence on him—when I took him, one of the others struck at me—the prisoner offered me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make it as easy as I could for him, as his friends were respectable.</p>

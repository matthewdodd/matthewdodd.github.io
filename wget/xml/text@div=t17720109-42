I called my wife down stairs, that I might have a second person in the shop. He looked some things out, and said he would call again for them, and pay me. I followed him, and, when he had got about 150 yards, saw him take two combs out of his pocket. I took hold of him while he had the combs in his hand, and brought him back to my shop, when I went and fetched a constable.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lewis deposed, that when the prisoner was brought back to the shop, she saw him take the things mentioned in the indictment out of his pocket, and put them in a drawer on the counter. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, said, that being in liquor, he put them in his pocket, and thought they were paid for.</p>
               <p>He called a great number of witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

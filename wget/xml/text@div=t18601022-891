I am one of the constables of the City of London—on 1st October, about five in the afternoon, I was watching Mr. Black's warehouse in company with Monger—I saw Eastmead come out of the warehouse, he went along Cannon-street, took a back turning into Thames-street, and went from there on to Southwark bridge—when he got on to the bridge he looked back to see whether anyone was watching him—I then saw him go into a recess on the bridge, where Thorby was sitting down—Eastmead put his hand underneath his apron and gave Thorby these two brushes—Thorby put them in an inside pocket of his coat—I and Monger went up to them—I told them that we were two detective officers, and I asked Thorby what he had got in his pocket—he said nothing—I told him I must search him—he resisted; at last I got my hand into his pocket and pulled out the two brushes—we then took them to the station—Eastmead would not give his name or address until I sent for his master—Thorby gave his name as James Thorby, but refused to give any address—I have found out where he lived—as I was taking him before the Magistrate the next morning, he said, "I have got myself into a bother for having two brushes given me.

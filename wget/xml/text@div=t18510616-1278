                  </hi>. I am the widow of William Victory, a plasterer; we lived at 6, Dobney's-place, Pentonville. On Monday, 21st March, I was out at work—I was sent for home, about half-past 4 o'clock, and found my husband had gone to the hospital—he came home between 8 and 9 in the evening, very ill—his face was very much cut under the right eye—he went to bed—he went to his work next day, for fear of losing it, but came home early, about half-past 4, and complained of pain all over him—he said it was the last day's work he should ever do—he left his bed next day to go to the</p>

I am a plaisterer, and live at 38, Penton-street I knew the deceased—I was with him on 31st March, at the Two Brewers, 50, White Lion-street, Pentonville—he was plaistering a copper in the yard—Daniel Bickerstaff was there, and George Emberson, my brother—the deceased was there first; he was in liquor—the prisoner came in in liquor, and fell down in the yard in a sort of swoon—she said, "Where is my <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>?" meaning a plaisterer named Jefferys, the deceased's wife's brother—the deceased said, "B—r your <hi rend="italic">Bob,</hi> and you too"—she said, "I will smash <hi rend="italic">Bob's</hi> head, and yours too, you b—y thief, I will"—Victory took a mallet by the bead, and gave it to her, saying, "There is something to do it with"—she was about a yard from him, and instantly threw it at him in a great passion—it struck him on the right eye—she did not appear to fling it with any force—she appeared very sorry when it was done—the blood spirted out of it, but not much till he bathed it with cold water, and then the blood ran—he seemed very passionate after the blow, and kicked the pail of water over—she offered to bathe his eye, but he would not permit her, and did it himself—she said if she could do him any service, she would; and if 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was of any use to him, she would give it him next day; and offered to wipe the blood off his face with her handkerchief—he bathed it about an hour; there was a great deal of blood, and he kept squeezing it, and making a fountain of the blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company, of 74, Chapel-street, Pentonville. The deceased was brought to me on 31st March, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening—he had a contused wound</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185106160023"></xptr>
               <p>under the right-eye, about three-quarters of an inch long—I probed it—it was bleeding profusely—I stopped it, and sent him to the hospital in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—this mallet would produce such a wound if thrown in the way described—on 18th April I was sent for about, 8 o'clock, and found him in bed, with typhoid symptoms, and suffering from extreme exhaustion—an abscess was forming in his neck—the wound was looking tolerably healthy; it bad not closed; the bone being denuded, it was nearly closed—I saw marks of leeches over the spot where the abscess afterwards formed—leeches would be employed to get rid of inflammatory action—I ordered him medicines—erysipelas came on three or four days afterwards, which formed an abscess on the arm—he went on from bad to worse, became delirious at night, diarrhoea set in, and he died on 7th May—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the brain and membranes were perfectly healthy, and so were the viscera of the chest and the heart—there was congestion of both lungs—the lifer was considerably enlarged—I do not think he had any disease which would have killed him—I attribute the enlargement of his liver to drinking; I do not think, that had anything to do with his death—the bowels were healthy—I examined the wound, and found the bone bare—in my judgment, the cause of death was the diarrhoea, which was produced by the typhoid fever, which was produced by the low state he got into through the loss of blood.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are not congestion of the lungs and enlargement of the liver, signs of a person being in the habit of drinking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—I think I should have found the brain healthy if the blow under the eye had been the cause of death—there is no reason why it should not be—I believe all the symptoms were caused by the blow under the eye—I do not remember such another case—the erysipelas and diarrhoea would not have followed a severe cold caught after drinking: as much as a blow under the eye, not in the way they did follow—pus forming tinder the jaw was the first thing: that might have resulted from a severe cold after drinking.</p>

I met the prisoners soon after ten o'clock on the evening of the 15th of April, in St. John-street, opposite Wilderness-row: I went to a house lower down with them, and one of them took something to drink - the other had some money; we then went to a house in <placeName id="t18250519-140-crimeloc824">West-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner DIGGINS. Q. Did you not give me 4 s., and then say I had robbed you of some money? A. No.</p>

            . I heard the rattle sprung and saw Diggins run down Peter-street: I took her and the prosecutor said she was one of them.</p>

               <p>DIGGINS'S Defence. He offered to leave his watch for 10 s. at the house, and they would let him have but half-a-crown: he then asked if I would let him have 9 s. or 10 s., as he should like to go with Harris: he went into a house with her; they came out and were quarrelling - he said she had got his watch - she said she would not let him have it till he gave her 4 s. which he had promised her.</p>
               <p>HARRIS'S Defence. We were coming down the street; he came and asked us to have some liquor - he took her into a house and gave her some liquor, and gave me 6 d: we went to another house, and he gave us ale and liquor till we were almost intoxicated; then he and I went into the house - he asked the servant to go and ask her master for 10 s. on the watch - they would let him have but half-a-crown; and then he gave me the watch; he then said he would have it or he would have my life; I ran from him and he pursued.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GRESHAM re-examined. Q. Did you give any one your watch to pledge? A. Yes; the servant of the house, but it was returned to me, and I put it into my pocket - I did not perceive that it was gone till the prisoner Harris left me.</p>

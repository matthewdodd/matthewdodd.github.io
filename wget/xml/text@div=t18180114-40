On the 21st of December I missed an ewe sheep between eight and nine o'clock in the morning; I had seen it on the 20th at noon; I went to the prisoner, White's, house in the evening of the 21st, near Harrow-weald Common, with Howell, the constable, and found the whole of a sheep, except two breasts and one leg, hanging up in a room at the top of the stairs; it was cut up into joints - I found the head in a cupboard below. White was not at home-in about half an hour he came to the door with a beatle on his back; Howell and Clark came in and secured him, and told him we had found the meat at the house; he said we might find the sheep-skin on Harrow-weald Common, among some furze-he took us there, and shewed it us; I have got it here, and know it to be my master's, by the mark on the left hip, which I put on it myself.</p>

Snow and Paul's farm, which is not their way home.

               <p>SAMUEL BRUSH re-examined. I saw the prisoner, Read, after he was taken-there were marks of blood about the field, as if the sheep had been killed there, and the footmarks of two men. They persuaded White to confess.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HOWELL re-examined. I was in the room when Read was brought before the magistrate - He asked him if he knew any thing of White, and if he was in his company on Saturday night? he said he was, that he was in liquor, and that White persuaded him to go and kill the sheep.</p>

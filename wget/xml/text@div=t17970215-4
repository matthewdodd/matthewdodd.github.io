               <p>Q. Did you tell him what you apprehended him for? - A. When I came up (I was going to take a coach to go to Hertford, to the man he said was his master), I looked on my left hand, and saw the man; I was heartily glad, I went up to him and took him by the hand, and asked how he did; he said, very well, he was glad to see me; I said, I was glad to see him; he asked where mistress was; I said, over the way; I gave charge of him; he said, what, my own cousin to go against me?</p>
               <p>Q. You are related to him? - A. I am not related; his own cousin is Squire Vincent's servant; he would insist upon seeing his master's property that he sold to me; I sent my wife to bring the horse up to him, and when he saw the horse, he said, I am a done man, or a dead man, I cannot say which; he went down on his knees, and said, I hope for God's sake you will not hurt me.</p>

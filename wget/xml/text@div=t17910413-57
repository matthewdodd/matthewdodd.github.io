The first thing I saw was a razor laying on the bed; I says there is the instrument that hath done it; where is the woman. Frank turned round to the right-hand, to the bed, and says here she is; she was laying at the head of that bed on the floor. I went to her, and says, Mrs. Taylor, are you dead? my dear; she said no: I said I shall take a pillow, and put it under your head; she said, hold my head, Mrs. Junor; the people rushed into the room; she said hush, let me die easy and quiet; I repeated these words to the people, and said go fetch a surgeon for her; I lifted up her shift, and saw her bowels laying on the floor. Immediately one Surgeon Price came; as soon as he came in, he said, O the woman is a dead woman, there can be nothing done: says I, Mr. Price the woman is in a dismal situation; cannot she be moved off the floor? At this time her bowels were laying on the floor, her right arm almost cut off, and the other arm cut about the wrist, and the other parts of her body cut, and her thighs violently cut to the bone, about the middle: I said, you that have a good heart, stay in the room, and let the rest walk out, and let other assistance come in to help the woman on the bed. We got her on the bed, instantly Surgeon Cook came; he said, my dear Mrs. Taylor, as long as there is life there is hopes.</p>
               <p>How soon after that did she die? - She lived all night sensible.</p>
               <p>Do you think, from that appearance, that she was in a dying state? - Yes, she told us that she was sensible she was dying: I says to the deceased, would you have Mr. Baxter to pray over you? I sent for him, and the gates were shut, it was so late. I looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130057"></xptr>round the room and found a bible, and read to her, that I might be of as much service as I possibly could to her. A gentlewoman, one Mrs. Man, came into the room, and said to her, how did it happen Mrs. Taylor? she said, we had a little drop of something hot, and went to bed, and there was agreeable together; and she said that she did all that lay in her power to please him in bed, when they were connected together; and he said that she could do nothing for him, for on the Friday night she had slipt out of the house, and she had lain with Mr. Walker; he turned his back to her, and she turned her back to him, and prayed that he might go to sleep, and thought that he was asleep: instantly he turned again, and what she told me his words were, I cannot remember; but she got out of bed, to jump out of the window.</p>
               <p>Did she say why? - She might say why; but I cannot repeat the words she said; that he came with a penknife and cut her so; I said, my dear, it was a razor; no, she instantly said, it was a penknife. During the reading, I asked her if she would have a little drop of wine; she said, if my wounds were as found as my heart, I should live yet; give me a little drop. When Surgeon Cook came she said the same as she had said before to me. I staid with her till she died, she was sensible from that time till six in the morning, and about half after six she died.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. You have been neighbours with the prisoner and the deceased some time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you been intimate with them for some time? - Never very intimate, any more than good morning or good evening.</p>
               <p>You visited much? - Never, as I know of.</p>
               <p>She said that her husband had accused with sleeping with

             the night before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When they went to bed they were in very good friendship, they bid one another good night, and then turned round: how long do you understand it was that she laid between the time of his turning about, and the time that she got out of bed? - I cannot tell, I did not ask that question.</p>
               <p>When you came first to the house, at the threshold of the door, without being asked, he said that his wife was dead, and that he would surrender himself? - He said, here I am, Mr. Thompson.</p>
               <p>You do not know, as you have not visited the prisoner and his wife, what sort of a man he was before? - I have seen her with violent bruises.</p>
               <p>Are you able to state, from what you know, whether the prisoner had been at all deranged in his senses? - Never, since he came into the parish, or into London.</p>
               <p>Now the poor woman said, and you are sure she said, the wounds were made with a penknife; and when she spoke to Mr. Cooke, the surgeon, she likewise continued in the same story, and said it was done with a penknife? - She did.</p>

               <p>I am a widow woman living in St. Catharine's; I have known the prisoner and his deceased wife five or six years. The deceased was a very sober, honest, industrious woman, worked very hard, was a good wife, and tender mother; I was setting up up with her the night she died: about one or two o'clock, while a person was reading by her, and she did not know I was in the room, she called out to me, Mrs. Francis, rub my feet, I am troubled with the cramp; after that we joined in prayer, and praying for the family, she desired me to stop, and wished me to come to her head, and told me, mind what I am going to say to you: I am crossing the water to Jordan, I am not crossing the water in a boat, but taking my steps minutely; I then asked her how the misfortune happened; then she began and told me how they had some words on Friday, that he beat her most cruelly, and she went out, and staid out all night; that she returned on Saturday to make it up, and in the afternoon he wanted to be agreeable, but she told him she could not yield directly to do as man and wife did, in the afternoon, but every thing was very agreeable, nothing passed amiss, they had their diet and tea together,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130058"></xptr>and they supped at night, and they had a pint of two-penny, and made it hot; after that they read together, and went to bed, and had that together, which man and wife have together; and he grumbled because she was not altogether agreeable to his mind; afterward they turned back to back: she lay still for some minutes, he was grumbling; this while she said nothing: he put his hand outside the bed, and took a knife out of his pocket, and began to cut; after he had cut her, she got out of bed, to the foot of the children's bed, where they lay, to get them to cry out for assistance, and he followed her, and knocked her down; she got up, and got to the window to help herself, and then he knocked her down again, and cut those dismal wounds. After that he turned to go down stairs, and came down three stairs, and went back again to her, and asked her whether she was dead; she said she was not quite dead; he asked her if she would forgive him; she said she would forgive him, but there was a higher power to ask forgiveness of. He then said, as he had had his will of her, he would go down stairs and kill Walker, who lived next door, a man who is a very honest sober man, a good husband, and a tender father; she then desired on her death bed, that as her husband had taken her blood of her, some good Christian might see and take his.</p>
               <p>How long after this conversation was it that the poor creature died? - She died at half after six, and this was about half after four; at a quarter before six the doctor came, and she said that she thought the doctor might give her a comfortable draught, as she seemed to want to go to sleep,</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When she talked about Jordan, did you think she was then in her perfect senses? - I did.</p>
               <p>There had been some words, and the difference between them was perfectly settled? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They had been as man and wife, and she had not given him satisfaction, and the prisoner grumbled, and then he put his hand out of bed, and took a knife and cut her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After he cut her he went out, and then returned again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So that there could not a moment elapse before he returned, and then he came round, and then he knocked her down? - No, Sir, you are wrong, he did all his execution before, and returned, and asked her if she would forgive him.</p>
               <p>And then he said he would kill Mr. Walker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She mentioned all this to you after she had complained of a pain in her head? - She did.</p>
               <p>There had been some ground of jealousy? I believe not.</p>
               <p>At least the said he had charged her with it? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with these neighbours? - Some time.</p>
               <p>Have you visited together much? - No, only as a neighbour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mrs. Francis, I suppose this woman used to go to meeting? - Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>I suppose so, by this language of talking of going over the river Jordan? - Yes.</p>
               <p>- PRICE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon. Between nine and ten, on the 20th of March, at night, I entered the room, and found the woman laying on the floor, with a blanket over her, and a pillow under her head. I turned the blanket aside, and the first thing that came to my view, was three-fourths of her bowels lay on the floor; on this, with the assistance of a couple of women I got her on the bed; I examined further, and found two wounds on the neck, about three or four inches long, and one on the wrist of the right arm, a mortal wound, because it had divided some of the arteries, and a large wound on the fleshy part of the left thigh, pretty near the body, six or seven inches long, and several other wounds, about nineteen in all: after I had been in the room about twenty minutes, I went home, as there was no prospect of my rendering her any assistance, so I gave it up as a forlorn case.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with the woman?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130059"></xptr>- She informed me that she and her husband had had a pint of hot before they went to bed, and they went to bed together, and had connection with each other; and after they had been in bed a few minutes, he began to be in a passion, and to curse and swear that he would be her butcher, and told her that such a person gave her more pleasure than he did: she informed him his suspicions were groundless, for she had been serving her maker all the day, for she had been bred to that from her cradle.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you how she came by her wounds? - She did not.</p>
               <p>- COOKE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon, I live in St. Catharine-street. I came into the room (being fetched by the person who took the man) to this woman, who I found laying on the bed. After the other person, Mr. Price, had left her, I examined her wounds, found her in a very bloody state from head to foot; I asked what was the cause of it; they told me it was done by the husband Taylor; the woman's bowels were laying out, I endeavoured to put them in; I was at least an hour employed in this; I found it ineffectual, and she begged she might die in peace. I saw it was to no purpose, for the wounds were such that she must die; I let her alone, from the wounds the abdominal large blood vessels were divided, which was the cause of her death. On her wrist I saw a large artery cut, which would have killed her; I then examined her from head to foot, and found upwards of twenty wounds; I then administered some wine to her, in order to preserve her life, to get from her the cause why this happened; I asked her particularly this, whether she provoked her husband to do this; she said by no means in the world, he was a base man, and had often threatened to do it. I said, Mrs. Taylor, I should have supposed the man to have been mad or insane, to commit such an outrage as he has on you: she said, now believe me, he is not any more insane or mad, no more than you. I told her she must die, and I was very sure her husband Taylor would be brought to justice; she said she hoped so: she said they had had something hot, and went to bed on Sunday evening, and when they were in bed, she turned her back, as was usual, to go to sleep, and thought he was asleep, and said that he took a penknife (which proved afterwards to be a razor) and cut her across the belly; that she got out of bed, in order to go to the children's bed, which was in the same room, to alarm them, but he got out after her, and knocked her down.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the magistrate's? - I was, the last time he was examined.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any thing he said there? - I heard him say that he had taken from God Almighty what he could not restore; he was guilty of the fact, and must die; and he did not care how soon.</p>
               <p>Was any thing reduced to writing that he said before the magistrate? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Did you either at that time, or any other, discover any derangement about the man? - I never did; I went down to the watch-house after I had left the woman; he had not then gone to prison, I had the curiosity to see if he was or not insane. I saw no symptoms of insanity about him; he seemed very much distressed in his mind, but never uttered any thing that led me to suspect he was insane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. At the time you addressed yourself to the woman, you certainly entertained some idea that he was insane? - Before I saw him, I did; I said I should suppose within myself, that he should be insane to commit such an outrage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then it was your comment on such a violent act? - That is all.</p>

               <p>I am an headborough. On Sunday night, March the 20th, I went to Taylor's house, he was standing at the door; the people told me that was the house, and that was the man. Mr. Thompson, says he, you may come in, it is over, my wife is dead. I immediately took hold of him; he says, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130060"></xptr>need not take hold of me, I will not hurt any one; I ordered two men to lay hold of his hands; both his hands were all over blood; they took hold of him; I took a candle in my hand, and went up stairs, and there I saw his wife lying down on her right side, between the bed and the window.</p>
               <p>Did you see any instrument? - Yes (two razors produced bloody), I found these two razors: I took him into custody, and took him to the watch-house; I thought his wife was dead: we had a surgeon there in about five or six minutes, and he said she was not fit to be moved: I took the prisoner in a coach to New-Prison: before we got to the watch-house, I asked him how he could do such a thing; he said, it would have vexed any man to have his wife out all night, and sleep with another man; and he said he was sorry she was not quite dead. After he was inside New-Prison, I told him I fancied he would never see his wife alive any more: he asked for some water; the keeper said, there was a water-cock, he might get some: we turned the cock, and he washed his hands, but did not drink any.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mrs. Francis. Where did you find that razor? - I went to stoop to take some things away, and it fell plump on me out of the window, close by the bed where the prisoner and his wife used to lay.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jones. The razor without the handle I saw laying on the bed.</p>

Says she, I will tell you: we were very agreeable all day, and we read in the Bible in the afternoon, and at night we had a little hot, and he was not satisfied with it, but wanted a little more; I said to him, we have had as much as we can afford; upon this, we went to bed very agreeably, and after a bit he fell a grumbling, and said, d - n your eyes, you b - , and then turned his back on me, and I was in hopes he was a going to sleep; and instead of which he was feeling in his pocket for a small knife; and he said, d - n your eyes, you b - , now I will dispatch you, and gave me a cut on my arm; but, says she, it may be I may live a little longer, as I have got a good heart.</p>

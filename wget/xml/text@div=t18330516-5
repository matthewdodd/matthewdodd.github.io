            . I am the son of the last witness. I was in the sitting room behind the shop - on Friday, the 19th of April, about half past 6 o'clock, three or four little boys came in and gave me an alarm; I went out at the street door to see what had been done; a window had been cut about 6 weeks before, and several little toys stolen on that occasion - a patch had been put over the hole and secured with putty - I found this patch was cut or broken; the putty had been cut away under the glass, apparently by some sharp tool like an oyster knife, that had been forced under the glass and started it up, and a piece off the patch had been pushed in; the hole was only the size of part of the patch; perhaps it was a big as half of my two fingers - I then went into the shop and opened the glass frame; I took out the piece of glass which had been forced, and 2 little boxes of paints, which stood just by the hole, had been overturned, and the paints drawn through the hole - I went out and spoke to the little boys, and learnt from them, that they should know the person; I told them if they should see him to let me know - the prisoner was taken up that night, but I did not see him till I was at Worship-street Office on the Monday; and I there saw some paints precisely of the same description - I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

             who lives in the Hackney-road. I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160008"></xptr>one of the boys who went into Batchelor's shop on Friday evening, and told him what I had seen - I saw the prisoner put a stick through the window with a point at the end of it; it was straight; he shoved it through the window and the piece of glass fell in, and then he said he would give me half if I would not tell; but I went in and told Mr. Batchelor, and he came out - I saw the prisoner take out some paints when he said he would give me half - I did not know him before - I took notice of his face and dress; he was dressed all in cord - Mr. Batchelor told us to go and look after the prisoner - I went and saw him again about five minutes after looking into a snuff-shop in Shoreditch; he was looking in at the window at the snuff-boxes- I then went back to Batchelor's and told him I had seen him - I met a policeman, and he took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was standing at the window at the same time, and he poked his finger through it himself, and told us to bring out the boxes. Witness. I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He told me to take out the brushes, and they would do to paint with. Witness. No; he said he wished he had got a knife to cut the window out, and then he could get all the things.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How far from the hole were the paints? A. He stood close to the window; he got the paints out with a stick; they were in a case, but he could not get the case out - the hole was not big enough - he got the whole 15 out - I went in to tell directly I saw him doing it.</p>

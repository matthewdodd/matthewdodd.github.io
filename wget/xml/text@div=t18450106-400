                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker. I live in Grange-road, in the parish of St. Mary Magdalene, Bermondsey. These boots and shoes were placed on a show-board in my shop-window—I saw them safe at three o'clock in the afternoon, on the 25th of Dec.—my shop was shut and locked at that time, and I went out to spend the day—I came home at half-past eleven o'clock—the door was then on the latch, not locked—there were no marks of violence—the door had been apparently opened with a key—I am sure it was locked when I left home—I saw a glass bottle standing on the cutting-board, as if a person had brought a light and put into it—the boots and shoes produced are all mine—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

I found these goods on the prisoner, in Staple-street, near Long-lane, in the Borough, about eight o'clock in the evening, on the 25th of Dec.—I asked her what she had got under her cloak—she said, shoes which she had brought from home—I asked her what sort—she said men's—I asked her how many—she said she did not know.</p>

I was on duty on Christmas-day, and saw the prisoner in company with a female and a man, passing from the direction of the Grange-road up to the neighbourhood of Kent-street—I called my brother officer, and we followed the prisoner and took her—I heard my brother officer question her—she said she had got some boots and shoes, which she brought from her own home.</p>

Q.</hi> I believe she was committed for receiving the goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I will swear she was not committed for receiving the boots and shoes—I have not seen the calendar—a question was put by the chief clerk to Mr. Trail, to know whether she was to be indicted for burglary, or breaking and entering, and he said, for breaking and entering, which satisfied me that it was not receiving.</p>

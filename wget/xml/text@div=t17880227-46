               <p>How long had you known him? - About two hours and a half, or three hours before.</p>
               <p>How did you become acquainted with him? - The prisoner came to the Hotel as a stranger; he was asked to dinner with me, by Mr. Frome; he said, he was just come from Paris, where he had laid out 20,000 l. with Monsieur Le Roy, a famous watch-maker of that city; he said, that in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270066"></xptr>Holland they did not like French watches, for they were too slight; that he came to England for the purpose of buying English watches, for they were more solid; I told him, I knew a friend of mine, (meaning Mr. Carpenter) who was able to serve him, and I believed was a very honest man; after dinner, he asked me for his direction, and I sent my brother with him, with my compliments to Mr. Carpenter, and the gentleman wanted to buy some watches of him.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you his name? - He did not; I never knew his name, not even when he signed the draft in my presence.</p>
               <p>After Mr. Carpenter went away with the bill, what became of the prisoner? - The prisoner took the watches, and carried them into his room; Mr. Carpenter gave me two watches, which the prisoner did not chuse to buy, and desired me to put them away; I put them in my bureau in my own room; in the mean time, the prisoner took the opportunity to go off with the watches he had agreed for; I went in search of him, but could not see him; I went to Bow-street, and wrote a description of the prisoner to have hand-bills printed from.</p>
               <p>You do not know what his name is now, do you? - I have reason to suppose his name is Vander Cruysen; he signed that name upon the back of the warrant.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him write except that bill? - Yes, he has wrote for me part of a letter in Dutch to my wife, who is a Dutch-woman.</p>
               <p>Do you know his hand-writing? - I cannot take upon me to swear, but I thought it was something similar.</p>

               <p>About three or four months ago, I carried some watches to the prisoner at the bar, at an Hotel, in Jermyn-street, but they were all too small; upon coming out of the house, I enquired what the gentleman's name was.</p>
               <p>You did not hear his name yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him write? - Only what he wrote at the office; he signed upon the back of the warrant, Vander Cruysen, as his own name.</p>
               <p>Sims. I saw him write it.</p>

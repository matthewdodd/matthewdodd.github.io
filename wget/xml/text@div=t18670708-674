                  </hi> I am potboy at the Woolpack tavern, Hart Street, Cripplegate—the prisoners have a room next door; I know them all—about the end of February W. Bulkley came in, and asked me to mind a horse and trap, which was just outside No. 2—I did so, and W. Bulkley brought from a dozen to eighteen white parcels out of the cart, and put them in the passage of No. 2, Hart Street—it was between six and seven o'clock, I should think—Batterham came afterwards and asked me for Mr. Bulkley; I said, "He is inside, going up stairs"—I knocked at the door, and Wilford Bulkley said, "Who is there? "—I told him the gentleman with the furry waistcoat from Easton's—he said, "Tell him to wait till the proper time in the morning, ten o'clock"—R. Bulkley was at that time inside the door of No. 2—Easton's doors were open at the time these parcels were brought out—Batterham stood by the tavern door—W. Bulkley came down about a quarter of an hour after<lb></lb>wards, and I told him again it was the gentleman with the furry waistcoat; he said, "Well, if he wants me, tell him to call at the proper time in the morning," and then he drove off in the trap with his brother Richard—on the second day afterwards I saw both the Bulkleys again, near dinner-time; Wilford asked me to mind their horse and trap—R. Bulkley brought these parcels down the staircase and put them into the trap, but they had changed the papers; they were white when they were brought in, and now they were brown—from twelve to eighteen were brought out—I noticed the size of them, they were the same as I had seen before—the two Bulkleys came to No. 2 during the week—I saw Richard Bulkley change some of the papers when he was carrying them down.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">W. Bulkley. Q.</hi> Was that at the end of March or the beginning of April? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't fix the date; you brought the parcels from the first floor to the chaise, and your brother brought them from the room to the thirst landing—I did not see you change any papers—you sent mo up for two parcels, and while I was up your brother changed some—I saw the inside of the parcels, they were the curtains that have been shown.</p>

Bulkley took away, and the elder Bulkley brought parcels to the house, which he took away himself—no explanation was given to me why the parcels were left—in consequence of directions from my husband, I directed W.

                  </hi> I am a wholesale carpet and drugget manufacturer—I have seen one of the Bulkleys about a year ago, but have had no trans<lb></lb>actions whatever with them—the other two prisoners were in my employ<lb></lb>ment, Batterham was manager of the blanket department, and Buckley was in one of the minor departments; he was the holder of the keys; ho locked up the premises at night, at six o'clock, took the keys home with him, and opened the premises at 8.30 in the morning—after the first examination before the Magistrate I received a message and went to the cell to Batter<lb></lb>ham—he said that he was guilty, it was no use denying it, that he took away the keys from Buckley and opened the door, and that he believed Buckley to be perfectly innocent—one night after the robbery Buckley came to my house and wished to give up the keys, as he wished to be rid of the responsibility, it was two days before he was taken—I did not take the keys from him, because I had then perfect confidence in him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was W. Bulkley doing business by himself when you traded with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, all the invoices are made out to him alone—here is Hunter Street on this invoice, I do not know that he has left there—I never had any transactions with young Bulkley, and do not know of his having any interest in the concern—the bankruptey was 4th March—I do not think I did business with Wilford at that time—the endorsements on these cheques is Wilforcl'e writing to the best of my belief.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you seen him write? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—this invoice of the reps on 4th December is our late clerk's writing—I have no doubt at all that I received that quantity of rep at that time from W. Bulkley—I took no means to ascertain where he got them, because we buy of so many people—we do make inquiries, but I am not the buyer.</p>

                  </hi> I was managing man in this business at White<lb></lb>chapel before the bankruptcy—we bought reps about 24th December—I may have bought them—I will not say positively.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">W. Bulkley. Q.</hi> How long have you known me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four years—I have paid you about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at different times—I have bought goods of every description of you—you gave me references—I have refused to purchase as many goods of you as I have bought.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">W. Bulkley's Defence.</hi> I should not have pleaded not guilty had it not been increased to 750 curtains; I always pleaded guilty to 138 pairs. The damasks are Ackroyd's goods, and are as common in the trade as postage stamps. The goods sold on 21st December could not be his at all, because</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186707080047"></xptr>
               <p>his stock was correct that. With regard to the damasks sold to Messrs. Johnson, the prosecutor missed no goods till they saw my invoice. He was taken to Messrs. Nathan's and saw four piece of rep and some damask, and recognised all he saw, and wishes you to believe they are his employer's goods, though they were sold eight or nine days previous to the stock-taking. If he has lost the goods there is nothing to prove that I am connected with them. The Nathans during the last three years have paid me over 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. My brother never knew anything at all about this; he received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. every Monday morning, and was only a paid clerk; he had to attend to the office in my absence, and he never forfeited to the extent of a farthing in any of the transactions. I alone am guilty with regard to 138 pairs of curtains, and the damasks I leave in your hands.</p>

            ; we were stationed abreast of Hern Bay, Kent. On Monday night, the 23d of April, after twelve o'clock, we went on our station - it was the morning of the 24th. I was stationed on the beach, abreast of the town at Hern Bay, Sydenham Snow, was the officer, he was midshipman of the Severn, employed on the same service, and was an officer of His Majesty's Navy, and acted as a deputed officer of the customs. I was under his command that morning, he came to me about a quarter before three o'clock - it was his duty to visit us from one part of the district to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. After you saw him, how long had he left before anything happened - A. About three or four minutes; he had gone to the westward, and I eastward, and in about four minutes I heard a discharge of fire arms, and turning round westward, a whole body of musquetry was fired in a direction between him and me - I heard the whistling of the balls, and the balls heaved up the shingles as they were fired.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there only one firing - A. More; I retreated towards one of our men, (Wilson,) eastward, and there was a firing from another party. I found such a considereble firing there, that it was impossible for me to get to Wilson; that firing proceeded from another party, not the one that fired first, and I heard them, and I heard a sort of cheer, and cry,</p>
               <p>"Kill every *** on the beach;" these cheers proceeded from several persons repeatedly. I found several of them were following me, and firing at me; I heard the whistling of the bullets, and being before two fires, I retreated up the bill or bank, and there remained about half an hour or more till I had an opportunity of going down the beach, when I saw some of our party and joined them they had come to my assistance. I was armed with a pistol and cutlas - I discharged my pistol in the direction the firing came from.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first discharge your pistol - A. At the first beginning, after the first firing - it was after I was fired at, and as I was proceeding towards Wilson, I fired my pistol, and as I went towards him, I loaded my pistol again, (having my cartridge loose in my pocket) and fired it again in the direction of the smugglers. I was fired at repeatedly before I fired the second time. I loaded my pistol again but did not fire it - it was a very dark night; there was a very heavy lightening at intervals, which might make it appear darker.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity by the light the fire-arms made to see whether many people were assembled - A. Yes, by the flashes of their arms, I could see the number of men. I should think the first party was twenty or more - these was the party to the westward. To the best of my judgment, the party to the eastward was composed of the same number - they were more straggled; there were more continual firing from the eastward, than the west. I do not know what became of them. When I joined my party, I was informed something about Mr. Snow. The bullets<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060027"></xptr>came very near me; they went in different directions; they were fired both above and below me - not in the air, they were fired at me.</p>

            . I was a seaman on board the Severn. On the 24th of April, I went on duty at twelve o'clock at night; my station was the next to the village of Hern eastward; I was next to North. I saw Mr. Snow first about a quarter before two o'clock - I saw him twice; he passed backward and forward to the men at the next station; and after he had passed me the second time, about a quarter of an hour or better, I heard a pistol fired - the report of the pistol came from behind me, about the village, in the direction Mr. Snow had gone. On hearing the report of the pistol, I fired to give the alarm to the next man - I fired in the air. I then heard a volley fired at the same place, where I heard the first fire - I saw the the flashes very plain. I could not tell how many pieces were fired; they fired at different times, perhaps five or six together; there must have been a great many - above twenty I am certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you guess from the report, if the fire was from pistols or musquettry - A. Both large and small fire-arms. I immediately loaded my pistol and ran on towards the fire - I had only a pistol and cutlas; the firing was repeated constantly in two directions; I heard the balls whistle past me repeatedly, and the shingles came against my trowsers. I ran as close as I could get to them, about fifty or sixty yards, and then I fired, and they opened a volley upon me. After I discharged my second pistol at them, I endeavoured to get nearer, but found the firing come so close on me, I was obliged to get up under the bank - they were then about fifty yards from me. I heard them sing out several times</p>
               <p>"Murder the *** and kill them;" the fire continued about eleven or twelve minutes; they fired right towards where they saw me fire from, as if at me, and the other party fired towards the village. I was joined on the beach by Parker, before the fire had ceased; I then got behind a boat which was turned up, and fired again off the boat's keel at the party - I could see them distinctly when they fired. We went along right up towards the village, where the firing was, and got abreast of the Ship Inn, and saw Norris, the landlord, at the window; he said something to me, in consequence of which, I ran down directly on the beach with Parker, and found Mr. Snow laying on his back; he sung out</p>
               <p>"Wilson, I am wounded, I am a dead man." I found him laying extended on his back, with his cutlas near him, and his hat on the other side; the tide was flowing, and the water was over his shoe-tops - if he had not been moved he must have been drowned - the tide was three quarters flooded, it would not have been above three or four feet higher. I observed his mouth had blood on it - it appeared to come from his mouth; two other men came down from the eastward station, and we carried him to the Ship Inn; when he was brought to the Inn, he begged us to send for the parson - one came, and I went out of the room.</p>

            . On the 24th of April, I was a seaman of the Severn, and was on duty. I was stationed eastward of Hern Bay; I heard a firing about a quarter before three o'clock, to the best of my recollection; it proceeded from Hern Bay - it was the report of several fire-arms.</p>
               <p>COURT to Wilson. Q. The first thing you heard fired was a pistol - A. Yes; I could not guess who it was fired from.</p>
               <p>T. PARKER in continuation. The first I heard was several fire arms. I cannot say whether it was pistols or what, I ran towards the firing as fast as I could, but could see no people at all. The firing continued; as I ran along the beach towards the bay, they fired behind the house at me off the green bank.

I ran up to Wilson.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe your wife's father lives at Littleborn - A. Yes; I was there in April last, several different times, and saw Beer at my wife's father's house - I cannot say how long it was before the 23d; I saw him two or three times out of doors as well as in.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you - A. It was talked over about smuggling, about working some tubs; he said that he and West and Lawrence had got some tubs coming.</p>

               <p>Q. During this time, did you see West - A. Yes; I saw him after the first conversation with Beer; I saw him passing my wife's father's house, and called to him; I knew him before. Nobody was with him, I asked him when he expected the boat to work, he said he did not know.</p>

               <p>Q. How come you to ask that question - A. Beer told me West was concerned in it - West said he did not know, but when the boat worked, he would let me know.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether he snapped before any body fired, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060029"></xptr>cannot tell - A. I cannot; just as he snapped his, two pistols, S. Lawrence who had a pistol, and M. Lawrence, who had a brass blunderbuss, both fired in a direct way towards him, they were, I suppose, fifteen or twenty yards from him, I cannot say the distance - on their firing, the same persons advanced towards the working party - I do not know whether he had any thing but a pistol; I did not see him again.</p>
               <p>Q. What took place - A. There was a great deal of firing from our party - I think it was only from our party; they kept firing for two or three minutes. The working party at this time were taking tubs from the boat at the water's edge, to the carts. We were not quite close to the beach. Beer told me it was spirits of gin and spirits of brandy - they were put into the carts - the two foremost went away first, and Webster's cart stopped behind, to take up some tubs, which were scattered about; they were all carried away, to the best of my knowledge. Webster is a man who jobs about, carrying coals.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the party - A. I have something else to say - all the tubs I thought were taken away, but I heard West, Beer, and Lawrence say, they had not got all they expected the boat to bring. When they got them safe in the cart, they began to huzza, and cheer; and say,</p>
               <p>"All is right." The armed men then assembled round the cart; the two carts went away directly - they were filled. Webster's cart stopped behind for three tubs, which were taken out of the water; the carts went on from Hern, and we went after them, to some distance on the road, and then returned to Littleborn - most of the party went as far as Hern, and then dispersed. West parted from me at Sturry, about five miles from Hern. I saw West the next day, Wednesday, thatching, at Mr. Westbrook's; we were talking about the boats working; he said there were sixty-five tubs worked, and they expected eighty-one to come in all - but they had not got them all; he asked if we wanted any money - Homans was with me; he said, it did not matter just then - he said,</p>
               <p>"I have got but little," and pulled out 9 s., and said we might have it between us if we liked. I said, I would have none; he gave Homans 7 s. - this was all that passed then. I saw

            . I have not seen her for thirteen years. I was married at Sandwich, it might be fourteen or sixteen years ago. I cannot tell how long I have been married this second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever in possession of some 5 l. Bank notes - A. That business was since this, it was three weeks or a month ago. Mr. Smith, the officer, who I went with to Hern, told me when I returned, that there was a charge against me; he told me so at the Marquis of Anglesea, public-house - I have passed many notes in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You may answer or not, how long before you was at Bow-street, had you passed the first note, that was supposed to be forged. - The witness declined answering the question.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When were you first married - A. I do not know. I have only been married twice. I was very young when I first married. I do not know what age I was then or am now. My mother tells me, that my first wife was buried at Deal. My second wife has her certificate to produce - she is here. I think I have been married above twelve years to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How many cartridges were delivered to you - A. Fourteen as near as I can tell; I know I had three in my pocket, in the morning, and one in my pistol, and I might have drawn some out of my pocket in loading my pistol. I was about fifteen yards from Mr. Snow when he fell - I did not see him fall, but saw him rush in among the company - I did not see him after. I knew nothing of his falling, only Edward Homans said,</p>
               <p>"There is a man fell." It was a finish night, the moon had been up about half an hour - I could see a man fourteen yards off. I gave information to Stride nine or ten days, or a fortnight before the transaction - it was after I saw West and Beer. I could not tell Stride exactly where the boat was going to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a 1 l. note from a 5 l. - A. Yes, and that is all. I do not know all the letters in the alphabet. I know a person is coming up to say I wrote a letter for her - (Mrs. Fuller). I have known her very well for seven or eight years - I can neither read or write.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in custody - A. Not at all, Homans and another are in custody. I have been to see them four or five times, and saw them this morning here.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not going to ask if you have been guilty of felony, but have you been in prison - A. Yes, three times; the first time was twelve or thirteen years ago, about some money that a man and I were partners in. The second time was about two years ago, for standing in my own defence, when a farmer suspected I had his things, and stopped my cart on the road. The third time was last summer, that was for a fine for smuggling. I was on board a man of war seven or eight years ago for smuggling,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060030"></xptr>when I was taken with a pair of tubs on my back. I think they are the only times I was in trouble for smuggling.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not something about some oil once - A. I lent a man money to buy oil, and was taken up because I went out to see it measured. I was confined by the Mayor of Canterbury for two or three days - I was not tried for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw your father-in-law the morning after this transaction, did you not tell him you, yourself, fired eleven times - A. Not to my knowledge, if I did tell him I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q A. few days after this happened, you went to Mr. Snow's brother - A. Yes, to give information of the matter. I had told the Custom-house officer, it was to be done in the Isle of Thanet. I thought it proper to tell Mr. Snow, on purpose to save people's lives.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not go to Stride on the 23d of April - A. If I had, I should not have known where the party were going. I went to the House of Correction to see Smith and Homans - Smith's sister wished me to shew her down to him, and I went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not talk about this matter - A. Very little - we have not communicated together about it.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. You saw them this morning in the room with other witnesses - A. Yes, I did not know the goods were to be landed at Hern Bay till after we left Hoath; it was eight o'clock on Monday when I knew where they were to be landed; I went to Stride that night; I first knew of the charge about the notes when Smith and I came to London; I had been to London before, and in consequence of my communication, a Bow-street officer was sent with me to Deal, and on my return this charge was made - that was about a fortnight or three weeks after the 23d of April; all the prisoners, except Webster, were in custody when the charge was made - I was examined and discharged.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there any understanding that you were to be discharged because you were to be a witness in this case - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You fired seven or eight times; did you fire at any body - A. Not at all; I bit the ball out of my cartridge and fired in the air; I made no objection to their taking fire-arms, if I had, they would have had suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Sidders, your brother-in-law, that you fired ball cartridges - A. Not to my recollection; I could not tell him, for I did not.</p>

We had a glass of gin a-piece to drink, and then set out towards Hern Bay; I cannot say how many there were of us, but I think about sixty, ten or twelve went first across the fields, they were the armed people, I was with them, and so was Griffiths, Homans, and West; we went across the fields, and the rest went another way; the night was darkish, and rather gloomy, there had been no moon at that time.</p>

I was taken up on Sunday; I work in the woods as well as smuggle; I do not know the hide in the wood, I know no place where arms or tubs are hid - I was in custody before I gave information, I cannot deny the truth - I come here to save my life - I do not know how many times Griffiths fired - we were all straggling about on the beach; it was dark, we could not tell what each other did; the moon got up while we were in the fields, there was lightening.

            , there was a room full, and some out of doors; there was about sixty in all, pistols were given to us there, and cartridge halls; there was some shots given, I had eight ball cartridges, some had more; a pistol was given to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said what was to be done with the arms - A. The party all agreed among themselves, that if the blockade men ran away, to fire on them, the prisoners heard it, and all agreed to it. We each had a glass of Hollands to drink there, it was a common smallish glass, about half a quartern, then some went one road and some another, I went with West, Williams, and Griffiths; I do not know how many there was of our party, I should think about eight, not more - we went along the road about twenty rods, and then into the fields; I saw three carts by Richardson's - I do not know who was with them - we met the other party down at Hern Bay, at the back of the house, it was the same party that left Richardson's; the prisoners were all there, except Webster - I do not recollect seeing him that night, when we got there, the party was shifted, some to go to the right hand and some to the left; West and W. Williams were with me on the left, the other party went to the right, the other men stopped till the boat came, and then all went down between us. I saw West bring two tubs up from the beach, one in each hand; I was so far off, I could not see the working party; they soon began firing on the right, and we began firing - I cannot say whether our party or the blockade party fired first, I heard pistols go off on the right, and we on the left fired right all along the beach; I did not see any body on the beach, we agreed to run after the men if they ran away, not to shoot them, but to fire over them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it agreed what to do if the blockade men stood, and did not run away - A. I did not hear that mentioned, the firing continued about ten minutes; I saw a man on the beach, laying on his back, right in the middle between our two divisions - I went up to him, I did not think any thing had happened to him myself, I spoke to him and ran away, leaving him there - we all went away and followed the carts - I saw two tubs of gin put into the hind cart by West, the other carts were gone. These were what I saw West take up and put in after - I saw the man laying on the beach; we then went away to Sturry -

             went in and had a pint of beer at Sturry, and then went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see West after this - A. Yes, on Wednesday morning, he was thatching at Mr. Pembroke's. I was with Griffiths - we talked things over there, and he gave me 7 s. I did not hear any thing about tubs. Griffiths asked him for money, he said he had but 9 s. in his pocket, and Griffiths said he would wait till another time till he had it all.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the pistol which had been given to you - A. I carried it home, and fired it two or three times after. I put it into the drawers; Smith, the officer, afterwards took it away. I was taken up on the following Sunday, and have been in custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. What are you - A. I go with horses, but have not been this year. I have been a bricklayer. I have only worked two boats. I have known Griffiths six years - I had heard he smuggled, but was not with him, except this time, and one other, on the coast below Rickebar - I was not armed then. I was never accused of any thing, but was once before Mr. May, the Magistrate, for not doing justice to my master. Griffiths was on the right side party, I was with mine - the moon was up. I was apprehended in bed, by Smith, and a pistol was found at my house. I was brought to town on the coach, with West, Beer, the two Richardsons, and the last witness. I saw Griffiths at the House of Correction several times; Smith and I were confined in one room together. Griffiths was confined in the same prison for near a week, slept and eat in the same room, and talked together about this business; he came to see us last Wednesday, and talked about the evidence we were to give here. I think I saw him four times - he stopped about half an hour once, and sometimes an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How much money did Griffiths ask for - A. He mentioned no sum. I never charged him with shooting Mr. Snow; I only solicited W. Williams and Griffiths to assist in landing the spirits.</p>

               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Was Griffiths in prison on the same charge as you - A. I expect so; I was there a week or more before he came - he was afterwards discharged.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you set off from Littleborn, did you know you was to go armed - A. No; when I found we were I was sorry I was there - we took them to keep the men at bay. I fired once, and fired my pistol off in the field.</p>

On the morning of the 24th of April I was alarmed by the discharge of fire-arms, I got out of bed, looked out of the window, and saw a number of people on the beach, and a boat on the shore - there seemed to be twenty or thirty men; they appeared in motion from the boat up the road, and appeared to be carrying something. I saw no cart or horse - I could not tell what they were carrying - they passed on, and soon after I heard a person mourning on the beach, and heard him say,</p>
               <p>"Lord, have mercy on me!" and in the course of a little time four of the men belonging to the preventitive service came into the road; I called to them, and Mr. Sydenham Snow was brought to my house - I knew him before. He was first taken into my bar by four of his men, and then into the parlour; he requested a clergyman to pray with him, and I sent for Mr. Dornford, who came; I also sent for a medical man, and then sent to Whinstaple for another medical man; this was on Tuesday morning - he died at my house about eight o'clock on Friday morning.</p>

            . I am a Surgeon. I was sent for to Hern Bay, to the Ship Inn, and saw Mr. Snow - he was wounded in his right shoulder, and right thigh; the left shoulder was dangerously wounded - I arrived there about seven o'clock in the morning, the clergyman was there then; I did not leave Mr. Snow until his death.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060033"></xptr>I had some conversation with him about his wounds. Immediately on my arrival, I found the wound in the left shoulder was mortal - he was paralyzed below. I did not apprize him that the wound was mortal; he expressed his apprehension that he should not recover, he said he considered himself in a dying state, and told me he should never recover, before I entered into any conversation with him - I believe he expected he should die, the clergyman had been with him. He stated to me, that in visiting his men, on returning from North, Parker, and Wilson, he desired them to give a good look-out, as he saw a boat near, as he was returning towards Hern Bay, he saw another boat, and desired his men to look-out; that as he had passed his centinels, and got down to Hern Bay, he endeavoured to gain the road, and a party of armed men rushed down on him; he received the small wound in the middle part of his left shoulder, from fire-arms; he attempted to fire his pistols, but they both snapped; he threw his pistols away, and drew his sabre, and while in the act of cutting and slashing, he received the shot in his left shoulder, the lower extremity became paralyzed, and he fell; he knew nothing further of what happened, till the party of armed men came to take the goods from the boat; when that was done, he was taken from the water's edge (his feet being in the water) by part of the blockade men - he mentioned Wilson's being the man who spoke to him, he was carried up to the Ship. He stated, that one of the smugglers stood over him with his legs extended, and said,</p>
               <p>"You *** you lay low enough" - he died on Friday morning. I extracted the balls, one from under his right arm-pit - that was a large pistol ball; the other appeared either a slug, or a duck shot - that was in the thigh. I can hardly tell what it was - I produce them. I saw his clothes, the cape of his great coat was partly blown away; his inside blue jacket was very much scorched - the person who shot him must have been very near.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you at Sturry three weeks ago - A. I was going to Canterbury to market, and went in for refreshment - I do not know either of the prisoners' friends; I sent the answer to the letter to my sister; I have enquired for it she has not got it.</p>

            . I am a dealer in confectionery, at Canterbury. I know Webster, his stable-yard joins my house, he generally comes to my house every night for a light to do his horse up with - I well remember on Easter Monday, the 23d of April, between nine and ten o'clock, he came to light his candle, as usual, to go to his stable; I believe his horse and cart were there, I know the cart was in the yard; he went to the stable as if to dress his horse, if the cart had left the yard, I must have heard it, as there is a height of about six inches by the curb, which he must go over; I saw no more of him till next morning at twenty minutes before three o'clock - I asked him to call me up, as I was going into the country, and remember perfectly well, that on that morning his father-in-law died.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he called you up, did you see his cart in the yard - A. It was to the best of my belief; I did not go to the window to see. It is ten or twelve miles from Canterbury to Hern Bay and back; I believe Hern Bay is eight miles from Canterbury; his father-in law left a widow, she is now in that state that she cannot be moved, Webster's wife is living.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. He called on you on Tuesday morning - A. Yes; it was light enough for me to see the time-piece on my mantle shelf. I travel about the country, and keep a shop at Canterbury, he flung something against my chamber window to awake me, my window looks into the front street, the garret window looks into the yard. I came down stairs, opened the door. I asked him how his father was at the window, he said, he would wait a moment, and I came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go that day - A. Nearly to Deal, I travelled alone, I will not positively say the cart was in the yard in the morning. I went to bed at night about five minutes after ten o'clock; it was nearly twenty minutes before three o'clock that he called me - I could see my time-piece.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It was very near the full moon, I believe - A. I believe it was the last quarter. Webster's mother's name is Prior.</p>

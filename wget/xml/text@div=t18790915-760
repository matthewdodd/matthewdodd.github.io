I am Rector of Spitalfields—I have employed the prisoner for the last 10 months since he came out of prison—he had latterly the charge of Wentworth Street Bagged School and has been a messenger at the Rectory, and in paying bills and taking parcels—the offence he had committed had nothing to do with counterfeit coin—he had a character for honesty—he had charge el the soup kitchen, and always proved himself perfectly honest—he has had money entrusted to him week by week and day by day, and there was never the slightest inaccuracy—I believe he has really endeavoured to reform.</p>

On the 11th of July, I hired the prisoner for a fortnight, at 10 s. per week, and his board, as my husband was from home for that time; he was with me from Friday until Tuesday, the 15th. He had no money on Tuesday, for I lent him 6 d., and that afternoon he asked me to go to the grinders, for some razors, which were there, as he could not do without them - I went, leaving him in care of the place. I was gone about two hours, as I stopped out of the rain - when I returned, the shop door was fastened; I went in at the side door, and he was gone. I missed this property, which was in a brown silk purse, in a small box, in the first floor room, in which I had left the key, but I locked the room door, and put the key into the kitchen closet. He heard me tell my son that morning, that I had not paid my rent, as my landlord was out of town, and that I had the money in the house ready for him. He never returned for his few days' wages, nor for a neck handkerchief and waistcoat, which he has left there. I never saw him again until he was in custody. I went to his lodgings, but could not find him.</p>

            . I am a hair-dresser. I saw the prisoner at the Red Cap, public-house, at Holloway, on Wednesday, 16th July, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon. I had known him for two years; he gave a boy a penny to fetch me to drink with them; he changed a half crown to give the boy the penny, and then another to pay for drink; he was tossing with the hostler, and lost a pint of gin, which came to 1 s. 6 d. and changed a sovereign to pay for that and for some bread and cheese and for his bed, as he had slept there the night before. I saw more sovereigns in his hand - a few words occured, and he threw down a sovereign, and wanted to fight me for it - I refused. I heard of this robbery a day or two after, and apprehended him in Chandos-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any previous quarrel with him - A. About fourteen months ago, about his robbing my mother-in-law. I did not see him after that till he sent for me to the Red Cap. I told him he must have robbed somebody of that money; he said his master was dead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left my place, it being a very low neighbourhood. I did not like to work there, on account of my character. I never saw the money, I always had money of my own; the prosecutrix was always pressing me to drink gin - she drinks four or five glasses a day. I never saw twenty shillings in the house.</p>

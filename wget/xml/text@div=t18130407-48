I saw him make several attempts to pick the gentleman's pocket. He put his hand in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070036"></xptr>the gentleman's and took the handkerchiefs about three parts out. The gentleman feeling him he took his hand out. The prisoner followed him. He then clapped his eye upon another gentleman's pocket; the gentleman looked round; the gentleman had a friend with him. The prisoner pretended to look up at the fire when the gentleman looked round. He directly took the handkerchief out. I said, sir, to the gentleman, you have been robbed. I laid hold of the prisoner. He let the handkerchief drop. I put my foot on it. The gentleman said, he hoped I would let him have it. I said, no, you must attend before the alderman the next day. He said, he would not.</p>

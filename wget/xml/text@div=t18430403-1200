                  </hi>. I am the widow of Thomas Clarkson—I let a furnished room to the prisoner on the 22nd of June, 1839—it contained these articles—about July he came home one night tipsy—I went up stairs to put out the light—he was sitting at the foot of the bedstead—I said to him, "Where is my bed and bedding?"—he said, "Get out, or I will kick you down stairs"—he got up to do it—I went and told my husband—the prisoner went away, and locked the door—his wife came on Saturday night and promised, in his presence, that the things should be brought back the following Satur<lb></lb>day—his wife brought back a bolster, and said the prisoner was gone for the bed, but he never came back with it—I did not see him till he was taken.</p>

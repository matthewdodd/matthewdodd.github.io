On the 23rd of September, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop with another person; she asked for some ribbons; I shewed her some. I saw her take a ribbon out of the box; I was very much frightened, nobody was at home but myself; I let her go to the door; then I had courage to ask her for it; she held the ribbon out, she dropped it in the mud; I asked her if she was not ashamed of taking the ribbon; she said, no. She gave me a blow, and ran away; I ran after her; an officer was coming by, he took her. I am sure she is the same person; I never lost sight of her.</p>
               <p>- CAVE. I am an officer. I was going by, I took the prisoner in custody.</p>

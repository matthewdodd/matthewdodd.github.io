On the 27th of December, I went out with my sister, who leads me about; in my way home the prisoner came to me, and said, she had travelled sixty miles, and was very hungry; I told her if she would come home with me I would give her some food. She went home with us, and my sister made her some tea. I told my sister to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150005"></xptr>give her a gown and a pair of stays, as she said she was very naked. She then said, she had pawned a box for five shillings, and asked me to lend her money, and she would pawn one of the gowns which were in it, and pay me. I sent my sister to pledge my ring for three shillings, and lent her two shillings and nine-pence of the money. The prisoner remained with me while my sister went with the ring; when she returned, the prisoner asked me to go to a public-house with her, to see her husband; I and my sister went with her; we had some beer, and then we all came back to my house again; the prisoner came back with us to take her old things away. When we got back the prisoner told my sister she would give her in charge if she did not go home; I told her she should not turn my sister out. I had bolted both my shutters. I went out and locked my door, and asked the prisoner to lead me to my sister's; it was about ten o'clock at night. When the prisoner came out, I locked both the doors, and put the keys in my pocket. She took me the wrong way, and left me in the street, saying, she would return to me-a person came by and took me home. When I got home, I found my door was locked, as I had left it. I let myself in and locked the door after me. I found one of my shutters unbolted, inside, and the window was downa person could get in at the window from the ground; my lodgers were all in bed. I went to my box, which I had left locked, and found it open. I missed the articles mentioned in the indictment; the box was in the same room that the prisoner was in.</p>
               <p>REBECCA BOND. I went out with the last witness, who is my sister; the prisoner stopped us, and asked her for charity. The prisoner went to my sister's, and had tea with us; afterwards I went out and pawned the ring for three shillings, and my sister gave the prisoner two shillings and nine-pence of it; she then went to a public-house with the prisoner, and then we all returned to my sister's house again; in our way the prisoner took the shawl off my shoulders, saying, you will go and pawn that next. Before we went out my sister fastened the shutters. When we returned the prisoner would not let me go into the room, she pushed me, and got my shawl of my sister's bed; I told her I was going to get my shawl, but she said I should not. She pushed me out at the door; I went out and called, through the shutters, to my sister, saying, that the woman wanted to rob her, and not me. The prisoner then came out, and said, she would give me in charge. I went home, and I was afraid to go back again. My sister had not been drinking, except some porter which she had with the prisoner. The next morning I went back to my sister, who told me she had been robbed. If the shutters were open I could get in at the window myself. I knew my sister's clothes, I used to put them away for her.</p>
               <p>GREEN. I am a police-officer. I know the prosecutor, and the house, which is in the parish of St. Margaret; she is a lodger, but the landlord does not live in the house. The prisoner was described to me on the 28th of December, I knew her, and went after her to a house which she frequented, several times, at Marsh-gate, Lambeth; I, at last, found her at Moulsey, on the 7th instant; she had this bonnet on her head (producing it,) I met her in the road, and took her into custody; before I said any thing to her, she cried, and said, she knew what I wanted her for. I took her to her mother's, at Moulsey alm-house. I searched her, and found a duplicate on her, it was tied up in a handkerchief, which she threw upon the floor, she said it was the duplicate of a gown that was pledged at Kennington. I went to the pawnbroker's, whose name was upon the duplicate. I produce the gown.</p>

               <p>REBECCA BOND re-examined. My sister only rents the room in which she lives, the landlord does not live in the house. The house is let out to different persons.</p>

               <p>The prisoner pleaded distress.</p>

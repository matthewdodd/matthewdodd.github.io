I went to No. 10, York-street, London-road, with three officers—the street door of the house was open; I went in and proceeded to the back room on the first floor—the room door was open; I went in and saw the prisoner Hillyer come from the fire-place—the officer, Evans, called out, "Don't let that man go"—Hillyer had his shirt sleeves tacked up and was coming from the fire—there was a clear fire in the grate—I pushed him back into the room—I saw one shilling melting on the fire, in an unfinished state—Neville came into the room and I gave Hillyer into his custody—at that time I saw Witham come from a little oval cupboard under the back window—I gave her to sergeant Brown—I examined the cupboard and found this zinc battery plate, a cylinder, and a piece of copper wire—the cylinder was all wet and the coals—I went to the grate and found this ladle with white metal in it, very hot; almost in a state of fusion—I found on the table this saucer, with wet sand in it; this file, with white metal in its teeth; and this mug, containing sand and water—on the window sill I found a saucer with black composition in it, and under the grate a small portion of white metal, very hot—while I was searching the room, Evans brought in two plaster of Paris moulds; one was for casting two shillings at a time—they were broken and very hot—Hillyer said, "I don't live here; I live in Tyers'-gateway, Bermondsey"</p>

I went on 29th Oct. to No. 10, York-street, London-road—I followed the inspector into the back room on the first floor—he gave the prisoner, Hillyer, into my custody—after the room had been searched, I took both the prisoners to Stones'-end station, in the Borough—while we were in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, some one in the street called out, "<hi rend="italic">Ben</hi>, have they got you <hi rend="italic">to rights?"</hi>—Hillyer answered, "Yes; too right for me."</p>

I accompanied the two last wit<lb></lb>nesses—when I entered the room where the prisoners were, I saw the prisoner Hillyer pass a small parcel to Witham, like a white rag, and Witham momentarily put her hand through a broken pane of glass, and threw the parcel out of the window—I saw her hand when she drew it in again, and it had nothing in it—I called to the inspector, "Don't let the man go;" and I went down to the back yard, where I found a small parcel, tied in a white rag, on a shed under the window through which Witham had put her hand—I knew that by the window being broken—the parcel</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, M</hi> 10). I went with the other officers—I saw Hillyer's left arm through a broken square of glass; pretty well up to his shoulder—I left the room, and returned without having found anything—when I took the prisoners to the police station, I met Hallett, who gave me this handkerchief and 44 counterfeit shillings tied in the corners of it—when I saw Hillyer put his hand out of the window, his sleeve was tucked up.</p>

On 29th Oct., between 12 and 1 o'clock in the day, I was coming out of the water closet—I stood for some minutes, and while there I saw a handkerchief come from the back room window of the next house; it was thrown sideways by a naked arm—when the handkerchief fell, I went and picked it up—it had burst and shot the coins out—the coins were tied in both corners; one lot in one corner and one in another—about 12 pieces fell out—I took them up, I did not count them—I gave them to Sergeant Richards.</p>

                  </hi>, Jun. My father kept a public-house at Ealing, and it now dead. John East, the pot-boy, brought home a lot of pots; among them was one with the prisoner's name on it—here are five pots in all, with the prisoner's name on them, "William Bennett," but which were my father's, Henry Dodd—the prisoner keeps a beer-shop—my mother now keeps the Horse and Groom, at Ealing—the prisoner lives near us—here is one pot which I can swear to—I have others to match with them—I can dis<lb></lb>cern where the name of "Oliver" has been erased—my father succeeded Oliver—here are three which I can discern, and there is the broker's mark at the bottom—some of them were found in the prisoner's possession by the officer—when he was in custody, as we took him to Brentford, he said to me, "Dodd, if it goes against me, don't be too harsh, you shall lose nothing by it"—the policeman was present when that was said, but I believe he did not hear it—he bad just got out of the cart.</p>

               <p>which he brought me—I then ordered another pint—he did not bring that, but it came from his house in two pots of this sort—I afterwards went to Dodd, and asked him if he had lost any pots—I then went to the prisoner's house and said I wanted to look over his pots—he said, "Very well"—I looked over them with Dodd who identified several—the prisoner said they were not Dodd's—he told the Magistrate he bought them of a Mr. Terry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you hear any thing pass between him and Dodd, in getting out of the cart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not there, I was just inside the gate of the station-house—the cart stood against the gate—it was me who found the boy's trowsers—I found them in a room in Mr. Dodd's house—Dodd and East took me to the room—Dodd opened several places before he got to the box—the boy fixed on the box—I asked Dodd if the boy might take them—he said, of course, if they were his—he said they had, most likely been put there by mistake, in taking the inventory of all the things, and the matter stopped there—the boy did not make any charge of felony—he came to the station-house some days before, and said that his trowsers were stolen.</p>

               <p>How came you to take out the purse in her presence? - I do not know, because I was foolish; she charged me five shillings for the bed; I took half a guinea and paid five shillings for the bed, and the other five shillings and six-pence was spent in wine.</p>
               <p>You was not very sober I suppose? - I was not drunk, Sir; I lost a studd out of my wrist, it was a Mocoa stone set in silver; in the morning I awaked, and found my breeches, instead of under the pillow, upon the pillow, and my purse and money was gone; I found the purse on the table cut in three or four places, I cannot tell what time it was when I awaked, it was not light, it might be four or five; the window was open, and the curtains drawn; I called to the person of the house, and the maid answered that the door was done; the woman's name is Lumley, I heard of the prisoner at No. 3, Goldsmith-street, at one Eaton's, on Sunday afternoon; I went to her, she was alone at her lodging, I suppose Mr. Eaton came up; I asked for her.</p>
               <p>How did you get her name? - I had her name.</p>
               <p>How did you get it? - I had it.</p>
               <p>You must give me an answer? - I have given you an answer; Mrs. Lumley gave me her name, and even her maid was the person that gave intelligence where she was.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the woman you saw at Eaton's, was the same woman you had been in company with before? - Yes, that is the same person, I have looked at her, I asked her whether she could give me any of the money again; she said she had it not in her possession; she said she knew nothing at all of it, she gave me the studd before the constable, it was my studd; my money was not marked.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. This is a very pretty, a very entertaining, a very becoming sort of a story; because I observed, when you first came up to that box, you came smiling and laughing? - No, I did not, I do not know that I did, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect that you was laughing? - Somebody gave me a push on the back, as I suppose, as I was coming up, I did not smile at the Court.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that you did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220089"></xptr>smile and laugh when you came up there? - I do not know, I might smile.</p>

               <p>Who are you? - I am a dealer in cattle, when I am out of London.</p>
               <p>Then you came to London about your cattle? - Not on purpose.</p>
               <p>That makes me suspect that here is rather an over-charge as to the money? - Not purposely, I did not come.</p>
               <p>You was at the Swan with Two Necks in Lad-lane? - That day I dined at one, at the Swan with Two Necks.</p>
               <p>How much money might you spend in liquor, before you saw this young woman? - I spent none, for I paid nothing there, I spent it between Lad-lane and this place.</p>
               <p>You drank, I suppose, pretty well at your dinner? - Yes, I suppose I drank some liquor at my dinner.</p>
               <p>Do you only suppose that? - Yes, I know I did.</p>
               <p>You had drank pretty plentifully at your dinner I take it? - Yes, I drank some liquor.</p>
               <p>What liquor? - I drank porter, and I drank punch.</p>
               <p>What might your reckoning come to? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave the Swan with Two Necks? - At Five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Then you was enjoying yourself from one to five? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then from five to half past six, it was that you was getting this four or five miles to Temple-bar? - I suppose I was; I know I was an hour and half getting to Templebar.</p>
               <p>You did not walk very strait? - Yes, I did; I do not eat a deal, but I drink a good deal.</p>
               <p>Do you know what women you met in the way? - No, I cannot tell their names.</p>
               <p>Amorously inclined, I suppose at this time? - I suppose I was at that time, I do not know, I accusted one, I cannot rightly say what part of Fleet-street I met her in.</p>
               <p>How many places did you stop at in going? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to say that you knew every thing you did with your purse, and every part of the money you laid out during that hour and half? - Yes, I will say that I know what money I had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Which way did you get into Cheapside? - I do not know that.</p>

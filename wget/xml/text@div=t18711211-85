                  </hi>. I am porter at 21, Grosvenor Mansions—on 20th November, about 7.45, I received this letter from last witness—I put it in the pillar letter-box at the corner of High Street Place, Victoria Street, as near 8 o'clock as possible, with this other letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), addressed to Mrs. Coulson, 132, Lower Bagot Street, Dublin—she is a tenant who has apartments in the house, but was then staying at Dublin—I enclosed in the letter another letter directed to her, and also a little memorandum—I posted the letters in the usual way; I put them into the pillar box the same as I always did—I have been living in that street ten years, and I have been in the habit of posting letters sometimes eight or ten times a day—I put the letters in at the top—there is a plate that goes in, and you can drop or slip them in, and they will either fall out into the street or fall into the box—I am certain that I pushed them in (<hi rend="italic">model produced</hi>)—that is the way I put them in, and they dropped over—if they did not go in they would come out into your hand—I am positive they went over that ledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The letter now contains just what it did when I posted it—I posted the letters in the ordinary way—I had no other errand—I simply went out and posted the letters, and went back; it is just across the road—this box has not been there very long, not a year—it has not always had the same aperture, the old one was different from this, it was taken away and a new one put—I don't recollect that I heard the letters drop in the box, there is such a noise in the street—I saw them disappear, that I swear—the mouth of the letter-box is towards the railings of the houses; it stands on the kerb—I have seen the inside of the box when the postman has taken the letters out, but not to notice it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On 20th November, about 10 minutes past 8, I was on duty in Victoria Street, and saw the two prisoners standing close together, side by side, close by the pillar letter box; they did not touch it—they were standing quite still—I was coming from Victoria Station, and when I got within about 20 or 25 yards of the box they walked towards me, and as they passed me I heard one say to the other "We must look out for him"—they had just got past me—I went on, and as I passed the box I cast my eyes into the mouth of it, and could see nothing in the aperture—I am sure there were no letters at that time sticking in the aperture, not to my sight—after hearing what they said, my attention was called to the box—that was the reason I looked—there is a gas lamp not quite 20 yards from the letter-box, which shows a full light on it—it stands on the same kerb as the box, in a line with it—there are no lamps over the doors there—after I had got a few yards past the box I looked round, and I saw the prisoners looking round, watching me—I went a little farther on, looked round again, and saw them still looking round, but they were walking on at the same time—I went on about 40 yards from the box, and they went about the same distance the other way—they then stopped on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187112110017"></xptr>
               <p>the pavement, and I stopped for about five minutes—I then saw them walking towards me again, and I walked towards them, and we passed each other—just before I got to the turning they had come past the letter-box—I then turned round to the left in Ashley Place, by the area railings, and there I secreted myself, and watched them—they went up about the same distance that I did, and there they stopped again for about two minutes—they then walked back to the box—I got round the other corner into Ashley Place, and there I could see the box perfectly plain—the prisoners came and stood by the box in the middle of the pavement for about half a minute, then they placed themselves side by side by the box, and I saw Bradley place his hand into the mouth of the box, and I could see something white appearing from it (<hi rend="italic">describing it with the model</hi>)—at that time I saw Smith touch Bradley, and they walked away, leaving the white sticking out nearly an inch, or it might have been quite an inch—it was out far enough for me to catch hold of—the prisoners walked towards Victoria Station—I went directly up to the box, and found these letters sticking out, so—I did not notice how the top one was, but this one was sticking out corner ways, like that—they were both there, but I could only see one—I am quite certain they were not there when I passed the box before—I pulled the letters out, took them with me, and followed the prisoners—they looked round and saw that I was after them, and Smith separated from Bradley—they walked some distance like that; I stopped on the pavement, and Smith looked round and then joined Bradley again—there were three gentlemen walking towards Victoria Station, and I walked on behind them until I got opposite the prisoners, when I took them both into custody—I told them I should want to take them to the station—they said "What for?"—I said "I will tell you that when I get you into the station"—Smith said "Tell me now?"—I said "It is for attempting to take these letters out of the pillar letter box"—Smith said "I shan't go"—I said "You will"—he said he should not—I asked a young man who was stand<lb></lb>ing by to go to Victoria Station for a constable—Smith then said "I will go," and I took them both to the station—on the way Smith said something about waiting for a brother or brother-in-law of Bradleys, that they had to wait outside a public-house for him—they had every opportunity of parting with anything after they left the letter box, they were some distance in front of me, and there were several people passing by—I afterwards examined the letter box—I found that the aperture was a little bit wet and damp—it was a very foggy night, it might have been caused by that—about three-quarters of an hour afterwards I saw the box opened; it was not full—there were not above forty or fifty letters in the box.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I started with the notion that these men meant to rob the letter-box—that was my idea from their conduct, and my intention was to see whether or no they did rob it—at the time I saw them move some<lb></lb>thing white, there was no one else near the box that I could see—I could not see into Victoria Street—there was nothing to prevent their taking the letters if they had so liked—I was in uniform—I heard the words "We must look out for him" quite distinctly—they had just passed me—I noticed on five different occasions that they were watching me—four occa<lb></lb>sions before they tried to get the letters out of the box, the fifth occasion was after they had got the letters to the top, when I was walking after them—I hid myself behind the railings in Ashley Place—I could see straight to the letter-box—I was twelve yards from it—I should hardly</p>

               <p>think they could have seen me, because I was in the dark—was peeping through the railings—the lamp would not throw the light on the front of the letter-box—I could see the aperture by the light of the lamp—I did not go to the public-house to ascertain if there was anyone there the prisoners knew—I did not lose sight of the prisoners till they got round the second corner, just for a minute as they turned the corner—it was Bradley's hand that I saw at the box—Smith was then standing on his right side—when I first passed the letter-box I saw nothing white sticking out—the box is about 5ft. 4 in. high—the height of the aperture is about 5ft.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk of the works at the General Post Office—I have examined the letter-box in question and made the model produced—if a letter is put in the aperture and over this incline, there is nothing to stop it from going down, the interior of the box is quite clear, there is a cavity of about 16 or 18 inches in diameter each way—there is a wire guard in front of the door to prevent the letters dropping out when the door is opened—when I examined the box there was no imperfection, or anything to obstruct a letter from going to the bottom.</p>

Gentlemen, Please send me some patterns of Brussels-carpet, suitable for a drawing-room; the furniture and fittings are dark green. Yours, truly, (Mrs.) Eliza Faulkner. Nearest Station, Shepperton, L. &amp; S. W. Railway")—Upon that I had some patterns sent, and they were afterwards returned with this letter—"Grove House, Halliford. Gentlemen, I have taken the ticket off the pattern I prefer, and enclose it. The size of the room is 18 by 6, by 16 by 9, and there are no crevices, so you will know what quantity to send. Yours (Mrs.) Eliza Faulkner." On the receipt of that letter I had measured off a quantity of carpet for a room of those dimensions—about 51 or 52 yards—I gave directions for it to be sent off as directed in the letter—I did so from the letter, and the name of Faulkner in the letter—I recognised the name—we have customers of that name—I believed that there was a Mrs. Faulkner residing at Grove House, Halliford—I do not know whether any invoice was sent with it—the value of the carpet was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard, it came to £13 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

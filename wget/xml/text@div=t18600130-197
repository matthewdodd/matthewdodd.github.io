               <p>Bartholomew-close—I was there on Saturday night, 21st January, between; half-past 10 and 11, and saw the prisoner there—I had never seen him before—there was a dispute about paying the proper price for a quartern of gin, but it did not last a minute—I passed through the bar and went out at the back—I afterwards returned, received some information, and went to look after a glass which had been taken away—I went after the prisoner, found him in Bartholomew-close, and asked him to give up the glass which he had taken away—he said that he would not—I said that if he did not I would give him in charge for stealing it—he said that he would smash it about my head rather than give it up—a policeman came up, and I turned my head to tell my sister, who had come up, to go away, and received a tremendous blow on my head with the glass, which was a very thick one, in the policeman's presence—I did not attempt to strike the prisoner before he struck me—I did not use my hand, or make any threat.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 235). I saw the prisoner in Bartholo<lb></lb>mew-close holding a glass in his right hand—the prosecutor asked him to give it up—he said that he would not, and rather than that, he would smash it about his head: and struck him a violent blow over the left eye—the glass broken and his face was cut and bled very much—I then took the prisoner in custody—he seemed very much excited and I think he had been drinking—I did not see the beginning of the scuffle—I only heard the prosecutor ask for the glass—I did not hear him say anything about a tailor.</p>

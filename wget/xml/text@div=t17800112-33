On the 8th of December I went there in the evening at about seven o'clock; I went up stairs about half way up the stairs to the two pair of stairs room; there was a turning in the stairs, and it was very narrow from thence to the top about three or four steps; I then stood and saw both the prisoners at work.</p>
               <p>How were they dressed? - I believe Benfield had the same clothes on that he has now; his great coat was off.</p>
               <p>What were they at work about? - It was at a drawer, a kind of trough; I saw both their hands in the trough busy at work; I said to Mr. Clarke, there they are at work; the door was wide open, as I was going into the room I kicked against the steps, one of them I don't know which called out holloa; upon that Turley turned down the drawer where the moulds and flasks were; one of the moulds has the impression very clear; Turley catched hold of the flask and hit it against the window and broke two or three panes of glass in attempting to throw it out; I hit him with a stick on his arm and caused the flask to drop within the window, instead of going through the window. Turley attempted to run by me but I prevented it; and by that time Clarke and Jealous were in the room and had hold of them; when we took up the drawer where the mouldings were; there were patterns for half crowns and shillings; the impressions were chiefly broke, but some of them are very clear now; we examined the fire; there was a crucible on the fire three parts full of metal; Mr. Clarke will describe the metal.</p>
               <p>Did you search either of the prisoners? - I held them while Jealous searched them; we found three crucibles, and the frame and the boards of the flask which makes the flask complete; there was some bad silver found on Benfield, and some in the room I believe, but I did not find them.</p>

               <p>That information came from Mrs. M'<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120055"></xptr>Ginnis I believe? - It might, I don't know; I had it from Mr. Clarke.</p>

               <p>Do you know Mrs. M'Ginnis? - Yes; I would rather catch her than any of these men.</p>
               <p>Where is this house? - In a little court in Bowling pin-alley.</p>
               <p>The stair-case was extremely narrow? - Yes; on the top of it.</p>
               <p>When you went up half way the door was wide open? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The street door was wide open? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How narrow may the stair-case be where you stood and saw the men at work? - Room enough for two to pass, till I came to the turning.</p>
               <p>I believe there are rails at the top of the stairs? - I believe there may be; I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>How many windows are there in the room? - One I believe.</p>
               <p>Where was that? - To the right as I stood on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Where was the fire place? - To the right too; I could not see the fire place on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Where did the trough stand? - Close to the window; a child on the stairs where I stood could not help seeing them from foot to head.</p>
               <p>What part of them was towards you? - Their backs were to me; the one stood at the end, the other at the side of the trough; they might have seen me if they had looked.</p>
               <p>I need not tell you, as you know very well that you are entitled to a part of the reward if they are convicted? - That is nothing new to me.</p>
               <p>What led Clarke and you to this house? - Mr. Clarke told me what he was going there for; I went with him; he told me he had received an anonymous letter.</p>
               <p>You was lucky enough to go unperceived by these men till you saw them at this trough? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Turley. Was my hat on or off? - I I don't know.</p>
               <p>You say you saw two men working at that trough, was there room for two men to work at it? - There was room for three men to work at it; it was a drawer out of the chest of drawers.</p>

               <p>Did you find any thing else in Turley's pocket? - Nothing else; in Benfield's pocket I found a bad shilling and a bad six-pence, and a good shilling and a good six-pence with it, in his other pocket I found some bits of cuttings, I believe they are bits of six-pences cut, it is bad seemingly; I found two shillings and a six-pence in the room behind the fire place, they are bad.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Did you go to this house with Prothero and Jealous? - Yes; I went next to Prothero up stairs; he turned back and told me they were both at work; he went up stairs; I heard the flasks and money fly; Turley threw the flask at the window, but it did not go through. We secured the prisoner. I then applied myself to the place where the flasks were; I picked up the sand which fell out of the flasks; I found a quantity of pieces of metal in the window; I found some black copper in the window likewise. I found these four shillings, they are counterfeits; they are quite finished. Upon the ground and in the sand I found these pattern shillings from which the others are cast, they are good. This crucible was in the fire with this metal in it; I poured it into the sand to cool it; it is a mixed metal. There were all the implements complete for coining, file, scowering-paper, a pair of cutters, crucibles, facing sand, and moulds.</p>

               <p>The whole apparatus is complete? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Look at that money which is said to be taken out of Benfield's pocket? - There is a shilling and sixpence bad, and a shilling and sixpence good.</p>
               <p>Is the bad money cut or cast? - One of them is cut I believe, and the impression put on afterwards; the other may be cut too, I rather think it is cut.</p>
               <p>With all the implements you found in the room could a piece of money have been completed? - No; there could not in my opinion.</p>
               <p>In the next place there is a fluid necessary to complete it? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>For the purpose of throwing up the silver colour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing else wanting? - No.</p>

               <p>Did either of the prisoners live in that house? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What made you go to this particular house? - An information.</p>
               <p>What was the description of the house, by whom kept? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Have you any objection to tell from whom you received that information? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that it is necessary to prove the persons at work in these cases? - No, I do not know it.</p>
               <p>You do not conceive it to be of the essence of the proof that they should be proved to be at work? - No; I do not.</p>
               <p>Prothero told you they were at work? - He did.</p>
               <p>You was contented with that information, you did not see them at work? - I could not see through him.</p>
               <p>You saw nothing of that? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you look over the house, to see if there was the appearance of any people lodging there? - I did.</p>

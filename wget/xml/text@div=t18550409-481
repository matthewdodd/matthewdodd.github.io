                  </hi>. I live with my father and mother, at No 29, Glasshouse-yard. I have known the prisoner since 1850; he is a coppersmith—my father is an engraver—the prisoner knew my mother—I am twenty years old next birthday—when I first knew the prisoner, I was about sixteen years of age—he was then married—his first wife died whilst I knew him; he married again in 1851—he first paid attention to me at the latter end of 1850—he was then married—it was in May, last year, that he first bad connection with me—I became pregnant, and was delivered of a male child on 7th Feb. last—I first mentioned to the prisoner that I was in the family way on 18th July; he had then had intercourse with me twice—I told him that I was going to have a child—he then said, "That child must not be born alive, or else it will be the ruin of me"—he said he would get something to do away with it—he asked me if he was to give 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and write a letter to that effect, would I say it belonged to some one else—I told him that I would not—he asked me to meet him again, and I saw him two evenings afterwards in the City-road; I mean in the road, not at any house—I told him that I was very uneasy—he offered to take a lodging for me—he did not give me anything then—I met him again a fortnight after<lb></lb>wards, at the corner of Beech-lane, Barbican; that was in the afternoon—he crossed over to the Prince of Wales coffee shop; I crossed with him to the corner, and he then gave me a pill, and said that would partially do it, and the next would do it altogether—I swallowed it in his presence—I did not remain with him, or have any further conversation with him then; he went away about two minutes after I had taken the pill—it was a dark brown pill, with bright spots, and it spangled—it made my face swell, and one of my eyes bloodshot, and it gave me great pain at the lower part of my stomach, and I felt very faint—I saw the prisoner again, between A week and a fortnight afterwards, at the same place, near Whitecross-street, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the evening—he then offered me a powder, and said that would nearly effect it—I did not take that powder; I tasted it, and took it home and destroyed it—it was two or three powders together; they were of a yellow colour, and very bitter—he gave me a pill abort a fortnight after that—it was not a pill of the same description as I had before; a different one—it made me spit blood, mixed with water, an hour or an hour and a half after I had taken it, and caused a deathly feeling, a very faint feeling—it was a very dark brown pill; the first pill was very large, the second was not quite so large—in Oct. the prisoner introduced me to James Scott; that was in the street, at the corner of Chiswell-street and Whitecross-street, in the same neighbourhood as before—the prisoner said to Scott that he would give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he would do it—I went away and left Scott and the prisoner together—the next time I saw Scott by himself—that was two or three days afterwards—Scott then offered me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090101"></xptr>
               <p>some powders—I asked him to give them to me; he would not let me have them; he wanted me to take them in his presence, and I would not—I saw Scott three times altogether—on the last occasion, he Offered me a bottle of mixture; I heard him tell the prisoner that he had had to bribe the assist ant to get it before his master was up; he said it was oil of savin—Scott said that to Longman—I heard Scott say to Longman that the medicine would effectually do away with it, alluding to the infant—it was the oil of savin that he said that of—I did not take any of that mixture; he wanted me to take it in the Crown coffee house in Barbican; the prisoner was not present; he left Scott with me, and went by himself—I did not take any of the medicines that Scott gave me—I did not take it home; he would not give it me to take home—I did not take any medicine from the prisoner or Scott, except the two pills; it was offered, but I did not take it—after I had taken the second pill, the prisoner told me to tie a piece of tape round my stomach, and tell him day by day how much I decreased—I had not a very good labour—I have been ill for about four months altogether—my mother has met with an accident since, she sprained her ankle when she first went to look after Scott—I was attended by a nurse when I was delivered—Dr. Harris saw me afterwards, his assistant came too late to deliver me.</p>

               <p>found it out; that was when I was in the family way—I did not ask him for money at that time—he said he would call on my mother, and he did—I was present at that interview—my mother did not say at that time, that all she wanted was money for the child—she told him that no money would recompense her for the way in which he had ill used me—my father is a tradesman, and has lately been a bankrupt; he carried on business as a printer—I did not at first charge a rape against the prisoner—I never accused him of that to a policeman, or gave him in charge for it, that I swear; my mother did not threaten to do it—after he married the second time, I was not very angry with him for not having married me—he had connection with me twice; the second time was at the same place as the first—I met him, and he persuaded me to go, and I went there; that was in the evening—I had never seen his wife at that time—my child was nine weeks old last Wednesday—it is a very unhealthy child—it is the first child I ever had—I did not invite the prisoner to our house, when my father and mother were out; I am quite sure I never did (<hi rend="italic">looking at a note</hi>), that is not my writing—I am prepared to swear that; it is a forgery—I never had connection with him but twice—he took the pills out of a paper out of his pocket—he gave me one pill at a time; one a fortnight after the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Astins, an engraver, of No. 29, Glasshouse-yard. The prosecutrix is my daughter—she was twenty years old last birthday, 27th Aug.—I know the prisoner—I remember the death of his first wife—after that he wanted to marry my daughter—I told him I could not think of such a thing—I said it was disgraceful altogether—I meant on account of his age, that my daughter was too young—I took him to be between forty and fifty—I first heard of my daughter's pregnancy in October last—I heard something, and was induced to question my son—I then went to endeavour to find Scott, the doctor—after I had examined my daughter, the prisoner came to my house on Tuesday evening, 24th Oct.—my daughter was present—I said to him, "Is this the return for my kindness in procuring your liberation from prison, and feeding your children</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090103"></xptr>
               <p>when they had no one to look after them?"—(my daughter did not show much that she was in the family way, even to the last)—he murmured out, "I can't help it now," or, "It can't be helped now"—I then spoke to him concerning certain abusive language that his wife had used concerning my daughter—he said she was in a passion—I then said to him, "Here is a pretty thing; when her father comes home she will be turned out of doors"—he then asked me if I had any confidential friend where I could send her for a time—I said I had not, and if I had I should not like to trouble them upon such a subject—my husband was at Newcastle at this time—after I had loaded the prisoner with every epithet I could think of, he said, "But you know, Mrs. Astins, the child may not live"—I said, "Live! it will live fast enough, if you will leave off playing your devil tricks with it!"—he said, "What do you mean?"—I said, "You have been giving her drugs, for the purpose of procuring abortion"—he hesitated a moment, and then said, "Does <hi rend="italic">Betsy</hi> say that?"—I said, "Yes, she does say so, and more than, that, I am in possession of all the facts of the case"—he then said, "Have you seen Scott)"—I said, "Yes, I have seen Scott; and the cowardly scoundrel ran away from me"—neither I or my daughter had mentioned Scott's name at that interview before he said that—he then said, "I can't help it now; what is done can't be undone; for Christ's sake, don't expose me, or I am a ruined man"—I told him I should immediately send my husband word about it—he then wanted to know if I could suggest any plan; if he could raise a sum of money, if I thought I could get Simmonds to marry her—I said I did not think he would; it was not very likely—he then asked me, provided Simmonds was agreeable, would I consent to deceive him on the subject of the pregnancy—I said, "God forbid!"—that was pretty nearly all that passed—he asked me several times if I would appoint an interview with him, or if I would write him a letter, and I refused to do anything of the kind—I wrote to my husband, he came home on the Thursday following, and we both went to the police station about it on the Saturday night—we saw Brannan, and gave him information—that was on the Saturday following the Tuesday upon which I had the interview with the prisoner—I have been ill for three months—I have been suffering from neuralgic pains of the head, and paralysis—I am not properly recovered now—my daughter was very ill indeed before her confinement—I noticed on one occasion, that her face was dreadfully swollen on the left side, and one eye appeared very much closed and bloodshot, and I noticed that she murmured in her sleep—on one occasion she complained of sickness.</p>

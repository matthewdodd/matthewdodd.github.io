                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer. The prisoner was brought to my house on Saturday, 5th April, as a lodger, by another tradesman—I had two boxes standing one on another, under the window in my bedroom, containing my own wearing apparel, and my wife's—I went to the boxes on Tuesday, and found the hasp broken off one of them, and I missed a waistcoat, and two shawls—I gave him in charge on Tuesday evening—I first saw him in the house on Tuesday evening, between eight and nine o'clock—he was then sitting nearly facing the bedstead that I lie on—he had half a bed there that night—I saw him go to bed on the Tuesday evening—I did not see him again till Wednesday evening—I do not know that the box was safe on the Tues<lb></lb>day evening, between four and five—I found it had been opened on Tuesday evening—we never tried the box—we saw the nails had been pulled out and placed in again—I missed the articles on Tuesday morning—I found the things were gone about three in the afternoon—I saw the box safe between four and five—I was in the hospital on Sunday morning—I came out on Tuesday, and then a lodger's shirt was missing—I cannot say that I saw the box safe myself—Wednesday was the only time I examined the box.</p>

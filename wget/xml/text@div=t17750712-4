            . On the 23d of June last, I lost twelve forks and one knife; I saw them about two hours before they were taken away. I missed them about two o'clock; I had laid them in the window of my tap-room; they were found an hour after.</p>
               <p>(The Knife and forks were produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Williams. I live next door to the prosecutrix; I was standing at my door, when the prisoner was there; I saw a knife and some forks falling from his pocket; I believe the prisoner took them up again and put them into his pocket. Hearing the prosecutrix had lost some knives and forks, I went to the prisoner who stood at the door, and felt them in his pocket; he would not let me search him, but made off. I found them afterwards in a ditch about one hundred and fifty yards distance from the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never had them in my custody, another man had taken them.</p>
               <p>For his Character.</p>
               <p>Wm Williams. I am a serjeant in the regiment the prisoner is in, I have known him about sixteen years in the regiment, I never heard him charged with theft, he has been guilty of breach of duty, owing to his getting now and then in liquor.</p>

The prisoner was in my service, as groom, for about fourteen months - he left me in November last; shortly before he was apprehended I missed some property. I found this cloth at the office on the 26th of February - it is mine - I am positive it was safe within five or six weeks of that time; it was on the warehouse shelves: the warehouse is part of the dwelling-house.</p>

            . I am captain of St. James' watch. On the morning of the 26th of February, about two o'clock, I stopped the prisoner with this cloth under his arm - he said it was sheeting, which his brother had bought to send into the country, to his mother; I asked where his brother lived - he said in Gray's-inn-lane. I took him to the watch-house, and then he said his brother lived in Wimpole-street, which turned out to be true; his brother came to the office, and said, in his hearing, that he knew nothing at all of it. I marked it, and delivered it to Avis.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. The prisoner was brought to the office, and I had some conversation with him; I neither threatened nor promised him any thing: he told me, after some conversation, that he got the cloth from a place where he had lived, and said it was from Mr. Greig's, in the City-road - he afterwards said he had been along with two Jew lads - that they took the property, and gave it to him; he afterwards said he took it himself out of Mr. Greig's warehouse, and that he got in the back way; he afterwards told me where he lived, and gave me the key of his box, which I searched, and found in it duplicates of two pieces of linen, which he said were Mr. Greig's, and a book, with Mr. Greig's name in it; I got the linen out of pawn.</p>
               <p>MR. GREIG. This piece of cloth is mine. I am certain I never sold it; the fluctuation of the market is so great I cannot estimate the value. His friends are respectable, and I believe this to be his first offence.</p>

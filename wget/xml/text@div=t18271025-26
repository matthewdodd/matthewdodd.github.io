On the 2d of October I went with him and his wife to Croydon fair - I saw him fasten the door; he put his hand through the window, and fastened the bolt; any body outside could push it back - I left my bonnet and shawl in a box under the bed; we lived in an adjoining room; we returned from the fair together on the Friday following - I found the door had been unfastened, but fastened again; it was bolted as we had left it, but must have been opened, as the bonnet and shawl were gone; the prisoner lived in the same court - I have since seen my bonnet in Cochran's possession(looking at it); this is it - I bought it last Whitsuntide, but had only worn it half a dozen times; the ribbon which is now on it is not mine; this strange bonnet was left in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I know Edward Norwood; he is in his fifteenth year. On 29th May, I was out with him on the slip on Uxbridge-moor, about half-down 4 o'clock—we were catching May-flies—I saw the prisoner come running the moor with a gun in his hand—I had never seen him before—there was a hedge between the moor and the road—he came down towards the slip where we were standing, catching May-flies—he held the gun at me, and said he would give me two ounces he put a cap on the gun first, then pulled up the cock, and pulled the trigger at me—It did not go off—I saw him pull the cock up again, and put on another cap; he then came through the hedge—I ran away, and hallooed to young Norwood to run—Norwood laughed at him, and then he came and stood about seven feet away from Norwood, and then shot him—he put the gun up to his shoulder and took aim at him, just as if he was shooting a bird—Norwood fell into the hedge—his cap was blown off—I ran to get it and then saw that he was shot—I pulled him out of the hedge, and I saw that he was smothered in blood—Mr. M'Namara, the doctor, was fetched.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Uxbridge. I was fetched to the boy Norwood on 29th May—I found him recovering from the shock of the wound—he had been shot with a gun over the top of the face, the forehead, and eyes—it was a dangerous wound; he is still in a very critical state—he has lost the use of his eyes—there was considerable injury to the bone of the head—I saw him this morning—he is not well enough to come here—his deposition was taken in his bedroom—the prisoner was present, and had the opportunity of cross-examining, if he was so disposed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You found marks of a gun-shot wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; all over the front of the face—they were small sparrow-shots—the marks were on the upper part as low down as the eyes—most probably the greater part of the load had passed over his head—if the load had been fired from a gun at a distance of nine feet, and aimed fully at the head, I should imagine it must have produced death—I saw the prisoner and Norwood in the room together on the day the depositions were taken—the prisoner cried, and appeared affected—I never heard Norwood speak of it other than as the result of an accident.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The deposition of Edward Norwood was read as follows</hi>:—"I was on Ux<lb></lb>bridge-moor, near the new Church, yesterday afternoon, getting May-flies—young Hirons was with me—young Ladyman came over the gap with a gun in his hand—I said to him, 'He has got a gun'—Ladyman then held up the gun and shot me, and stunned me—I had not spoken to Ladyman when he fired at me.

On 29th May I was near the beer-shop kept by Ladyman's father—I had a fowling-piece—I was on the moor amusing myself, shooting sparrows—I discharged the gun about thirty yards away from the house, and took it in and put it on the tap-room table—I had fired the gun three or four times—it was unloaded when I put it on the tap-room table—the prisoner waited on me with some ginger-beer and ale—he asked me if I had any caps—I said I had neither caps, shot, or powder—he said, "I can get some"—I had some business about the house, and did not take any more notice of the boy—I did not tell him to get any caps—I did not see him do anything with the gun—I did not tell him not to take it; after having the ginger-beer, it was about half an hour before I saw him again—he then told me that he had shot a boy, and not to tell any person—he had my gun with him—he gave it back to me.</p>

Q.</hi> How long have you been in the army? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly fourteen years—this was after dinner, after I left my stables—I am quite sure that I fired the gun off before I came into the house—I fired at a spar<lb></lb>row within thirty yards of the house—I desisted from shooting, because I had expended all my ammunition—I had no powder, caps, or shots left, or I should not have gone in—I did not load the gun again after I had got into the tap-room—I do not know a man named Hale—I know Gray—two men came into the tap-room some time after I had gone in—I do not know their names—I had only been quartered there for a short time—I did not load the gun again in the presence of those men—I had a shot-belt round my body, and a powder-flask on my shoulder—I am quite confident that the prisoner, in taking the gun, did not take the powder-flask or shot-belt—I did not see him take any other shot-belt or powder-flask away from the house—I did not hand the gun to him, or see him take it—I was engaged with a female in the house, and did not take notice of the boy, or the gun either.</p>

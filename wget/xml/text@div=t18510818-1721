                  </hi>. I live in St. Pancras. The prisoner was in my service for seven days—she was given into custody from my house, on 19th July—she was in liquor in the morning, in my absence—in consequence of what was said to me, I said I should like to see her boxes searched, as she had got my liquor—she said a policeman should do it—I opened a box, the prisoner threw the key of it on the lid, but she refused to open it—I found in it these articles, which are mine—I had seen my child, who is dead, wear them—I suppose they were kept in my drawers—this bottle contains rum.</p>

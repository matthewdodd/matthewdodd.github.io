                  </hi>. I have a warehouse in Sea-coal-lane. I missed some lead from the top of it, on the 8th of September—I had not been on the roof for five or six months—it appeared quite fresh cut—I have since seen some lead in the officer's hands that fitted it—I believe it belongs to the warehouse, which I and my brother Thomas hold.</p>

               <p>to Mr. Hunt's house. On the 7th of September, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner go on the roof of his own house, and I saw him there rolling, as though he were rolling lead; but I could not see what, for the parapet-wall—I saw him again at half-past ten o'clock go on the house, and remain there till a quarter before twelve o'clock—I watched him—he was on his own house—he went across his own roof to Mr. Hunt's—he was out of my sight till a quarter to twelve o'clock then be came across and put something down into his top room; at least, he gave it his daughter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am patrol of St. Sepulchre's. On the 8th of September I was desired by my inspector to watch the prisoner's house and about eight o'clock I saw the prisoner come out with something in his apron—I told him I must know what he had there—he said, "I have a little lead, but I will take it back"—I said I could not allow that, he must go to the watch-house—I found two pieces of lead in his apron.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I went on the roof, and saw the roof of the prisoner's house—there is about 40lbs. of lead taken from there, but this lead did not match with that—I found a piece secreted under the flooring of his third-floor room, which matches with Mr. Hunt's.</p>

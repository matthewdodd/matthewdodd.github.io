I was on duty in Albion-place at half-past 2 o'clock on the morning of 19th January, and my attention was drawn to some marks on the iron railings there, which run from Hyde Park-terrace—there is no house in front—I then heard a rattle, and got into the garden of Sir John Romilly, at No. 14, Hyde Park-terrace—while there I saw the prisoner Douglas in the garden of No. 10—I got over the rails into the garden of No. 11, then went into No. 10, and found him lying on his face and hands close by the wall of the house—I took him by the collar, lifted him up, and asked him what he was doing there—he said he only got over to lie down—I then asked him where he lived—he said at the other end of the town—I searched him, and found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on him—I then called out for assistance, and Constable 219 came over the wall and assisted me in getting him out—I sent him to the station, and then examined the house No. 10—I found the kitchen window open in an area at the rear—there were no area steps—I saw dirty footmarks on the window-cill; in the area I found this silver soufflét dish (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I examined the sash, and it appeared as if a knife or something had been put up between; there were marks on it—I then went in at the kitchen window, which was open, and examined the shutters; they appeared to have been sprung, as the catch that goes across was a little bent—the drawers in the kitchen were all pulled out, and the door leading from the kitchen to the passage was broken open—the inmates came down, made a further search, and found the thieves were gone—I then went back to the station.</p>

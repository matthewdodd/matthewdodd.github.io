            . I am an assistant to Mr. Lazarus. On Thursday the 21st of March, I was in his shop, which is opposite Mr. Spooner's, and saw the prisoner trying to lift the print from the iron where it hung - he had a companion; he then passed up the street, and in a short time returned and handled it again - I turned round to answer a question, and on turning my head again I saw it was gone - I ran out and pursued the prisoner, who took the right hand turning of Finsbury-square - I called, Stop thief! and he dropped the print from his apron - I took it up, and followed; I lost sight of him, but he was stopped, and I brought him back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me drop the print? A. I did not actually see you, as I stumbled at the time - I was about fifty yards from you.</p>

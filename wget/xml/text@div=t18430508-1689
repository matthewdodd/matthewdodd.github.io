                  </hi>. I live in St. Ann's-street, Kennington—the prisoner was in my employ, as a chimney-sweeper, about seven months—in conse<lb></lb>quence of something I heard, I said, "William, where are those pots? "—he went to the soot yard, and brought three or four, such as publicans use—I asked how he came by them—he said they came from No. 4, Bedford-terrace—I asked what he was going to do with them—he said, "I do not know;" and then said, smilingly, "To sell them"—I said, "Are you aware what you are about to do? you are liable to be sent to Brixton; do you know who they belong to? "—he said "No"—I said, "You can read what is on them"—I could read it—one part over the inscription had been cleaned—on the 27th of April, a lad in my employ, named Lovejoy, brought me two pint pots—I gave information to the police that afternoon, and gave him the two pots—the others could not be found—I had asked the prisoner if he had taken the pots back—he said he had—I asked what the people said—he said, "Nothing"—I asked what they gave him—he said, "Only something to drink."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner—as I took him to the station, he said to a person that walked by his side, that he went to sweep a chimney on the terrace, and, in potting the soot into the bag, a pint pot fell out of his shovel, and he had picked up one previously; that the servant took it up and put it into his bag—he said he did not take it back, as his master told him, in consequence of his old mistress telling him not to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went to No. 4, Bedford-terrace, to sweep the kitchen chimneys. The stove was loose, and behind it I found this pot, which is burnt at the bottom, a coffee-pot, and a lot of old saucepan lids. I put them on one side; and as I was putting the soot into the sack, this other pot fell off the shovel; the servant picked it up, and put it into my sack. I did not see them till the soot was sifted, after I got home. I showed them to my master, who told me to take them home; but my mistress told me not to do so, but to leave them there, or throw them away. I left them in the top room. I left my master about six weeks ago, and set up for myself, and have got a few of his customers from him, and this is his spite. He knew the pots were in the house.</p>

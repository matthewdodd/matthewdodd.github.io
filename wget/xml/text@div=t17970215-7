             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a Trinity-officer, I live in Dung-street, Mile-End New Town. On the 28th of January, I saw the prisoner coming from Tower-hill, towards East Smithfield, with nine pails upon his back; I followed him into the house of Mr. Bruce, with the pails upon his back; seeing him go into Bruce's I suspected he had stole them, and accordingly I detected him with them on his shoulder in Bruce's shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150023"></xptr>Q. You knew Bruce's shop before, did you? - A.Yes; I have apprehended a great many people from there.</p>
               <p>Q. Bruce's shop is in East Smithfield, in the County of Middlesex, out of the City? - A. Yes; an old iron shop; I asked the prisoner where he got the pails from; he said, Mr. Bruce knew; Bruce and Mr. Grant were by; Bruce said he did not; I asked Bruce over and over, three times, if he knew any thing of them; he denied knowing any thing of them; I took the prisoner out of the shop; going along, he said, I know my master will shew me no mercy, and, for God's sake, don't take me to the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you knew, at that time, who his master was? - A. Yes, I did, becaule I enquired who he worked for; I took him to the Magistrate, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You saw him go into this shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say that a man of the name of Haygarth sent him with them from the Gun-tavern? - A. No; he said, before the Magistrate, that Haygarth, who is a servant of the prosecutor, was the ringleader.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mention that before the Magistrate? - A. No; I was not asked the question.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you he brought them from the Gun-tavern? - A. He said so in the public house, the Horse, opposite the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Bruce has absconded? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So has Mr. Haygarth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not known the prisoner before? - A. I never saw him in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. He said, at once, Bruce knew where he brought them from? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. He did not say he was employed by Haygarth till he was at the Horse? - A. No; he said he had a good watch, and he would give me that, or the value of it, if I did not take him before the Magistrate.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a cooper and turner, in Tower-street: The prisoner has been my apprentice about four years; I have lost a quantity of goods for some time, pails and other goods, which I found in Bruce's house, (the pails were produced in Court); these are my pails, they were made by my foreman at his shop in Ratcliff-highway; they are made in a particular way, we never sold any of them but three dozen that were sent to Woolwich, and returned as too slight.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you given the prisoner any authority to sell any that day? - A. No; they were kept in the cellar where the prisoner worked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner had lived some time with you? - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a very honest and well-behaved young man? - A. Yes; he said he was drawn in by Bruce and another man; Bruce said, he had been but once there before; the prisoner said, he should not have done it if he had not been persuaded.</p>
               <p>Q. Haygarth is gone off, and so is Bruce? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Haygarth use to send him out on his business? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any pails on that Saturday? A. No, they had been gone some time before they were lodged at the Gun-tavern; the prisoner said, as I was busy settling with the men, he took the pails to Bruce's.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was taken down in writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is any body concerned with you in the business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Whether they were at the Gun-tavern or not, you don't know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the nine pails? - A. Sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM URQUHART sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a cooper, employed by Mr. Green; my apprentice and myself made these pails for him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You used to sell pails of that description yourself? - A. I never sold but one dozen; I called on the person last week, and there were but six sold.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were employed by any body to make pails of this sort, you made them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You never made any for this young man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Haygarth ordered me to take them from the Gun-tavern to Bruce's; I never knew any thing of this being wrong till I was taken; he was apt to get drunk, and asked me to take things for him, that he might not have a noise from my master.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Galloway-street, St. Luke's—the deceased Thomas Osborn lodged in my house—on 8 th July he came to me at my club, at the Island Queen public-house, about half-past eleven o'clock, and asked for the key—I refused to let him have it, as he was a little the worse for drink, and asked him to come home—he agreed to do so—we were rather the worse for liquor, and were <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> about at the Island Queen—we left there a little before twelve—when we got outside, Osborn wished to spar with the prisoner—the prisoner did not want to do anything of the kind—a policeman came up and dispersed them, and the prisoner seized Osborn round the arms and body, and carried him over the Canal-bridge, in the Wharf-road—that was to get him home—Osborn then accused him of attempting to put his fingers in his pocket, and said he would fight any man—the prisoner said it was no such thing—Osborn would fight; the prisoner did not care to do so—at last he said, "Well, if I must fight I must;" so he gave him <hi rend="italic">one, two,</hi> with both hands, and Osborn said, "That is a nice one; that is a beauty; come on again;" so he had one more hit at him, knocked him backwards, and he fell with the back of his head on the kerb—he was picked up, and the prisoner assisted him part of the way home with me, after a policeman had come up, and taken his address—I left them for a minute, and when I came back the prisoner was undoing Osborn's smallclothes, and I saw him draw his arm back as if putting something into his pocket—I immediately accused him of attempting to rob him—he said, "No such thing"—I examined Osborn's pockets, and found 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a key, and a pencil-case—the prisoner made a move on one side, and ran away, and I saw no more of him.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq., M.D. I was called to see the deceased on 11th July—he seemed to have received some serious blow on the head—he was in a <hi rend="italic">semi-comotose</hi> state—I found a very small wound on the back of the head—there was no external evidence of any fracture—I saw him up to the Friday, when he died—I then made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found the occipital bone was fractured, or fissured, from the top to the bottom, and the anterior lobes of the brain on each side were torn; that was the result of a counter-stroke of the blow received behind—the cause of death was inflamma<lb></lb>tion of the brain, resulting from the injury to the skull—he died with epileptic fits—a fall would cause the injuries that I saw.</p>

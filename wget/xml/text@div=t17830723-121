               <p>Were they armed? - Yes, the one had a pistol, the other a cutlass; when they met us they turned us round with an open cutlass, saying to Wotton, your money or your life: Mr. Wotton said, he had got nineteen shillings and gave it him, and he covered his eyes with his hat, I made a great alarm not to hurt Mr. Wotton, the prisoner told me not to make a noise, and I should not be hurt; he had a pistol in his hand, and he put it in a breast pocket in the lining of his coat, he did not present it when the prisoner first came up he said nothing. I had a pair of black slippers in my hand, which he took immediately, and the other things mentioned in the indictment; after he took these things he turned me round, and looked for my buckles, I had slippers on, and no buckles, he turned me round, and looked at my gown, and thinking it a gown of value, the other man was going to cut it off with a cutlass, only a cart came by which prevented him; the prisoner pushed me and bid me walk forward, if I looked back my life was at a stake, I looked back, I saw them pass over by the Fox, about one hundred yards from where we were robbed.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it light enough for you to see them? - Yes, a bright star-light night, I am clear that is the man; I did not see him after, till I saw him at Bow-street; I knew him immediately I saw him, and swore to him.</p>

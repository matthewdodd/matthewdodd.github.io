                  </hi>. I keep the Adam and Eve, in Jewin-street. On 13th Sept., about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came for a glass of gin, and threw a shilling on the counter—I took it up and said, "This is a very bad one"—there were marks on the head side—I gave it him back again—he said he did not know how he came by it—he gave me another shilling out of a green purse, and I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I put that shilling in the drawer—there were neither shillings nor half-crowns there—I then took it to the window and drew my finger round the edge, threw it down and said it was bad, and asked the prisoner for my sixpence back, and took up the fourpence—he said he could not imagine how he came by it, and be said, "I did not give you this"—he did not drink the gin—I gave him back the shilling and he gave me the change, and went away—a policeman came in and I gave him information—he went after the prisoner, and he was brought back in a few minutes—the policeman had his hands on each side of the prisoner's head, and he said, "I will choke you if you don't put that out of your mouth"—he put his head down to the bar and a shilling dropped from his mouth: the officer took it up—one of these two shillings produced has got the marks that I saw on the head of the shilling that the prisoner offered me—the other shilling I had bent.</p>

I followed the prisoner and apprehended him—I asked where the bad money was that he tried to pass to the landlord—he said he had got no money—I told him to come back to the landlord and he would tell him a different story—just as I got him to the door he put something quickly into his mouth with a hand that I had previously seen in his trowsers pocket—I laid hold of him by the neck, and said if he did not put that money out of his mouth I would choke him—with some difficulty I got a shilling out of his mouth, I then searched him, and in the same pocket where I had seen his hand, I found another bad shilling, and 3 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—the prisoner refused to give his name and address.</p>

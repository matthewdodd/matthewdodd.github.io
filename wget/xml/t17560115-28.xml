            . I am a horse grenadier. Going up South audley-street, about twenty yards beyond Dean-street, I heard an outcry of murder! watch! stop thief! I made a stop, and, at about ten yards distance, I saw the prisoner and another man come running up Dean-street. They turn'd at the corner, and ran down towards my lord Chesterfield's. They sever'd, and I pursued and took the prisoner. I and my comrade,

               <p>Sarmon. He said he did not know but that we ran after him to murder him. He had this stick in his hand. Producing an oaken stick with a knob to it. He had hold of it by the little end, when I laid hold of him, and held it out in a posture of defence. There was no other person in the street.</p>

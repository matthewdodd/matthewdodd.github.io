                  </hi>. I am a carrier, of Giltspur-street. On Saturday, 30th Nov., I believe the prisoner brought a couple of chests of tea to my place, but I did not see him—I went to the police-station, and saw him in custody, and a basket which I had seen in my premises about a quarter of an hour before the robbery—I suppose it had been there an hour and a half—it was directed to Mr. Bell, plumber, Leicester—when I saw it last, it was inside my premises, on the top of some packages—there is a gas-light inside the window, within four inches from where the basket was, and there is a street-lamp outside, four or five yards off—persons bringing in a parcel would pass by where this basket was—it was about a yard from the outside gate.</p>

                  </hi>. I shall be fifteen years old next birthday; I work for Mr. Tucker. On 30th Not., I was in the yard, and in consequence of what I was told, I went out, and saw a man carrying a basket from our yard—I had not seen it in the yard—he put it into a covered cart, about a hundred yards from the yard—the name of Coe was on it—I stopped the horse; the prisoner was in the cart guiding it—the man who put the basket into the cart walked away down Skinner-street—I said to the pri<lb></lb>soner, "What basket have you there?"—I went to the back of the cart, and be <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it on my head, and drove on again, not very fast, on the trot—I stopped the horse a second time, and he got out, and threatened to srike me—I let him go till I saw a policeman, and gave him information—I saw the prisoner taken to the station—I bad not heard any cry after him.</p>

On 30th Nov., about seven o'clock, I heard Morgan cry, "Stop him!"—he pointed to the prisoner in a cart, driving as fast as he could for the omnibuses—I stopped it—Mor<lb></lb>gan came up, and said he had received a parcel in the cart which another man put in, and he was going away with it—the prisoner heard that—I asked him if he knew the man that put it into the cart; he said he did not—he said he had thrown it out—I asked him what was the reason he was driving away if he had not received anything that did not belong to him—he gave me no answer—he had four other parcels in it—I asked him how he came to throw that parcel out instead of the other; she said it was the top parcel.</p>

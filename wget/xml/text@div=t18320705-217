On the Saturday night I had no money to pay my rent; I met several young men, who gave me liquor - I got intoxicated; I strolled about till early in the morning, when I met three young men, one of whom I knew; we walked on to Moor-street; they there said they had a pair of trousers they wanted me to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050098"></xptr>take care of - I put them into the house I lodged at; I put the handkerchief into my hat, and went on to the Seven-dials, where I met the prosecutor, who said the handkerchief was his - he then said he had lost a pair of trousers; I said I knew nothing about them, but when the officer came I said I would produce the trousers.</p>

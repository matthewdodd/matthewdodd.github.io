On a Friday night the prisoner came to my shop with another man; it was Friday fortnight. The man who was with him asked me for an article which I had not got. I went and put three one pound notes and a dollar into my till; I went into the parlour, and the other man came in to speak to me, leaving the prisoner in the shop; the parlour faces the till, where I was drinking my tea. I saw the prisoner put his hands over the counter into the till. I went to my till, and the money was gone. I seized him, saying, you have robbed me; he pulled a one pound note out of his pocket. I took him into the parlour, and asked him for the rest; he then gave me another one pound note; he said he had thrown the remainder of the money about the shop; he then ran away. The other man told me where he lived; and I informed the constable. The other man's name is Butler. I never found the other note or the dollar.</p>

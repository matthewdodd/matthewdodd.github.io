On the 5th of February, about half-past six o'clock in the evening (as near as I can guess.) I saw the prisoner Jones, and another with him, near the house; when I first saw them I was at the corner of the house: I cannot say who the other was - he was very much like Sullivan, but I cannot be certain of him; I saw them standing at Julian's shop window, with a knife or something, trying to get the putty away from the glass; when they saw me they went away: they returned in five or ten minutes - I was then in my little shop, at the corner of the house; I heard them break the glass: I looked as close as I could to the window, and saw Jones take the snuff-boxes out of the window, and tuck them into his bosom, with his left-hand; the other one was standing by his side: Jones put down a piece of glass, which they had broken, and then they ran away; I followed Jones, and never lost sight of him - he ran into Baker's-row; I followed, and saw him in Baker's-row - the other ran straight up Great Warner-street - (the house is at the corner of Little Warner-street;) Sullivan joined Jones in Baker's-row, and another one.</p>
               <p>Q. If Sullivan was the same person, how did he get from Great Warner-street to Baker's-row? A. There was time for him to come round; I followed all three into Coppice-row, till I saw Bowden, the constable; I told him to come with me, for they had broken a window and taken the boxes out; we followed, and took the prisoners - the other had gone away; we did not see which way he went. I told them what we took them for - Jones denied it, and said the boxes were his own; Bowden found them all upon him; he took nine from his bosom when we took him: Sullivan said he had got nothing about him, and knew nothing about it; I had not lost sight of Jones from the time he took the boxes till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JONES. Q. Could you keep sight of me all the way? A. Yes, I did; it was about half-past six o'clock - it was dark; there were lights in the street, and a lamp lighted in the shop - I could see his features.</p>

On the 5th of February I met the witness in Coppice-row, and took the prisoners in Crawford-passage; the prisoner Jones was just before the witness when I first met him; I never lost sight of him - we secured them; I found nine snuff-boxes in the prisoner Jones' bosom, and seven in his pocket; he said he had got nothing till I found them on him; I did not find the seven in his pocket till I got to the office; he said nothing after I found them- I have them here, and produce them: I found nothing on Sullivan: it was about half-past six o'clock.

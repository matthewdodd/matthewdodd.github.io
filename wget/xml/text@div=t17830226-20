               <p>What are you? - I get my bread by working: the prisoner lodged in the house were I lodged, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, they were in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Court. How came all your cloaths to be in the kitchen? - I generally used to leave them there.</p>
               <p>What time of the day did you discover that they were gone? - Between the hours of three and seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Have you found any of them since? - They were delivered to me by the constable who took them, they were found at a mantua-makers, I have got the gown on, it is mine.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it is your own? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you all the other things here? - No, my Lord, only a few of them.</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing of the prisoner before? - No, she only lived in the house a fortnight.</p>
               <p>What was she, a servant or lodger, or what? - A lodger. (The things deposed to.) I bought the hat but a very few days before, I know it by the ribbon, and there is an S. on one handkerchief.</p>
               <p>What became of the prisoner when these things were lost? - I do not know, I saw her at three o'clock in the morning, when we went to bed; these things were found upon her, the hat and the cloak, I was not present, I never saw her in the house after three o'clock.</p>

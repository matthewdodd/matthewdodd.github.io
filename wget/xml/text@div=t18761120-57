I am a labourer, and live in Wood Street, Chelmsford—the prisoner lives in the same street—on 15th September, I went out from one beerhouse to another—I left my house a little after 10 o'clock, before I left I shut the doors—they fastened with a latch—the front door opens from the outside, and the back door from the inside—I left my wife in bed—there</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-constable</hi>). I was in Wood Street on 15th Sep<lb></lb>tember, opposite Curley's house—I heard the prisoner's voice in a public-house close by; soon after I saw him some out into the road—he then went up to his own house—he came down the street again with a woman—I believe it was his wife, and he went up into Curley's house—I could not see whether he went inside the door, it is at the end of the house—he went up the yard towards the door—I next saw a light in the house; it had been all dark, before—there was a light for two or three minutes and then three or four minutes after I heard the prisoner at his own door—I did not see him leave the house; he must have gone the back way—he could have done so without my seeing him—then I heard him at the door—he called his wife, who was still down the road near Curley's gate—he had left her behind—she then went up to their own house—they afterwards came down again and both went up Curley's yard—there was no light before in Curley's house; they went up the yard again towards the door, and there was a light again in a very short time, and then soon after I heard the latch of the front door drop; I saw the prisoner and his wife come from the door down the path into the road—when they got there I could see the wife was carrying something in her arms—she was a little in front—the prisoner stopped and fastened the gate of Curley's house—they went up the lane, the prisoner's wife got a few yards from the gate and said "Now then! look sharp," and set off running—she ran up on the left side, the prisoner crossed the road and ran up on the right side—I saw them go into their own cottage again—the door was shut and the light put out—I saw the prosecutor and told him what I had seen and we went to his cottage—he then missed his coat—in consequence of what he said I got the assistance of the inspector—I then went to one door of prisoner's house and the inspector to the other—the inspector knocked at the front door; the prisoner answered—the inspector said "I want to speak to you"—he said "What do you want me for? Who are you?"—he said "I am an inspector of police, open the door, I want to speak to you"—he said "What do you want me for?" "I want to speak to you about a coat that has been stolen "—he said "I shall not open the door;" I heard his footsteps going to the back door, and just as it was going to open I pushed myself in and found him about to open it—I found inside the house the coat produced—I searched the prisoner and found this whip thong in his right hand jacket pocket—I also produce a lot of groceries which I received from the prosecutor's wife next morning.</p>

On the 19th of September these sheep were in a small meadow near the farm; they had only come into Mr. Hill's possession that night - there were four hundred of them: I kept watch through the night - I was in a small meadow adjoining the one they were in; a hedge parts the two meadows. I have known the prisoners nine years - they lived near me, and I knew their voices well. About half-past one o'clock in the night I heard the sheep disturbed, and after that heard a hurdle crack, as if it was breaking; there were two hurdles set in a gateway, to from a gate, and I heard the voices of both the prisoners speaking to each other in the field where the sheep were disturbed - they said to each other "We will make a thorough clearance;" I had

             with me at the time - I did not see any thing; we made away under the hill, towards Leach's house, and stood under the hedge leading to the prisoner Leach's house - we concealed ourselves there as soon as we heard the conversation; it was a dark night: they came across the small meadow, and while they were standing under the hedge near us I heard the sheep bleating, and then we heard something chucked over the hedge, about twelve yards from us; it was two substances - we then heard two persons get over the hedge - I heard no voices in the field where the sheep were except the prisoners': they went across the road to James Leach's garden; we could see something on their shoulders, but could not exactly tell what; we could hear the sound of their feet on the gravel-walk up to James Leach's house, and could see two men, but there was not light enough to distinguish their features; it was then nearly two o'clock- I could not hear the door open; I immediately went and called up Mr. Hill - he lived about one hundred yards off, and Leach's house is about fifty yards from where we were concealed; I went with Mr. Hill to Leach's door in about a quarter of an hour - Barnes went for a constable, who came to the door to us; we demanded admission, but were not let in - Leach came down to the door, and opened it; the parish constable told him he wanted to look over his house - Leach asked him what for, and the constable told him it was concerning two sheep; I stood at the door while Hill and the constable went in - I did not see Gristwood there - I left before the search was over: I afterwards saw the skins of two sheep in possession of the horse patrol; Leach had no light in his house - Mr. Hill went and got one himself, and on his returning with it Leach refused to let them in to search - the patrol brought two sheep out of the house while I stood at the door; one had began to be flayed, but the other was entire - they were two of the sheep which had been in the meadow - one was marked I. in a ring, and the other S. in a ring; I had not observed the sheep in the meadow - I afterwards saw how they were marked; there were some marked the same as these two, sixty of one lot, and fifty of the other; I missed two sheep out of the four hundred, and believe these to be them; the prisoners were taken before a Magistrate, and committed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Mr. Hill lives at Harrow-hill? A. No, that is a relation of his; he lives at Sunbury, and he has no partner; the prisoner's house is about two hundred yards from where the sheep were - I am quite certain of both their voices; I had seen them about two days before.</p>

Mr. Corby said he wanted to speak to me; I went down stairs, opened the door, and Corby I believe came in - I could not find the matches to strike a light; Hill went home and brought one - he came in doors: I said, "I do not think you have any great right to search my premises at this time of night;" Hill said, "Come on," and when they had got six or seven yards Barnes said, "There is no doubt but what the sheep are here;" Hill said, "Then stop here all night;" this man was in my house at the time dead asleep, as he went home drunk - I did not know what to do with the sheep; whether they were his or any body else's I knew I was wrong in having them there.</p>

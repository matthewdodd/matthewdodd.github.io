                  </hi>. I am the wife of Esau Dodge, a coach proprietor—the prisoner came with a man, named Horrocks, in June last—they drove up to the front of the shop with a horse and chaise—they said that they were commercial travellers, who had done their business for the day, and would I let them have a light gig, as they wanted to go a few miles out pleasuring, as it was Saturday afternoon—I said, "Yes," and we let them have a gig—they left their own in front of the shop till they came back at night; when they returned my gig, and paid me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the following Sunday, 29th June, the prisoner had a horse and chaise of me, and Horrocks had another—I asked them for payment before they started; they both said that they were short of money, and asked me to advance them 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the fourth of this cheque, which they produced, till Monday morning, as they were too late to cash it on Saturday—Horrocks gave it into my hand—I said that I had no money at all as my husband was out—they tried very hard to get one sovereign, but I did not give them anything then—they both went out with the chaise—the prisoner returned the same night; he brought back the horse and trap, and said that his friend had got tipsy, and was incapable of driving home, and he advised him to put up for the night; he told me where, but I forget—he asked my husband to advance him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the faith of this cheque, and my husband should go next morning to the Bank with him to receive it, as he should want the chaise to fetch his friend home—my husband said that he could not—the prisoner then said, "Can you let me have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said, "No"—the prisoner said, "Can you let me have 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?" my husband said, "Yes; give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." Which I did—I had got the cheque; he had left it with me in the afternoon—on Monday morning, he came again, and had the horse and chaise to fetch his friend home, and never came back; we never saw it till the Wednesday—we put it in the hands of the police—I wanted the prisoner to go to the Bank with me, but he seemed very much</p>

               <p>confused, and would not go—he said that I could take upon myself to go, if I chose, and drove off, and I did not see him again—I afterwards went to the Bank with the cheque, and was given in charge—I was afterwards discharged.</p>

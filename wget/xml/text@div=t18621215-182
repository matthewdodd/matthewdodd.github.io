                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 96). I apprehended Vito and Anderson at their lodgings at Lewisham, on 30th November—the coat Vito is now wearing was on the bed—I asked him if the coat was his; he said, "Yes"—it wanted a button; this button corresponds exactly with the other but<lb></lb>tons on the coat—Anderson said that he met two men on London-bridge who had the tools in a basket, and they asked him if he would pawn them—he gave them to the woman Hewitt, and she brought the tickets and the money to the carpenters who gave him the tools—I took the coat off the bed at the time, and Vito said it was his.</p>

I am a labourer and rubbish carter, at 9, Richard-street, Kingsland—I know the four male prisoners by sight—about a month ago I saw Vito and Anderson—I know Anderson; I don't know the other man's name; it was these two nearest to me—I saw them in Bain's-build<lb></lb>ings, Back-road, Kingsland—I don't remember what day it was; they were sitting down in a garden, and had got two bags with them—I saw them both in the afternoon, and each sitting on a pack bag—I afterwards went into the Fox public-house, Back-road, Kingsland—Vito and Anderson came in, and asked me if I would buy some carpenter's tools; they did not pro<lb></lb>duce any—I saw them the next day walking along—the pack bags looked as if there was something in them.</p>

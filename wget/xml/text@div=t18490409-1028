                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Dodenham, a coal and corn<lb></lb>dealer, of Lewisham. On 26th March, about eight at night, I was walking through Lewisham, carrying a truss of clover; I met the prisoner and a man I do not know; he pushed the clover off my back; I asked the reason, but had hardly got the words out, when the prisoner collared me and pushed me backwards into the ditch, and fell on me, with his hand on my throat—he put his left hand into my pocket while he held me down with his right—I had no money—I had him by the jacket; he asked me to leave go of him, which I did, and he ran and turned up Mr. Dadd's field.</p>

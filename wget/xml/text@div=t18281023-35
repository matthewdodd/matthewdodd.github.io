               <p>STEPHEN ROBINSON. I live at the Duke of York public-house, Chelsea, it is kept by Mr. M'Pherson. On Wednesday night, the 1st of October, about half-past ten o'clock, I found a fit of the ague coming on, I went out intending to get some medicine from the apothecary's; as I went along, four men followed me and knocked me down - I knew three of them, they were the three prisoners; I knew them before; I saw them in the street every day, several times; the fourth was a young man not so tall as Crozier, I had never seen him before; I do not know what the prisoners are - it was a fine night, there were lamps in the street; I cannot say whether they were gas or oil; it was Crozier who knocked me down, he struck me on the eye with his fist; when they got me down, they throttled me and bruised me; two of them got on the top of my breast, I screamed out, and they throttled me; Crozier took three half-crowns from my trowsers pocket, a sixpence. and 9d. in copper, from my waistcoat pocket; also a pen-knife and pair of new braces from my pocket; the half-crowns were in a little white bag in my fob; Wright came out and they ran away: after I got up, I went to Winkle the constable's door - I stopped knocking at his door for seven or eight minutes, but did not get in; I heard a noise in White Lion-street, somebody was screaming out there - I went down to the corner, and saw the three prisoners holding some other person down; I have found none of my property; they were taken up the day but one after; I am certain I had seen them before several times every day.</p>

            . I live at No. 10, Royal Hospital-row, Chelsea, next door to Robinson. On the 1st of October I shut up about ten o'clock; I am a hair-dresser; after putting my family to bed, I was looking over my half-batch door, and heard a noise - I looked out, and saw these three men having a man down on the ground, (I had only my shoes on) and before I could get my pantaloons on they were gone; there was a fourth man with them, he ran away when I opened my door; I went to the man who they had been robbing - it was the prosecutor, he was rapping at the constable's door - his face was as black as it could be, and all over blood; he is a pensioner; I did not go with him to White Lion-street, and know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner REYNOLDS. Q. Two days before I was apprehended, had not you and I a quarrel? A. Not that I know of; I have known these persons these four years, and have suffered a great deal by them; I quarrelled with Harris, for he broke my door.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I apprehended the prisoners - I found Crozier and Reynolds together, on Friday, the 3d of October; and Dawkins, my brother officer, took Harris close to me - I found nothing but an old knife on Reynolds.</p>
               <p>REYNOLDS' Defence. Two or three days before I was apprehended, Wright told me my mother was rotten with v - l disease; I told him to look at home; then he said he would have me transported like he had the other boy - I could bring witnesses who heard him say so.</p>
               <p>HARRIS'S Defence. I am innocent; for on the night of the robbery I was at home at eight o'clock with my mother, and never went out again, for she was taken ill.</p>
               <p>CROZIER'S Defence. I am not guilty; I know no more of the prosecutor than a child unborn; on the Wednesday I went with my brother-in-law to take his pension, and was with him till eight o'clock - I then went home to my mother, and never went out afterwards.</p>

               <p>JOHN DUFFIELD. I am a saddler - I have a shop in Long-lane, and one in Goswell-street. The prisoner is a <rs id="t18290115-211-deflabel1133" type="occupation">saddler</rs>

               <p>Prisoner. I met two young men in the street, who asked me if I would buy a harness - I said Yes; I went and told this witness that it was not my own, but I had it of two young men who looked like grooms - I took it without the breeching, and then went and got it; I asked 29s. for it - he said he would give me but 26s.: I said it did not belong to me - I then said he must give me a piece of cloth to make a blanket; I went down, and the lad gave me three yards and a half, and that made up 33s. - he knew the young men; he has bought harness of them since - they were tried last Friday, and found guilty. Witness. I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150095"></xptr>saw them. I have a foreman at Long-lane - these men sold him a stolen haruess, and they were convicted.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner told the Magistrate that there were ten respectable people in the tap-room, where the harness laid for two hours, exposed, and that the landlord, landlady, and their neice saw it; he was remanded, to give him time to send for them - I said, "If you will give me their names I will go for them:" he said he would send for them himself: the next day he said he had been locked up, and could not send to them; I had a summons to get the publican - he said that the same two men had been there with a lot of things in a bag - his wife told them that the prisoner was taken, and they went away - that he himself never saw the men.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I sold the harness, but I was never near the prosecutor's; I was at home in bed at the time - I have not been out of my own bed at night since last Easter Monday.</p>
               <p>MARY JONES. I am a widow, and live in Turnmill-street; I go out to work. I have known the prisoner three or four years - he lived in the next room to me; I was in the habit of making his fire and going to clean for him. -On the 9th and 10th of December he was in bed at nine o'clock in the morning, and as far as I can recollect, on the 8th the same; I remarked that he was later in bed than ever I knew him - the 8th was Monday; I was going out to wash at ten o'clock - he was not up at nine.</p>
               <p>HENRY SHELDRAKE. This is the prisoner's wife - she has been to me three times, for a bag and some other things - she told me she was his wife, and was sent by his authority for the things; I said I would have a note from the Magistrate before I would give them up.</p>

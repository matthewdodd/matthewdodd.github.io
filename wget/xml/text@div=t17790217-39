I lost a horse on the 28th of January, at night, out of my field in Oldford. I saw the horse in the field at dark; I missed it next morning about eight o'clock. Dinmore and Redgrave came down to Oldford, and told me they had a horse that was offered to be sold, and asked me if it was mine. I told them it was; they told me I must come to the justice the next morning. I did so, and there swore to the horse; it is a stout little horse, about thirteen hands and an half high.</p>
               <p>What age? - He may be ten or a dozen years old. I am certain it is my horse?</p>
               <p>What was its value? - Three pounds, or more. I swore to three pounds, and would not have sworn to more than it was worth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you lost your horse, were there any gaps in the hedge through which it might have strayed? - Yes; there is some of the bank broke down where he might go over to be sure.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable in Clerkenwell. Near where I live there are some people buy horseflesh. On the 29th of January last, about the hour of eight in the morning, the woman belonging to the horse-flesh-house came and told me a man had brought a horse to her, which she did not think it was fitting to be killed for horse-flesh. By the time I had got to the place, the prisoner had got farther from the house with the horse, for he had sent for a voucher, which the woman and I both knew to be a receiver of stolen goods, that made us suspect him the more. I laid hold of the prisoner, and asked him whose it was; he said it was his father's, who was a clerk to a printer near Bow, and his father having no further occasion for him had sent him to town to sell it. I said it was strange that a man should send a horse to town to sell on a Friday, Smithfield-market day, and should bring it to a place where they kill horses. He still insisted it was his father's, and gave me a direction to his father. After the other officer came back from Oldford, and found out the gentleman that had lost the horse, the prisoner declared before the magistrate, that it was through the persuasions of a man that boiled horses, that put him upon the practice of stealing horses.</p>
               <p>Who went with you to the justice's? - Redgrave and I that night.</p>
               <p>Was any confession of the prisoner's taken down in writing? - No.</p>
               <p>Was this confession before the justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170042"></xptr>Were any promises made him? - No.</p>
               <p>Or any threats made use of? - No.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - When he found there was an owner to the house; he said, I have known the prosecutor, and the horse some time. He laughed, and said, I little thought that the horse and I should be so well acquainted together. He asked the magistrate what was the consequence of this; the magistrate told him it was horse-stealing; he said he knew the man that owned it, because he saw him ride it into a pond a stag hunting.</p>
               <p>What did he say relative to stealing the horse? - He said he met one Minchin, who told him, if he would come to the Punch-bowl in Hockley in the Hole, if he had any horses to sell, he could buy them of him, and that he was to have brought the horse on Monday morning; he said he brought it from Oldford, and he mentioned the turnpikes he came through. He had asked fifteen shillings for the horse; I told him I thought such a horse as that was not sit to be knocked on the head, as it was a good looking horse, and with good eyes too. He confessed before the justice, that he did take the horse, and bring it there to sell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never made any confession of a theft. - Yes; he did.</p>
               <p>What was the horse worth? - Three or four pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I give you a direction to go to Oldford? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My father lived there. I should not have given him a direction to have gone there if I had known the horse had been stolen.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Dinmore the constable sent for me on Saturday morning, and told me he had apprehended a man for stealing a horse. The consequence was, I went down to Oldford. He asked the prisoner how he came by the horse; he said it was his father's horse. I went to Mr. Hambleton's at Oldford; he was not at home; I waited till he came home; he said it was his horse. I was afterwards before the justice. The prisoner at first said it was his father's.</p>
               <p>Did he say before the justice how he got it? - No; not as I remember.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This is the man that went down upon the horse to enquire for my father; a man he met said he knew the horse, that it belonged to Mr. Hambleton, a baker; that Mr. Hambleton indemnified the horse to be his property. They fetched me out of New Prison, and took me to a publick-house in the neighbourhood. There they gave me beer, and gin and water, both of them, and promised me great things if I would confess.</p>
               <p>Court to Redgrave. Did you tell him he had better confess, or did you make any promise to him, that you would do any thing for him if he did confess? - No.</p>
               <p>Did any body in your hearing? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you give him liquor before you carried him before the justice? - I remember we had a pot of purl between us three, and that was all.</p>
               <p>Court to Dinmore. Did you give him any thing to drink? - So far from giving him drink; I gave him victuals. He said he had no money; there was part of a pot of purl, out of which us three, and another man drank.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing said to induce him to make a confession? - No; upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Did you say it would be better for him? - No. I said, how could you send a man to Oldford, and say it was your father's horse, when another man has owned it? Then he voluntarily confessed the fact.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it ever his father's horse?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No; his father never kept a horse in his life, I believe.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>A man said this horse had the staggers, and as I had nothing to do; he promised me if I would take him to London that I should have something for my trouble for selling him; I was to be back by twelve o'clock if I could. I came to London; the way I came acquainted with this horse flesh butcher was, I came to a publick house where this Minchin used; he is a printer by trade; he left off the printing, and then worked at horse flesh butchering; he told me if ever I went into the country to live again, if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170043"></xptr> knew any body that had any horses that could not work to bring them to the Sun and Punch Bowl in Hockley in the Hole and he would buy them. I told this man I would take the horse there, but said I would not sell him unless they would give money enough for him. Smithfield market begins about three o'clock in the afternoon and I was in a hurry to go to Stratford upon business for my father; I was at this place a quarter after eight in the morning; this woman would give but half a guinea; and I was to get half a guinea for the man, and have the rest for myself; I would have sold the horse for 15 s. so I should have had a trifle for myself, as I was out of work and had nothing to do. They took me to New Prison upon suspicion. Mr. Dinmore was sent down to Oldford; before he could see my father he heard this horse belonged to Mr. Hambleton; the next morning when my father went after the person that entrusted me with the horse to sell, he was gone out of the way, and not to be heard of; after the common prisoners were locked up, they got me out of the prison, and took me into a little parlour at the sign of the Horse-shoe, and gave me two or three pennyworths of gin and water; and one went out of the room while the other staid to make me confess, and said they would do great things for me. All that I told the justice was, that the horse was intrusted to my care to come to London. I did not know the horse, not that it belonged to Mr. Hambleton, because I work at Hackney in the day time, so I have no opportunity of seeing the horse in the day time. Mr. Hambleton says he has had it but three months. I know he had a grey horse, but think it was rather taller than this horse, which they say I stole; the man I had the horse of lived at Hackney; he has absconded. He brought the horse to my father's at seven o'clock in the morning for me to bring to London to sell. I said I could not take it to the Market because that did not begin till three o'clock, therefore I could not stay so long; a man would have bought the horse for fifteen or sixteen shillings. If I had known it had been stolen that would have been a dangerous method as the horse would have been always about the street.</p>

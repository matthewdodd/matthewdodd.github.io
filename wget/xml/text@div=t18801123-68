                  </hi>. I am under gardener to Mr. Spicer, of Woodford, Essex—on 19th October, at 5 o'clock, I shut up the hot-house and locked the door; there were grapes then growing there—the hot-house is under a garden wall, 11 feet high—the garden gate was locked—I left about 6 o'clock, and came back at 6 next morning; I went into the hot-house about 7, and found the door broken open and the grapes all gone but one small bunch—I saw some grapes in Kelly's possession on Friday, the 22nd, they seemed the same sort, black Ham burgs, and the same colour, but I cannot say that they were the same—I was there when they were compared with the cuts, but my eyes did not enable me to see—there were 22 bunches, valued at 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know the prisoner—a ladder had been used, but it was put back in the same place—it was wet, and I had left it indoors in an outhouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head gardener to Mr. Spicer—on Friday, 22nd October, Inspector Kelly showed me these grapes—I compared them with the stems carefully, and am prepared to say that they came from Mr. Spicer's vinery by the peculiar cut; any one can see it; if you cut 1,000 bunches you would not get them to fit like this—they are cut slanting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> You are a perfect stranger to me—I swear to them by their fitting together—they are extensively grown—it took a little mani<lb></lb>pulating to match one stalk to another; I could not do it with a knife—they have been cut, not dragged off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have not manipulated them—these bunches exactly correspond with every branch left behind, and I have not the least doubt about them; it is a grape which you cannot grow outside—if they had been cut with scissors I could not have matched them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, of Forest Gate—on, I think, 20th October, the prisoner brought this hamper of grapes into the shop; it was half full; he asked me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound; I bought a pound, and he took the rest away—I gave them to the inspector on the Friday following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have bought rabbits of you, and once last year I bought some grapes—I had no reason to believe these grapes were stolen; you said you had just had them sent by train—I do not know you as a licensed game dealer—you came last year with a horse and cart—I thought the grapes were dear, and offered you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I thought they were common grapes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am licensed to deal in game and poultry, and I deal in anything I can buy. I went to market, and bought 20lb. of these grapes; there were some white ones among them. I gave a sovereign for them. Nurserymen come. at the market and bring their goods to sell. If I could have got out on bail I might have produced the man I bought them of. I do my business openly, and do not thieve. I stand outside Forest Gate Station, and sell poultry, game, and fish to the public You can go and cut grapes for yourself at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound. I sold them openly, and if Mr. Spicer had asked me for one or two pounds I should have sold them to him. I do not see what there is to connect me with them. Nobody but themselves was there when the police matched the grapes. Instead of being taken before a Magistrate, was taken before one of Mr. Spicer's intimate friends and neighbours, and 'not allowed to say a word, and he said that instead of being prose<lb></lb>cuted I ought to be acquitted. The Magistrate said that it was for a Jury to decide, and I said I thought so too. As to matching grapes, people come from all parts of the country with them, and who can say that they have not been tampered with. I hope you will consider my ex<lb></lb>planation a truthful one, and that I shall leave this Court without a stain upon my character. A reward of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been offered; lots of people think the police do not get the reward; they do not get it directly, but they get it indirectly.</p>

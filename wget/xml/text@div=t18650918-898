                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Maxwell the prosecutor, who is a farmer at Kidbrook—he had some ducks—on 18th of last month we minted seven about 8 o'clock in the morning—I had seen them age the night before—I saw them dead on the 18th at the Greenwich Court—I am quite certain the two drakes were our's and the others are very much like what we lost—I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 49.) At 6 o'clock on the morning of 18th August I saw the prisoner in Trafalgar-road East Greenwich carrying a bag and a basket—I stopped him and asked him what his bag contained—he said, "Ducks"—I asked him how he came by them—he said he was a breeder—I asked him where he came from—he said "Blackbeath village"—I asked him where he lived there—he said he did not exactly know but he lived with a Mrs. Green—I took him into custody—there were two drakes and five ducks in the basket and bag dead—I showed them after<lb></lb>wards to the last witness and he identified them by the marks—it was about a mile and a half from the prosecutor's house that I met the prisoner.</p>

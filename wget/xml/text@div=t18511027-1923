On 8th Oct., between 7 and 8 o'clock, I was on duty in plain clothes, in Holborn, and saw some boys named Burke, Nelhams, and Agar, pick a gentleman's pocket—I took Agar and Burke into custody, and Nelhams got away—Agar said to some boys, "Go and tell them in Plum tree-court, and Field-lane, and fetch Mary Paton from St. John's-court, and tell her I am <hi rend="italic">nailed"</hi>—they all then ran off, and I con<lb></lb>veyed Burke and Agar as far as King-Street, Smithfield, where the prisoners came round us—I am sure they are the women—I have known them by sight a long time—the women said, "What do you want them for, they shall not go?"—and they laid hold of the prisoners, who commenced struggling with me—I then gave Agar over into Hewitt's custody, and kept Burke—I saw some of the girls attack Hewitt, and some of them laid hold of Agar, and there was a general scuffle, which lasted four or five minutes—I am sure the four prisoners were engaged in it—I went on with Burke to the station leaving Agar in Hewitt's custody.</p>

I was on duty, and saw Mos and Burke, Hewitt and Agar—I have known the prisoners a long while and saw them there—when I came up there was a crowd round Hewitt and Agar, Paton had hold of Hewitt's arm, trying to make him leave go of Agar, and the other women were round him trying to pull him away. Hewitt told me to take Paton into custody, which I did, and took her to the station, leaving Agar in Hewitt's custody—before I took her, they were very violent, and endeavouring to rescue Agar—there were a great many other women.</p>

I was on duty on Holborn-hill, and saw Moss, with Burke and Agar in custody—I followed them down Holborn-hill, to the corner of King-street, where it is not very light, and there was a piece of work between Moss and the women—Moss told me to take Agar—I took him by the collar, and had not walked above a pace or two before I received a blow on the back of the neck—I turned and saw Paton step away from me—I walked on a few paces, when I received a blow on the side of my left cheek, I turned again and saw Paton make away</p>

               <p>from the kerb-side to the houses—Cotter then came up; I pointed her out to him and told him to take her, which he did—in a minute or two there was a cry of "Don't go!" "Let him go!"—Agar then made a stop, and swore he would not go any further—I found Agar was getting away, and I threw him down in the carriage-way, I received a kick on the leg—I struggled with him some time, and was kicked several times, but I cannot say who by—I still held Agar by the collar, and he twisted and struggled with me, but he twisted himself out of his coat and got away—I kept his coat in my hand—I then tried to get up to go after him, and found my leg was broken—I was assisted to the station, and then carried to the hospital—I know all the prisoners, and saw them all there—I have known Flynn a long time—I saw her at my back, but did not see her do anything.</p>

I have nothing to do with the police—on the evening of 8th Oct., I was in King-street, and saw Burke in Moss's custody, Paton in Cotter's, and Agar in Hewitt's—there were several females in the mob, but it is a dark place—I cannot say whether they were doing anything to Hewitt—I saw Agar kick him, and break his leg, and there were three or four more there besides men and women—I saw Flynn there, and Paton was trying to get Agar away from Hewitt—Agar got away, and I pulled Hewitt from under a cart-wheel, or he would have been run over.</p>

After looking at a number of pieces, he selected one; he told me, that his name was John Williams, that he lived at No. 6, Arabella-row, Pimlico; if I sent it there, he would pay for it. I sent our young man with it, and I heard no more of it, till the next morning, when I was looking over some bills, I observed two ten pounds notes; I asked my young man where they came from. I saw the prisoner about eight or ten days afterwards, he wished then to pay for the silk, and he said, I could do nothing but arrest him. I thought the boy would find him again; I saw him in my own compting-house in custody, coming home one morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You sent the boy with the bill of parcels made out, in which the prisoner was made debtor to you? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not entered this in your book, and made the prisoner debtor? - I have entered it in our memorandum-book, which I do on all occasions; it has gone regularly through the journal, and through the ledger to his debit.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he stands debtor in your books now to that amount? You made him your debtor, as you would any other customer? - Surely.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you do so with all goods, till they are paid for? - I do.</p>

            , No. 6, Arabella-row; he wished Mr. Wilson to send the goods, and desired to know what time they could be sent; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150041"></xptr>prisoner proposed six o'clock in the evening; I took the goods myself, and as near to the time as possible, within a quarter of an hour; between Hyde Park and Arabella-row, I met the prisoner, who knew me again, with a person with him; he asked me, if I was going to his house? I answered, yes; he desired me to go on, and he should overtake me, which he did in two minutes after; he took me to his lodgings; he knocked at the door, and it was opened by the woman that keeps the house, and he took me into the front room; I gave him the bill of parcels; he took his pencil, and proved it to be right; and then gave me two bills, ten pounds each, on Taylor, Lloyd, Bowman, and Co. I took them home, and Mr. Wilson enquired the next morning of whom I received them, I told him. The amount of the bill being twelve pounds, ten shillings, I informed the prisoner, I had not cash enough to give him change about me, he then said, he wanted more goods, and he would call the next day, and look them out, when he would take the change; I saw no more of the prisoner from that time, till the 21st of the same month; when I saw him in Fleet-street, and pursued him, he ran away as fast as he could, and me after him; and by the assistance of another man, who met him, and stopped him, I got up to him; the prisoner seemed much confused, but after recovering himself, he said, the best way I could do, was to go with him, and he would get me the whole of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him, that led him to say this? - The moment that he recovered himself, I looked at him, and he said, the best thing I could do, was to go with him, and he would give me the whole of my money. I told him, I could not confidently do any such thing; he then said, where do you mean to take me? I told him, he should go to Bread-street, if he chose, to Mr. Wilson's; he agreed, and we went; and Mr. Wilson came home a short time after he had been there, and then I went with the prisoner to Guildhall, and Mr. Wilson came there; he was examined before the magistrate, and I gave the evidence that I now give, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Court to Wilson. Have you those two notes? - I have, these are the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the notes you received of the young man? - They are the same.</p>
               <p>Clarke. These are the notes I received of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with these notes? - The morning after I received them, I presented them to Taylor, Lloyd, Bowman, and Co. they informed me, they were not worth any thing; I then went back to Pimlico, in hopes to find the prisoner at his lodgings; I did not find him there; the person who keeps the house is now in court, who will tell you more of the subject about that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You delivered him the goods with the bill of parcels? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you enter the goods in a book? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do it after you returned from Pimlico? - I entered them before I carried them.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand they were entered into three books, first of all, in the memorandum book, afterwards in the journal, and then in the ledger? - I entered them in the memorandum book myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the delivery of the goods, did you enter them into the ledger? - I did not enter them into the ledger, we have a clerk for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this transaction, that they were put into the ledger? - I cannot tell, I have not seen it in the ledger yet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Wilson. When is your goods entered in the ledger? - At the end<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150042"></xptr>of the month, it is entered in the ledger regularly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys here objected to the making of this a felony, as the prosecutor had considered him on his books in the light of a debtor. The court was of opinion, that it would be proper for the Jury to decide upon the intention of the prisoner, and alio, whether Mr. Wilson at the time he sold these goods, meant to give him credit. And afterwards to reserve the case for the consideration of the Judges.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before? - No. He liked them very well, and he thought he should like to have them; he asked me the number of my door, and the name of the street, I told him, it was No. 6, Arabella-row; and he told me, that he was come from the country, and he had a portmanteau coming from the country; and he went away, and he told me, he would call again; he never gave me his address; in the afternoon, between five and six, he called again; he came about ten in the morning to bargain for the lodgings; between five and six, he told me he had ordered his portmanteau to come there, and that he would have my lodgings; I told him, I did not know what to do about taking parcels in, till the lodgings were taken, and I had not his address yet, to enquire about him; he said, he would walk about, and take the portmanteau himslef; and he went out about six o'clock; he came again, and knocked at the door, and a young man with him, he had not got the portmanteau, and when he knocked at the door, I opened the door, and he walked into the front parlour, and the young man with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any portmanteau then? - No, nothing but the small parcel that the young man had by his side. Then I did not like his behaviour; I went to the bed room adjoining, and looked in, and then went and stood at the door, not liking his taking that liberty before he was a lodger. I stood at the door till the other man came out, the young man came out, and said, you are very pleasant, and went away; and the prisoner stood at the door, to see him out of sight; I said to him, have you got your portmanteau? no, says he, I have not, tis not come, I have given eighteen-pence to a man to bring it; I will go, and see, why it does not come; and he turned back again, and went into the parlour, and took this small parcel, and went away, and I never saw him afterwards.</p>

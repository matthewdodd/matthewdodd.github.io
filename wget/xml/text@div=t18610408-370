I am a cabinet-maker of Woodford—on 9th March, in consequence of information I received, I followed four lads the same size as the prisoners—Pledle is one of them—he is the only one I could distinguish—as I approached, I saw him put down something behind a bush—I went there and found this box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my shop is near the Castle—that is two hundred or two hundred and fifty yards from the bush—a constable was with me—this is my box—it is worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had seen it safe between 2 and 3 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a whitesmith of Woodford—on Saturday, 9th March, I saw Bates and Pender outside Mr. Waller's shop, and within ten yards of it, and Pledle inside the shop—I returned about five minutes after<lb></lb>wards, and saw them all together in the middle of the road—Smith was with them—I next saw them all together against the police-station—that was not five minutes afterwards—it was on the edge of the Green—I pointed out to Mr. Waller the one who I saw in the shop, and he went after them—when they saw Mr. Waller and the constable coming, they separated—three of them went across the road, and Pledle went across the Green—Pledle and Fender came over to me with some herrings, and I noticed that Pledle had something under his coat—Pender said, "Come away; he does not want any; "and they all went towards the police-station—I ran after them, with the prosecutor and a constable, and Pledle went in, put something behind a bush, and the constable apprehended him—the others went round the road to the right.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far were these boys from you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not far—Pledle was not more than a dozen yards from me, because he only walked—the others were more than that, because they went round—the policeman, the prosecutor, and myself, were about a dozen yards off when I saw Pledle put this into the bush—the bush is in the middle of the Green—he went behind it, so that they could not see what he put—if he thought fit to come round he could see me and the policeman, and Waller; or he could see through the bush.</p>

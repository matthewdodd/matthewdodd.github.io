                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live in Upper Ebury-street, Pim<lb></lb>lico. The prisoner was in my employ, as plumber, for five weeks—he was engaged to work at some new houses in Grovesnor-row, and I supplied him with a quantity of lead pipe for the order—he was to leave what was not used on the premises—there were two closets on the premises to put the materials in, of which he had the keys.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 2nd of December I was going up Westbrook-street, Pimlico, a little after twelve o'clock in the day-time, and saw the prisoner crossing from Lower Graham-street in a direction from the building where be was employed, with a bag on his back—he seemed to try to avoid me—I allowed him to go tome dis<lb></lb>tance, and then followed him—when he got to the corner of Coleshill-street, he looked round, apparently looking after me—I followed, took him into custody, and found this lead on his person—I then went to the premises where he was at work, and compared it with a piece I found there, which I have no doubt this came from, from the peculiar cut, which corresponded in both—it was a sort of vein in the lead—when I took him he wanted to go to his master's shop, but he was going quite away from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you ever spoken to him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—about a week before I asked him if he knew a person named Hurst—there were several public-houses between the shop and the building—when I stopped him I asked what he had in the bag, and he seemed very much confused—I said, "You have got somelead"—I did not ask where he was going—his master's private house was about ten doors from where I took him—he was carrying the bag openly on his shoulder.</p>

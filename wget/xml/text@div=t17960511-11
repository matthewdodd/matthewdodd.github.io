                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110062"></xptr>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner? - A. I saw him, I am sure he was the man; a person that was in the shop ran out and took him at the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. Is it your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You let it out in lodgings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What door was this you speak of? - A. A little door that goes out of the passage to the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a very dark night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner, as you suppose, knocked you down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was rather a tumble, was not it? - A. Yes, we were both down together; but my head was cut through it.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no light in the passage? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was all in a minute, and very dark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All you know about it is, that some man came down in this dark passage and tumbled over you? -</p>
               <p>Court. No, no, don't mislead the witness, he said he was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you or not knocked down? - A. I was.</p>

               <p>Q. Perhaps the agitation of your spirits was such you could not tell? - A. I know that I fell down, and the prisoner fell with me.</p>
               <p>Q. All this passed in a moment? - A. It was done in a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. And the passage was extremely dark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say it was the prisoner, do you say it from that momentary observation of him in a dark passage, or because that was the man that was brought back to you? - A. He was taken in the passage at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that he had not passed the passage; could you see whether he was within or without the door? - A. He was within the door.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the wife of the last witness: on the 9th of April, we were busy in the shop, the shop was full of customers; my husband said, he thought he heard somebody over head; I went up stairs and found the door of the one pair of stairs front ran a litle bit a-jar, about the width of my finger, I clapped my hand upon the lock of the door, a man opened the door, looked me right in the face, and ran out of the room down stairs, I ran after him, as hard as I could, I cried out, "stop-thief, stop thief;" my husband ran out at the little door at the foot of the stairs, and caught the man in the passage; I saw my husband have hold of the man, and then the man knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he knock him down? - A. I don't know; the man was got off the stairs before my husband laid hold of him, and got rather out of my sight; I came a little way down, and then I saw my husband have hold of him, and he knocked him down; I then went up stairs, and missed a black silk gown and petticoat, a mode cloak, a black sattin long cloak, two table spoons, one salt spoon, a a dark cotton gown, five guineas in gold, and ten shillings in silver; when I went into the room, I saw this little box (producing it), rested upon the side of the bed, which was close to the door, and a pair of stays at the top of it; it was, before that, in the third drawer from the top, in a mahogany chest of drawers; I did not see any of the things again till last Monday, when a boy brought a pair of table spoons that answered the description of our's, but they were bent double, and a salt spoons; I don't know who the boy was, my husband and I were both out, they were directed No. 165, High Holborn, out side the paper.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen these spoons and these things? - A. This was on the Saturday; and I saw them about an hour before I missed them, when I dusted the beauset, and I saw all these things safe in the drawers when I left the room, about half after seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard a noise a over head, did it appear to be one person or more? - A. I did not hear it myself, only from my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Barney). Did it appear to you to be more than one? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Barney). How was it possible for any body to get into your house at that time? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. They could not go through the shop? - A. No; they must have gone through the passage, the passage door always stands open till eight o'clock, and then it is generally shut; on a Saturday night it is generally open later; when I left the room, I put the little dog into the room, and double locked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that lock broke or unlocked? - A. It was unlocked or picked by a picklock, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the things you lost? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110063"></xptr>Q. Will you venture to swear that all the property you lost was worth 40s? - A. Yes; I can swear that all the property I lost was worth 15l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. Your house was full of lodgers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were extremely alarmed, I suppose, at the moment? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And in that moment, perhaps, hardly can tell whether two or three, or four men rushed by you? - A. To the best of my knowledge, there was but one; light was knocked out upon the stairs when the man ran by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite clear whether one or two persons rushed by you? - A. There might be one or more, I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, at first, when the man was examined before the Magistrate, you expressed some doubt whether that was the person or no? - A. I would not wish to say it was the person, without I was positive sure it was.</p>
               <p>Q. And you expressed some doubt upon that account? - A. I said, I believed it was, and I believe so now.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the gown? - A. The gown cost me four guineas; I had wore it but twice since it was made.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say whether the man struck your husband, or whether he sell with the prisoner? - A I saw him raise his hand to my husband, but whe ther he hit him I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Barney). Was any property found upon the prisoner afterwards? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Were there one or more persons rushed down? - A. I cannot say, I saw but one.</p>

               <p>I live in Mr. Barney's house with my father and mother; I was coming down stairs to go to the mangler's; as I came down stairs, Mrs. Barney in one hand and the key in the other; as she was putting the key in, a fellow rushed out and gave me a blow on the lip; I halloaed out murder and thieves as loud as I could; I ran down stairs directly, and he knocked me down in the passage; Mr. Barney was a-top of me; they knocked him down a-top of me; my brother came down stairs when they were a-top of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know whether he was the person? - A. I can be upon my oath he was not the person that knocked me down, because the gentlewoman had a candle in her hand, and I saw that he was a very short man, with a very thin visage, and I said that immediately the man was brought in.</p>
               <p>Saunders. My wife came to me to beg me to follow two men who came from the prosecutor's house with a bundle, but they were gone too far for me to overtake them, and being so dark, I could not see which way they turned; one of them, she said, had got a bundle under his arm, apparently black, and was running very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Morgan). You have lived in the house some time? - A. Yes; my father has lived in the house six years.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Willmers). Q. You say you were knocked down in the passage? - A. Yes.</p>

On Sunday evening the 26th of January, I went out about a quarter before six o'clock, leaving only Mrs. Dale, who lodges on the first floor at home, it was dark. I returned about seven o'clock, and saw a light shining on the wall of the stair-case; I immediately went back, and saw White and Anderson. I got a light, and we all went up stairs, and found the prisoner trying to get out of the first floor window; Dale occupies that room. He ran to the landing, and struck me on the side of my head, and then knocked the other man down, and ran into the second floor back room. A third man collared him; and I laid hold of him, and brought him down, and took him outside the door, and laid him on the snow, and took him to the watch-house. I returned to the house, and went into the first floor rooms, and found the linen laying about the floor, and in the back room the trunks were on the bed. My master picked up a crow-bar, soon after in a chair, in the front room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did he ever get away - A. No. I first saw him in the front room. Holmes never slept in the house, but I do, and his other servants do. I saw the prisoner's face distinctly.</p>

I went back to the spot, and found a green-bag on the snow, near the curb; it contained seven skeleton and one picklock key, which I gave to the officer. When we took him to the watch-house, he laid down at the door on the right hand side of the steps, and on that spot I found next morning, a piece of wax candle and two matches, which I also gave to the officer.</p>

            . I went to Holmes's house - no force was used to the doors, they must have been entered by false keys. I picked up a skeleton key which unlocked the door. I also found a silver watch and sleeve button. I saw the prisoner at the watch-house, and asked where he lived. He said in North-street, City-road, but afterwards he said in Great Gardner-street. I asked what he was, he said a chair-maker. I asked who he worked for, he hesitated. I then asked where he worked last, and who for. He said he had sold half a dozen chairs in Moorfields, but could not tell me the name or number. Bowcott gave me eight skeleton keys, and one picklock key. Another picklock key was given me by a young woman who picked it up.</p>

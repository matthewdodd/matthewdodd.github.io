                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Curzon-street, May-fair, and am a job master and contractor; I have one partner. I have an order to supply the army with horses; in consequence of that I was at Banbury fair on 23rd Jan., or about that time—I had before employed the prisoner a few times to bring horses to town—on that occasion the prisoner had charge of twenty-one horses, which he was entrusted to bring to Woolwich—the instructions were given to him by my foreman, who is not here—I was there when the prisoner came away with the horses—I know of their being delivered at Woolwich—I did not see any money given to the prisoner when he left—he has on former occasions delivered vouchers; it is always done—I received this letter from Mrs. Burnham, dated 20th March—I showed it to the prisoner, and read it to him, when he was taken, at Mr. Saul's livery stable, in Finsbury—I received two letters from Mrs. Burnhain—the first time I saw the prisoner after receiving a letter from her was at Beverley, in Yorkshire—I called his attention to the bills—I asked him if</p>

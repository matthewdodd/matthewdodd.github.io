                  </hi>. I live in West Ham-lane, Essex. Eliza Harris was my cook for two months—a policeman made a communication last Friday week, and I went to a house in Stepney the next day—the first thing I saw was a coat belonging to a friend, a shirt, and other articles which are principally marked with my name—I gave both the prisoners in custody—the policeman went to my house, and I gave Eliza in custody—she went down on her knees, and begged that I would excuse it—the policeman took a handker<lb></lb>chief out of his pocket and shook it at her—that handkerchief had been taken out of Francis' pocket at the station.</p>

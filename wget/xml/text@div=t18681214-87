                  </hi>. I am a farmer, at Exwick, near Exeter—on Monday, 26th October, I was at the cricket ground, Islington, at the pony races—I had received a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I can't say what time in the day it was, but it was after the races, 5 or 6 o'clock, I think—my hands were occupied when I took the note, in taking some half sovereigns, and I placed the note in my mouth, and held it there while I pocketed the half sovereigns—I was standing with my face to the betting booth of Valentine and Wright, where I had just received the money—I placed the note in my mouth, and put my hands into my great coat pockets—I felt a hand come and snatch the note—I made a firmer grasp with my teeth at the note, and the man who took it left a portion of the note between my teeth—I then turned round to see who it was, and saw a man disappearing among the crowd, getting between, as an eel would among a lot of eels; and, the prisoner confronting me, he said, "What do you want, where are you going?"—and he hustled me, and put himself in a fighting attitude—from this interruption I lost sight of the other man in the crowd—I took the piece of the note out of my mouth and put it in my pocket—I then said to the prisoner, "You scoundrel, you are as bad as the other"—he said, "Oh, I came round this course for a pur<lb></lb>pose," which he mentioned; there was a place there that might be made a convenience of—I preserved the portion of the note, and sent it next morn<lb></lb>ing to the Bank of England.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you been betting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had—I don't pretend to say that the prisoner is the man that snatched the portion of the note from my mouth—I am sure he is not—there was a great crowd—I found this man standing before me—I turned round as fast as I could—I did not give him into custody then, or attempt to hold him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at 32, Florence Street, Islington—I was at those races and saw Shaw there—I saw a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note handed down from Messrs. Valentine and Wright's stand, and he put it into his mouth—the prisoner was standing close to him at that time—he said to a party standing on his left hand side, "Take that!"—as soon as the note was put into Mr. Shaw's mouth, the man made a snatch at Mr. Shaw's mouth and tore a portion of the note away—another portion was left in his mouth—Mr. Shaw turned round and accused the man of taking it—he said, "Oh no, I know nothing at all about it, I was here for a different purpose"—as he turned round to accuse him, the prisoner got in between Mr. Shaw and the other man, and the other man turned off to the left and walked up the cricket ground—the prisoner then walked up in the same direction and joined the man at the top of the long gravel walk at the back of the house—I made a communication to the prosecutor—there were about twenty persons there, as near as I can guess.</p>

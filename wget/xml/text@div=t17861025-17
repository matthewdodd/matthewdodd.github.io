               <p>How far was that man you took from you? - About two or three hundred yards.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250043"></xptr>Was he ever out of your sight? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the man you took, was one of the men that robbed you? - Yes, I took particular notice of him; I was attacked within one hundred yards of the Three Cups.</p>
               <p>What sort of a morning was it? - It was pretty lightish, a very fine morning; the man came behind me.</p>
               <p>As you was knocked down before you was robbed, had any opportunity of looking at them? - Yes, when I was knocked down, I took particular notice of them by their jackets, and by the hairy caps they wore, and by their complection.</p>
               <p>What countrymen are they? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen them before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Which is the man you took? - The prisoner Vallence.</p>
               <p>You say you are sure that Vallence was one of the three that robbed you? - Yes; the other prisoner came to the watch house afterwards, but nobody would stop him, and he was taken the next day; the watchman came to me again, after they were fully committed, and said a gentlewoman wanted to speak to me, and he took me to a strange house, and they wanted me to smother the robbery; one of the women asked me if I was going to hang her nephew; I said I never hung any body, nor never should, for if the law of the nation hung them, it was not me; then I was applied to by a girl, who said a gentlewoman wanted me; she gave me some rum, and told me not to hang her son, but she should not mind if he was transported.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys, Prisoner's Counsel. You are a labouring man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was between two and three in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where had you been all that night? - At Paul's-wharf at work, and from thence to Newgate-market.</p>
               <p>When did you leave off work? - About half past one, I carry the loads all night.</p>
               <p>Was not it very dark that night? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was not dark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not the watchman tell you, you was drunk that night? - No, Sir, not that I know; he abused me very much; the watchman shewed me the Three Cups; I knew the watchman; the watchman has been turned out of the parish on that very account, and his other misdemeanors, the day following, and two days after he was turned out of the parish in the vestry.</p>
               <p>You are sure Vallence was one of them? - Yes, Sir, very sure.</p>
               <p>Where did you get this money? - Worked for it, Sir.</p>

               <p>I was a watchman in Shadwell-dock that night, the 8th of September, I have known the prosecutor these two years; I believe I came round about ten, and it began to rain; after the half hour I came and saw the prosecutor in my box; says I, what is this here, my officers will not allow me to keep any body in my box, you must move out of this; he was drunk, I could hardly keep him up; at eleven I found him drunk a second time, laying in the street, I then told him he should not be there; says he, I am waiting for the captain; says I, where do you lodge? says he, in the city; I went round about, as soon as I came round the half hour, there he was laying in the same place again; I thought as it was raining he would catch his death of cold; he asked me if I knew of any lodging; I told him no, except one public house, as I came round where I heard people up, I went there, and told them there was a man very much in liquor, and would catch his death of cold; I did not stay there three minutes, there I left him in an empty box by himself.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - I suppose pretty near twelve when I put him in there, then he was very much intoxicated with liquor, he could hardly stand upon his legs, I saw him afterwards, I cannot tell what time it was, may be it might be an hour and a half afterwards, when he came out of this public house there was a good many people backwards and forwards, I did not stop to hear what they were, there was a racket, as there most commonly are watermen and captains of ships and that, and so I went down, and the prosecutor was there, and two men had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250045"></xptr> hold of him, whether they were lifting him up or what I cannot say; the prisoners at at the bar were coming one way; says, I do you know who robbed you? yes, says he; says I, did this man rob you? yes, says he; and I suppose if I had pointed out any other he would have said the same.</p>
               <p>Where was Vallence when you came up? - He and another man was walking towards us.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to ask him whether that man had robbed him? - I asked him whether he know the persons that robbed him, Vallence was one of the men that he said robbed him; I do not know who the other man was.</p>

               <p>Mr. Keys. Who took Vallence into custody that night? - I did.</p>
               <p>You took him to the watch-house I think? - I did.</p>
               <p>When you first came up was Vallence standing there? - No, he was coming towards the crowd; I have known the prosecutor for about two years.</p>
               <p>What is his character in that neighbourhood? - His character is like a great many labouring men, he makes ill use of his money, and gets drunk like a great many more foolish people.</p>
               <p>Is he supposed to carry much money in his pocket? - I believe he seldom has much money, I believe he is like me.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you any relation to Vallence? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know his aunt? - No, I know his mother.</p>
               <p>Did not you carry this Schooley to his mother or aunt? - No, I carried her to the public house; I never took him to her house.</p>
               <p>What house did you take him to? - To Mr. Swinney's, the Bull's Head, in New Gravel-lane.</p>
               <p>Who desired you to take him to that house? - I met him and took him up there with his mother to make it up.</p>
               <p>How came you to know that? - He told me he was willing to make it up; I told Schooley I believe the mother and you will make it up; so I carried him to the Dock public house, and the mother was not at home, I fancy there was some relation there, they had some discourse but what it was I do not know; I was not with him the next time; I have known his mother going on twenty years.</p>
               <p>How has the lad got his living? - I have known him to be a good scholar, and he is lately come home from Greenland.</p>
               <p>How comes it you are not a watchman for the parish? - I do not know, I am a watchman in another parish, now in St. George's, I was turned out about this affair.</p>
               <p>I suspect because you wanted to get this man to make up this business. - No, it was because I did not come down time enough when this man was robbed, I could not be at both ends of the street at once.</p>

               <p>I have known Vallence in the course of fourteen years since he was a baby; he was brought up to sea, and that vessel was car away, and the captain is not here at present; he has gone to Greenland backwards and forwards, his mother keeps him; Captain Scott is not in town or he would give him an undeniable character, he made his last voyage with him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four more witnesses who all gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Court. Can you satisfy the Jury where you was that night? - I know no more about it than I met this young fellow, we went into the Three Cups and had a pot of beer, the prosecutor was laying asleep in the box, we sat in another box, the watchman came in, who was an acquaintance of this young fellow's; this young fellow called for half a pint of rasberry, and drank about half a glass of it, and went away for fear of being locked out; then I heard he was taken up, I went to the watch-house to see what was the matter, and the prosecutor was there, and he said I believe he is one of the robbers, take hold of him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250046"></xptr> but nobody would; then I went away, I was going to work; and after I came from work, about ten, Mr. Forrester came and took me away: I have no friends in England.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any person belonging to the watch-house? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Sutton. Was you there when Collins came to see Vallence? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Court to Schooley. Where had you been the night before you had got down to Shadwell? - At Paul's Wharf carrying apples, pears, and all kind of garden stuff, as I always do when I am not in place; I suppose I went away from Paul's Wharf about half past twelve, and got down to Shadwell about half past one; I never was laid down at the Dock, nor he never bid me go away; he said you are a little in liquor; says I, I am fatigued and a little in liquor too, says I.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you sure you were alone? A. Yes; there was no one in the square but the prisoner - this was near Cranbourn-alley. I had been at the ltalian Opera - he was stopped by the watchman at the end of Lisle-street; nothing was found on him. I did not see him from the time I was pushed down till the watchman took him; I went to the watch-house that night and got locked up as well as he. There was no charge against me - I never struck him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty in Leicester-street, and heard the prosecutrix cry Stop thief! I went to the place; the prisoner was running, and she was following him, saying "He has got my property" - I stopped him; she said "It is in his hand;" I looked into his hand, but found nothing; I took him to the watch-house, and found nothing on him but three sixpences.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not wish to be searched on the spot? A. No; I did attempt to search him in the street, because I saw his hand near his pockets - not two minutes elapsed before I took him; I did not see him thrown anything away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prosecutrix appear sober? A. Yes: she complained of her neck-chain being broken; she was detained because the prisoner accused her of striking him, and we have some cases where the persons do not appear. I have seen her in the street before, but not that evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up the square and saw a young woman whom I had known two years ago; I spoke to her - the prosecutrix came up and asked if I would give her anything to drink; I said "Where can I get it;" she said "Further on;" I objected, and wished to go home - I turned to go home, and the prosecutrix struck me several times and knocked my hat off: I did not with to make any disturbance in the street and ran off.</p>

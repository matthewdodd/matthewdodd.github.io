            . On the 13th of November, between nine and ten o'clock, I took a hackney-chariot in Piccadilly; the prisoner drove it - a friend was with me; we drove to No. 2, <placeName id="t18301209-61-crimeloc354">Bolton-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did Douglass get the purse? A. He took it off the coach - when I missed the purse I had all the straw taken out; the prisoner assisted - I did not tell him what I was searching for, till after the straw was out; I was looking for it to pay the prisoner - I gave him 2s.; I am married - I had a lady with me, a friend of mine, who is now out of town: the prisoner demanded more, but I would not give him more than 2s. - I said I would not let it rest there; my husband is on the continent, on a journey.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you this money for your own use. A. Yes; I had the management of it - I have money independent of my husband, by settlement; it is money which comes to me as a separate allowance, by settlement.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there any separate settlement by which you are entitled to receive and disburse money during you husband's life? A. Yes, perhaps there is, but I do not choose to say what it is - this was my own money; there has been a written settlement between us - it was not at the time of my marriage; this money was not settled on me by my husband: I shall not tell you who settled it - it has been settled about a year; I shall not tell you the name of the attorney who drew the settlement - I am living on terms of affection with my husband; this settlement was done, with his knowledge, by a friend - I left my husband three weeks ago on the continent; this was not part of the money my husband left me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you live upon this allowance? A. No- this was part of the allowance.</p>

            . I was at No. 2, Bolton-street, on the night the hackney-chariot came there with Mrs. Murray and a friend - the prisoner drove the chariot: I brought out the candle for the witness to search the coach; I helped to search - I found nothing on the first examination; the prisoner stood outside, quite unconcerned, and took no steps to find the money - he was on the point of going away, and demanded 3s. for being detained; Mrs. Murray said she was positive she had lost the money - I asked her if it was of consequence; she said she should not like to lose the purse - I got a Policeman; he got on the box, but could not find any thing - I then got on the box, and under a horse-cloth I found this purse, which Mrs. Murray claimed - I do not know exactly what was in it; the prisoner was taken to the station-house; I went there, and heard him admit taking it - he said, "I did take it, and am sorry for it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. I am a clerk, living on my means - I am in no situation; I have been out of place about twelve months - I lived last with my sister in Bishopsgate within; I had searched the straw - the Policeman who searched the box before me, is not here; I asked if he had searched it; he told me he had, and could find nothing - he then went away.</p>

            . I am an officer. A little before ten o'clock on the Saturday night, I got into the prisoner's chariot to look for the purse - I saw Ferrers get on the box, and he said he had found the purse; I took the prisoner to the station-house - he said he had put it up on the box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure he did not say, "I took it, and am sorry for it?" A. He said, "I am sorry for it, I put it there;" I knew the other Policeman had searched - this is the purse; there is 5s. in it.(Purse produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man was the last who got on my box - he said, "I have got it;" I never saw it till this moment - I know no more about it than a child; I never had sight of it - that is the man who got on my box, and he must have put it there.</p>
               <p>JURY to MRS. MURRAY. Q. Was the prisoner see non the box from the time the Policeman went up to the box till Ferrers did? A. I do not know indeed - I had not seen him on the box after he got off.</p>
               <p>Five witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

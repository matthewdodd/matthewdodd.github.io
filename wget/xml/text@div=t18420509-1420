                  </hi>. I am the wife of Moses Myers, of High-street, Shad<lb></lb>well. On the 24th of April the prisoner brought me the advance note for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now produced—I had cashed a 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for him three months before, and he did not go into the vessel—I said to him, "How is it to be between me and you? I hope you will behave honourably"—he said he would—he said I should take the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note from the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would allow me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for having waited for the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that would leave 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money and the remainder in clothes—I said I would give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said that would not do, he must have a sovereign—I told my daugh<lb></lb>ter to give him a sovereign, which she did—I then said to him, "Douglas, sign your name at the back," which he did—he said he was going to the ship then as chief mate, on board the <hi rend="italic">Madras,</hi> at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per month—he came to me next morning—I asked why he did not go on board—he said it would be time enough to go at three o'clock in the afternoon, if I would let my boy carry a parcel for him into the City—I said he should—he said, "You must let me have some more money"—I said, if he waited till the boy returned he should have it; and while he was waiting, my daughter came in with the note, and said, "Here, mother, the gentleman has forged a note upon you"—he flew over the counter—I caught him by the collar, and told him that out of my hands he should not go—my daughter called a policeman, and I gave him in charge.</p>

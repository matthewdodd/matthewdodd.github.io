I knew Mr. Currey, he was one of the time keepers lately in our employ—the railway from Balaklava to Sebastopol was constructed by Peto and Brassey—there was a man employed there named John Fennell—there was only one John Fennel—I paid John Fennell his last account—I cannot recognise the man at the bar—it is impossible to recognise one man out of 500—I paid some of the men; I paid a person who called himself John Fennell—I have no belief whether this man is the John Fennell, I do not know him—the men received personally the money that was due to them—the balance that I paid to John Fennell was 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have not my books here—I did not pay John Fennell any more money, nor did I see it paid—the other money was paid in the Crimea by Mr. Bartlett—I have the balance sheet in my writing—this is from the book—a receipt was given—I have not the receipt here; I have a copy of it.</p>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi> Some of the men were in the Crimea about six months—some longer, some not so long—a labourer on the rail<lb></lb>way there would earn 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day—John Fennell was a horse keeper—he wonld earn 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day—he would have overwork—he might, as horse keeper earn as much as 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Or in six months—he would not have to provide for himself out of his wages—some rations would be furnished to him by Government—it was the duty of Mr. Beattie to hire persons going to the Crimea, but he is dead now—I believe two or three clerks used to assist him, but I am sure I do not know their names—when the men come back there is some one sent down on board each vessel to arrange the time and place of payment—I went down as well as others—when I went down I suppose I should see John Fennell as well as others.</p>

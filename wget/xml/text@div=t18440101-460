                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and lodge in Chopping-court, Gravel-lane. On the night of the 27th of Dec. I went home with the pri<lb></lb>soner—I put my jacket on a chair alongside the bed—I missed it in the mor<lb></lb>ning, and I spoke to the prisoner about it—I went to my sitter, got some money, and the prisoner got it out of pledge—I then went back and laid down—the prisoner said, "Take off your clothes"—I took off my things, and put them under the pillow—that was between one and two o'clock in the day—when I awoke I missed my jacket again, and the prisoner too—I went down stairs, and she was there—I said, "Go and get my jacket; I don't like my friends to see me a second time without it"—she used very bad words—I went and got the officer to come and take her—when I met her the first time I said I had no money, but I should be paid on the Saturday night—she said that would do for her.</p>

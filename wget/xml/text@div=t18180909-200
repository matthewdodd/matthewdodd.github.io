            . I am watchman of Marylebone. On the 3d of September, about eight o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner in the Bayswater-road, about a mile and a half from Tyburn turnpike, with three other persons; I followed them all the way to Tyburn, and then asked the prisoner if the hog was for sale? he said, No; and that he was going to take it to his master's, who was a cowkeeper, at Islington - He would not tell his name; he said he brought it from Acton, but he could not tell who from. I followed him to St. George's-market; he was driving the hog, the others were with him. I ran towards the watch-house to get assistance, and saw him turn down Wigmore-street. I met two watchmen, and asked them to assist, which they refused. The serjeant of the watch-house went with me, and took the prisoner and hog, the others ran away. The prisoner said none of them were with him when he got the hog.</p>

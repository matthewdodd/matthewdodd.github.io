The Evidence for the King deposed, That being a Prisoner in Newgate for Clipping and Coining, That Bush did come to him, with two other persons, and offered him 500 l. if he would go out of England, and suffer a Divorce between him and his Wife by Consent; with that he said, He admired they should make such a Proposal to him, and askt him how he should do to get out; with that they replied, We can soon get you out as we did Birkenhead, and convey you into France. The Prisoners denied the Fact, and called Witnesses to prove that Egon was in Flanders at the same time when the Escape was made; and that he was sick in his Chamber, and never out from the first of October to the first of January; which did not agree with the King's Evidence, who was not committed till the 13th of October. As to Jones he was not positive and Bush called a Cloud of Witnesses to his Reputation; who said That he was a Man well affected to the Government, and would not be Guilty of such a Crime; he called Witnesses to prove that they had been offered Money by the King's Evidence, to Swear against the Prisoners; the Jury considering the matter <rs id="t16970224-47-verdict255" type="verdictDescription">

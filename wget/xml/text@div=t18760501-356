                  </hi>. I am a master mariner, and have been living on board the ship Fox in the East India Dock—I did not leave her until 6 o'clock on the evening of the 1st April—at 10.40 that evening I was going down the East India Dock Road to go on board—the prisoner and another female came up and spoke to me, and a man came afterwards—they wanted me to treat them with a glass of ale, I declined—they said they wanted to speak to me and walked about 30 or 40 yards down the street—I heard what they had to say and felt the prisoner's hand go into my pocket—I put my hand there directly and missed my purse—I held her for two or three minutes; she bit my hand and the blood was coming through her teeth—I held her until a policeman came up—it was after 9.30 when I know I had the sovereign, and I had put a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into my purse not five minutes before—I heard the prisoner say "Here's the lump."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Dudley-street, Paddington, and am a labourer—the prisoner is my wife—on the night of 14th March, she came home to me between 12 and 1 o'clock—she looked as if she had been drinking—I said, "Then you be come"—she said, "I shan't be here long"—went to a drawer, took this knife out (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and said, "It is not very sharp"—she sharpened it on the stone and then said, "I will cut my throat from ear to ear and then I shall die quick"—I said, "You shan't do it here"—and when I went to her she said, "I will stab you to the heart," and cut me down the face—I took a piece of wood from the fire-place and hit her over the arms till I got the knife from her—she then began hallooing "Murder," and I took her out at the street door on to the pavement—a policeman came and took her in custody; and I went to St. Mary's Hospital—my face was cut through and has been sewn up—here is the scar—I did not strike her before she cut me—I only got out of bed to hinder her from cutting herself.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, D</hi> 11). I was on duty about 1o'clock and heard a cry of "Murder:" went to the spot and saw the prosecutor and the prisoner—he was perfectly sober, but she had been drinking—she was on her knees on the cill of the door, holding one of his wrists—he said, "Policeman, my wife has attempted to murder me, she sharpened the knife to do it"—she got off her knees and they both went into the back parlour—I followed them, and on the ground beside the bed I found the knife and this hone on the corner of the table—the prosecutor said, "That is the knife she did it with, and that is the stone she sharpened it with"—he was bleeding very much—his face was cut open and the jaw-bone was bare; I said, "I must take you to the station, how came you to do such a thing?"—she said, "I did it, I did it, and I will do it forty times, for he has illused me"—he replied "I did strike you with the stick after you cut me"—he showed me the piece of wood he struck her with—she was charged—and I took him to St. Mary's Hospital, where a surgeon sewed up the wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital—I examined the prosecutor not on the night he was brought in, but at 9 o'clock the next morning, on the 15th—he had a severe wound on his face, completely dividing the lip and part of the cheek, two inches and a half in length—it might have been inflicted by such a knife as this—it was sewn up when I saw it—it would have the effect of causing the cheek to lap, so that you could see the jaw—it was a severe flesh wound, not dangerous, though erysipelas might have come on, but it healed by first intention—he never came in, he was an out-patient.</p>

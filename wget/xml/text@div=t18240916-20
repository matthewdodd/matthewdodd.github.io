            . I was called up on Sunday morning, the 19th of July, about half-past four o'clock - I went to my own wash-house, which is near Davis's, and saw a young man getting over the yard of an opposite neighbour; I then went over, and saw the prisoner's feet under a gutter of Mr. Davis's. I asked him what he wanted - he said he was waiting for a young man who was gone up stairs. I called to Davis, but he did not hear - I went up to Davis, and the prisoner ran away. I afterwards went down, and saw the watchman, to whom I spoke about it. The prisoner was taken about five o'clock, by the watchman, who brought the pigeons and the bags.</p>

At half-past four o'clock Blanshard asked me if I had seen a boy with a paper cap - I said I had not, but I looked round, and saw the prisoner coming from the back of the premises; he ran away - I pursued, and took him, and found the pigeons in the two bags. He said he had taken them.</p>

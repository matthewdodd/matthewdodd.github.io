               <p>I am a servant to Messrs. Fossetts: on the 21st of July I saw the prisoner take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150137"></xptr>something through the banister of the stairs of the workshop; going from the warehouse; she is one of the women who work there at sewing up the carpets; it was laying nigh the banisters; she took some carpeting up stairs to the workshop; I communicated it to Mr. Brown.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a foreman to the manufactory of Messrs. Fossetts: after being informed by Mr. Haynes of the transaction he has mentioned (it was about half past six in the morning), I consulted with the last witness, and we thought it prudent to say nothing to her: I went up into her room, but could see nothing; I concealed having made observations, I thought it would be more prudent to let her go out into the street; she went to breakfast, and I followed her, about a quarter after seven, at some distance, that she should not discover me till she got to her habitation: she went from the corner of Chiswell-street to Golden-lane, to her own apartments; I went up into her room after her, and accused her; she immediately gave me these carpets here, fastened up in a paper; she at first hesitated at a little, but soon after that gave me these two carpets.</p>
               <p>What did you accuse her of? - I had examined the things on that counter, and missed two pieces of carpeting; I accused her of taking some remnant bedside carpets out of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>(The carpets produced, and deposed to, being the pattern carpets alone manufactured at that warehouse.)</p>
               <p>Court to Haynes. Do you know what it was the prisoner took from the banister? - It appeared to me to be some kind of carpeting.</p>
               <p>Can you say they were not sold since the time you saw them before? - No, because it was the last thing almost that we took account of.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I know nothing at all of the stealing of them, my lord.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called on Mr. Brown, with whom she was a servant, to give her a character; who said, he never knew any thing against her before in his life; as also two other witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

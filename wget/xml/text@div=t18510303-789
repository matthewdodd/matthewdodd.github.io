                  </hi>. I am butler to the officers' mess of the Royal Artillery of Woolwich. I have the care of the plate—on 28th Feb. in counting over the plate, I missed two silver forks—the constable came the same day, to inquire if I had lost anything, and I then missed a silver label and chain, and a silver mustard-spoon—the constable produced this wine-label, with "claret" on it, with this chain and mustard-spoon—I had seen them on the evening before, at five o'clock, to the best of my know<lb></lb>ledge—they were in use—I saw the mustard-spoon in use—I cannot say that I saw this particular label—we have a great number—we have six claret-labels in all, and I am sure we had six the day before—they are the property of John Brandling and others; he is a captain—all the officers contribute to the expense of the mess—when they join, they pay a certain entrance, and then they pay so much a month—this plate is stationary for the officers at Woolwich—it is never removed away—the prisoner is the son of a private in the Artillery—I believe he lived with his father, in Woolwich, in a part we call the Cottages, which is appropriated to soldiers with large families—there had been nothing particular on 27th Feb., only the usual dinner—I never saw the prisoner till the morning of 28th Feb. when I saw him standing just within the pantry-door—I asked him what he wanted—he said he had brought a boot for one of the waiters, which boot he had in his hand—I afterwards ascertained that he had brought a boot for a waiter named Royston, who was in the habit of working in the pantry, where the plate is cleaned—in ordinary course, this label and mustard-spoon would be in the pantry that morning—I cannot say whether they were there—there are seven waiters, who are military men—they have extra pay.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live in Wellington-street, Woolwich. On 28th Feb., between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner, and another boy about his age, came to my shop—one of them (I can hardly tell which) produced to me this mustard-spoon, and asked me if it was silver, and whether I would buy it—I asked where they got it, and one of them said he picked it up in the dust-hole—I asked where they lived, and I said, "You had better go and fetch your parents, and then I will see about it"—they said they lived in the Cottages, which are places built for the soldiers, and they gave me a number; I think it was 24—I said, "I will detain the spoon till you bring your parents"—this is the spoon—they left it, and went away—in about ten minutes they came back, and the other boy said he must have the spoon back; and if not, be would call a constable, if I did not choose to give it up—I took hold of his shoulder, and said, "Come to the constable, we will see; I think you have stolen this spoon, unless you will bring your parents"—he said, "Leave me alone; I am not the thief, this is the thief," pointing to the prisoner—I did not hear the prisoner say anything—I let the other go, and they went away—I then called the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 340.) In consequence of information I took the prisoner, on 28th Feb., about two o'clock, at his master's shop, Mr. Driscoll's, a boot-maker, in Artillery-place—I asked whether he was the boy who had been to Mr. Hart's that morning with a silver spoon—he said, no, he was not—I said, "I shall take you there, and see whether</p>

               <p>you are the one or not"—he then said he was there—I then took him, and went and took the other boy, who is named Monteith—they were both at the station, and Monteith said that the prisoner had a chain on him, and the word "Claret"—the prisoner said he never had anything of the kind, and be knew nothing at all about it—I then searched the prisoner and found this chain and label in his left jacket-pocket—he then said he had found it.</p>

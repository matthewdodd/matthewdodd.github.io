             keeps the house, and lets it out in lodgings - he lives there himself. In the early part of March the prisoner came to lodge there, and occupied part of my bed; when he came I had a box in my bed-room, containing my wearing-apparel - I had lost the key, and it was unlocked: I used to keep another box on it; I had looked into the box on Thursday, the 12th of March, and saw my articles safe; the prisoner had slept there every night till Saturday, the 14th - on going to my box on Sunday, the 15th, I missed three coats, a pair of trousers, two waistcoats, a handkerchief, and a snuff-box, all of which were my property. I did not see the prisoner again till Saturday, the 21st; I had been looking for him all the week, and saw him by the King's-mews, Pimlico; when he saw me he ran away - I pursued, and took him to Hatton-garden; he had then got my trousers and waistcoat on - the waistcoat was taken off in my presence, by Hall; (looking at them) these are the trousers I lost - I know them by the make and button at the bottom; I have no doubt of them, but the waistcoat I cannot positively swear to; it is the sort of waistcoat I lost - exactly the same work, and I believe it to be one of those I lost.</p>

            . I am married, and lodge in the same house as the prosecutor, on the first floor. I saw the prisoner twice on Saturday morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, going out at the front door - he had in his hand a good sized blue bag - it appeared quite full; he used to come home pretty regularly, but I never saw him again till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Could you swear what the bag contained, or whether I took property out once or twice in it? A. I cannot say - I did not know before, that you had brought nothing to the lodging but what you wore.</p>

             re-examined. One of my coats was quite new; I had only worn it twice, and I gave four guineas for it; another of the coats I gave four guineas for, and had not worn it half a dozen times - the other coat cost six guineas; they were certainly worth 10l. - the trousers cost 30s., and the two waistcoats are worth 1l.: the prisoner stated himself to be a gentleman's servant out of place - I never saw him with any thing but what he had on, and he said he had been in great distress.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, In the greatest distress of mind I appear before you, charged with a crime I committed under circumstances of the greatest distress; I have been brought up as a gentleman's servant, out through unavoidable misfortunes attended with great affliction, I have been a great part of my time out of a situation - distress ensued, which drove me to misery; believe me it was not through badness of heart, but distress that brought me to this state, at which my heart recoils; my friends brought me up respectably, but through misfortunes are unable to render me assistance, and are a hundred miles from me at this time - I am destitute of any friend to my character; under every impressive consideration, I must now throw myself on the mercy of the Court, to deal with me as merciful as possible never having before been before a Court - I at present labour under a very severe affliction</p>

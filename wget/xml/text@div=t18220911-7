On the 13th of March, I was in company with the prisoner - he was destitute of breakfast and dinner, which I gave him, and between three and four o'clock I was parting with him - he asked me to lend him 1 s. or two to get a bed; I refused, and he thrust his hand into my pocket, and took out a silk handkerchief, and ran away; I immediately hollowed out, Stop thief! he escaped. I saw no more of him. I indicted him at the Session in April; he was not then in custody. I have known him twelve months. He had slept at my house that night, as I wanted him next day, but never before - he said he had no lodging. I had got him to deliver a summons for me, and he slept in the same bed as myself. I did not pay him for delivering the summons; he owed me a few shillings. I have seen him at Hicks's Hall. I attend that Court for plaintiffs.

               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long was I in your company - A. From the morning till between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect meeting two girls, and snatching water cresses from them - A. There were two girls, but they had no cresses. I did not lend him the handkerchief. I applied for a warrant to take him on the 3d of April, on seeing him in the Office, but the Magistrate would not grant it - I think I went to the Office to bail one Sutton, and saw the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not indict four people last Session - A. I believe I did for an assault. They never gave me a farthing to settle it.</p>

            . I know Miles very well. In March last, I saw him running along London-fields after a man, calling Stop thief! I cannot say the prisoner was the man. I do not know whether the man had anything in his hand.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in a long Defence stated that the prosecutor was indebted to him for serving two summonses, that the prosecutor lent him the handkerchief to wipe his face, and he told him he would keep it till he paid him, and that the prosecutor had offered to settle the business for 1 l.</p>

            . I made no offer to settle it. His father applied to me to settle it; I said it would be compounding felony. I saw the prisoner standing by the Five Pound Court, the day after the robbery. I did not speak to him.</p>

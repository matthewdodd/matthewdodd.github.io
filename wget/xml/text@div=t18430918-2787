                  </hi>. I am a sail-maker, and live at Claremont-place, Chatham. On the 11th of July, I saw my watch at two o'clock, hanging on the bed-room mantel-piece—I missed it between eleven and twelve at night—the prisoner went home with me that day, and had an opportunity of taking it, while I was getting ready to go out—this is my watch, but this chain is not mine—I afterwards found the prisoner at Woolwich—he said, "I am the person that took your watch"—I said, "Act like a man, and I will not hurt a hair of your head"—he asked me to go home with him—I went—he called his wife, and said, "My dear, this is the gentleman I took the watch from at Chatham"—she went down on her knees, and begged me to forgive him.</p>

                  </hi>. I spoke to the prisoner on the 29th of Aug., and asked him what he had done with the duplicate of my father's watch—he said it was all right—I said that would not do for me—I met him on the 30th, and got the watch from his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a publican, but am out of business. On 14th Dec. I lived at the Three Cups, in Lower Shadwell—on that night I was in Sutton-street, St. George's in the East, on my way home, nearly opposite the George—I had for some time felt indisposed, and at that time I felt very sick—I sat down on the step of a doorway—I observed two men coming towards me, arm in arm, and a third man was following me—I had not been sitting half a minute before they got to me—I had scarcely sat down—the two men put their arms through mine, pinioning my arms back—they put their arms under mine, and lifted me up with their arms, and pinioned my arms back—they raised me up on my feet—one man was on each side of me—they said, "Here is a man drunk and ill—let us take him home"—I was perfectly sober—I said, "Hold hard, let me alone"—and then the third person put his arm round my neck, and gagged me back—he did not come in front of me, he was behind—he put his arm round my neck and got hold of his hand with his other hand, and pulled me back, rendering me almost insensible—I can identify the prisoner as the man who had hold of my left arm—he robbed my left-hand pocket, and the other robbed my right hand pocket—the prisoner put his hand into my left hand waistcoat pocket, where I had a half crown—I had seen it about half an hour previous to that time—the man on my right side put his hand into my other pocket—the prisoner then let go my arm and struck me a violent blow in my stomach with his fist, and at the same moment I fell down—I had five halfpence</p>

               <p>in my right hand pocket—they then ran off—the man that had had me round the neck, ran down Sutton-street—I ran after the prisoner, who ran towards the Commercial-road—I never lost sight of him—I missed the half crown and the five halfpence—the policeman stopped the prisoner, and I came up—I never was five yards behind him.</p>

TORR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where had you been that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To Hoxton—this occurred in Sutton-street, near the George—that was my nearest way home from Hoxton—I had felt ill for about a week before—I had had bread and cheese for supper at my friend's at Hoxton, and a glass of porter, and after supper a small glass of brandy and water; only once filled—I was sober when I left my friend's house—I took nothing on my way—I do not know whether it is usual for a man who is ill to sit down on a door step, and not call a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, perhaps you would have done so—when these men came to me I had not my head bent down, it was resting on my hand—before the men came close to me, I had observed that there were two men coming towards me, and one person following me—I had not seen them before I sat down on the step—I raised my head up in haste when these men came towards me—I had not some impression that they were acting as friends, I was rather suspicious—the place where I was sitting is lighted as the ordinary streets are lighted—the prisoner was on my left side, and I had a half crown piece in that pocket—after they had rifled my pockets, they all ran away—I had not seen the policeman before they commenced running.</p>

I was on duty in the Commercial-road East, just opposite Sutton-street—between 11 and 12 o'clock I saw three men in Sutton-street, walking together up towards the Commercial-road—I then saw the prosecutor sitting down on a step in Sutton-street—I saw two of the men go to him—the prisoner took his left arm, the other man took his right arm, and the third man went and put his arm round his neck, and drew him back—I saw the two that raised the gentleman off the step, fumbling at his waistcoat—they both did that, the man that had his left arm and the other—I ran down and directly two of them ran down Sutton-street, and the prisoner ran towards the Commercial-road—I took him directly in the Commercial-road—I pursued him nine or ten yards—I did not lose sight of him—I said to him, "What have you been up to?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "You must consider you are in my custody"—I held him till the prosecutor came up—he was a few yards away—when he came up he could hardly speak—he told me he had been robbed and gagged by the throat—he said he would give the prisoner into custody—the prisoner did not say anything then—at the station he said he was innocent—I found on him a sixpence, four halfpence in copper, and a book.</p>

            . I am a stationer, and live in Crawford-street, Marylebone. On the 11th of July, about two o'clock in the morning, I was in my parlour at dinner, and saw the prisoner on the roof of <placeName id="t18220911-180-crimeloc947">No. 32, Gloster-place</placeName>

I immediately went to No. 33, to inform Braham - he was not at home; I returned home, and in twenty minutes he came, and I told him - and the servant went on the roof.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. What distance was you from the house - A. Between fifty and sixty yards. I positively swear to him by his dress and features.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There were other persons employed on the premises - A. Yes. I did not charge him with it; he had a short jacket and red handkerchief on. I never saw him before. I was about sixty yards off - my window was shut at first, but I pulled it down. I did not see him pull the lead up - but saw him knocking it up on the roof of No. 30, on the party-wall.</p>

I went to work at No. 30, and left at twelve o'clock, I returned at one, and at a quarter to three I saw Cresswell and the constable come on the roof - they said they wanted a short person; they went down again, and were gone about twenty minutes; and when the rain was over, I went on the roof. Cresswell and the officer came and asked me to come down - I went down - they said,</p>
               <p>"If you will go into the room with the carpenters, we will pick out the man we want." I went round to Cresswell's house with the officers, and the officers said to Cresswell's brother,</p>

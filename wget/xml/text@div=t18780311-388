                  </hi>. I am 14 years old and live at 12, Orb Street, Walworth—on Monday, 18th February, I was standing at the corner of Orb Street and Bedford Street, and saw a Hansom cab coming from Bedford Street towards Orb Street, going into the Rodney Road—it was on the left side of Bedford Street; I was standing at the other corner—I saw some little children there, they had just come out of school, and had been hunting Mr. Bye's chickens—Mrs. Draper tapped at her window to tell them to leave off, and they left off, and went in front of Mr. Bye's shop, on the pavement—the little boy Bollard was about 2 feet from the kerb stone, on the pavement; he was four or five years old—I saw the cab come up, and the chest of the horse knocked him over and the left wheel went over his back—Mrs. Draper said "Stop that cabman, he has run over the child"—he drove on—Mr. Matthews told him to stop, but he would not till he got to the City of Salisbury—I took his number—the little boy got up and walked to a window and fell down, and Mr. Matthews picked him up and took him up to the cabman to show him; he did not seem to take any notice, he turned red in the face—he did not say anything that I heard—the kerb is worn out at the corner, and the horse, in turning the corner sharp, had one foot on the pavement—the horse and the wheel of the cab were both on the footpath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The children had ceased from driving the chickens for about two or three minutes, and stood laughing in front of Mr. Bye's shop—the deceased was on the pavement, his feet were nearly touching the beginning of the kerb.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Draper, of No. 1, Bedford Street, Walworth, which is near the corner of Orb Street—I was sitting at mv window on the first floor on this afternoon, which commands a view of the corner of Orb Street and Mr. Bye's shop—I saw three children at Mr. Bye's corner; they had been in the road driving the chickens; I tapped at the window for them to get out of the road, and they ceased and went and stood on the pavement—the deceased stood with his back towards the road, and the cab drove round the corner and knocked him down and ran over his back—it was not going particularly quick, just a run.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was examined before the Coroner—the deceased boy was standing about a foot and a half on the pavement, where the wheel</p>

               <p>came—I was looking through the window, it was down—the boy was on the pavement, not on the kerb stone—Mr. Matthews was in the street, and he took the boy in his arms first to the City of Salisbury and then to the doctor's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Groves—I was sitting at the window with the last witness—the three children were on the pavement—the boy was about a foot from the kerb on the pavement—I saw the cab come down Bedford Street, knock the little boy down and run over him—the wheel of the cab went on the pavement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. As I was looking from the window, the cab was between me and the child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer in Walworth—I was standing at the corner of Bedford Street and Orb Street, and noticed the deceased standing at the opposite corner about 4 inches from the gutter, on the kerb—I saw the cab coming down the street, and in turning the corner it struck against the kerb, which rather swayed him round and took a little graze off the kerb; the step of the cab caught the boy and knocked him into the gutter on his right side—the cab was not on the pavement—I ran across the road and picked the boy out of the gutter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. This corner seems a very dangerous one to drive round, anybody going round it touches the corner of the kerb, which is very low; the wheel of the cab skidded as it came round—when I told the prisoner that he had run over the boy, he said "Eh," and looked very red, and more like a madman, he was so frightened—I took the boy to the hospital—the kerb is about 2 inches above the road; it has been worn down—the boy was on the kerb—if the cab had not driven against the kerb the accident would not have happened.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. It is a very dangerous corner to drive round, the street is so narrow; there was formerly a post there—Bedford Street is about 18 feet wide, and Orb Street about 17 feet.</p>

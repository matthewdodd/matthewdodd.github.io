On Wednesday, the 8th of this month, between four and five, the prisoners were at my shop: I was waiting on two ladies near the door; my shop-woman came and said, she suspected the two women had stole something; I was about ten yards from them: the shopwoman was coming towards me, past them; and one of them asked her to shew them some muslin; she then came and told me what she suspected; I waited on the ladies about ten minutes; after that

             came to that part where I was, as if going out of the shop; she stopped opposite me, and looked hard at me, and came close to the counter, and laid hold of a piece of flannel, and asked me the price of it; I said fifteen-pence halfpenny; she said, cannot you take fifteen-pence? I said, no; she stood about two minutes, and then she walked sharply out of the shop; one of the ladies said the woman had something concealed; I followed her immediately: Kelly was at the further end of the shop then; but she got away while I was pursuing Smith; I overtook Smith about fifty yards from my door; I took her by the hand: she had no cloak on: one piece of the cotton dropped from under her coats; I took it up: it was not in paper: I am certain it is mine; it corresponds with a piece that I had cut off: there is a number on this, and the other piece has the progressive number.</p>

               <p>Where did this lay in the shop? - In that part where the prisoners were: here is another piece that dropped from her: I took her into the shop, but did not search her: Kelly was then gone; she was never searched at all.</p>
               <p>Did they both come in together? - I never could learn that: I do not know how long they had been there: the goods cost me about four pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You say there were a number of people in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could any body take any thing without being seen while there were a number of people in the shop? - I think they might; such things have been done.</p>
               <p>Was not Smith intoxicated? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Kelly called six witnesses, who gave her a very good character, and had several others ready to give her a character.</p>

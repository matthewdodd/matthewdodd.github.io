               <p>Q. Did he attempt to run away? - No, he never attempted to get away; when the watchman came down he had got me fast by the collar, and the watchman he parted him from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the watchman take Leeson into custody? - No, not that watchman, he let him go, and I followed him under the Piazzas of Covent Garden, and I charged him with the two watchmen that he was talking with; and they said they were not watchmen; and I said, then if they were not watchmen they were patrols; they said they were not; and there came by another gentleman, and I told him of it, and he said they had a right to take him to the watch-house; and they said no, they should not, they should take him along with them, because he was a friend of theirs; and then the watchmen they guarded him away towards St. Giles's; they would not take him, nor would let any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that other person attempt to take him? - Yes; but the watchmen would not let any body take him; they took him away along with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of Leeson after that? - I don't know what became of him till the officer of Bow-street took him; they found him with the pistol in his pocket, drinking with the two watchmen that were with him; I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Leeson next after that? - Not till he was before the justice; that was the Monday morning following.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you break up at dinner? - I suppose it might be half past eleven, or near twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been from that time till two o'clock? - It is a good way from Peckham Rye to Drury-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you walked in the common straight road to this place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you was three hours coming straight to this place? Where do you live? - In James's-street, Oxford-road.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the first time the watchman came up, you did not complain of any robbery at all? - I had not time, and he went to take the other men that went off.</p>
               <p>Q. First of all before the watchman came, the prisoner and his companions took this money from you? - They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you might have told the watchman that they robbed you? - I did not know then that I was robbed, I did charge him with the robbery as quick as I could.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman belonging to St. Martin's in the Fields; I had been the half hour after two, round my beat. I am a watchman in Russel-street, facing the Play-house; it was the 29th of June, I was coming down the court, that is called Crown-court, I hears a great noise, I hastened into Russel-street, to know what was the matter; when I came there, there were five or six men, I did not count them, and they were making a noise, and they were crossing each other, some on one side of the street and some on the other, as if they were at a game of play, and they were taking off one anothers hats, with a cuff first from one, and then to another, then I went up to them, and requested that they would not be so disturbing; I had no sooner spoke the word, but one of the companions came to me immediately, and laid hold of my stick, with whom I had a great struggle, but he did not get it from me, and I had like to have been down once or twice, but I held hold fast of the stick, the other man fell down on his bottom in pulling, and he would not loose the stick, and by pulling I pulled him up again from the stones, and when he was up he took to his heels and run, then I had a hand loose to take and spring the rattle, which I did, and followed him; I left the others all along with the prosecutor in the street, while I pursued this that had got hold of my stick.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear any body call out for your assistance? - I did not hear any body; the man that had hold of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160011"></xptr>stick, he ran past one of our watchmen at the corner, and I left off the chase, and came back again to the spot where this piece of business was; when I came back the prisoner at the bar had got hold of the prosecutor by the collar, challenging him with being a recruit, and a deserter, from which the prosecutor cried out aloud, and said, watchman, I am not a recruit nor a deserter, I have been ill treated by this man; says I to the prosecutor, are you sure that you are right? I am, says he, I am neither a recruit nor a deserter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other man about? - No, I see nothing of the kind.</p>

            When did the other men go away? - They dispersed at the spring of my rattle, some one way and some another; I stepped up to the sergeant, and says to him, loose your hold, and let the man go, what business have you with the man; I made him loose his hold; now, my man, says I, do you make the best of your way home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner appear in liquor at that time? - I cannot say that I see him any was disguised. The prosecutor then went towards Covent-garden, then I was left in Russel-street alone, no man there besides myself; in about five or ten minutes the prosecutor came to me, and told me that he was robbed by them men? robbed, says I, why had not you said so sooner, I would then have taken some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any reason why he did not say so sooner? - He did not give any answer to that, he asked me if I knew any of them? I told him I did not, they were all strangers to me, the same as he was, but I believed the sergeant, whom I took from his collar, belonged to Captain

               <p>Q. How long time had elapsed from the first time you came down to these people? - It might be five or ten minutes. So I refusing to go with him into Covent-garden, he goes by himself under the Piazzas of Covent-garden; he came back again to me, and told me that he had seen the prisoner at the bar under the piazzas of Covent-garden, but I did not go with him.</p>

If the man had made any charge against the sergeant for an Highway robbery, you would have taken him and done your duty? - Certainly I should; he did not say any thing to me about a robbery till he had left the street and come back again, about five or ten minutes after.</p>

            How long do you think you was settling that business, whether he was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160012"></xptr>deserted recruit or not? - A very short time that was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now from the time that you was in view of all the parties when they were at play together with the hats and so on, and when you parted the prosecutor and this man how long might it be? - That was at the last of all, there was none other then left but the sergeant and the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the sergeant attempt to run away when you parted them? - No, I pushed the prosecutor one way and the sergeant another, and they both went on slowly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not think the prosecutor was in liquor? - He must have been a drinking, but he did not seem to me to be drunk, he could talk and walk very well.</p>
               <p>Q. You never suspected that any highway robbery had taken place till this man came back? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you first came up the prosecutor was one of that number? - He was one among them.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not hear watchman called? - I did not, but hearing a noise I went down the court to see what was the matter.</p>

On the 29th of last month, the prosecutor came and informed me in the morning, about four o'clock, that he had been robbed; I was in Bow-street, walking along by the door of the Brown Bear public house; I had two prisoners in charge there; he informed me that he had been robbed of half a guinea, two half crowns, and four shillings and six-pence in silver, by the prisoner at the bar, and three more men; he described the prisoner, and I went round Covent Garden to see if I could find him, and I found him in a public house with his head on a table asleep; I came back again and sent for Mr. Miller, another officer; and we both went and took him into custody, and brought him to the

               <p>Q. Do these recruiting sergeants ever go armed in that way? - Not to my knowledge; he had his sword and sword belt on, which I took from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This public house where you found the sergeant, was the house where the recruiting business was done? - No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from it? - This was in Tavistock-row, one side of Covent Garden, the sign of the Queen's Head.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You knew that he belonged to captain Leeson's recruiting party? - Yes, he is a sergeant there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been along with my recruiting party for a good part of the night, and we had got three recruits, and my officer told me I must go down to Chatham with some recruits, and carry this pistol in my pocket. I was in the street coming along, and this prosecutor came and asked me if I would sight? I told him that I thought that I knew his face, that he belonged to our regiment, and the watchman came up while I was looking at him, and told me to quit him, and I came up to one of our houses in Covent Garden, and stopped there, and two gentlemen came from Bow-street, and took me into possession, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160013"></xptr>prosecutor charged me with the robbery.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he at that time, the 29th of June, in want of money? - He never was, he always had money when he wanted it.</p>
               <p>Q. It is customary for persons in his department, to have pistols in his pocket or not? - Whenever I sent him with any recruits to Chatham, I always gave him a pistol not loaded, to accompany them.</p>

               <p>Q. How far did you accompany them? - I had them in fight about twenty or thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they quarrel together? - For about three quarters of an hour in the whole.</p>

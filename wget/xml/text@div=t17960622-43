               <p>The prisoner came into the sugar-house of Messrs. Pyecroft and Ward, on a Saturday, about a fortnight ago, between nine and ten o'clock, he went up to the sugar, and took a handful of sugar, and looked at it, and threw it down; he went round the sugar-house, and looked if any body was there; when he saw nobody in the sugar-house, he went up to the sugar and filled his hat with it, and drawed the lining over it, then he put the hat upon his head; I had suspected the prisoner, and had concealed myself; I then came out, and asked the prisoner what he had been doing there, he then came running up to me, and asked to shake hands with me, and I refused, and then he ran away with the sugar and the hat into a dark place in the sugar-house, and threw the sugar out of the hat upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner employed in the sugar-house? - A. Yes; he brought a couple of hoops and heads to head up a hogshead, he is a cooper's labourer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the sugar lie before he took it? - A. Upon the floor in a corner.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man when he had thrown the sugar down? - A. He ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. Do you know how long he had been employed as a cooper in that warehouse? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual for persons employed as he was, to get the scrapings of the sugar that are generally thrown away in a corner? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him whether the man did take any sugar, or whether he only looked at it, laid it down again, and went away? - A. The first time, when he took out the handful, he threw that down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner take any sugar away? - A. Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220065"></xptr>Q. What time was it? - A. Between nine and ten in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether there were not a great many other men working in the same room? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner run away? - A. No; I put it into a paper, and gave it to Mr. John Pyecroft.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. Whether it was not a very dark place, and impossible for any one to see it thrown there? - A. It was dark there; but if any body else had come there, they might have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was not necessary to see the person who had thrown it there, to be very close to it? - A. Yes, it was.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I was sent for by the prisoner's master, to a cooperage, in Petticoat-lane; I took charge of the prisoner, and took him to Lambeth-street Office; in going across Whitechapel with the prisoner, I asked the prisoner what his master charged him with, he said, he charged him with taking a handful of sugar from the sugar-house, where he went to put some hoops upon the cask, and what he intended to do with the sugar, was to put it in a pudding the next morning, which was Sunday; I took him before the Magistrate, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Pyecroft). What do you call that sugar? - A. It is what we call headings, it is manufactured sugar, but not in a finished state.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of it? - A. About 3s. I should suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the washings or scrapings of the sugar? - A. No; it is the wet part of the sugar, when it is taken out of the moulds; this man has come to our house as a cooper's labourer very frequently, 4 or 5 times a day sometimes, to bring hogsheads.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the Saturday morning, I pulled off my hat, while I went into the hoop warehouse, and when I came back, I found the sugar in my hat, which I turned out immediately, and then I was accused of the robbery.(The prisoner called

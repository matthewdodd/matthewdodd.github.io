                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. George Smeed, of the Strand Wharf—he has premises in Belvidere-road, Lambeth—I was examined before the Magistrate on the 3d of February—about two months before that I had missed a leather water hose from Mr. Smeed's premises—I had seen it safe about three months before—it was then in a tool room hanging on a nail—it was locked up at night but was open in the day—this is it—I am quite sure it is my master's.</p>

In consequence of information, I went on the 26th of January to the prisoner's house, I searched it, and amongst other things I found this water hose—another constable went and brought the prisoner home—I asked him if he could give me any informa<lb></lb>tion of how he became possessed of the water hose; he said he bought it of a man and gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I asked him if he knew the man, he said he did not, nor where he lived—I told him he must give a more satisfactory account—I took him to the station, he there said he bought it of a person of the name of George and gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it.</p>

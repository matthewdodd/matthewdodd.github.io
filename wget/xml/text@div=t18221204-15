I sent Hunt, the post boy up stairs - I followed him soon after, and found he had hold of the prisoner. My door leading from the house to the stable is generally open. I found some things on the floor, and two blankets on the bed. She said she was going by the gateway, and asked the post boy the way to Knight Rider-street; that he said he would shew her the way, and took her up into the room - but finding her an old woman would have nothing to say to her.</p>

            . I am a post boy to Mr. Thompson, I was with my master in the counting-house, and the servant said she heard somebody up stairs. I went up to my master's bed-room on the first floor, and found the prisoner there. I never saw her before. The bed clothes were off the bed, and she was tying them up, she had the blanket, sheet, and counterpane. I held her till my master came up. I took a light up with me, which she put out.</p>

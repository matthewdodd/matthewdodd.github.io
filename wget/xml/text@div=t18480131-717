                  </hi>. I am butler to Mrs. Dickenson, of Plumstead, in Kent. I had sixty-five sovereigns safe on 4th Jan., about eight or nine o'clock in the evening, in a box in a closet in my room—I missed it about nine next night—I had been out nearly all day—the prisoner was page in the family—he would have to go into that room to dress—he left about seven that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Russell-court, Drury-lane. About nine o'clock in the morning, on 6th Jan., the prisoner came to my house to buy a pair of Wellington boots—Josiah Pratt was staying at my house, he is about seventeen or eighteen years old—he had been there about four weeks, till his father came from Northampton, to ge him a place—he was out the evening before with the prisoner, and when I was shutting up my shop, I went and called Pratt—he did not come in then, he did afterwards, and said he would go and have a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi>—he went, and I did not see him till the following morning, when he came in with the prisoner, who bought the boots—he gave me a sovereign to pay for them, and he and Pratt went away together—Pratt</p>

               <p>came home on the Sunday evening following, differently attired, which excited my suspicion—on the following morning I went to the station, got the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>, and there saw the particulars of this robbery—I went home—Pratt went out about eleven—I followed him, he met the prisoner, and went into a public-house—I got a policeman, and took him to the house—I said the prisoner had robbed a butler—the prisoner said he was guilty, and the other was as bad as he was.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, G</hi> 233.) I was on duty, in Finsbury<lb></lb>square. Mr. Allwright took me to a public-house in Whitecross-place, where I found the prisoner—two other lads came out at the time—Allwright saw them—he did not tell me to stop either of them—I took the prisoner to the station, and told him he was charged with stealing 159<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes and gold—he said he never saw any notes; that he had 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was all there was in the box; that the other lad had got part of the money, and some clothes—I found on him twenty sovereigns, a watch, ca chain, a guard, a ring, a purse, a suit of clothes, and this stick.</p>

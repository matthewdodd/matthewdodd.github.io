                  </hi>. I assist my father, Joseph Muller, a curiosity-dealer. On 26th Sept. I was in the kitchen under our shop—I could see person who entered the shop—I saw the prisoner come in—I ran up, and missed him, went out, and saw him in the next street—I overtook him—he threw one of these ornaments down, and ran away—I called, "Stop thief! Police!"—a policeman took him—I picked up one ornament, another person brought the others—they are my father's.</p>

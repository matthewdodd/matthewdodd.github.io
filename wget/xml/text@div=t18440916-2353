                  </hi>. I am a grocer and general dealer, and live at Waltham<lb></lb>stow. I am building a house there—on the 23rd of Aug. I engaged the pri<lb></lb>soner and another man to saw some timber for me in Marsh-street, Waltham<lb></lb>stow, about a quarter of a mile from where I live—I set them to work on Friday the 23rd, and paid them 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I did not go to look at their work at all—they finished on the Saturday night, and came to me, and I paid them—I went on the Monday to see what work was done, and I missed some of the timber—I knew there was a considerable portion of the timber not there which ought to have been there—there was no part of the outside of the timber there—they were trees that they had to saw—I received information, and went to the Cock public-house, kept by Joseph Hicks—I went to the stable there, and found five slabs of timber, and the ends of two trees—I was quite certain they were my property—I had seen them a great many times—I had the trees cut down, and they laid on my ground about twelve months—that was a portion of the timber which the prisoner had to cut up—I gave information, and the prisoner was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Marsh-street. On the 24th of Aug. I saw the prisoner and another man sawing the wood up, and in the afternoon I saw them take some wood to Mr. Hicks' stable—I saw them go backwards and forwards to the sawpit, and take a bit of wood every time to Mr. Hicks' stable—it was outside planks which they carried—I cannot say how often they went—it was more than once or twice—some of the pieces were as much as the two men could lift, and some of them one man carried—I saw them both engaged in carrying the pieces, and the prisoner was one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the Cock public-house at Waltham<lb></lb>stow. I know the prisoner—on Friday, the 23rd of Aug., I saw him and another man—they took their meals at my house that day, and I saw them sawing timber near my house—I cannot say whether it was the prisoner or the other man who spoke to me, but one of them, in the presence of the other, asked me if I wanted to buy some chips—I asked where they were, and whom they belonged to, and they said to themselves—I said I would go and look at them—I went into the yard and looked at them, and purchased them—they were chips, which are the refuse of the cuttings—on the Saturday they came again to my tap-room, and had three pots of beer, and said they had some more chips—I went out, and saw them cutting timber—I said, "These are the chips you mean?"—they said, "Yes"—I said they had had rather more beer than the chips were worth—(it is a natural conclusion that the chips are their perquisites)—there was a piece of elm timber lying by the side, and they said if I would give them another pot I should have that slab—I took my basket of chips in, and asked Hagger, who was standing by, to bring the slab into my stable, which he did—I went into my stable the next morning, and saw four other slabs beside the one I had bought of them, and two ends of trees, which I believe to be two elbows—the policeman took them.</p>

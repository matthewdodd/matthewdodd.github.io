               <p>On the 14th of June last, I was in Anchor and Hope-alley; I saw somebody come out of Mrs. Mouat's window; it was a young lad about sixteen or seventeen; I believe the watch had gone ten; I was standing at my own door, my house is next door; I laid hold of his coat, but he ran past me, I had not strength to hold him; I ran after him, and called stop thief; Mrs. Mouat called also; he was taken about twelve or fourteen doors from the place where I first-saw him; I never lost sight of him, I am sure of that, till he was taken; there was nobody in the street when he ran past me, and I saw nobody with him; I am quite sure that the person that was taken, was the person that I saw come out of the window; the prisoner was brought back to the prosecutor's house; I did not him searched; I never saw the boy before to my knowledge; I had an opportunity of seeing his face, for I was looking at the window when I saw him come out; I am sure it was him; it was not moonlight, but it was so light I could see him.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Mouat. I was present when he was searched; there was nothing found upon him, but as I called out stop thief, he called out Jem, and a man came up to him.</p>

               <p>I was standing at my own stall, and I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner coming by, and I took him; he was running as fast as he could; he tried to get away from me, and called out Jem, and there was a stoutish young fellow came up, and asked what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Did the stout young man that came up, come the same way the lad came? - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110018"></xptr>cannot say; then a few people came up, and the stout man went away; he might be a passenger; I took the prisoner to the next door, to a butcher's, and the prisoner was struggling and striving; I called my boy to help me, and about an hour and a half after I picked up a handkerchief, and gave it to Mrs. Mouat.</p>
               <p>(Deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It was not marked; my door was locked, I had the key in my pocket; it was a one pair of stairs; they are not very high houses; I do not know but the window might be left open, nor who might have gone in, but the watch was never found.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. The handkerchief is of small value; the watch cost five guineas, it has been in wear twelve years.</p>

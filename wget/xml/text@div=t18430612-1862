                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Kirk, and live in Bell street, Vin<lb></lb>cent-square, Westminster. Between five and six o'clock on the morning of the 10th of May, I was awoke—I got up, and looked into the wash-house, where I had left these articles safe between eleven and twelve—they were all gone—these are part of them—I had them to wash—I will swear to them—</p>

               <p>the wash-house was latched—any one, by just opening the door, could get in, by getting over the garden wall—the foot-marks in the garden correspond with the shoes that were fitted to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Matthews. On the morning of the 10th I was awoke by the dog barking—I got up and stood at the window some time—I saw the dog move, and went and found a bundle of wet things in the garden a short distance from the prosecutor's.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 80.) About three o'clock on this morning I was in Bell-street, and saw the prisoners coming out of Garden-place at the back of Kirk's premises—Matthews called me, and said she had found a bun<lb></lb>dle of wet linen in the garden—I took it—she afterwards told me there was a second bundle—I took that—about twenty minutes before six o'clock I saw Phillips come and attempt to go up the garden—I went to take her, and she ran off—I took her—Kerchevall was waiting at a distance—he ran away—I told Butler, and he took him about six o'clock—I took Kerchevall's shoes to the back of the gardens, and there were distinct footmarks—I compared them with the shoes—they exactly correspond—I can swear they were exactly the same marks—I looked at the mark before I put the shoes in—they were very remarkable shoes, very much worn at the toes, and there were holes in the shoes and the mould exactly fitted—the prisoners came exactly from the spot where the property was found.</p>

I went with Hudson, and com<lb></lb>pared these shoes where the prisoner jumped over the wall to the garden—there there was soft mould there were distinct marks—both their shoes fitted exactly—they had holes in them, and the female's footmarks were a little dis<lb></lb>tance off, as if she stood to take the things just by the side of the wall, where he came over from the washhouse—I am sure of that.</p>

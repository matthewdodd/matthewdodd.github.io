There was a kind of twilight when this happened, and there were three lamps in the street, and it was just under one: I lost a hat, but I could not say who took it. There was a girl said she knew all their names; she gave us the names; but she gave them by the names that they went by, not the names they are now indicted by: I snatched at a hat, and tore out a lining: and I picked up this hatband and buckle.</p>

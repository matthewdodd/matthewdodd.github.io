               <p>JAMES PEARCY. On the 19th of September, I met the prisoner in Sun-court, about six o'clock in the morning - we went into a private house; we had been about the street all night, and never went into any room at all till the morning - we went to this room; she asked me to give her some gin - I gave her 1s., and she took my watch out of my jacket-pocket, which was by the side of me, and ran down stairs; I saw her take it, and I said "Don't break my watch;" she came up again, and I said "Where is my watch;" she denied that she had had it - I went for an officer, and while I was gone she brushed - I did not see her again till the next morning, when I got a man to take her.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and went to the house with the witness - I could not find the prisoner, but he described her, and stated verbatim almost as he has now; the prosecutor met her the next morning, and took her into a house, and sent a neighbour for me - I went and found her there with him; the moment I went into the room, he said "This woman robbed me of my watch in Sun-court yesterday morning; in going to the watch-house;" she met three very low looking characters, and said to one of them, "Tom, good bye, I am going for seven years," and the tears came into her eyes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was on the 18th he met me, and said he had come from my parents, and they were all well; he said he had but 10s., and he had spent it in drink - he met a young woman, and asked her for a bed; she said she had a room in Sun-court, and we went there, to a room on the first-floor - there was a man in bed there, and we went up to the other floor; he lay down on the bed with his clothes on; he sent the woman for 1s. worth of gin - I heard a person come in in; I went and said to the young woman, "Is that you come in;" a man there said "Yes, she and I have drank it;" the prosecutor then jumped off the bed, came down, and said I had got his watch; I said I had not seen it - he then said "Where is the young woman I sent for the gin?" and said to the man "Have you got it?" he said No; he then went out - I waited an hour and a half - he did not come; he had a pot of beer at a house the night before, and a quartern and a half of rum, at the White Hart public-house; when he asked about the watch I said"I have never been out of the house;" I undressed myself, and had nothing on me; he said he was fully convinced that I had not got it; he then went and got the officer.</p>
               <p>COURT to JAMES PEARCY. Q. Were you at any house the night before? A. I had a pot of beer at one house - I had no spirits; I was quite sober - there was no other woman in the house but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the officer came in, the prosecutor had had three pints of beer, and given 1s. to a young man to go for an officer - I said I was quite innocent, and would not move for it; the prosecutor took out some gold, and said "If you will tell me where the watch is, I will give you money to take it out, if you have pawned it."</p>
               <p>COURT to JAMES PEARCY. Q. Where did you find her? A. At her lodging the next morning - I had but 6s. 6d. the morning before, and had only 2s. left; I had neither gold nor silver.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 83, Sandwich Street, Burton Crescent—I am a widower and keep a lodging-house—Latham and a woman took my first-floor back, and the Corries the first-floor front—Latham told me he was working at Mr. Evestaffs ten years, and that Corrie had worked for him three years—on 15th September, about 3.30, I heard some one come in—I got up and called out "Who is there?"—Ellen Corrie said "It is me"—I got up and chained the door—at 6.45, I heard the bell ring, got up and saw Corrie and Latham at the door—I went to the door and found one of them had opened it with a key, but could not get it open for the chain—they were pushing in some pianoforte strings tied up in brown paper—one of them said "Open the door"—I opened it, and asked them what they meant by bringing work into my house on a Sunday morning, as my house was a respectable house, and I did not allow it—Latham said he was getting the work ready to take to the shop on Monday morning—they were both loaded with goods—they went up stairs and came down for a second lot—Latham went out with them in the evening—I knew him as Lester—I never saw him afterwards, he never came back—they had their meals together.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Frederick Corrie's Defence.</hi> On the Saturday night I met a man named Pearman, who I knew by drinking with him; he asked me where Latham lived. I told him. He asked me if he would buy anything, I said "I do not know." I went down to see whether he was in, to get my money. He said that his master had not paid him, and that he could not pay me, and I left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Latham's Defence.</hi> Corrie called at my father's place, and I told him I could not pay him. He said that he had met a man who was enquiring about me, who had some pianoforte work to sell. I slept at my father's with Corrie, as it was too late to go home. We went home on Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing for our dirty linen, and met a tall man with a bundle under his arm, who asked me if he could leave the things there till Monday morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ellen Corrie's Defence.</hi> These prisoners asked me to take the articles to pledge.

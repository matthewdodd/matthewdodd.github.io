                  </hi>. In 1837 I was a farmer at Ruislip, and still. I had a boy named John Brill, in my service in 1837—on Thurs<lb></lb>day, the 16th of Feb., I went to Uxbridge market—I saw Brill before I went—I had a wood belonging to my farm, called the Young wood—it was in my occupation—about half-past nine o'clock in the morning I sent Brill with three cows into the meadow, with a bill and a glove to fill up the gaps in the meadow, in the path leading to my house, and then to go into the Young wood, to watch the wood, that the underwood should not be stolen—it had been cut a few days before—I told him to watch the wood till towards one o'clock—I told him if any one came to cut it, to let them cut it, and take what they thought proper, as long as he got near enough</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184502030050"></xptr>
               <p>to see who they were, for I thought it would not be a stranger—he dined at my house of a day at one o'clock—he was to go home to his dinner at one at my house—as I was going to market, in con<lb></lb>sequence of something I heard at the Six Bells, I went to the meadow to see after the boy—I found him at his work in the meadow where I had sent him, filling up the gaps—I should say that was about half-past ten in the morning—I never saw him after that alive—he was then in good health—he was fifteen years of age—I returned from market at three—I used to return at any time I could get my business settled—the boy ought to have been at my gate on my return to let me in—it was his habit to let me in—he was not at the gate—I thought it very strange that he was not there, and I directly went into the wood to search for him—I was alone then—I could not find him—there are four woods, the whole of them making 132 acres—three of them are about an equal size—one is a very small one, about six acres—there was a good deal of underwood in the wood—he was only to watch the Young wood—it is standing, growing wood—I could not find anything of him on the Thursday, and came home—I directly went to his father, who came directly, and he, and me, and another man, went into the wood to search for him again—we continued searching the wood till between nine and ten—it had been dark a long time then—we searched for hours after dark, but could not find him—we searched again on Friday morning as soon as it grew light, but did not find him—there was no search on the Saturday—I proceeded to search again on the Sunday—I cannot tell the names of the persons who were with me—Lavender was one of them, and the boy's father—we began to search at half-past eleven—we had not been search<lb></lb>ing more than half an hour when Lavender cried out, "Murder here!"—I went to the spot, and found the boy lying on his back in the wood—it was a very thick, high place, high standing wood—it was all leaves and moss where he laid—it was a soft place—he was dead—I saw that his front teeth were knocked out—the glove was lying at his feet, and the bill too—his cap hung on a bush close to him, about four feet from the ground—there was a bough hanging over his head, belonging to a small tree that stood at a distance from him, but the branch hung over him—the body of the tree, was, I should say, six feet from him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any recollection of the thickness of the bough, so as to form any judgment whether the boy might have fallen from it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would not bear him—it was about ten feet from the ground—the ground on which he lay was soft—Lavender lifted up the body—I saw the blood running from his ear—the boy was taken away to the Six Bells, on Ruislip-common—I went into the wood again about ten on Monday morning—I saw there had been some underwood cut in the wood, between twenty and thirty yards from where I found the body.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose the boy had been on the branch of a tree, about ten feet from the ground, and had fallen from it on to the ground, where there were leaves and moss, in your judgment, would such an appearance as you saw have been the result? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say, decidedly not—I was not examined before the coroner—Mr. Patten was—I was pre<lb></lb>sent—there were marks of more than one blow, but of the same description, as if made with a flat instrument—two blows might have produced</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184502030054"></xptr>
               <p>the external appearances—one severe blow might account for the internal appearances—I can hardly recollect a bill being produced to Mr. Patten before the coroner—I think there was one, but I cannot say—I know what a bill is with which hedges are cut and trimmed—the flat side of a bill used with violence would certainly be calculated to produce such appearance! as I saw—I did not go to the spot where the body was found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Then you have never seen the ground at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not speak with certainty as to the weapon which produced the injuries, I only say it must have been a weapon with a flat surface—the bruise extended over the left temple, and the whole of the left ear—I cannot state its circumference—perhaps four or five inches—it extended over the entire ear—the weapon must have been applied sideways.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a portion of the ground to have been bare, instead of having moss and leaves on it, and, as we have been told by one of the witnesses, it was a very fine dry day, in your opinion might not a very violent fall from the tree above have produced the appearances you saw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not, from the position of the blow—if he had fallen from a tree, he would have fallen on the top of his head—there is every probability of it—the gentleman who took the principal part in this examination was my junior, he was not my assistant—he did take the principal part in the examination, and was the person who was examined on the former occasion—I heard him examined—I did not hear him state a very different opinion to mine—I heard him state that either a blow or fall would have produced the same consequences, as to the internal portions—I did not hear him say that, in bis opinion, the blow was caused by a stick—to the best of my recollection, his evidence was, that it was done by a flat instrument—I do not deny that it might have been a stick—I say it was a flat instrument—a fall would not have produced the external appearances, and, to have produced internal symptoms of that sort, he must have fallen on the top of his head, and on hard ground, not on soft ground—it gene<lb></lb>rally happens that when we find much extravasation or congestion on one side of the brain, that it is the result of a violent blow on the other side of the head—I found that the extravasation and congestion were principally on the right side of the head—I should certainly not have expected to find that the case if he had fallen on the top of his head.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, if this blow had been inflicted with a stick of any kind, must it have been a slick with a flat surface? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I should say it would be impossible for a fall on the ground, which has been described, to have produced what I saw.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the fall to have been from a branch, ten feet, above the ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it possible—I have no recollection of any appearance of bruises on any other part of his person, except on the head, which I have described—I came in just as Mr. Patten was commencing the operation on the head—my examination was confined to the head.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner.</hi>) I am twenty-six years old. I know the prisoner, and have done so rather better than twelve months—during that time I have not been living with him anywhere—I have been living at Harefield—he lived at Harefield also, 300 or 400 yards from me—I have come to-day from the House of Correction—I have been intimate with the prisoner at times during the last twelve months—I was out with him about four months ago—we were on the hide and seek, because we would not come to the House of Correction—we had done a deed we should not have done—we had been out poaching together, and were at hide and seek to avoid the officers—about a fortnight before I was taken to prison we were coming from Rickmansworth to Harefield, about five or six o'clock in the afternoon—we were talking about how soon we could get into trouble, but we could not get out of it again very soon—I said, "No, we cannot"—he said, "I have heard that the House of Correction is a bad prison; you have been, how is it?"—I said, "Of course it is bad enough"—he said, "I would sooner be taken for my murder than I would go there"—Murder!" I said—"Yes," he said;" I went to get a bundle of wood in Mr. Churchill's wood, and a boy came round the wood, by the name of John Brill, and he saw me, and he came up to me, and I took and struck him and knocked him down; so I stood a few minutes, and I hung his cap up in the bushes, and his bill and his cuff I <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> down aside of him, making believe as if he had tumbled out of a tree—now," he lays, "there is no one knows of it but you and me, and if I happen to hear that you tell any one, I will kill you"—we were walking along the road together at the time—I was taken up, I believe, about seven or eight weeks after this conversation, but I cannot rightly say—I have been in prison ten weeks—the prisoner and I were not living together all that time—I did not go to Harefield—he did—I stopped by Woodcock-hill—I left him by Woodcock-hill—I was taken to prison for the poaching—he was taken before me—I mentioned about this, about three weeks after I got to prison—I made a communication to the yardsman or turnkey—I was in the House of Correction, Coldbath-fields—the prisoner and I were confined in the same ward—I never had any quarrel or difference with the prisoner—I cannot recollect the name of the wardsman—Mr. Hoare was one that I spoke to—he is the head wardsman—the yardsman told some-body, and then I repeated it—I told some of it that night, and next morn<lb></lb>ing I told all of it—I was examined by a Magistrate in the gaol next morning—I remember being brought face to face with the prisoner—that might be a month after I first communicated it to the wardsman—I was afraid to mention it before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then if you were afraid of mentioning it before, how came you to mention it when you got into prison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why I thought as we were both in there together, if I told them, that somebody would get hold of him, as I should not be hurt—there was another reason why I then mentioned it—I had such dreams, and could not sleep.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by your not being hurt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why I was in danger of my life when I was out, from the prisoner, and I thought when he was in confinement I could tell it, and yet not be hurt.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184502030056"></xptr>
               <p>my lifetime—Harcfield is two miles, or two miles and a half from the wood where the boy met his death—I knew John Brill, and I know Mr. Churchill—I am married, and have been so six years—I have lived with my wife during the whole of that time—I have been four times in gaol—I had two calendar months at St. Alban's for fishing, and three weeks twice, for fishing, and six months for poaching—I have not been taken before a Magistrate on other charges—I have never been before a Magis<lb></lb>trate but on those four occasions—yes, I was once had up for half a sor<lb></lb>reign, but nobody appeared against me—a man named George Tebbald <hi rend="italic">lost a half-sovereign, and charged me with stealing it at a public-house</hi>, and after that he had it cried—I was not before a Magistrate any othet time, I am quite sure—that is all—I do not know what my wife did for a living while I was in gaol—I do not know that when I was out of gaol she was leading the life of a common prostitute—she has not, over and over again, told me that I lived on her prostitution—I got my living by hard work—I was not at work all the year round—I was out of work sometimes a month, sometimes a week, or a fortnight, and sometimes two months—I have been as much as three months at a time out of work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you live on during that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, I went to my father and mother—I did not live all upon them; I supported myself by jobbing about, doing little jobs, digging gardens up, and doing work for the people about the town and other places, for my father for one—he is a labouring man—he gets 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he is a farmer's labourer—I do not say he has 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. all the year round—I think he gets 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the winter—he has eight children at home—the youngest is five or six years old.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And do you mean to say that your father, with that family, and getting 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, supported you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not entirely; sometimes I went to him and had a breakfast, and the rest of the day I went about to other places—I went poaching sometimes; I very seldom went fishing—they found me out most of the times that I went fishing—I poached game—I remember sending for Mr. Hoare on a Sunday—I said to him, "If I had my liberty I could tell of a murder"—Mr. Hoare asked me if there had been any reward offered—I said there had—I had heard of a reward of 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. two or three years ago—Mr. Hoare told me that what I said was not sufficient evidence against the prisoner—that was on the Sunday afternoon—I had then told part of what I have told to-day—I then said I could tell more if I had my liberty—I do not know how many different rewards were offered, to make up the sum of 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I heard there was 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward—I told some of my story on the Sunday, and the rest I told next morning to the head gentleman of the prison—the prisoner was in the prison some time before me—I had had some of the dreams that disturbed me before I went into prison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, if you had those dreams before you went to prison, and knew that the prisoner was in prison, and could not hurt you, why did not you tell your story then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, I thought that he had told some one out, whilst he was in prison, and if I told whilst he was in prison, they would get hold of me, and hurt me for telling.</p>

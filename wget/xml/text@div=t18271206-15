            . I am a butcher. On the 18th of July I was in Charles-street, St. George's, (which is a little way from the Jolly Sailors), about one, or it might be two o'clock - I passed the Jolly Sailors, and saw Watson, whom I knew, holding a bay, or a brown horse there - I went to buy some wood for a pig-stye - I came up Charles-street, back again, and saw a horse, and a person on it, about twenty yards off - I was told his name was Dean - I think it was the prisoner; he looks to me to be the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Dean before? A. Yes; the prisoner is the person; when first I saw the horse, it was about twenty yards from me, coming past me - I spoke to the person who was on it, and I took him to be this Dean - I said, "There you are, Thomas," or something of that; he looked back, and said, "There you are, Charley," or something of that; he rode away towards Chapman-street, and I came on; he was trotting; this was a few minutes after I had seen Watson holding the horse - I had seen Dean two or three times before, or it might be more, I cannot exactly say - I may have seen him several times - I have seen him in company with Watson - I cannot saw how many times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you recollect whether you have seen him more than once with Watson? A. I have - I cannot tell when - I cannot say how long I have known Dean; it is a good while ago.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you remember being examined here on a former trial? A. Yes; the prisoner is the person I saw on the horse in Charles-street - I know he was acquainted with Watson - I have seen them together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What are you? A. A journeyman butcher. I know it was the 18th of July, for I was at the dock on the 16th and 17th - I believe it was about one or two o'clock. I know I had dined. I will not swear it was not three or four o'clock. Charles-street is not far from the Jolly Sailors public-house - it is the second coach turning on the right - it is not half a quarter of a mile. I was going to a shop in the back road, which is about thirty yards from Charles-street. I was a-head of the person on the horse at first, and he passed me. I turned down Martha-street, and he turned another way; he was in Charles-street, coming in a direction from the Jolly Sailors. I was returning with the wood. I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060014"></xptr>come by the Jolly Sailors in my way back, but did as I went - I was shifting my wood on my shoulder - the horse was trotting - it was walking at first; when I first saw it, it was about twenty yards from me - it went very slow, between a walk and a trot; while I was shifting the wood I saw the horse coming up, my back was towards him till he passed me, and he was then trotting fast - he passed me as I was going to turn the corner - it did not vanish in a minute. I said "There you are Thomas" - he said "There you are Charley." I cannot swear to what he said, but I understood it was that. I have not seen the prisoner since that till to-day - I am sure he is the person now I come to look at him - it was a long while ago, and I could not swear to him till I looked at him. I have since been living with my brother-in-law, as a butcher - I work as a butcher when I can get it to do.</p>
               <p>RICHARD PECK re-examined. Q. Where was it that you saw part of the horse in the dust? A. Close to the Jolly Sailors - he was cantering - that was immediately after I lost it, before he got into Charles-street. I do not know Charles-street, but I think I turned down two or three street before I saw it - the streets run in a crooked direction, and there was a great mob after the horse - the Jolly Sailors is in Back-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say, that as soon as you came out of the house you saw a dust, and part of the horse galloping off? A. I did not see it till I went down two or three streets. I went down several turnings, but being in a hurry, I could not tell whether it was two or three streets - the streets are very short there. I do not know the name of any of them. I saw a dust, and caught a glimpse of the horse.</p>

            . I live in Back-lane, Shadwell, and am an egg-merchant - I am in business with my mother. On the 18th of July I was standing at my door, which is three or four doors from the Jolly Sailors, on the same side of the way. I saw Mr. Peck ride down to the Jolly Sailors, and stop with a bay horse - he went into the house, leaving his horse at the door with a young man whom I saw here last Sessions - he was called Watson - he brought the horse opposite my mother's door; another young man came up - the one who was holding it said, "Get up;" he got up and rode up the street, opposite my mother's door, towards the Commercial-road; he afterwards made a tarning round, and went towards Charles-street. I cannot say whether the prisoner is the person. I did not notice him to know him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You stood at your mother's door? A. Yes - he turned round one street, and then I saw him no more. I do not mean that he turned back, but he passed two or three streets before he came to this turning - there is a street directly opposite my mother's door, and up that street are five or six streets crossways - I saw him pass two or three streets before he turned down one; that would lead towards the Commercial-road, and towards Charles-street.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at Brockhurst, within two miles of Gosport. I know Cutt's stables at Brockhurst. I went there in the month of August, about seven or eight o'clock in the morning - I do not recollect what I went there for; a man named Hitchcock came there about half an hour after I got there - he is not here to-day - I saw the prisoner there - I think he was there when I first went, but I am not curtain of that. I saw some horses there. Mr. Barber took a horse away with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in August, see the horse there, which Barber afterwards took away? A. Yes - I think it was the same, it was a bay horse - it was shown out for sale that morning, I do not recollect by whom. Cutts had two or three men there - the prisoner was there; the man called Cutts goes by the name of Brown; the prisoner was there looking after the horses the same as other men about the premises. I do not think Cutts was up when I first went there. Hitchcock asked some people in the yard about a horse, but I do not recollect which or whether the prisoner was by; one of the men said Hitchcock could not see the horse till Brown was up. I cannot say whether that was the prisoner. I have said I thought it was the prisoner who said so, but I cannot recollect which man said so. Cutts was called up - I cannot say who it was that called him up.</p>

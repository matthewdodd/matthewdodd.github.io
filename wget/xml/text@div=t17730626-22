On Friday morning the 30th of April, as I was coming to town from my country house, about six o'clock, I received information that my house was broke open and robbed; when I came to town I found my drawers in my bed chamber broke open, and my bed burnt down; that is the back chamber of the first floor; the wainscot was burnt through in several places; it had been on fire all round the room. I searched my drawers and missed the things mentioned in the indictment; several bank notes and a great deal of cash; I examined the window, in the chamber which looks into the back yard, and I saw no signs of a breaking in; there was no door or window with any marks of violence upon them; from which I concluded that it must be done by somebody that knew the house; I immediately suspected the prisoner; he served his time with me; he has been gone from me about two years; he was at my house a few days before, and I was informed he was drinking at a public house in the neighbourhood that morning at one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing lost out of any part of your house but your bed room?</p>
               <p>Langfer. No; the things were took out of the double chest of drawers; the key of the back door hangs in the workshop; the prisoner knew very well where the key was; he could easily get over to the work-shop and take the key, and let himself into the dwelling house. I have a dog, but he knew the dog, and the dog knew him I suppose better than he does know me. I enquired where he lodged, and after some difficulty I found that he lodged in Tripe yard, Petticoat-lane; I got a search warrant, and a warrant against his person, and went to his lodgings; that was the same morning about ten o'clock; I took with me, Mr. Hawkins, Mr. Jeffs the beadle, and Mr. Plant an officer; we found him at his lodgings; his wife was gone out; he was alone; I told him I had been robbed and suspected him; we searched, and the first thing I believe that we pulled out was a rusly black pocket book; in that I found a copy of a certificate that we have when we export goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it made out in your name?</p>
               <p>Langfer. No; it was made out in blank.</p>
               <p>Q. Such a one that any man must take out that exports goods?</p>
               <p>Langfer. Yes; I looked at it and saw wrote on it

            , April 29, 1773; which was the night my house was broke open; I asked him when he wrote his name upon it; he said a fortnight or above ago; I shewed it to Mr. Hawkins; I looked on the inside his pocket book; there was wrote the same; I asked him when he wrote that; he said at the same time as the other; I looked particularly at the certificate seeing that writing upon it; I asked him how he came by it; he said my son gave it him; I asked him if he had got any money; he said no; we searched further and found a new guinea upon him; I asked him how he came by that; he said he had sold some of his clothes for it; I told him he had no clothes to sell; he said it was for clothes he had bought; I asked him where; at last he said at Golden-square; I asked him when; he said last Monday; that there were two coats, two waistcoats, and a pair of breeches; that he gave 11 s. for them, but they did not fit him, and so he sold them again. He was taken before the justices at the Rotation at Whitechapel, and was upon these circumstances committed; it was upon Monday he was committed, and he was discharged the next Wednesday: in consequence of some intelligence I took the beadle, and the officer, and another gentleman with me, and went to search his house again; his wife said she had no money: the prisoner was not at home. Then that gentleman with me searched the chair, and found sixteen guineas tied up in a piece of linen rag, and stuffed in under the bottom of the rushes; I asked her where she got them; she said one Gibbons gave them to her; there was no such man as she described to be found; at last she said she received it as a pension. She had on a pair of new stays, a pair of new cotton stockings, and a new crimson sattin bonnet. The prisoner came home while we were searching the house; he had on a new pair of pumps and new stockings; we searched him and found very little upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him of the money in the chair?</p>
               <p>Langfer. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I do not remember that he made any answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you mentioned it to him?</p>

            . When I was a little at leisure, I began to examine my drawers narrowly, and I recollected perfectly that certificate that I found in the prisoner's pocket; I missed it from the drawers; there was such a one in some time before.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not say that certificate but such a one?</p>
               <p>Langfer. No; I lost a pocket book that I had thrown aside some time like that I found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it that you had thrown that pocket book aside?</p>
               <p>Langfer. It might lie there two or three years; I frequently saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you have worn it in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Langfer. Ten or a dozen years: he was then removed to Newgate; I w ent there to him; I told him I wanted the pocket book which I saw the first morning he was searched, and described it; he said he knew nothing of it; we searched him but could not find it; I asked him where the certificate was; he said he did not know; I asked him how long he had had it; he said near a year: my son has been dead about two years and a half. Upon the Wednesday he was committed, two or three men came to my house; one of them is Barue: he said if he was admitted an evidence, I should get every thing back again; some of the plate that was taken was brought me next day, tied up in a handkerchief, which was found in a neighbour's yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever traced any of the rest of the things?</p>
               <p>Langfer. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What recollection have you of the contents of this certificate? repeat the words.</p>
               <p>Langfer. These are to certify to the Honourable Commissioners of the Customs, that the duty of (blank) pound of candles are paid at this office.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this a blank certificate or filled up?</p>
               <p>Langfer. Blank, for the number of candles, the ship's name, and the captain's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your name in it?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I think it was, I will not be positive that my name was in it; I am positive I had that or such a one; it was my son's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear the certificate you found upon him had you son's hand writing in it?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I am positive it was his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose these blank tickets are printed?</p>
               <p>Langfer. No, we write them ourselves; I had that form from the office to write them down, not to give them trouble; my son copied the form in short hand, and afterwards wrote it out in long hand, and I kept it by me for a form.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at the time you saw the certificate upon the prisoner take notice it was of your son's hand writing?</p>
               <p>Langfer. Yes, I said so; and he said he had it from my son; as he said that, and I not knowing that I had lost one, I did not think of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it you should have stored up this blank certificate?</p>
               <p>Langfer. It was always a form I kept by me to make the entries by.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it that it did not immediately strike you, that this was your certificate lost out of your drawers?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I did not know it then, nor for some weeks, till I examined the drawers, and then I found it was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the loss might hurry you for a day or two; then as to this pocket book you say you had wore it ten or a dozen years, and then laid it by in the drawer, I should have thought that would have struck you directly?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I did not think of it; I was in search after things more valuable.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there in that pocket book, that upon recollection, you can swear to?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I scarce recollect any thing in it but the certificate and these remarkable dates in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a pocket book or a case?</p>
               <p>Langser. A case.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any papers in it?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your recollection can you venture to swear that that pocket book you found upon the prisoner the day you took him up was your pocket book?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I will not do that, but I believe it was; I did not take so much notice of the pocket book as the certificate. Barue came to me and said my notes were buried, and should he and rot if Solomons, the Jew, was not admitted an evidence, and since, he said if Williams was discharged the things would come into his hands, and I should have them again.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many of them certificates your son wrote?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I believe he did not write more than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177306260020"></xptr> one, and the copy he had was first taken at the office in short hand.</p>

               <p>Oliver. In brown clothes with brass buttons, and a white apron.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is your house to Mr. Langfer's?</p>
               <p>Oliver. About 60 yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he often come to your house?</p>
               <p>Oliver. Sometimes once a week; sometimes once a fortnight; I never saw him in my house twenty times, I suppose before in my life.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Langfer: I got done work that night about half after eleven; before I went to bed, I fastened the back door; it is a spring lock; I pulled it to, and it shut; I lay in the work shop, that is separate from the dwelling house; it is across the yard; the door of the work shop is facing the back door of the dwelling house, and the key of the back door of the dwelling house hung upon a nail in the workshop; the door of which is always left open; I went to bed a little before twelve o'clock, and was waked in the morning with the cry of fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the key was after the alarm of fire?</p>
               <p>Makin. I was so frightened I cannot tell whether I found this door open or not.</p>

               <p>I was at Mr. Oliver's that night; as soon as I left his house I went home; that was before one o'clock, my wife can prove that: as for the book I know nothing of it; I never had a black book about me; I know no more of the certificate than the child unborn; there was a piece of paper he found in another pocket book, he said it belonged to him; he had it a whole week; after I was cleared he said it was of no service to him, I might have it again; the money I know nothing about; I did not know my wife had any; she concealed it unknown to me.</p>

            . The prisoner came into my care when he was about six years old, I being executor to his father's will; he was with me till he was thirteen, he behaved remarkably well; I put him apprentice to Mr. Wall, a tallow-chandler in Lemon-street; he was there three years, when Mr. Wall failed, he was turned over for the remainder of his time to Mr. Langfer; I have heard since he came out of his apprentiship a good character of him from several masters he has worked with.</p>

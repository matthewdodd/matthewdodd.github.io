On the 18th of October last, I was alarmed about three in the morning; our bell rang, we lissened to know what was the meaning; I heard a person run up stairs. Mr. Reynoldson, that lodges in our house, call'd, and said, he believed there were thieves in the house; he came down into my chamber and took the keys, and went down stairs. I followed him immediately after;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070008"></xptr> my husband was ill in bed; and is so ill now he cannot attend the Court. When I came into the parlour, I found the flap of the cellar window was torn up, and a padlock torn from the cellar door, that opens into the street upon the cellar stairs; the door shuts on the flap, and was padlock'd on the inside. There is a window seat like in the parlour, which was a head-way front, the top of that was wrench'd off, and the top of it lay upon the ground; by that means a passage was opened into the parlour, close to the bureau where our goods were locked up: I locked them up myself, about eleven o'clock over night; I am always the last up, and know the cellar door and flap were safe at that time. The bureau is a bureau and book-case, but instead of books there are twenty-four drawers that hold our work: there is an iron bar that goes cross and fastens the two doors, and is padlocked. The padlock I found torn to pieces, and the bar torn off; the shutter taken down, and the flap of the bureau had the lock torn off, the keys were in there; by which they unlocked the top where the other drawers were; there was a lock to the top besides the bar; the middle drawer the lock was broke off. There were three locks of the buffet broke also, and a case of tea-spoons moved out and put into a chair; but we believe, by the alarm of the bell, the thief made off. The next day I observed there were some drops of wax in the bureau: the goods mentioned in the indictment were taken away; some we have found again, but not all, nor near all. I immediately had warnings dispersed about, from Goldsmiths hall, and went to Sir

I heard nothing of them till Mr. Wintle came to me, on the 21st of November, and told me, he believed he had some of my goods, he shewed them to us, and we owned them; he said, they were offered to him to sell, by one Mr. Davis in the Minories; Mr. Davis's son came with him: we asked him how he came by them: the son said, a gentleman, that his father knew very well, that his father had them of; and he was to call on his father about three o'clock; he had left them to see whether he liked them: Mr. Wintle, seeing Mr. Knight's seal, thought proper to stop them. There were fifteen pair of gold buttons, and seven pair of garnet ear-rings.

I went with three of his people; and a gentleman that lives behind the Change, that had been robbed, to search the prisoner's house, No. 5, in Swan-street, in the Minories: we found the prisoner's wife and her sister, and a nurse; at going in the nurse took down a watch that was hanging up, and clapped it into her pocket; one of Sir John's men insisted upon her pulling it out; and upon my examining it, I found a gold seal of mine hanging to it; we asked for the keys; we were answered, they had none. So Sir John's people broke the locks. In the bureau we found several of my rings, buckles, ear-rings, buttons, and several things of mine: some we found in a chest of drawers.</p>

               <p>A. Knight. I have been in the business near twenty years, and my husband has been very ill for twelve months: I have attended the business more than he laterly: and there are marks upon many of the things of my making; by which I know how to sell them, We found great many things at the prisoner's house besides mine, an iron crow, two chisels, a dark lanthorn, some wax lights, and a particular gimblet. We found a great quantity of silks, plate, china, and other things belonging to other people; we brought all to Sir

Then the prisoner was called in to be examined; he would make no other answer, but that he bought the things in the street, Sir John ordered him to Newgate; he returned back again, and wanted to be admitted an evidence; and said, he would make very great discoveries. Sir John said, he was an old offender, and would not admit him. (The padlock produced, broke.) Perhaps, when the iron tools come to be produced, very likely, the Court may judge who did the mischief.</p>

               <p>A. Knight. There were a pair of knee buckles, which were taken out of his knees.

               <p>Q. How do you know it was his wife?</p>
               <p>A. Knight. She told me she was; and that her certificate was in Sir John Fielding's hands, among the papers that were brought there. We asked her if she had any more rooms than that, she said no. But afterwards she said there were more.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of marks were on the buckles?</p>
               <p>A. Knight. The marks are scratched with a point of a file. (She takes up a buckle.) I have the fellow to this in my pocket. Please to examine this knee buckle; which is one I had out of the prisoner's breeches knee. You will find out felling mark, H. I. upon it. (The bench and jury examine and find it so.) Thus we mark all our goods that are large, so as to bear it; our papers are scratched in the same manner.</p>

About half an hour after three, thinking somebody was getting in backwards, I got up, opened my door, and rang the bell. No body coming, I went up and awakened one of Mr. Knight's apprentices. We both went down together, and opened the street door, and went into the street. There we found the cellar window open, upon which the apprentice put the flap of the window over it. We went in, and shut the door, and went down into the cellar, and from thence into the kitchen, and from thence into the parlour, where we found the seat of the window broke open. Mr. and Mrs. Knight heard us go down. She came down. We found the desk and book-case open, in the parlour; and the drawers open, and most of the things gone: upon which we went to the beaufet, and found that open. There were some little things lying in an easy-chair by it, ready to be taken away. I did not go to bed till near one o'clock that morning. I was in my own apartment; I was at home all the evening, and can answer to the street door being fast before I went up stairs.</p>

            . I keep a silversmith's shop in the Minories: On Monday morning, the 21st of November, the prisoner came into my shop, and laid these goods on my counter, and said, Pray sir, will these goods do for you? (Producing seven pair of gold buttons, and fifteen pair of gold ear-rings.) I was very ill; and it was a rainy dark morning: I said, indeed I cannot see them, whether they are garnets or not. Pray what do you ask for them? Said he, I must have nine guineas for them. I said, Sir, they will not do for me, for I am so ill I cannot look at them. He said, well, what time shall you be back from 'Change? I will leave them, and call again for either the money or my goods, by two, or a quarter after. He left me. I wanted to go to 'Change, but being ill, I went no farther than Mr. Levi's Coffee-house. I had not been there long before Mr. Wintle came to me. My son had taken the goods, and carried them to Mr. Wintle. Mr. Wintle, and another man, and my son, came to me. Mr. Wintle called me out, and said, here are some goods which your son brought me to sell, which belong to a workman of mine, whose house has been broke open; and I hope you will give me an account how you came by them. I said, sir, do not be uneasy about them, I have not bought them; but the gentleman left them, and is to be at my house by two or a quarter after, for either the money or the goods. He said, do you know the gentleman? Said I, yes, sir; I see him every day, at the Bank Coffee-house. Said he, I am afraid he will not come for the goods. Said I, I will warrant you, the man will come. Mr. Wintle had the goods in his pocket at the time. I said, do you and the other gentleman come to my house, and make no noise, but sit in my parlour, and you will see the gentleman come according to his time. We went to my house, and in about half an hour after two o'clock, the prisoner came. Then I said to Mr. Wintle, please to give me the goods. I took and opened them upon the counter, and said, here sir, is your goods, they do not suit me. The prisoner said, pray, sir, why do not they suit you? I said, because here is a gentleman that says they are not honestly come by. (The goods, with the gold rings in the case, produced in Court.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Knight. (Takes out a card which had earrings on it.) Here is my hand-writing on this. The card was brought to me by Mr. Wintle, as it is now, torn. Here are the letters H.

Mr. Wintle said he would do the same for Mr. Knight, as he would for himself. Mr. Knight being very ill, he went away with Mr. Davis's son; he returned again in a few minutes, and said, it would be proper to have more assistance. Mr. Knight desired me to go. I went with them to Mr. Davis's; we waited there till the prisoner came. We got a constable: on his being desired to search him, I saw that case of rings taken out of his pocket in his bosom.

               <p>Webb. This was about ten weeks ago. I set them down at the end of the Minories, at the end of Swan-Street, betwixt one and two o'clock in the morning. A gentleman said, Mr. Martin, a good night to you. There were several things in the coach; one in particular was this iron crow; (taking the crow in his hand.) I am certain it was this crow. There was also something that rattled; whether it was brass or silver, I know not. There were two men came with them in to the coach, but they parted with them in Cheapside. I carried the prisoner five times within a fortnight. I carried him twice from Blackwall: I cannot be sure he was one of them in the coach, the first time; but I carried such things as these (meaning the crow and chisels) and three men, to No. 5, in Swan-Street, in the Minories: I know he was one of them the second time.

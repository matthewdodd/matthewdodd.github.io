                  </hi>. I am clerk and overlooker to Robert William Kennard and others—I remember the prisoner coming to the warehouse on October 18th—I had received some information and caused some iron to be weighed in the prisoner's presence—it weighed 11 Cwt. 1 qr. 3 lbs.; previous to that Astbury had been to me with a board of the weight of the iron to be entered in our book; the weight on that was 8 Cwt. 2 qr. 10 lbs.; it came to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am porter to the prosecutor—I wag in the yard on 18th October—the prisoner came and said, "I want 8 cwt. of iron, the same as I had before"—I told him I was busy and could not attend to him—the cashier came and spoke to me, and in consequence of what was said I served the prisoner—I told him he must take his cart down the lane, and I went and got the scales ready—the prisoner then said, "Come and have something to drink"—we went to the public house, and on coming back he said, "I am going to put the iron out in four lots of 2 Cwt. each, and I shall trust to you in weighing it; you might as well make 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for your self"—I told him I never did such a thing, and I was not going to do it now—we went to the warehouse and I put on the weights and weighed the first lot, it was 4 Cwt. 0 qrs. 8 lbs. and I put down the weight on this piece of board (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—while I was putting the weight down the prisoner took some of the iron that had not been weighed and put it on his cart—I said to him, "Hold hard, you are a fool, there are eyes about; you don't know who is watching you"—he did not say anything—he left off but did not take the iron out again—I then weighed some more, 4 Cwts. 0 qrs. 3 lbs.—I put that in his cart, and put it down on this board—he then said he</p>

               <p>would have another half Cwt. and I weighed 1 qr. 27 lbs.—that was put in the cart, and I put it down on this board; 4 Cwt. 0 qrs. 8 lbs., 4 Cwts. 0 qrs. 3 lbs., and 1 qr. 27 lbs., making 8 Cwt. 2 qrs. 10 lbs.—I then told him to draw off—he said, "Where is Mr. Kent? I must pay for it"—I allowed the iron to remain in the cart—I went up to the counting-house and charged the iron; it amounted to 8 Cwts. 2 qrs. 10 lbs.—I told Mr. Kent what it weighed in the prisoner's presence—it was re-weighed and it weighed 111/4 cwts. and some odd pounds.</p>

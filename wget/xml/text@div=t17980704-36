             sworn. - On Thursday last, about four o'clock, the two prisoners at the bar came to the door, and looked at some muslins hanging near the door, she objected to them, and I asked her to come in and look at some others; I shewed her some, and she looked at one, while the boy was looking at another; I brought it forward, and the boy staid behind; I then observed him reaching over the counter, where I had left the printed cotton, with his hands stretched over, but I had no suspicion of him at all, on account of his youth; she looked at the muslin, and seemed very well satisfied with it, she said, she was going further for some shirts, and would call again for it; immediately after she was gone out, I went down to the bottom of the shop, and missed this piece of print; I told my fellow shopman of it, and said, I was positive it was there just before she came in; I have never seen the print since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Trebeck. Q. You saw the woman and the child the whole of the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She was bargaining fairly with you? - A. She did not bargain for any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had any suspicion, it must have sell upon the boy? - A. I had no suspicion of either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had your eye pretty much upon him all the time he was there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he took it, then it must be at the time you saw him with his hand stretched over the counter? - A. No, he could not possibly do it at that time; after that, he went into the inner shop, and came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. She could not have done it? - A. I should imagine not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say in the shop, that you were sure the boy had taken it? - A. I said, I thought the boy had taken it.</p>

             sworn. - When I brought the prisoner back from Tower-hill, she had this piece of cotton in a handkerchief in her hand, with which she was endeavouring to cover the print; I saw the print clearly, I took her to my master's, and the cotton was delivered to the constable, George Wade.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WADE sworn. - I am a constable: This is the print I received from the last witness.(Produces it).</p>
               <p>Bengough. (Matches it with a piece which he took from his pocket). This is the piece that was on the counter when the prisoners came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the value of it? - A. It cost twenty shillings and upwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Trebeck. Q. Is that the whole piece? - A. No; I had sold three gowns, fifteen yards of it; the piece was twenty-one yards, and this is six yards.</p>
               <p>Q. This may be one of the three gowns that you sold, for any thing you know? - A. No, that is impossible; the fag end matches exactly with the end that is cut; I took it down five minutes before they came in.</p>
               <p>The prisoners did not say any thing in their defence.</p>

            , Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live in Bury-street, Edmonton. On the 22d of December, I was robbed, in company with Mr. and Mrs. Macbean, in a post-chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was it, and at what time did it happen? - A. About three or four hundred yards from my own house, at half past four o'clock, it was then perfectly light; it was after sun-set, but perfectly light, light enough to discern any object whatever; we were in conversation relative to the house we were just then passing; we had not passed it more than fifty yards when we saw a man run before the chaise to the horses' heads and lay hold of the bridle; on observing that, the friends that were with me were of opinion we were about to be robbed, but so little was I of that opinion that I was in the act of letting down the window to enquire what the man wanted, I had not the least expectation of being robbed; while I was in the act of letting down the glass, I felt something on my right side, I sat in the middle; on turning round to observe what it was that went against me, I discovered the door open on the right hand, and a man stood at the door with a pistol presented at me, it was a short bright barrelled pocket pistol; he demanded my watch and my money, or my money and my watch, I don't recollect which; I desired him to take away the pistol, and that he should have all that I had; his answer was, make haste, make haste; I took hold of his arm with one hand, and with the other put my hand in my pocket, and held to him the money that I had, which was two guineas; he took the money, and asked if that was all; I told him it was; he then demanded my watch, and said, that he had either seen or felt it; I took the watch from my pocket, and held it up between my finger and thumb, and he took it, it was a new gold watch; he then demanded my pocket-book; I told him I had not any pocketbook; he said I had; I told him upon my honour I had not, and begged he would be satisfied, and go away; he told me to take care that he did not find one; I told him I had not got any, and he immediately turned to the lady and robbed her; when he turned to the lady, he presented his pistol to her; I desired him to take away his pistol, and not to alarm the lady; he said he would not do any harm; I told him if he did not mean to do any harm, it was rather strange he would not take away his pistol, and desired him to take it away; he turned to the lady, and desired her not to be alarmed, for he would not do her any hurt; I believe that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you collected and cool at this time, or under any alarm? - A. I believe I was as little alarmed as any man could be in a similar situation.</p>
               <p>Q. During this time, had you an opportunity of observing the person that was robbing you? - A. Yes, perfectly; I have not the smallest doubt of that being the man, (points to Marriott); I verify believe that to be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a full opportunity of observing him? - A. Yes; looking in his face the whole time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt then that he is the man? - A. It is possible I may be deceived, but I declare solemnly that I believe that to be the man, I have not the smallest doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your attention drawn towards the other side of the chaise? - A. At the time that he finished robbing me, I heard, on the other side, what I thought was a dispute, a little hesitation on the part of the gentleman that was with me; I turned suddenly round, and laid hold of Mr. Macbean's arm to check him from making any resistance; and then I saw the other prisoner at the bar, with a pistol similar to the one I was robbed with; I then turned to the lady, and attended to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a good opportunity of observing the person of that other man? - A. Yes; the moment I saw him at Bow-street, I could have identified him if there had been a thousand, immediately as I saw him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. By that you take upon yourself to swear that that other prisoner was the man that was at the other door? - A. I speak with as much certainly as I think any man ought to speak.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Mrs. Macbean was under considerable alarm? - A. She was very much alarmed; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. The way in which you speak of it is, that you verily believe they are the men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a good while afterwards before you saw them at Bow-street? - A. A week or ten days.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing belonging to you was found upon them? - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor was there, in their possession, any pistol, I believe? - A. I never heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were under the state of alarm, that you speak of, as a man would naturally be alarmed, especially with a lady? - A. I was as little alarmed as any man could be in that situation.</p>
               <p>Q. Every man, of course, under such a situation, must be under alarm? - A. Of course; but that alarm very soon subsided; and I must do the prisoners the justice to say, they behaved extremely well; that there was not a single oath uttered to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>

            , Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I was in company with Mr. Oldham and Mrs. Macbean when this robbery was committed, on the 22d of December, about half<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150005"></xptr>past four o'clock, in a place called Bury-street, nearly opposite Mr. Goffart's house, or between that and the bridge. Mr. Oldham had just been speaking of robberies, and of the house, and I perceived a man go up to stop the horses, upon which I got up, judging what it was, that we were to be robbed; as I got up, I pulled my watch out of my sob, clapped it upon the cushion below me, between my things, and sat down; I laid hold, with my left hand, of the string of the side glass to let it down; I then perceived the right side door open, I was upon the left side, and Mr. Oldham in the middle; I saw a man entering at the door, and saying, your money and your watches immediately; I turned round upon my left hand, and found a man close by my side, with a pistol in his right hand, and said to me, your money and watch; I said, my money was very little, but he should have it; I took out all that was in my waistcoat pocket, which was about eight or nine shillings, this key, this pencil-case, and this knife I put into my left hand, and a shilling with them, which I kept, and gave him all the rest; after that, I laid hold of his hand which had the pistol, and kept the muzzle of the pistol upwards; and he said, in a very low and slow voice, your watch, Sir; I endeavoured then to wrench the pistol out of his hand, and that knocked his hat up a little higher, it was down before that over his nose, very low; at that time Mr. Oldham turned round, and laid hold of my hand, and said, what are you about, look at the lady; I turned round, and saw that her head was thrown back behind Mr. Oldham, and saw the man's hand searching her pocket; immediately I gave the man upon my side the watch; he then asked me for my pocket-book; I said, no; he said, you had better let me search your pocket; I said, you had better not; he then said, you are interrupting me in my business, or words to that effect; the man upon my side said no more.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you a good opportunity of observing the man that was upon your side? - A. Plenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend to him? - A. I did; and I remarked him, that I should know him again if I ever saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round the Court, and see if that man is here? - A. Yes; that man with the red hair is the man, the tall man (Mackaway.)</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the person on the right hand, when the door was opened, and saw him searching your wife's pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of his person? - A. Yes; but not so much as I did of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether he is here or not? - A. Yes, to the best of my knowledge, from his face, that was the man (Marriott.)</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt, whether he was the man or not? - A. I have none; I am not so positive to him as I am to the other; but I have not the least doubt that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did You see either of the men, when they were apprehended at Bow-street? - A. Yes; they were mixed with other three.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able then to identify either of them? - A. I pointed them both out.</p>
               <p>Q. The place where you were robbed, was close by Mr. Goffart's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice at that time of the manner in which they were dressed? - A. The man on my side, was dressed in a blue, or dark coloured coat, and a black handkerchief over his chin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any further observation of him? - A. I observed that his nose was large and bent down, and a pink reddish face, perhaps occasioned then, as it was a frosty night, by the cold.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation upon the dress of the other? - A. No, I did not; I made such remark of the man on my own side, that I would have known him, let him be in what dress he would.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I observe you to speak very cautiously, respecting the persons of there two men, and the result is, that your attention was particularly called to the person on your side? - A. More so, because he was close to me; I saw the other man first.</p>
               <p>Q. But of course, the pistol of the man near you, being close to you, your attention was more called to him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to speak with the same certainty to the other man, as you do to him? - A. Not exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a darkish night, I believe? - A. It was not dark, it was day light.</p>
               <p>Q. At half past four in December, the day was closed? - A. No; it was quite light.</p>
               <p>Q. The day after the shortest day, was not it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. His coat was a blue, or dark colour, you said? - A. I think it was blue.</p>
               <p>Q. And notwithstanding you cannot, with certainty, describe the colour of his clothes, upon the day after the shortest day, yet you take upon yourself to swear to the man's face? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated to the Court, that the man had a black handkerchief over his chin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it as high as his mouth? - A. No, by no means.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knopp. Q. Had he a round hat on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A round stapped hat? - A. Yes; such a one as that before you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was your attention most called to the colour of his dress, or to the man? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150006"></xptr>A. To the face of the man certainly; I have heard him since speak at Bow-street, and I know it to be the same voice.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time might the whole of this business employ? - A. From two to three minutes, or perhaps upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after did you see them at Bow-street? - A. Twelve or thirteen days.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q.

Yes, I can do that; my reason was, I heard that Marriott was taken up for a robbery committed on the 22d of December; I knew, at the same time, that Marriott had been in the same house with me for three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect that you told me, a little while ago, that you had never heard from the prisoner before you looked at the almanack; and that the person from whom you heard of the robbery did not tell you the particulars-Who told you it was on the 22d.? - A. Marriott told me when I came to see him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that after Marriott had told you it was the 22d.? - A. Marriott told me the robbery was charged against him the 22d; and I told Marriott I recollected that day perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to tell me, a little while ago, that you had not heard from Marriott when you referred to the almanack? - A. I don't remember that I said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Martin, or his wife, that day? - A. We had no more than our own regular conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Then nothing particular passed for Martin to observe that day? - A. Only one, though it is a foolish thing; I asked Martin if he could oblige me with a few pickles; he said he had none; I think I asked him if he had an onion, which he gave me; and I asked him for some vinegar, and he went out himself, to a chandler's-shop, and got a halfpenny worth.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Mrs. Martin cooked the dinner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she by when you asked about the pickles? - A. I believe she was not; I am sure she was not in the tap-room at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And have you made no enquiries after her? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. And you did not know where it was that he went to? - A. I know where he told me he was going, I did not go with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and Marriott frequently spend the whole day together without working? - A. No; because I had my business to do.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that day a holiday? - A. Mr. Eustace, the gentleman I work for, is out of town; I have worked for him these eighteen months, and do still.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you give any reason for dining that day at that house? - Q. Yes; the reason was, my child was very ill, and my wife had been a washing, and we have but one room; the child had been ill about two months.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where did you buy the steaks that were dressed that day? - A. At a butcher's-shop in the Folly, Dock-head, and brought them to the house.</p>

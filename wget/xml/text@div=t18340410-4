            ' room, in the same house I live in, but I did not speak to her all that day, but she repeatedly abused me, using very bad language - she did not threaten me with anything at that time - we had no quarrel whatever - I believe it was Mrs. Tew, who is now out on bail, put her up to abuse me - that was from about half-past one o'clock until the time I got the cut from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, you were coming up the court into Drury-lane, where was it she struck you? A. Here on the temple,(pointing to the left hand side of her temple,) and she struck me after that with a poker - the blood came down in a most dreadful way - and, after I put my hand up, I said, "Mary, Mary, that woman has stabbed me" - Bland looked, round, but could not see where she was gone to - I went to the doctor's shop, to have my head dressed; and it was about nine or ten o'clock, when she struck me with the poker - the doctor's shop is in the same house where I lived - I got my wound dressed, and between nine and ten o'clock I was taken to the station-house - when I came to go up to my own place, she met me with a poker, and struck me - she said nothing to me - she knocked me down - I immediately fell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This was Saint Patrick's day? A. Yes; I had not been drinking that day - I had drank no spirits except one glass of liquor in the morning with my husband, about ten or eleven o'clock- I had not been in any company with this party at all - I drank nothing else till I came home to my own place, between ten and eleven o'clock, and when I got to bed I had a glass of ale - I had only one glass of spirits all day - I was not at all tipsy - my husband did not use the poker - he never took it up - I do not know Mr. and

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you mean a woman your husband had taken a fancy to? A. That was what I meant by a fancy woman - I do not know what a fancy woman is - I am quite sure the prisoner is the person who did it.</p>
               <p>MARY BLAND. I lived in the same house with the prosecutrix, and was walking with her on the afternoon of the 17th, between six and seven o'clock, from Drury-lane into Orange-court - there was nobody with us - as we were passing on the left hand side of the way, Mrs. Slater came past on the left side of Mrs. Moriarty - Mrs. Moriarty cried to me, "Oh Mary, Mary, I am stabbed by that person," - I had not seen the prisoner do anything till Mrs. Moriarty cried out that she was stabbed by Mrs. Slater - she said it was by Mrs. Slater - I immediately ran to see where Mrs. Slater went, but could not observe at the time - I lost sight of her through the court - I am quite sure it was her - it was getting towards dusk - there was light enough to enable me to see distinctly who it was - I swear it was Mrs. Slater - she had been annoying Moriarty during the day, and me likewise, going in and out from her own residence - I cannot say what they had been quarrelling about - she had not a room in the house - she was visiting Mrs. Tew, who lodges in the same house - Mrs. Moriarty had not done anything to provoke her to give this blow during the time I was with her, I am sure - they did not exchange any words until the blow was given at that time - she bled, and was taken to the surgeon - I have not said she annoyed me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I warn you to be very careful of answering - on your oath, did you not say, "She was annoying Mrs. Moriarty during the day, and me likewise?" A. I did not - Mrs. Moriarty during the day was annoyed - I do not know that I have said, "She had been annoying Mrs. Moriarty and me likewise" - I did not say so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had she, in point of fact, annoyed you during the day? A. No; she had not any words with me at all.</p>

            . I am medical assistant to Mr. Bradford, of 216, Tottenham-court-road, and who keeps the shop at No. 131, Drury-lane, which I attend to - the prosecutrix was brought into the shop accompanied by two women, about five minutes before seven o'clock; her face was all covered over with blood - I asked her what was the matter with her- she said she had got a cut in the face. I examined her - there was a cut on her left temple, inflicted with some sharp instrument, it was an incised wound - I examined the wound - the woman seemed excited, and was talking a great deal - there was great hemorrhage from the wound, and great excitement - I told her if she talked so much, she must go to another shop - I examined the wound, and found it was cut in as far as the bone, and it was about an inch and a quarter in length - she lost a great deal of blood, and was in a very weak state; she could scarcely stand - she was greatly excited - I recommended her to go home and go to bed, and go to Bow-street next morning - she was sober - she appeared as if she had taken a little drink - she wanted to tell me the person who had done it, and mentioned the name of the prisoner - the wound was very near the temporal artery - I suppose it was cut within a quarter of an inch of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not mean to say there was danger from the wound? A. Not immediate danger - I certainly mean to say there was danger - I am not a surgeon - I am a member of Apothecaries'-hall - the prosecutrix was greatly excited, but perfectly sober - I told her to go home, but she would persist in going after her husband, who, she said, was at some public-house - I saw her afterwards between nine and ten o'clock, when there was a general row, in the same house, 131 Drury-lane - she had not gone to bed, she was dressed except her bonnet.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What people had collected about? A. A great number of persons - a great number of Irish people had come there assisting Tew's party, and there was a number of people on both sides - the prosecutrix got a stroke inflicted on her forehead in the second row by some blunt instrument - I saw the prisoner there then - she came to the door, and I met Rose, a policeman, and told him the prisoner was knocking at the door, as I was afraid of the mob - when the prisoner was knocking at the door, I asked her what she wanted - she appeared to be in liquor, and asked for Mrs. Moriarty - I told her to go and look for her, but I would not have the shop knocked about in that kind of way - I had not seen her exactly in the second row - I did not see her doing anything, nor did I see her at all in the row - came and knocked at the door repeatedly, and kicked at the shop door - the bell rang - I came out and said to the prisoner, "My good woman, what do you want?" - she was very tipsy, and another woman with her very drunk - I said, "What are you knocking at the door for?" - she said, "We want to get Mrs. Moriarty," and I think she said, she wanted to pitch into her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Moore of Queen's-road West, Chelsea j he is Curator of the Botanical-gardens of the Apothecaries Company—I went to Mr. Wyllie on 16th April; I saw the prisoner—I purchased some articles—I did not pay him any money then—I did on the, 21st or 22d May—this is the invoice; it is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., my husband paid him that money in my presence—I saw the prisoner sign the receipt.</p>

                  </hi> What I stated in the former case was true—I kept certain books; supposing the prisoner to sell goods, it was his duty to enter the sale in the day-book, and it ought to have gone in the ledger as ready money, and into the cash-book of course—I have looked through my books; there is no entry that I am aware of, of this 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the days that have been mentioned—several of my cash<lb></lb>books have been lost—the only cash-book I have got commences on 12th May, 1860—supposing this money to have been paid on 21st May it would have been the prisoner's duty to enter it in this book; and I don't see the entry.</p>

               <p>Babbs. I gave them my landlady to lock them up, having no box of my own. The prisoner was seen with more money on the Sunday than he had taken on the Saturday, and I suspected him, and charged him; he owned he had taken and pawned them in Bishopsgate-street. He went with us, and shewed us the house; they were produced, and I swore to them.</p>

            . The buckles were delivered to my wife to keep for the prosecutor. They were missing on the 4th of March. The prisoner worked for me when we suspected him. I asked him if he had not taken them, he owned he had, and had pawned them.</p>

            . The prisoner was asking for a pawnbroker on a Sunday; I said there were none on Sundays. He cried, and said he wanted bread, and I lent him money upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you lend him?</p>
               <p>S. Magee. I lent him 6 s. and 6 d. upon them. ( The buckles produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I was a long while sick in this man's house, and had received but little money, not enough to pay my way. I took them to pledge them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ricks. How much money did he take that Saturday night?</p>
               <p>Ricks. It was but very little. It was less than sixpence. He had been ill almost three weeks. I had known him but four days before. He was a stranger to me.</p>

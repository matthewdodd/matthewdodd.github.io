            , the accomplice. Penn and I set off, to morrow will be eight weeks, at night a robbing; we went as far as Mother Red Cap's, and had two pints of cyder; and then we went to Enfield Chase; where we stopped till a coach went by; we followed the coach; but thinking there was a guard with it, we let it alone: coming back, we met the Derby Fly, and stopped it, and robbed it of a gold watch, and a pinchbeck watch, in a shagreen case. I was taken on Saturday morning, in Hartshorn court, Golden lane, in Payne's room; I put the watch in Payne's chest; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Penn. I never was in his company in my life. I never went to Enfield Chase.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Where was you robbed?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I asked the coachman; he said it was South Mims.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not stopped coming from London?</p>

               <p>(The watch produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch; I know it by the name; the maker's name is to the seal. The watch maker swore to the watch next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lee. Where was the robbery committed?</p>
               <p>Lee. Very near South Mims, on this side.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any body here that knows whether that is in Middlesex?</p>

               <p>Lee. Yes; about six in the evening, Penn and Elmore had two horses of me, to go to Blackwall; Elmore came for them, and took them to the Bull; there Lee mounted one and Penn the other. I never saw Penn before; he was recommended to me by the person who keeps the Roe Buck.</p>
               <p>Penn. I hired the horses to take my wife a nd children into the country to their mother.</p>
               <p>Fanny White. Penn and Lee were at my house on the 26th of July, the same night they committed the robbery, at Mother Red Cap's at the foot of Highgate hill; they drank two pints of cyder; I am sure he is the man; he was not in the house, but at the door.</p>

            . When were the horses brought home?</p>
               <p>Lee. Next morning, about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought them?</p>
               <p>Lee. Elmore; he rode one and led the other, as he did before.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he appear; was he hard rode?</p>
               <p>Lee. No; he was in very good order.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lee the evidence. What time was you taken?</p>
               <p>Lee. About seven in the morning; Penn and I came to town together, to the Spread Eagle, in Gracechurch street, about four in the morning; there we put our horses up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else with you?</p>
               <p>Lee. No; from thence we went to Payne's, and between six and seven Penn got up and went to desire Elmore to carry home the horses, as he hired them. I did not see Penn any more till he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. to Broadhurst. Where did you take Payne?</p>
               <p>Broadhurst. In Hartshorn court, Golden lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with him?</p>
               <p>Broadhurst. The evidence was in bed with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took Penn?</p>
               <p>Broadhurst. I do not know; I went with Penn to Payne's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Payne in the house when you came in?</p>
               <p>Broadhurst. Yes; he was in bed in the same room as we lay down in afterwards; there was only one, and we all three lay down on it.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not know what you had been about?</p>
               <p>Broadhurst. At first we knocked; he said who is there; I said Penn and I have been on the marble, and desired him to let us lie down a little.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by being on the ramble?</p>

               <p>Broadhurst. Being out all night.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not know what you had been upon.</p>
               <p>Broadhurst. No; he said you have waked me out of my sleep; I have got the rheumatism; he soon went to sleep again, and we lay down.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to put the watch and pistols in the chest?</p>
               <p>Broadburst. Because we had not room for them in our pocket; and as the chest was open, we put in the watch in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Was you robbed by one man or two?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. One man; the other was on the other side of the coach; there were two in company; it was light enough to see them; I can be very certain to both their faces; it was light enough for that.</p>

               <p>Q. to Lee, the evidence. Where was if you got on horse-back the 26th at night?</p>
               <p>Lee. In Goswell-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who got the horses?</p>
               <p>Lee. Elmore.</p>
               <p>Q. There were only two horses got; what became of Elmore?</p>
               <p>Lee. He did not go with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the horses to the Bull?</p>
               <p>Lee. Elmore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out of the Bull yard on them, or you?</p>
               <p>Lee. He overtook us on horseback just beyond the Bull; there is no yard, it is only a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Elmore get off?</p>
               <p>Lee. At Goswell-street turnpike.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him.</p>
               <p>Lee. He came to Old-street to drink with us; we could not get another horse for him, so he went back.</p>

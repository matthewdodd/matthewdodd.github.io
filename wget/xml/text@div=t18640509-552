                  </hi>. I keep a public-house, 88, High-street, Woolwich—on Thursday night, 21st April, the prisoners came, with two other men and a woman—Baker called for some beer—I served him—it came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I put it in the till, and gave him 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—there were two other shillings there—they took the beer into the tap-room and drank it there—a few minutes afterwards Johnson called for a pint of beer, and gave me half-a-crown—I thought it looked bad, put it in the tester, and bent it—I said, "This is a bad half-crown"—he said, "Is it? give it to me back"—I said, "No"—he said, "I have no more money," but afterwards he found a fourpenny-piece, which he paid me, and went into the room again—I then looked in the till and found this bad shilling; I could tell it from the other two which were there, as they were very much worn—I called a policeman, and gave the prisoners in custody, with the half-crown and shilling.</p>

I am potman to Mrs. Payne—I saw the prisoners there on Thursday, 21st April, with two men and a female—I was in the tap-room when the policeman was sent for—the female then went into the buckyard and remained there while the policeman took the prisoners in custody—that was between half-past 11 and 12 o'clock—next morning I went into the back yard and found two half-crowns in the water-closet, with some paper over them—I gave them to Mrs. Payne, and she gave them to the constable.</p>

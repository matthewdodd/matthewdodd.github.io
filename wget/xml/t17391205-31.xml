             for 150 l. he gave me 30 l. down, and gave me several promissory Notes for the rest, which became due at different Times. When two of the Notes became due, I found I could get no Money. At last Walter and the Prisoner told me, if I would go to a Coffee-house, and say that Walter had bought so much Timber of me, and had paid me honestly for it, I should be paid my Debt in four Days: Butcher solicited me to do this, and Walter was with him, and said, he could have Credit for 300 l's Worth of Timber, if I would say so. I refused to do it, unless they would pay me; and finding they had bad Characters, I took out an Attachment against the Timber, had it appraised, gave Security to the Sheriffs, and then I carry'd the Timber to Nine-Elms. in a Barge: I saw it in the Barge myself. After this it was taken away, and carry'd to Westminster Horse-ferry.</p>

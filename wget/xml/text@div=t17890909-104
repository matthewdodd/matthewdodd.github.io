               <p>Where was that shop? - In Princes'-street; I saw the bundle on the counter; I said, them are my things; one part of the bundle was untied; the prisoner was in the shop; he staggered back; he was much in liquor, and the young man laid hold of him; I said, go out and call the watchman; he brought one; and the prisoner was taken to the watch-house; I kept the bundle myself when I was in town; and when I went out of town, I delivered it to this young man: the prisoner was so drunk, I do not think he knew what he was about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mariner—I live in Crosstree-lane, Deptford—on the night of the 16th of Jan. I was walking in High-street—I saw the prisoner—I knew her before—she introduced her arm through mine and we walked a short distance—she gave me a chuck under the chin, and shortly after she repeated it—I put my hand up, and missed a union-pin which I had in my scarf—I know I had it about three minutes before I missed it—I laid hold of the pri<lb></lb>soner, and called for the police—the policeman came after I had held the pri<lb></lb>soner about a quarter of an hour—I had only removed a short distance from where I laid hold of the prisoner—I searched for the pin with a light after the policeman came—I found it down on the pavement near where we were—I knew her before—this is my signature to this deposition—there was some<lb></lb>thing read over to me—I knew this was a charge—I thought I was going to sign what I had stated—it is here said, "At half-past eleven last night I was walking in High-street; the prisoner, of whom I knew nothing whatever, came and put her arm through mine."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 330.) I heard a cry, and came up—the prosecutor had got hold of the prisoner by the shawl—he charged her with stealing his pin—he said she chucked him twice under the chin, and the last time he felt the scarf draw up—I sent him for a light, and found the pin about a yard from the place.</p>

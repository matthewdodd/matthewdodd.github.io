                  </hi>. I live in Coburg-place, Goswell-road. The prisoner came to my house on Saturday, the 24th of September, at about nine or ten o'clock at night, with a week's rent, due from his father—I entered it in the rent-book—he returned soon after, saying there was a mistake in the book—I said, "There is no mistake, give me the book, I will take it to your mother"—I went, and left him in my room—when I returned, he was gone, and the door was closed—I had wound my watch up about a quarter of an hour before, and hung it on the chimney-piece—there was no mistake in the book—I returned about two hours after, and missed the watch—on Monday morning, the 26th, I had him taken on suspicion, and on closely questioning him, about five minutes after, he said he knew nothing of it—I said, "John, speak the truth, or you must speak it hereafter"—he said, "Well, I know where the watch is, I will go and fetch it," and the policeman followed him to Parr's-place—he went on his knees, and scratched a hole in the ground, and drew forth the watch, enclosed in a piece of paper—that is my watch.</p>

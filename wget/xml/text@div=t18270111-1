On the 29th of December I went out about four o'clock in the afternoon - this cloth was then in the window, which was quite whole. I returned at eleven, and found the shop window broken in at the bottom, and missed this four yards of cloth; it had evidently been drawn through the hole in the glass. Here is the cloth (looking at it) - I am certain it is mine.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 29th of December, about six o'clock in the evening. I was in Greek-street, Soho, and observed the prisoner and two others standing at Mr. 
               <persName id="t18270111-1-person82">Rudduck</persName>
            's shop window - I walked up the street, a little way above the house, suspecting them; I crossed over, and when I came opposite the house I saw the prisoner run away, with something under his arm; his two companions followed him - I pursued, and saw them all three stop at the corner of Frith-street; at the top of Queen-street I observed the prisoner standing against the rails, and his two companions standing before him, hiding him. I pushed them aside, laid hold of the prisoner, and asked him where he got that coat, which I thought it was then, it being dark - he said, "It is my coat;" I asked where he got it - he said it was his coat, threw it at me, and said, "Take it" - he ran away; I pursued; he said to one of his companions, "Trip him up," which he attempted to do. I still followed - he was never more tham two or three yards from me; I caught him in Dean-street - he was never out of my sight; there was a handkerchief with it, which he was trying to wrap it in when I went up - it was very dark; Mr. Rudduck's shop window was not lighted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me break the window? A. No, nor did I see him take the cloth out of it; he ran down Frith-street, across Compton-street, into Dean-street, which is only two streets from where he drew it at me; I caught hold of him two or three times - he was never more than three yards from me - it was very light in Compton-street; I had the cloth in my hand, or I should have taken him before; I kept calling Stop thief! but nobody offered to stop him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am not the person whom he took with the cloth; I never saw the handkerchief that was round it in my life. I was taken four streets from the place. Witness. I took no person but him - he threw the cloth at me - and as I was going to the office he told me that when he had the cloth in his hand he thought it d - d coarse stuff. <rs id="t18270111-1-verdict6" type="verdictDescription">

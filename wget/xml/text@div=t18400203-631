                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at the Queen's Head public-house, Charlotte-street, "Whitechapel. On the 10th of January I had these brass guards—they had been taken from the windows when the shutters were put up, and put on the counter—the prisoners came in together—they had two pints of beer, and, I think, a pennyworth of gin—I went into the parlour, heard the brass-work sound, and the prisoners were gone—I found three guards gone out of the four which had been on the counter—I told the policeman, and the prisoners were taken about half-past one o'clock—I have seen two of the guards since broken in pieces—the third has not been found—the prisoners left my house about a quarter-past twelve, and there was no one else in the house.</p>

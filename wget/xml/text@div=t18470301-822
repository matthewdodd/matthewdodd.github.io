About a quarter-past five o'clock, in the afternoon of the 19th of Jan., I went to a paddock adjoining Mr. Soames' residence at Maize-hill, Greenwich—I saw Colegate coming out of the entrance of a subterranean passage leading to the foundation of Mr. Soames' house—the other two prisoners were out in custody of another officer—I called to Colegate to come out—we tied him to the other two prisoners, put them into the stable, and left them in custody of two officers—Patmore, and the gardener and I, went about 120 yards into the passage—we found all this property, boxes of various description, and a model of a boat and of a ship—I got up to Mr. Soames' celler, and found the bricks had been removed—I afterwards searched the prisoners' houses—at Phillips' house I found a new cloth cap and some beads—the cap has been identified by one of the boys at the Naval asylum, as the property of another boy who has left the asylum—I found nothing at the other prisoner' house.</p>

I was fetched to Mr. Soames'—I went to the bottom of the paddock, and found this hole—I sent a dog up, and I heard a voice inside telling the dog to go out—I called two or three times for the persons to come out, and no answer was received—I said if they did not come out I would smoke them out—I made a smoke, but could not smoke them out there—the gardener and another man made a hole further up—we made a smoke there, and they called out that if we would put the fire out they would come out—two of them come out, and Smith took Colegate—I went into the cave—I found this model of a ship, these boxes, bends, and other things there—I had never heard of the place before—I do not think any of the police knew about the entrance to the cave—it is on quite private ground.</p>

I have known this entrance to the cave for eight or ten years—it is on private property—I always considered it a drain—there used to be a grating there—I have seen boys' footmarks there, but I never saw anybody go in to it—on the 16th of Jan. I saw the prisoners Jones and Phillips, and one of the name of Wood, going that way—Colegate was not there—Phillips had something in a sack on his back—on seeing me, they said it was too cold, and they turned back—I have not seen Jones so often as I have the other prisoners—the mouth of the cave comes out on the side of a bank, about 140 yards from the houses, on private property.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 136.) On the night of 10th Dec., I was a duty at Enfield—I saw the prisoner carrying a bundle of hay on his back;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184801030032"></xptr>
               <p>I stopped him, and asked him where he got the hay—he said it blew from his cart—I followed the cart, and overtook it; his younger brother was driving it—I followed it into his yard.—I gave the prisoner in charge to another officer—I found in the cart a sack, containing three fowls, and a leather wanty—I asked the prisoner where he bought them—he said "At Stortford-market"—I took him to the station, came back, and searched his stable, and there found the other things.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">the younger.</hi> I live with my father, William Walker, at Enfield. I look after his farm—he had three leather wanties six months ago—I missed them all three at different times—I missed the last, six or seven weeks ago; it had been lost some time before I missed it—I searched the premises, and could not find it—this one has the appearance of it—there is a peculiarity in the sort of leather—no man in our neighbourhood has a wanty made of brown leather; they all prefer black leather—I missed some onion seed, which was lying in bulk, to dry—it was all partly dressed; there was some undressed by the side of it—I have seen that produced—this is in the same state as that we lost—it is my father's.</p>

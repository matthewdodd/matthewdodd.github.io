               <p>On Thursday, the 26th of September, I saw the prisoner in a lighter, they were landing sugar, I called him out of the lighter because he was not employed, I searched him, and found eight pounds of sugar about him, four or five pounds, of it was good sugar, the other was scrapings; this was a tool he had with him, it is not allowed, but sometimes they have them to scrape their casks.</p>
               <p>Did you employ this man at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was any hogsheads shattered? - Yes, very much so, but not quite out, the prisoner had no business there.</p>

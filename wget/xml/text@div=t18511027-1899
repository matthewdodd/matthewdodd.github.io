Cooks, containing two pieces of black silk—this produced is of the same quality, length, and number, but I cannot swear to its being the same—we did not want it, and in consequence sent this return invoice to Cook's on 19th Sept.—I packed the goods up myself with some other goods, directed them to "Cook, Sons, and Co., St. Paul's Churchyard," and left them to be called for by Pickford's, who collect for the railway—I did not deliver the goods to Pickford's myself, but I found about 4 o'clock that they had left the house—this receipt was given for the box, which was covered with brown paper—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

On Saturday, 20th Sept., I was on duty in Holborn, about a quarter-past 3 o'clock—I saw an omnibus, which to the best of my belief was a Camden-town one, stop, and the prisoner got out of it with a bundle under her shawl, and went into the Castle public-house, in Castle-street—I had seen the prisoner before, and knew she lived in Field-lane—I waited by the pubic-house, and she came out again without the bundle, and went through a court leading to Fetter-lane, in the direction of Field-lane—I called Hewitt's attention to it—I continued to watch the house, and in about twenty minutes saw the prisoner go back again—there are two doors to the house—in three or four minutes the prisoner came out again</p>

In consequence of what Nicholls said to me, I went to the Castle tavern, and afterwards went into Holborn, as far as opposite Hatton-garden, where I saw Mrs. Simmons's husband, a man who lives in Field-lane, coming up Bartlett's-buildings, going in the direction of the Castle from up Holborn-hill, from the direction of Field-lane—that was about a quarter of an hour after Nicholls had spoken to me—in two or three minutes I went back to the Castle, and saw the prisoner come out with a bundle tied up in this handkerchief—I followed her down Norwich-court, across Fetter-lane, down Bartlett's-passage, into Bartlett's-buildings, where I overtook her and said, "Mrs. Simmons, what have you got in that bundle?"—she said, "Oh, it is only a bit of silk"—I said, "Where did you get it from?" she said her husband had <hi rend="italic">wrapped</hi> some silk handkerchiefs away for it; meaning <hi rend="italic">changed,</hi> I suspect—I asked her with whom, and she said she did not know who it was, but thought it was a foreigner—she said, "I will go with you to the station-house"—I had said nothing about going to the station—I said, "Very well," and she walked down carrying the bundle—when we got there I asked her how much silk there was, whether there were ten yards, twenty, thirty, fifty, or a hundred—she said she did not know—I had it measured, and there are 234 yards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Ship-alley, Temple-bar. I have employed the prisoner two months, and he lodged in my house—he only occupied part of a bed—my wife did the household work of the room he occupied, and he complained of her going into the room and leaving it wet—on his coming, and speaking to my wife, I ordered him out of the shop, and caught hold of his arm to put him out—he seized me by the collar, and would not go, but he went out at last, and said at he left that he would do for me—on the following morning, the 1st of Jan., I heard he had been into the shop—my little girl said he was gone out—I went up stairs to see if he was gone, and if he had left all right, and just as I got on the top stair I saw him in his room—I said to him, "Young fellow, you made a great piece of work about your room being cleaned; my wife has done it, and made you a good fire, you could take no barm; leave this place this day week"—he laid hold of me, and I of him, and he took a knife, and stabbed me on the temple—I fell down the stain insensible.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bachelor of medicine, and house surgeon at King's College Hospital. On the 1st of Jan., at a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning, Cornwall was brought there—he had a wound on the outer orbit of his left eye, about three quarters of an inch long, and I nearly an inch deep—it had evidently been done with a cutting-instrument, but not with the large breakfast-knife which was produced—I should say a shoemaker's knife would have done it—it was a dangerous I wound, and within one-eighth of an inch of the eye—it went entirely through the temporal muscle, and must have been a violent blow—the I bone was slightly injured—there were symptoms of inflammation, and the prisoner was remanded for that.</p>

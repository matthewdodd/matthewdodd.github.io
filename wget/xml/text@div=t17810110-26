             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am housekeeper to Mr. Crawford. Upon the 1st of November my master was distressed for a servant; I went to the office in Holbourn, facing St. Andrew's Church. I enquired for a servant; the prisoner was recommended to me. My mistress hired her at twelve o'clock the next day. I was not in the room when she was hired.</p>
               <p>Did she act as a servant in the house? - Yes, the time she staid, which was from twelve o'clock till within a quarter of six at night. Then I went down stairs to show her where the candles and candlesticks were, that she might bring up lights. I found the door open. I walked into the kitchen and missed her. I found a white apron on the floor in the kitchen; I went to hang it up under a cloak, which belonged to my young mistress, and missed the cloak. I was frightened, and ran up to the side-board; the plate was all gone, except a coffee-pot and a butter-boat. All the pieces of plate mentioned in the indictment were gone (repeating them).</p>
               <p>How long before she was gone had you seen all that plate in the house? - Not above five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Was there any other person in the house who could take the plate away? - No. There was no person in the house but my mistress, the young lady, and me.</p>
               <p>You do not know where they were found? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a silversmith in the Strand, just through Temple-bar. I bought some plate, I believe of the prisoner, but there is so great an alteration I can hardly swear to the identity of the woman; she was full of flesh then. I have great reason to believe she is the woman, but if she had not been in custody some time I could have sworn to her. I gave information the next evening after the robbery, within ten minutes after I had received the hand-bill. I told Mr.

On Friday night, the 21st of May, at half-past ten o'clock, I locked my mare up safe in the stable; I live fifty-nine miles from Hyde-park corner - I missed her at seven next morning - also a saddle, bridle, rug, and halter; I came to London directly by coach, and published hand-bills that afternoon, offering 15l. reward on conviction - and on the 27th I received a letter, came to town again that night (Monday), went to Shadwell with the officer, and saw my mare, saddle, bridle, rug, and halter - they were all what had been taken on the 21st.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DANIELS. Q.Where is the stable? A.Between my house and shop, rather behind, about ten yards from my house; I had two horses, but one was not at home -I had only one in the stable. I swear that I locked the stable door myself - I had rode to Winchester that afternoon on this mare. and called at several houses there; I was not in any jovial society - I dined about half-past twelve o'clock before I started - I had half a pint of ale at Winchester, which is seven miles from my house; and I think I had one glass of brandy and water, or sherry and water, at the White Swan, which is the only public-house I called at; I took nothing at any friend's house - my lad, who looked after the mare, came to my bed-room door at six o'clock, and on going to the stable I found it open and the property gone - it locks twice; one bolt was forced back once, and being double doors they could then open them; I do not know how they had forced it back - I found a window open, and by getting in at it they could open the doors; I swear I fastened the window at night.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Had you seen the prisoner about your premises? A. No; I never trusted him with the mare.</p>

            . I am a coal-merchant, and have a stable at Shadwell which I let to the prisoner on the 10th of May, and delivered him the key - he said he was in the habit of coming to London occasionally, and wanted a place to put a horse and cart in; I saw the mare in question in the stable, but not when Ward was present - I saw it after it had been taken away by the headborough; the prisoner is club-footed with both feet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A.Never; I said he was a stranger to me, and I should expect a reference; he referred me to a Mr. Deen - I saw him again once before he was apprehended - I am certain of him; he came to me about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon; I went to Deen, who lives in the neighbourhood - I might be there a quarter or half an hour; the prisoner was in my house at that time; I should think he was in my company from a quarter to half an hour - he went with me each time to the stable.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Have you a doubt about him? A.Not the least; the stable is in Pope's-hill, Lower Shadwell.</p>

            . I am a headborough. On Sunday, the 23nd of May, I went to Hoskins' stable, Pope's-hill, Shadwell, in consequence of information, and found three mares there; I took two of them into my possession, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080070"></xptr>other was rode away while I was gone to Bow-common; Ward saw one of them and claimed it, with a bridle, saddle, rug, and halter, which were in the stable - this was about ten o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew the stable well? A. Yes; it was locked - Holmes got in at the loop-hole, and opened the door by forcing the lock; a man could easily get in,</p>

            . I am a jobber. On Saturday, the 23rd of May, I was applied to, to go to the stable in Pope's-hill, by a tall-looking gentleman in a green coat -I did not take notice of any body with him; I never saw the prisoner till he was at the Thames police-office - I went over the water with the gentleman on the Sunday, after a mare that had been taken out of the stable; I went into the stable on the Saturday and cleaned two horses for the gentleman; he gave me one shilling for it- I did not see the prisoner then.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the mare claimed by Mr. Ward? A. Not since I cleaned her - I do not know that that was his; I was taken into custody on the Monday evening, and detained for a month - I was sworn before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q.Recollect yourself, and tell me what happened when the man in a green coat hired you? A. I was standing at the top of St. Margaret's-hill - the gentleman came up and asked me to go and clean two horses for him; there was a person with him - I cannot say who it was; I have no notion whether it was the prisoner or not - there was nothing about him which I noticed.</p>
               <p>MARY ALLEN. I live on Pope's-hill; my house joins Hoskins' stable. On Saturday, the 22nd of May, two horses came there about three o'clock in the afternoon - one was in a chaise-cart, and the other was rode by a man - they went to Hoskins' stable; the gentleman that rode the horse went round to Mr. Deen for the key, and when he came back he said the man was gone away, and he was a d-d pretty fellow to go with the key - they broke into the stable - the horse that was rode appeared very dirty; I do not recollect how either of the men were dressed - I believe the prisoner is the man who rode in the chaise-cart; he had two clubbed feet -I took particular notice of him; I saw no more of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A miller's wife; I stood at my door to see the horse come in - I take in work, and often sit at the door to work and nurse my children; horses seldom come by my door - I never saw the prisoner before that day; the chaise-cart was enclosed on each side; I saw him come out of the chaise - the young man with him broke into the stable, and opened the door for him to put the horse in.</p>

            . I am a livery stable-keeper and hackney-man. On the 10th of May I let a chaise-cart and harness to a young man who called himself Frederick; he hired it for two days, and said he might be gone two or three days longer - I saw no more of the chaise till I found it in the officer's possession; I let the chaise to Frederick before, and on one occasion, when he brought it back, the prisoner was with him - I saw him talking to Frederick in the street; that was before the 10th - my chaise was found in the stable at Shadwell, nearly a month after I let it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you swear to the prisoner? A. I saw him once talking to Frederick, in Whitechapel-road; I do not know where Frederick is - I have not seen him since he hired the chaise, on the 10th.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was there never an occasion on which the prisoner, jointly with the other persons, hired the cart of you? A.Not in my presence.</p>
               <p>ROBERT FEYER. On Sunday morning, the 23rd of May, about ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner looking down Pope's-hill, towards the stable; he stood there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him looking towards the stable more than once that morning? A. Twice; he went away a little, and came back again - he was two or three hundred yards from the stable; he stood there looking two or three minutes both times - I saw him come from Shadwell-market, not in a direction from the stable.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DEEN. I keep the Three Compasses, Shadwell-market. I was surety to Hoskins for the rent of this stable - I have known the prisoner altogether fourteen or fifteen years, but but for the last seven years, I had only seen him twice previous to becoming surety for him; I saw him at my house on the Saturday before he was taken - there was a tall young man with him, who went by the name of Fred - it was about three o'clock in the afternoon; Fred had a greenish coloured coat, to the best of my recollection - I have heard Fred called Reynolds and Smith; they left my house about eight o'clock, or between that and nine, but Fred had gone out in about half an hour, and was gone a considerable time - he came back after the prisoner, and they left soon after nine; Fred returned a short time before they left - I did not hear them say where they came from; I did not notice whether they were splashed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not sworn it was on Sunday, the 23rd, that you saw them? A. No, I cannot state the day of the month; I swear it was on a Saturday - I did not see either of them on Sunday, and never said so; I have not seen Fred since - I was sworn before the Magistrate; I was not charged with taking the mare - I was not in prison, nor bailed; I was taken with a warrant, but was only in custody from my house to the office.</p>

            . I am a headborough of Shadwell. On the 24th of May I was sent for Little, by his father, and in consequence of what he told me, I took him before the Magistrate; I went next day in pursuit of the prisoner, and saw him, after four hours' search, in Laystall-street, Gray's Inn-lane; I and Whitwell observed him, run towards him, and took hold of his arms - he said,"Don't hurt me, I will go with you quietly;" I told him I apprehended him on a charge of felony. and if he was the person, was his name James Brooks - he said Yes; I asked where he lived - he made no reply: I again said,</p>
               <p>"Where do you live?" or "Where do you lodge?" he said, "I suppose you will know where I lodge to-night;" I said Yes, I did; after asking him several questions, I said, "Do you keep the stable, for the rent of which Mr. Deen has become answerable?" he said, "How can I keep it if Mr. Deen has become answerable for the rent?" I took him to a public-house about two hundred yards from where I apprehended him, and there we asked whether he was not at the stable, or in Shadwell, on Sunday last - I repeated the question as to Shadwell the second time, and he said, "I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080071"></xptr>have not been there since Saturday night;" we asked him several questions, but he gave us no answers - we took him to the Thames Police, in a coach, and in the coach Whitwell was looking stedfastly at him; he said, "What the h-ll are you looking at me for?" on his person I found 18s. 7d., a snuff-box, and a strop; he was examined five or six times - the mare was at the stable: I showed it to Ward there, and he claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear whether the prisoner was married? A. I believe he said so at the office - he was five or six times examined before he was committed; that was for the purpose of apprehending two others - it was in answer to Whitwell that he said he had not been to the stable since Saturday - he went quietly; there were three of us.</p>
               <p>MARY ALLEN re-examined. The horse the man was riding seemed very dirty; I did not notice whether it was fatigued - I did not take such particular notice of the horse in the chaise cart, and cannot say whether it was dirty or not, for the cart bid the horse.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LITTLE. I went into the stable between three and four o'clock on Saturday afternoon; there were three horses there, only two of them were dirty - I do not think one was more dirty than the other; they seemed rather fatigued - I did not notice whether one was more fatigued than the other; they were both brown mares, and the third which I did not clean, was brown - that was not dirty; I was about an hour in the stable: I went again on Sunday morning, between nine and ten o'clock - I saw the horses last in the stable between eleven and twelve on Sunday; I left about eleven - the two horses I cleaned were standing in the stable - all three were in one stall; neither of the mares had a bridle or saddle on on Saturday.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BAYFORD. It was a chaise-cart and harness that I let, but no horse.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HOSKINS. I did not go into the stable after letting it, till after the 23rd.</p>
               <p>JAMES WHITWELL. I seized the horses about ten o'clock on Sunday morning - Little was not there then; I found only two mares then - I had been to the stable about half-past eight or nine o'clock that morning; there were then three mares there - I returned about half-past nine, and one was gone; that belonged to Mr. Holmes - I knew it before, for three or four years.</p>

            . Q.Which man handed the bay mare to the stable? A. I did not notice; I did not tell the Magistrate the other man rode the bay mare to the stable, and came first - the man that rode it went round for the key to Deen's, before the prisoner came down; the prisoner's cart was going by my door when I first saw him- he was driving it, and the man with the horse had then hung his horse on the stable, and was gone round to Deen's for the key; I first saw Brooks in the chaise, but did not see the other man till he came back from Deen's - I did not see them come together; the bay mare was fastened to the stable door by the reins, at the time Brooks drove down with the chaise.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Then you did not see in what direction the man came? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the mare till ten o'clock on Saturday morning, when I met the other man at Kingston with it, and he came home with me to the stables; I never saw her again till she was taken away - it was my own horse that I drove in the cart; they were both taken together, but they have advertised it all round the country, and cannot find an owner - Ward's mare is the one the young man rode, and he got there before me.</p>

On Tuesday before that, there was a gentleman came to take a ride, and he said to my foreman, let me look at my old saddle, I have not seen it a good while, he looks at it and says, I will give you this saddle; so Thursday, after looking two or three hours, my man came to me to my door and knocked, and says, I have not seen that saddle the gentleman gave me, no says I, then if that is the case there must be somebody about the premises that has taken it and the other; we looked over and we found two or three other saddles missing; but before that, I must tell you, that I asked the prisoner on Thursday evening if he knew any thing of this saddle that was missing, he said he knew nothing about it; he was a servant to me, an hostler, had lived with me two or three months, or rather better; then on the evening of Thursday I challenged him very strongly and he denied it, before I went for the constable he denied every thing, and we had him into the saddle room and we challenged him very strictly, we had a long altercation, at last he owned to taking that saddle that the gentleman gave the man, and I asked him where it was, I made him no promise; I asked him what he had gone with it, says he, I have only taken that one, says he, it is underneath the manger at the further end of the nine stalls, well says I, come and let us go and see for it; the constable was present; then we went and he took the saddle out, and after that we took him and had him into the saddle room again; I told him he must naturally know where the others were, and he owned to the others, and told us where he sold them and where to find them; I think he sold three saddles to one Lund, a collar maker in Cow Cross, Windmill-street; and one saddle and bridle since; another saddle and bridle was found at the butcher's, where he had left it, who gave him a joint of meat upon it; Lund has been here but he is not now to be found for these two hours; Lund gave him five shillings for the one bridle and saddle, I suppose it is worth a guinea.</p>

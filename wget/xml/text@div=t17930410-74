               <p>Q. Do you know how long you had lost these things? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This woman who has surrendered to take her trial on your charge, has been employed at your house and worked for your wife? - Never employed to my knowledge for my wife, she worked for other people.</p>
               <p>Q. I see which way you are now driving; she brought an action against you I believe, how much does she claim for work and labour? - I don't know how much exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not sixteen pounds? - Yes, it is</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say you did not know, perhaps she has arrested you on it? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. So if you convict this woman there is an end of the action? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you lived long enough in the world to know that a felony is a set off to an action? Perhaps you don't know that a person who is convicted of felony forfeits all they are worth. Was you never taken up for felony? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Never for picking pockets? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Never laid hold of for such a charge? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after she brought the action, did you bring the indictment against her? - I cannot tell to a day.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said to any body that if she persisted in her action, commenced against you, you would be damned if you would not transport her? - Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Brush up your memory a little; do you know a Mr. Wheeler? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have you not said so to him, or words to that effect? - I am sure I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to Mr. Wheeler about this affair? - Nothing at all as I know of, the man was in our house.</p>

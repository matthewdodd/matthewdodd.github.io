                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, at Staines—I produce the lease of a piece of land at Stanwell, from a Mr. Drake to Mr. Darling—I am the attesting witness—it is dated 19th March, 1866, for ninety-nine years, barring one day, at a ground rent of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I should think the land was a bare acre—I also produce a mortgage of that land, with a house erected on it, by Darling to the West Middlesex Building Society, dated</p>

               <p>14th January, 1867, for a consideration of 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also produce an assign<lb></lb>ment of the equity of redemption from Darling to Anthony Simpson, dated 23rd October, 1867, for the consideration of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am the attesting witness to that—I prepared the deed, I believe by the instruction of Dar<lb></lb>ling, accompanied by Spearing and Simpson—Darling and Spearing gave me the full instructions—Darling, Spearing, and Simpson all called in the second week in October—no consideration money passed in my presence when it was executed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who is the owner in fee of the land that went by the lease of 19th March? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe Mr. Sidney Smith—I believe no pre<lb></lb>mium was paid for the lease—I prepared the lease from Drake to Darling—I acted for both parties—it was a sub-lease for the residue of Drake's term—at that time there was no building upon it—I believe it was intended to have buildings, and market gardens in the rear—there is a covenant in the deed that Darling shall erect at least one tenement, to contain six rooms—I was solicitor to the building society, and acted for Darling as well, in the usual way—I don't recollect that monies had been advanced by Messrs. Ashby, the bankers, at that time to Darling; it is very possible—I don't know that the 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to the bankers, and not to Darling—there is a provision in the mortgage deed that upon failure of the payment of the instalments they shall have a right to sell—it was an absolute mortgage, but it was supposed to be paid off in ten years and a half, and the deed would then be endorsed receipted, and handed to him—they are monthly instal<lb></lb>ments—I don't know how much was in arrear—if they sold there would be no equity of redemption—Spearing, Darling, and Simpson, first instructed me as to the assignment of the equity of redemption on Wednesday, 15th October, 1867; that appears in my call-book—those were the first instruc<lb></lb>tions which I really, <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi>, received to prepare that deed, and on that and the following day they called again, and a day was fixed to settle, and they again called on 23rd October—it is possible that I may have said I could not tell who gave me instructions to prepare that deed, because I had not looked; at my books when I was asked that before the Magistrate I said I could not tell how long before its execution I had received instructions, I had not then looked at my books—I said there was a delay in making it out, because I was pressed for business; that did not mean delay between the original instructions and the actual execution—I saw Darling one evening in September, at Mr. Walker's, the bookseller, and he then said he should shortly want an assignment prepared—when the matter was first before the Magistrate, I was present only as Clerk to the Justices, not as a witness, and I was merely asked about the handwriting—I have no recollection of Spearing coming to me in September, and my then saying I would get it done as soon as possible—I knew Darling before—I don't recollect having acted for him before, or for Spearing; he is a publican at Staines, and a furniture broker—I don't know that he had a bill of sale—I do not know a Mr. Gristwood—I never heard of him till this matter came up—I have heard from the bankrupt's daughter that Gristwood advanced 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I know nothing of it—I don't know that I ever saw Anthony Simpson, jun., of Iver Heath, baker—Iver Heath is seven or eight miles from Staines—I know nothing of the Simpson family.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brickmaker, at Shepperton, and am the creditors' assignee under this bankruptcy—in July and August, 1867, I sold some bricks to the defendant, 32, 600 in all, they came to 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he</p>

               <p>gave me this bill at two months, which was dishonoured—in October, I saw some of those bricks at the Vine beer-shop—as near as I could count them there was about 8000—I also saw some at a place called Frog's Island, where the defendant had ten cottages and about an acre of ground—I went again to the Vine beer shop in January, 1868, and the bricks were then gone, and in May I drove by Frog's Island, and those were also gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When the bill was given were the bricks all delivered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I commenced proceedings against him directly the bill was dishonoured—I found he had absconded—he had bought some potatoes of me in July, and paid for them—I would not allow him to have them until he had done so—he was introduced to me by Spearing—I believe the defendant supplied two or three loads of straw to my son—that was struck off the balance of the potatoes—I was not very much annoyed at losing my money—I never said I would stick to the man because he had dishonoured my bill—I said before the Magistrate that I was the only one that had carried the case on.</p>

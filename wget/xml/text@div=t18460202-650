                  </hi>. I live in Blackfriars-road, with my mother, Ann Giles. The prisoner was in our service since August last—I left a crown piece in my waistcoat pocket, in the top room, on the 15th of Jan., about eleven o'clock in the morning—when I came back, in about a quarter of an hour, the crown was gone—there were two or three notches on the edge of the crown—I came down from the room—I passed the prisoner, who was going up stairs, and as I went up again I passed her coming down—I got a policeman—when he came, the prisoner said she would go up stairs and find the five-shilling piece, if we would not go up with her—she would not tell us where it was—she said she would rather go to the station—I went up stairs—there is a trap door at top—I went up, and looked through some laths—the prisoner came up to</p>

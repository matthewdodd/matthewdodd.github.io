On Wednesday night, 31st Oct., I was in the Woolwich-road, at a quarter before ten o'clock—I heard a noise in an unfinished house there—I looked up and saw Jackson at the attic-window—I went to the back of the house, and found Rogers in a trench, made in the area—I asked him what he was doing there—he said he came for a neces<lb></lb>sary purpose—Jackson was still at the window—I asked Rogers if he knew there was any one up there—he said he did not—I told Jackson to come down, and he did—I asked him what he was doing up there—he said, "Nothing"—I took them into the road, and said they must come with me—Rogers made his escape—I took Jackson to the station—in going, he said he had been there, and cut off about 6 lbs. of lead, and I should find it at the back of the house—I locked him up, and gave a description of Rogers to another officer, and he was brought in about half-past two—after I had locked Jackson up, I went back to the house—I found another officer there who had found the lead that was cut off—I matched it, and it fitted to the roof—there was about 8 lbs. of lead found on the ground, near where Rogers had been—I matched that with the lead on the roof, and it all matched—I found three-quarters of a cwt. more lead on the top cut off ready to throw down.</p>

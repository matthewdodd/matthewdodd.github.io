            . I live at Dunbar, in Scotland. On the 8th of July I was in St. Mary-axe; I had been to receive two sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and one shilling; they were in my waistcoat pocket - I went through Whitechapel, and got into <placeName id="t18290716-111-crimeloc634">Wentworth-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it impossible for you to make a mistake? A. It is not possible to mistake them - I had a little drop of drink, but was not out of reason; I was sober enough - I was not drunk; the Magistrate did not refuse to commit them that night because I was drunk - I did not lay down in the office<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160046"></xptr>and kick about, to show the Magistrate the way it was done: but when they showed me into an inner room I laid down, as I had no bed to go to - I afterwards was taken to the watch-house, and picked out the two women; I did not say I would swear to them - I told the Magistrate one was not the woman, and I told the witness so before I went to the office - I said in two minutes after that she was not the woman; I never said she was the woman who tore the cuff off my coat - three women were brought before me; I said they were some of the women who robbed me, and in a minute after I said they were not the women - I did not point out another young woman in the yard of the office - I had two glasses of gin and a pint of beer that day; I was not drunk.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you say about an inner room? A. I went into an inner room in the office, as I had not a farthing to pay my lodging - the officer said I might lay down in the watch-house; I laid down on a form to go to sleep - I did not lay down on the floor to show how this happened.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor came to me on the 8th of July and said he had been robbed in Wentworth-street by four or five girls - he described one or two of them; I think I took nine or ten- I got them all into the City of Norwich public-house, Wentworth-street; I made them all stand round in the tap-room - I brought him in, and he almost immediately identified Bevis; he at first passed over Jones, as she stood with her back to the window, but as she was going out of the tap-room, on seeing her face, he instantly turned round and said Jones was one of the girls - he had described a cross-eyed woman; Jones does squint - he had not fixed on any other woman at that time; he went to the watch-house that night, having no home - on the night of the examination he told the Magistrate how they had attacked him, and laid down on his back to describe the way they got on him, and tore his coat; they were committed the next day, and I received orders from the Magistrate to take him to the work-house, as he had no place to go to, and no money - it was not to see any body; what passed there I do not know - when I first saw him he was the worse for liquor; he had been drinking, but was capable of knowing what he was doing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If he meant to tell the truth, must he not have known that he laid on the floor in the office? A. He certainly must know that - I did not bring the women one by one into the street - I sent them out as he could not identify them.</p>

            . I am master of Whitechapel work-house; the prosecutor was brought there to be taken care of. On the Monday an officer brought a woman there, and requested me to let two women be placed with her - I called the first two I saw, Wood was one; the prosecutor was then asked if those were the persons who robbed him - he immediately pointed to Wood and the one who stood next to her, who had come from the office; he said Wood tore his coat and said to her, "You know you are the person who held me down and tore my coat;" I knew myself she had not been out of the work-house for a fortnight or three weeks, and told him it was impossible - I think he said more than once that she was one; he did not express the least doubt of her - but when he got to the office he would not swear to either of them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took a woman named Potter to the work-house, and placed her by the side of two women - the prosecutor was told to look at them; he immediately laid hold of Wood and said, "That is the one who laid hold of the cuff of my coat and tore it; and that is the other who held my arm - she held me down while a third took my money;" I told him over and over again to be cautious - he said positively they were the women; the master said it was impossible Wood could be - I took Potter to the office, and he said there, she was not the woman, she was too thin; and at the work-house gate, he said he was mistaken in Wood - be had declared several times she was one of them - Higgley had said it was impossible.</p>

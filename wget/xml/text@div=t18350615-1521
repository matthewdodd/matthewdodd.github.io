The prisoner is my mother—I am sixteen yean old next April, and am sister of the child who died—it was five weeks old, I believe—it had not been christened—it died this month—my mother had nursed it until the last week, and then it was taken from her by Mrs. Chapman—I had observed a mark on the cheek of the child on the Friday; it died on the next Thursday—my mother seemed fond of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Chapman, a sawyer, and live in Well's-yard, Goodman's-fields. I was nurse to the child—it was twenty-six days old—it was the son of John Goff and the prisoner—I was present at the birth—it was a very small child—I did not know the pri<lb></lb>soner before the child was born—I suckled the child the fortnight I was with her, which was the first fortnight—I gave it the breast two or three times a day—the mother suckled it as well, and it had arrow-root and milk—she appeared unable to give it sufficient nourishment; as she had fits, I understand—I never saw her in but one—I took the child from her after it was ill used, but it would not take the breast—I saw her stand at the window on the Thursday afternoon, and strike the child a violent blow with her open hand—but I could not see what part of the child the blow went on—I never saw her strike it afterwards—when I went to see the child, its mouth was bleeding—its upper lip bruised—the eye turning black, and the cheek Swollen—I am positive she struck the child as hard as she could with the open hand—I was on the ground-floor in the court, and she was at the first-floor window—I asked her if it was the child she had struck—she said, "Yes," and she had struck it before—I never found her otherwise than in her right mind—the child died eight days after—it took no nourishment in the mean time, but the breast, which I used to milk down its throat—it never would suck afterwards—it could not suck—I went over to her three or four hours after I saw the blow struck—her daughter sent for me—I saw no mark on the child's face when it was dead—I showed it to Mr. Liddle, a surgeon, on the Friday as I had it on the Thursday night—there were marks of violence on the mouth and eye then—the daughter applied to me to take it, and I took it and kept it two days and two nights—I told the prisoner I would not let her have it again till I saw her husband, and I did not see him till the following morning, and he told me to take care of his baby—she appeared to treat it kindly before I saw the blow struck—I said to her, "You brute, what did you strike your baby for like this?"—she said, "Do you not like it"—I said no, and took the baby away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in White-lion-street, Good<lb></lb>man's-fields. I examined the person of the child after death, on the follow<lb></lb>ing day, by the desire of the constable—I saw it at the father's house—I do not know whether the prisoner was in the room at the time—I saw the child in its life-time, in a very emaciated state—the first question I asked was, whether it was a nine-months child; for I thought it was a premature birth—I was informed that it was a child of nine months—I was struck with its squalid appearance, and consider it must have been totally neglected from its birth, or was labouring under disease—there was one or two small bruises on the face or cheek—I do not think they could be the immediate cause of death—my opinion is, they could not hare caused its death—I think a child receiving a blow on the face, to cause bruises, would be shook at the time—I cannot say whether that shaking might have caused a rupture of blood-vessels in the head, but the bruises could not have caused death—in my judgment, the cause of death was a blow given on the head, from some cause or other—whether it had fallen down I cannot say—I examined it under the apprehension that it had not died from violent means, and did not take another surgeon with me; but when I made an incision over the scalp, I found a considerable quantity of extravasated blood, and got another surgeon to assist me; and, on further examination, I considered a blow must have been given on the head, to produce the extravasation—a blow with the flat hand would be sufficient in so young a child—there was a considerable quantity of extna<lb></lb>vasated blood on the brain and under the scalp, on the bone of the cra<lb></lb>nium, as well as within the bone—there was no fracture of the skull—a fracture seldom happens where the skull is so tender; it would rather yield to the blow—I saw one mark on the upper part of the bone of the cranium, which, in my judgment, was produced by violence—the prisoner was in the room when I went to examine the body, but I requested the might leave the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does it not often appear that a blow on the right side of the skull causes a fracture on the left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That arises from its coming in contact with some substance—a slap on the head with an open hand would came the appearances I saw—my opinion is, that the child could not have sur<lb></lb>vived seven or eight days after so much violence; but that is merely my opinion—it would not take eight days for an infant to die from such a blow—when I first saw it, it was labouring under concussion of the brain—that was three days before its death—I saw the mark on the cheek then—the immediate cause of death must have been much more recent than eight days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the appearances on the brain, in my judgment, were the cause of death—it is almost impossible to say when it was inflicted—the quantity of extravasated blood might be more or less—a certain quantity might have been poured out at the time of the accident, and the vessel be<lb></lb>come plugged up, and afterwards poured out again—I imagine it to have been a recent injury—it might have been as much as a week before, in my opinion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183506150147"></xptr>
               <p>—I formed my opinion from a case which came before me three months previous, where a child fell from the nurse's arms on the ground; pre<lb></lb>cisely the same appearances were found, and the child lived a month—it epends on a variety of circumstances when death follows—in that instance, there was a large quantity of blood external of the cranium—it is not im<lb></lb>possible that a vessel might have been raptured, and continued bleeding at tervals within the brain.</p>

"—she said, "I did it"—I said, "You did what?"—she said, I smacked the child's face"—I asked her why she smacked the child's face—she made no answer, but began to fret—she appeared overcome with grief, and in a rery melancholy way indeed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, of 74, Kellett Road, Brixton—I formed the prisoner's acquaintance eighteen months ago, she was a domestic servant in the same road—I was in the habit for some time of going out with her, and there was a close intimacy between us which ceased in April, 1877—I was at home on 24th March, 1878, about 9.30, and there was a knock at the door—my servant opened it and I went out and saw the prisoner in the passage—I said "What do you want?"—she said "I want to speak to you"—I said "You had better get out"—she made a rush at me—I took hold of her by both arms and put her completely outside the door—I let go of her to shut the door and she put her knee in and I could not shut it—I opened it to give her a push and saw the gleam of something in her right hand and felt my throat touched—I took hold of her arm, turned it up, and saw that it was a razor, open—there was blood on it, and then I knew that I was cut—I took it from her, and said "You will have to go to the police-station"—I took her there myself—on the way she said "What have I done? Let me go and I will never trouble you again"—a constable overtook us and I gave her into his charge, with the razor—when we got to the station I put my hand to my chin and found I was bleeding—a doctor was sent for who dressed my wound—she has called at my house on several occa<lb></lb>sions and asked to see me, and I have shut the door and told her to go away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The wound is perceptible now—I have known her about two years very intimately—I was not on good terms with her as late as February this year, not at all after April—I cannot positively swear whether I went to Thames Ditton with her in June—she has been trying to frighten me because I formed the acquaintance of <hi rend="italic">another lady</hi>—I pushed her out on to the flags in front of the house, and we eventually struggled in the road—I lost a great quantity of blood—I had hold of her going to the station—I believe there were men lodgers in the house where she was.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I am divisional surgeon to the police at Brixton—I was sent for to the station and found the prosecutor suffering from an incised wound in the upper part of his neck, about 3 inches long, passing from the centre downwards—it was a superficial wound, one likely to bleed a great deal, but not dangerous except from its situation—it went within three-quarters of an inch of the carotid artery—the under tissues were slightly divided—it was a clean incised wound by a sharp instrument—the bleeding had partially stopped when I arrived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Any wound dividing the skin would bleed freely—he was quite well in three days—it healed very rapidly.</p>

               <p>Q. No gentleman with her? - No gentleman at all. She represented herself to be the wife of a captain Greville, and that she had been used to live genteel; and as a confirmation of what she said she had a recommendation to one Mr. Robinson, who gave her a very good character, and said, she would prove a very good lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Robinson? - A tailor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160202"></xptr>Wild-court, Wild street, near Lincoln's Inn fields. They gave her a most excellent character as any person could possibly have; in consequence of this we let her the apartment, and Mrs. Greville took possession on the 29th of July: but she had not been there many days before we had reason to suppose that we had been very much imposed upon, with regard to the character of the lady, and of course we gave her warning to quit at the week's end; she said, it would be putting her to very great inconvenience to quit the apartment so abruptly, and wished to stay another week till the fortnight was up; I told her it was my wish to be perfectly genteel to her, and if it would put her to so much inconvenience, she should stay another week. Then the day before the second week was up she went away and did not return to the house that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did she go from you? - Tuesday the 11th of September. We never received a farthing of her money. We could not take possession of the room; the drawers were all locked; she represented herself as out of town, the servant was there, but she came back on Monday the 17th, and slept in our house. She went out again the next morning, and we see no more of her till she was taken. What put us in possession of these facts was, after she slept in the house on Monday, the servant came in and asked my servant if her mistress was returned; she said, no. The servant went up to turn down the bed against her mistress came, and went out again immediately, and did not return any more. The next morning I went up and found one sheet off the bed; in consequence of this we had the closets and drawers opened, and found the things missing, a silver pepper castor. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things all let to her in lodgings? - Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were there when she went into the lodgings? - Yes, I see them there.</p>


               <p>Q. When was she taken up? - The Friday following as Mrs. De Rosia sent to enquire her character at our house, and we found she was not far off, and we went and apprehended her. She had the two lodgings at the same time, mine at eight and twenty shillings a week, and Mrs. De Rosia's at a guinea and a half, and was robbing both at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. That you don't know of your own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took the lodgings of Mrs. Small.</p>

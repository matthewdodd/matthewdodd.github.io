On the 24th. of February in the evening a young woman of my acquaintance knocked at my door, I opened the door, my acquaintance and this woman came in; she asked me to let the prisoner lodge with me that night and the next; she slept that night with me and my husband; she told me the next morning that she had a little business at the war office about her husband; she went out, and when she returned she said she could not get the business finished till the next day, and that a boot maker at Charing-cross would give her a job of boot strapping, that she could get nine shillings the next day, and begged me to call her in the morning at six o'clock, and when the work was done she would pay me for her lodging and breakfast. I called her at six, she said it was too early; about seven she got up, had her breakfast and went away; she came back in half an hour for me to lend her twopence to buy some hemp, I gave her the twopence, she went away and I went out to work; on my coming home I saw her by the Admiralty, I stopped to see whether she was going into the place where she said she worked at, she passed by it; I went up to her and asked her the reason of her telling me such a falsehood, I found my gown wrapped up in a sheet under her arm; I asked her how she came to take it, she said she could not get work at the shop unless she paid her footing; I took them from her, I forced her home with me, and then I found another sheet and a shift upon her. On the Friday she had sold the shift to me for two shillings, and on the Saturday she took it.</p>

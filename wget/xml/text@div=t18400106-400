                  </hi>I am the wife of Henry Goodman, and live in Burgess-place, Vincent-square, Westminster. On the morning of the 22nd of December I was in a grocer's shop at the corner of Strutton<lb></lb>ground—the prisoner and another young person were there—they were</p>

               <p>close to me—the shop was very full of people—when I came to pay for my goods I missed 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a half-crown from my pocket—the pri<lb></lb>soner was gone then—Mary Slinsby had been in the shop—I saw her outside the shop, and spoke to her—she pointed oat the prisoner to me, and I accused her of taking my money—she used abusive language, and said she had not—I said I could swear to it—she pulled a silver coin, a half-sovereign, half-a-crown, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of her pocket, besides my money, and said, "You had better swear to it all"—one of my shillings was marked down the face—she threw one on the ground—I picked it up, and found it was the marked one which I had had in my pocket with the other money when I went into the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. When she accused me of taking the money I pulled out all the money I bad, and said, "You had better say all this is yours"—she immediately snatched 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my hand, and knocked half-a-sove-reign out of my hand—I said I would wait till a policeman came, and when one came I said she bad taken 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my hand—he said, "Will you give her in charge? "—I said, "Yes, " and when we got to the station-house she said this shilling was here, the could swear to it, for it was marked—she carried the money herself all the way to the station<lb></lb>house, and when the inspector asked where it was, she gave it into the policeman's hands. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. The policeman carried the money to the station-house—I gave it to him in the street—I am quite sure the marked shilling was part of the money the prisoner took out of her pocket—I had no other money about me.</p>

                  </hi>I live with my mother in Simon's-buildings, Old Pye-street. I was at the grocer's shop in Strutton-ground—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner there standing close up against Mrs. Goodman with her hand straight down in Mrs. Goodman's pocket—a girl who was with me, said, "Look at that woman picking her pocket"—I am quite sure her hand was in Mrs. Goodman's pocket—I saw her take it out—she went out of the shop, and left the other girl who was with her for the tea and sugar—when Mrs. Goodman came out I told her what I had seen.</p>

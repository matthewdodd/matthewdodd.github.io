                  </hi>. I live in Little Shire-lane, in the back room, first floor; the prisoner occupied the front room. On the 22nd of March I returned home about half-past eleven o'clock at night—I heard the prisoner come in about ten minutes after twelve—I was in my own room—when I heard him I opened my room-door, and stood at it, and, in consequence of what my mother had told me, I asked him why he hit my mother while I was in the country, and said he was a d----d vagabond for doing such a thing—I had no sooner said so than I was stabbed on the eyebrow with some instrument—I directly called out that I was stabbed, and made a rush towards him—he was just at his own door, and I received a cut across my nose, which cut a piece of my nose off—I do not remember any more till I was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Cullen, in Little Shire-lane; the prisoner lived in the same house. On the evening of the 22nd of March I heard the prisoner come up the stairs—Cullen went and stood at the threshold of his own room, which is right by the side of the stairs, and said, "Connor, what did you strike my mother for? you ought to be ashamed of yourself, for she is old enough to be your mother"—I heard Cullen say, "I am stabbed, Iam stabbed—I came to the door with a light, and saw the prisoner with a knife in his hand—I saw him run at Cullen with the knife, and draw the knife across his nose—Cullen was leaning on the landing at the time, and went to catch hold of the prisoner, to prevent his running away—I looked at his eye, which was bleed<lb></lb>ing very much—he rose his arm again to stab him, which I prevented, and got a slight wound in my arm through doing so.</p>

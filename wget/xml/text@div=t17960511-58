I returned about nine o'clock, the warehouse was not shut up; my servant that usually shuts the warehouse was out. I came down in a quarter of an hour to shut the warehouse myself, and on opening the private door into the warehouse the bell was rung, and I went to the door and found the prisoner in custody of the officer. I was informed by the officer that the prisoner was breaking into my house; the door of the warehouse is a glass-door; on examining it I found the glass was broke, the door was bolted and chained; the bolt was undone. I saw it bolted and chained in the morning; the warehouse is unoccupied and opened for the benefit of the air to circulate through; there are two doors, the warehouse door is unconnected with the private door that leads to the house, the warehouse makes a part of the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Is the person that fastened the warehouse here? - A. He is not.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you discover the face of a man without a light? - A. I don't think I could; it was a quarter past nine.</p>
               <p>Q. You won't take upon yourself to swear either way? - A. No.</p>

            , in Wood-street: On Wednesday the 4th of May, I saw some men loitering about Mr. Slack's door; I thought them thieves.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? - A. About ten minutes or a quarter after nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see their countenances? - A. No. There were three of them, one on one side of the way, and two against Mr. Slack's warehouse. I walked a little way, and came back on the opposite side of the way, and one of the men had his arm through the casement that opens into the warehouse. I went to the pork shop, and told Mr. Newman I believed there were some men breaking into Mr. Slack's warehouse, and he came with me. There were two at the door when Mr. Newman came, and he laid hold of one with each hand, and one came from the opposite side of the way and struck him with a stick which stunned him, and he let one of them loose; he secured the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Was it quite dark? - A. Yes; you could not discern the countenance.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to answer that you could not discern the countenance? - A. I thought you meant to know if I could swear to his face.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a reward if you convict this man? - A. No, I don't know there is any reward; I have heard there is a reward if men are hung.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you been talking with Newman about a reward? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard there was a reward for taking a house-breaker? - A. No; unless they are hung.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you that? - A. Mr. Slack.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he tell you? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before you went to the Justice's? - A. I don't know whether it was before or after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it since you have been attending this Court? - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. I with you to tell me when Mr. Slack the prosecutor told you there was 40l. reward for a person when he is hung? - A. I cannot recollect, it was since he was examined at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>NEWMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer; on Wednesday the 4th of May, about ten minutes after nine, the last witness, and a person that keeps a pork-shop, came to fetch me, and I went to Mr. Shack's house; I stopped on the opposite side of the way about a minute, and then I went over the way and caught the prisoner, with his hand through a pane of glass, and another man with him; I seized them both; I called out for assistance, and I immediately received a blow on the head, which stunned me; I did not know whether it was a pistol or what; I secured the prisoner, the other got away; I took him into the house, he made a great deal of resistance, he would not be handcuffed; I was not armed, I rung the bell and the prosecutor came out; I charged him to assist me, which he did; when I went in the inside the door was about two inches open, the lock was undone, and the lower bolt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp (To Slack). Q. I believe you have prosecuted several times here before? - A. Once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you knew there was a reward if this man was convicted? - A. I knew there was a reward upon all convictions.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with the boy upon the subject? - A. None but what was accidental.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with him on this business about the reward? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said there was a reward if the man was hung? - A. Never to my knowledge; I don't recollect whether I said it or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you have not said it? - A. I will not take upon me to swear it.</p>

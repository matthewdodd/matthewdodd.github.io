               <p>Q. When did this happen to you - A. On the 1st of May the note was taken out of a cash-box which I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse these people of it - A. I thought it could be nobody else but this girl. The note was in a tin cash-box, in my room, up stairs. I left the box locked, and I found it locked in my bedroom. The woman prisoner was a servant to me. The ten-pound note was the undermost note in the box. There was fifteen pounds in the box in notes. The prisoner had lived with me ten months.</p>
               <p>Q. What does your family consist of - A. Three children, my wife, myself, and my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. And why do you accuse her of taking of it - A. I thought it was impossible any body else could take it. Nobody else was in the room but herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your note - A. Yes. I knew the address of the note. I had it stopped at the bank, and traced it home to the father of the girl, with his name on it. The number of it was 5,567, a ten-pound; dated, 25th of February, 1812.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH LALLIMENT. My father is quite innocent.</p>
               <p>JOHN KNIGHT. I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoners. I searched them, and found nothing at all; but I have got part of the produce of the ten pound note. I found a gown and a petticoat that they had purchased: this is it: I found it in the apartment where both of the prisoners lodged.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Bank. I produce the note, number 5567, dated 25th February, 1812, 10 l. Tomlin. That is the same note the prisoner passed to me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Newton. Is that your note - A. Yes: I think the daughter must have given the note to the father. He was at our house on the Sunday. I think he must have taken it away then. He seldom would come to the house and ask for the girl in a proper manner. He used to come about the house and make a motion to her to come to him. He seldom came into the house: she never went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Susannah Lalliment's Defence. My father is not guilty. I brought away the note to him. I asked my mistress leave to go out. She gave me leave. She said I should go out after tea. My mistress told me, if I did not give her the note, she would have me searched. I was searched; and I went home to my father. He said, what brought you here? I said, I have left my place. I asked my father for four shillings and a halfpenny; he gave it me. I took it to my mistress; and, on my coming back, I gave my father the note. I told him I found the note in the street.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She left me on account of the note. Mrs. Newton did not think proper of keeping her on account of this note.</p>

            . I often found money in the lodgers rooms. The last money I found was three shillings. I told my mistress. She said, you put it up on his drawers. I said, if I thought he put it there to try me, I would keep it. She said I should be much to blame if I did not. I did not put it on the drawer. I kept it. When I saw the young man, I told him. He said, put it on the table. When I saw this note, I could neither read nor write. It struck me it was put there to see whether I would take it.</p>

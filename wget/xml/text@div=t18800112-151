               <p>a few minutes afterwards Inwood came in and had twopennyworth of whisky—she spoke to Harris and the man, and appeared to know them very well—I think the man asked for the whisky, and while I had gone for hot water a shilling was placed on the counter—I took it up and threw it on a cabinet and found it did not ring—I tried it in the tester and it bent—I then ran to the till and got the other shilling, which bent also—the man the ran out without my speaking to him—I sent for the landlord, and the prisoners were given in custody with the shillings.</p>

I am barmaid at the Two Blue Posts, Laystall Street, about a quarter of an hour's walk from the Three Compasses—on Saturday night, 30th November, Harris came in with a young man, about 6.5, and shortly afterwards Inwood came in with a man, who called for a Pot of ale and gave me a shilling; I put it into the till and gave him 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Change—they seemed to know each other, they all four drank of the ale—the same man then called for a quartern of rum, which came to 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave me another shilling, and I gave him 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change; they all four drank of the rum, and the same man called for another quartern and again paid with a shilling; I found it was bad and showed it to another barmaid, who broke it and gave it back to him, and asked him if it was one of his own make—he said "No," and paid with a good sixpence—they all four went away Together—I was too busy to notice whether the other coins were bad, but I saw Miss Farnsworth find two more bad shillings in the till.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly porter in the service of Mr. Galibert, in Union-street, St. Saviour's, Southwark. I went into his employ five years ago—I have known the prisoner Carroll about nine months, and Bou<lb></lb>langer about six months, he is a hatter, and lives in Worcester-street, about five minutes' walk from Mr. Galibert's—Mr. Galibert is a manufac<lb></lb>turer of silk plush, used for hats—I first became acquainted with Bou<lb></lb>langer by taking to him my own hat to have it cleaned and brushed up—he said if I had any pieces of plush about in the warehouse, to bring them in—that was about Oct. last—I took him in some corner pieces and long pieces about that time—they were of this sort (<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>)—he knew where I lived, and that I was in the prosecutor's service—when I took them, he used to give me sometimes 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a glass of gin—I took things similar to these, about eight or nine times—after that he said these pieces were no use at all, he could not cut anything out of them; he said if I had a piece, I could bring it in—he did not say what sort of a piece—I had taken those pieces out of the drawer; when they were cut off, they were flung in there—after he had spoken to me about a larger piece, I recollect taking a large piece in Dec.—it was a whole piece, about forty yards—I did not take it all at once, I took fifteen or sixteen yards first, and the other afterwards—for that he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether, by instalments—I believe that piece was upwards of forty yards—I do not know the value of it—the next I took was in Feb.—I saw Carroll about that time, at his own house—he works at a wharf—I told him I would bring a piece to him, and he said he would get rid of it—I took him a piece of plush, about thirty yards—I took that at once—I took a part of that about six yards, or not quite</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 30, Union-street. I have been a silk plush importer for these twenty years—we take stock every month, and on 30th Dec. we found there was a piece of plush missing, a piece which cost me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—we sell it about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—it contained about forty-three or forty-five yards—after that I found that ay porter had charged me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. extra in some charges—I gave him notice to leave at the end of Jan.—on 15th Feb. we took stock, and missed a piece of the best goods, which had only come into the house a few days back—I called Hurne, and said, "There is another piece missed, I am afraid you are the thief"—he said, "No, I am not," but afterwards he confessed it—on that I discharged him—I afterwards sent for him again, to know if he would acknowledge it; he acknowledged it, and I sent for the policeman—I went with the policeman to Boulanger—I saw him, and the policeman spoke to him—a small quantity of the first piece of plush was found there,</p>

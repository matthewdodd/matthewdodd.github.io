On Monday the 28th of January, about eight in the evening, the prisoner was brought into my shop. The witness said he had broke the window, and had taken out some goods. I had the window examined; two pieces of silk ribband were gone: I had him before a justice, and he was committed. I did not find the ribband.</p>

            . I had been with the horses: I am waterman to the coaches. Mr. King's son came, and seeing the prisoner, with another man, walk by the window, he thought they had some bad design. We took notice that they walked backward and forward several times. I saw him break the window, and put his hand in: the third time he put his hand in, I took him. I was just the breadth of the street from him. The two first times, he passed his hand to his companion, and, I suppose, gave him something I could not see whether he took any thing: I did not see any thing in his hand when I took him: I brought him into the shop.</p>

            . I am a coachman: I was that night in Oxford Road between seven and eight: there came a young man by me; he said he was looking at two young men, and said, he thought they were going to rob some shop. They looked into the shop as if they were waiting for somebody in the shop; I said, I thought they were. We stood some time watching them; at last we heard one of the glasses crack, and the prisoner was at it: he was at it several times: after that, I heard it crack again: I said, They have broke the window: we got the waterman to look at them: he took notice of them: the prisoner came, and put his hand into the window: they walked down, and came up again; and then he put his hand in again; then my coach went on: I did not see any more. Then Jonashan Horton the waterman took hold of him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had turned my back, but had not been out to sit down. I was in the shop with two servants, with several persons, not less than a dozen, about three quarters of an hour before: I had examined whether the ribbands in the drawer were right. It is a rule with us to keep the ribbands, so that we can tell whether any thing is taken out by any customer: the row of ribbands next the pane of glass was gone.</p>

               <p>I had just come from work: I was waiting for my fellow workmen: we were going to the club in Tyburn Road; then this gentleman came and took hold of me, and said I was the person who had stole the ribbands. I had some witnesses here, but they are gone, because they thought my trial would not come on to-night.</p>

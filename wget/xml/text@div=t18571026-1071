               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What date was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Feb. 14th—the, prisoner enters the amounts in the book as a voucher for me—I saw him write his name—I was not paying him other sums at the time—I paid him other sums the same afternoon—retail customers come in from time to time, and it was part of his duty to attend to them—there are four of us Servants now, there are sometimes six—the prisoner and Mr. Ray keep the books—I know Baker, he obtains orders for the establishment—I have seen the prisoner and him together several times.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose you keep this book yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is my discharge from Oliver—at the time I pay the money to him he puts it down, and puts his name under—he also enters the amount in another large book—I do not know what that is called—I call out the names of the sums, he enters them down here in a book which he has before him, and I go away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Powell and Sons, of Bristol The prisoner was in our employ—it was his duty to account for goods which he received, every month by means of a written order—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are his accounts for Feb, and May—in the Feb account he accounts for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Winsor and Newton, instead of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he charges me with 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. discount allowed—he was not authorised to allow that—the amount of the receipt is 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and dis<lb></lb>count deducted 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 14th Feb. there is not the sum of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. accounted for from Mr. Murrell, nor does his name appear—the entries in this book are the prisoner's writing—it is the carman's book—in the May account our account against Corbin and Co. was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; discount 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. has been deducted, and the prisoner has received 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., net cash 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is all he has accounted for from them—these three invoices-are in his writing—they are not the invoices which were sent up from Bristol with the goods—it was his duty to deliver them to the customers, not to substitute others for them—I know of my own knowledge that invoices were sent from Bristol with the goods—it is the uniform custom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Suppose the goods which are sent up are broken, what would be the course? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A deduction would be made to the parties—it was the prisoner's duty to open the packages, to see that they are correct and correspond with the invoices, and if any of them are broken, it would be his duty to communicate with the house, and an alteration would be made in the books—we could not supply the damaged goods at once, because the names of the parties are printed on them—some of them are plain—I am not aware of the number of agents we have—that has been arranged by the prisoner—I never saw James Powell but once, and that was since this charge—I, have heard since that he has been acting as an agent—I have been told that Baker is an agent—it is not usual for me to see every parcel of goods sent from Bristol, but every entry in the books is examined by me or my brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner in the service of both the firms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they both joined in paying him—he did not fill precisely the same capacity in both—my brother is a representative of the glass works, what we call the retail department—the prisoner was paid 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week as salary, and his residence, and also 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum as a gratuity—he had no commission—it was his duty to allow commission to agents—it was about 5 or 10 per cent, according to arrangement—if his own active exertions had brought a customer, it would be most irregular and wrong for him to pay himself—on this bill, over the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cash, here is, "5 per cent discount"—that is written by Messrs.

            . I saw the prisoner take this punch-bowl from off the shelf in the bar, at Mr. Gilbert's.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. It was one Sunday morning, he gave it to me, to carry it to the pawnbroker, Mr. Price, at Dick's-Shore, and I did so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I live at Mr. White's, an Apothecary at Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. How near does Mr. White live to Mr. Gilbert's ?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. About two stones cast off.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you, when you saw the prisoner take this bowl?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I stood and looked through the window at the time; the prisoner and I had been out together that morning; he went in, and bid me stay without; and brought it and gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go out about that morning?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. What use was he to make of you?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I don't know; he did not tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go directly to the pawnbroker's with it?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. No, I carried it home, and kept it there about an hour and half, till he came; then carried it to the pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Q. What month was this done in?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I believe it was in February.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out in the morning?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. Between five and six.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light then?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you carry it to the pawnbrokers?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. Between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you lent you upon it?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I asked two shillings, and he gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you how you came by it?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. No, he did not; he asked me no questions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you before?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you pawned things there before?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I had, for my aunt.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he used to keep open shop, on Sunday mornings ?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. Yes, he does.</p>
               <p>Q. From between five and six, to the time he took the bowl, what were you doing?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. We walked up and down in Shadwell ; he went in there, just as Mr. Gilbert was up, and had open'd the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he go in for?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. He went in for a penny-worth of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bid you hide it?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. He bid me carry it under my coat; which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this bowl the same, that is here produced?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. It is; for I fetched it again, with Mr. Cock the constable, I asked for the bowl, that I brought on the Sunday morning; and he gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you carried it, that you fetched it again?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I think I fetched it the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose name did you put it?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I put it in in my own name; and the prisoner's name; so the pawnbroker wrote it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you before ?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Gilbert. Did you see the prisoner in your house, that Sunday morning you lost the bowl?</p>
               <p>S. Gilbert. My husband was up, I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this lad that gives evidence, do you know him?</p>
               <p>S. Gilbert. The prisoner has been married to his mother about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gwilliam. How long have you lived with Mr. White?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I lived with the prisoner, and my mother, at the time of his taking this bowl; I went to Mr. White, since the prisoner has been in confinement.</p>

On the 1st of May he left his lodging; on the 2nd of May I missed the things; a pair of breeches, a shirt, and a silk handkercheif. When the prisoner was taken he had my breeches on; he said the shirt he had pawned, and the handkercheif he had lost. I know they are my breeches, I have had them ever since. I value them at five shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the witness and the prisoner lodge with you - A. Yes, in the same room. On the 5th of June Stannard saw the prisoner in Park-street, he came and called me; I pursued the prisoner, and overtook him in Blackburn-mews; this young man came and said he had got his breeches on. I took the prisoner down to my house; he pulled the breeches off, and wished to make it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 24th of April I went to Colonel Jackson; I had not decent things of my own, these things lay in the room, I took them; I meaned to make some recompence with the young man for them. Colonel Jackson was going to Ireland, I had not decent things to go with him; I was obliged to leave him. I never did any such thing before in my life.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

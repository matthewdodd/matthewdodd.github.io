About four or five o'clock, on the 10th of July, the prisoner came into my house, and asked for a penny worth of beer; I served her the beer in a penny pot; a lad came in to call for some beer, and she asked the lad to drink out of the penny worth; I just earned my back to get his beer, and she went out of doors with a pint pot; when I came up the boy told me; I asked which way she went; I went out after her, and took the pot on her, and brought her back to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen her before? - Yes, four or five times that day; I wish I had not. I missed as many pots as cost me sixteen or twenty shillings within two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the pot? - Between her gown and her apron. I asked her when she came back what she was going to do with it? she said, she washed for an old iron shop in Grub-street, and she would fell it for a penny or three halfpence.(Produced and deposed to)

I see the prisoner drinking a penny worth of beer, in a penny pot; and after she had drank part of it, I see her put a pint pot under her gown; she offered me a drink of her beer; I refused, and she put the penny pot down and went out, and she told Mrs. Hill that she would pay for the beer at night; I acquainted Mrs. Hill, and Mrs. Hill acquainted Mr. Hill, and he went out after her. This is the same pot; here is my name on it, in my own writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My husband is very bad, and he used to fancy this gentleman's beer, and I used to go every day to this gentleman's house, and used to carry my own pot for the beer, that is, another public house pot, where I have had my beer for these three years, and one day I made a mistake and brought away one of his pots for my own pot.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Did she ever bring another pot? - Yes, she has once or twice of another publican's.</p>

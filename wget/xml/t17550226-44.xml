On the 1st of January we were to have company to supper, the maid was ordered to clean the spoons, and bring them down stairs. She presently came down, and said she must go out. We told her, as we were to have company, she must not go. Then she begged for three-quarters of an hour; we let her go, but she never returned. Then we received a letter, which the prisoner at the bar said she wrote. We took the prisoner on the 4th of January, and before justice Clark she there owned that her daughter gave her the things at her request, and she had pawned them: and by her direction we found the table-spoon and sattin waistcoat at Mr. Woolridge's, and two shirts and one sheet pawned to Mrs. Waters. She owned to them, but would to no more. I once catched her at my house, by getting up sooner than ordinary; then I did not know who she was; she told me she came from my maid's mother, and she was very ill. The maid had been out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175502260028"></xptr> the night before, but did not say, at her return, that her mother was ill. After that came the sister, and told me her mother was recovered. We found some of the goods after at Mr. Brunkley's, pawn'd by the prisoner.</p>

The prisoner was at our house on the 23rd of August, with his brother and my husband's brother - he came between ten and eleven o'clock; I left my pocket-book on the dresser, as I generally do - the prisoner was in the kitchen at the time; I was taken ill with a bleeding at the nose, which I am subject to, and went into the parlour - there were three sovereigns, two crowns, and two half-crowns in the pocketbook - the silver on one side, and the gold on the other; I remained is the parlour till the prisoner came back again to the house, which was between four and five o'clock - I had not gone into the kitchen till I went to have tea; I had seen the prisoner, his brother, and my husband's brother go away together; the prisoner came back between four and five o'clock - he came into the parlour where I was; I did not know he was in the house - I was a good deal recovered then, and said, "John, why I am astonished to see you come back - I asked you to stop, and you would not; what has brought you back again? you went with your brother, and my brother-in-law;" he seemed confused, and sat on the sofa with his hat on - he said, "Ann, my bowels have been had, and I have been in the yard;" I asked him to have some tea, but he would not stop - he kissed me, and bade me good bye; I never saw him again till he was apprehended; the first thing I missed was a tea-spoon out of a tureen on the dresser, when I went to look for it for tea, but when the milk came I opened my pocket-book, and missed two sovereigns, two crowns, and two half-crowns - one sovereign and one half-crown were left; I went to bed very early - I opened my drawer where I keep my things, and missed three silver table-spoons, a silver fork, a gold chain, a silver salt, two gold seals, a gold ring with a rose diamond, a gold eye-glass, a tortoiseshell pocket-comb, a gold pin, a pair of gold ear-rings, three 5l. Bank notes, and a silver snuff-box - they were all in the drawer, which was locked, and I found it still locked; there was no appearance of violence on it, but my keys hung up on a nail in the kitchen, in sight; I also missed a silk scarf and a yellow silk shawl from other drawers, and a pincushion - I immediately went to find the prisoner out, and his brother and my brother-in-law also, as they were all together; I could not find the prisoner, but saw his brother, who declared he knew nothing about it - we had his apartment searched, and his mother's, but found nothing; I advertised the property, and in about nine weeks I saw at Queen-square, the table-spoons, silver fork, snuff-box, pincushion, scarf, and tortoisesbell comb.</p>

            . This is my pin-cushion - it has the chain-pier at Brighton on it; these are my ear-rings - this tortoiseshell-comb, scarf, snuff-box, table-spoon, fork, and salt-seller, are all mine; the property is worth near 30l. without the money - the prisoner is no relation of mine; I have been brought up with him, and looked on him as a brother almost, and have been very kind to him - my house is in the parish of St. Marylebone; I have seen the notes at the Bank - I am certain they were in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I am now called upon for my defence for the crime of which I stand indicted for at this bar, but before I enter fully on the subject of my defence, I trust your Lordship and Gentletlemen of the Jury will pardon all such observation I feel induced to make, standing at the bar in my present critical situation. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, you are now in possession of the evidence, pro and con, but when you turn your eyes round, and view an own sister giving evidence against her brother, where she is the sole instrument of crime herself, becomes an unnatural feeling, and presses hard within my own bosom, when it becomes my duty to open the eyes of an open Court of Justice - the scene and lif of a sister, whose situation of life, at this present moment, ought to place her character without blemish or impunity, but when I reverse the scene, its nought but a real dissipated life; her character, from the nearest tie of nature, cannot rebnt my testimony - still, at the same moment I consider myself too much of a man to throw any blast on the character of an individual for the sake of public justice, or to screen the action of guilt. On the 5th of November, 1830, I was apprehended, and fully committed on the charge as per indictment; the property found in pledge undoubtedly belonged to my sister and brother-in-law, but was given to me by my sister in order to pledge, she not having the money I solicited of her at the present moment; here I became fully committed, consequently, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, you being in full possession of the evidence on trial, with fortitude and resignation I await a verdict from a Jury of my country.</p>

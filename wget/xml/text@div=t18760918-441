                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 462). On Sunday morning between 5th and 6th August I was in Northumberland Avenue at 1.30, I there saw the two prisoners—Lornen way carrying a large brown-paper parcel, and wearing along Ulster overcoat—they turned into Northumberland Street; I followed them—I allowed them to go on for some time, and then I went up to them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187609180086"></xptr>
               <p>—Booker turned round and threw Ms parcel down—I cried out "Stop theif"—I was in the act of catching hold of Lornen when he shook the Ulster coat off, and 399 came out of the Strand and caught hold of Booker and I caught Lornen and took him into custody—I found afterwards that there were two more small coats inside the Ulster coat—I told him I should take him into custody for being in possession of property supposed to be stolen—he said" You have made a mistake, the right man has gone"—the brown<lb></lb>paper parcel was addressed "Mrs. Denenlain, 9, Craven Street"—I went to that address, I saw Mr. Ehrlick and he aroused Miss Denenlain—he found his portmanteau and drawers and cheffionier had been broken open; Miss Denenlain's room had been broken into and was in confusion, and on a large round table were marks of grease from a lamp—I also found seven coats, six books, one dress, one skirt, one silk polonaise, and other articles—at the station I found three keys, one upon Lornen, and two upon Booker—the whole of the keys opened the front door of No. 9, Craven Street.</p>

I keep a lodging-house, at 9, Craven Street, Strand—on 5th August I went to bed at 12.30; all was safe in the house—the front door was closed—my lodger, Mr. Ehrlick was not at home—I was aroused by the police about 2.30, came downstairs, went into the sitting room and found it in great disorder—Mr. Ehrlick's room was also in disorder—my portmanteau had been taken out of the room into the hall; it had been forced opened and rummaged—I lost several articles.</p>

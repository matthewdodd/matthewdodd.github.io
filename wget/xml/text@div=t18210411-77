               <p>Q. He came to Cole Park, where you reside - A. Yes. Before he went away, he addressed me in these words -</p>
               <p>"Mr. Lovell - I think I should not be acting correctly, if I did not tell you my intentions towards your daughter - I have a fortune of 500 l. a year."

            . I served the defendant with notice to produce this and other letters, on Saturday, between six and seven o'clock in the evening. I served him with another notice to the same effect, on the 13th of February.</p>

               <p>(notice read.)</p>
               <p>MR. LOVELL (continued.) Q. You communicated by letter, your determination - A. Yes; my letter was to this effect - that I had considered the subject, and my present resolution was, that nothing more should take place between him and my daughter - and concluded by stating I should always be glad to see him as an acquaintance. I afterwards received this letter from him (looking at it), I believe it to be his writing. -</p>
               <p>(The letter was here produced, stating the defendant's regret at Mr. Lovell's decision, and offered to satisfy him on every point. Signed E. M. JONES.)</p>
               <p>Q. After the receipt of this letter, when did you see Mr. Jones - A. I think accidentally, at some races, near Swinbourn, in Wiltshire, on the 1st of September. I had my daughters Charlotte, Jane, and Fanny there with me. Mr. Jones came and asked me how I did. I talked with him civilly, that was all. I think after that I saw him at Bath, probably about three weeks after - it was about the latter end of October.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see him at Bath, in company with your solicitor - A. I did. That was after I had heard something about my daughter. I had seen him in London about three weeks before that.</p>
               <p>Q. State what passed when you saw him in town - A. I asked if he was married to my daughter - he said he was; I enquired at what place, and by what clergyman - he said he would not tell me. I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Jones, my daughter being under age, you must be well aware that the marriage cannot be valid." - There was then a proposal made of re-marriage, and money was talked of. I said I would go down into the country, and consult my wife about that. I went down, and a few weeks after met him at Bath, on the subject of the marriage - he wished me to deposit money - then he talked of terms, and something about a settlement. He said there was 1000 l. in his power, and he must talk to his mother - but I have a confused recollection of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the treaty come to any thing - A. No. I had information where my daughter was.</p>
               <p>Q. From the first time you saw him, till the present, did you ever consent to your daughter becoming his wife - A. We talked of terms. I consented to his marrying her, on his making a certain settlement - that settlement was never made. I heard where my daughter was, and went to the house where she resided. She came away with me willingly. Her clothes were detained at her lodging, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110052"></xptr>have never been able to get them. She was 19 years of age last April.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. A good full-grown girl, is not she - A. Pretty well.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean any thing offensive - but many a girl of twenty-five looks quite as young as she does - A. Appearances vary.</p>

               <p>Q. When the defendant said they were married, did he not offer to marry her again, if you thought fit to give your consent - A. On my giving some money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him, if he settled 1000 l. in the stocks, which he expected from his mother, that you would give another 1000 l. and they should be married again - A. On my oath I really do not recollect. We did talk about terms. Nothing was finally settled - but really I do not recollect whether I agreed to settle 1000 l. on his doing the same. I think I remember proposing that he should marry her, on my giving him 1000 l. - I think that was at Bath. He talked about terms, and I referred him to my solicitor, who said he was not competent to make the settlement.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect saying to Mr. Walker, I shall be happy if he marries her, and add</p>
               <p>"blessed be the peace maker" - A. I did not, after I heard where she was; I said, blessed be the peace maker when I talked about the re-marriage. Until I saw my solicitor I had made up the differences, and consented, but after I saw him he declined.</p>
               <p>Q. When he first proposed to marry your daughter, did you not tell him she would have a fortune of 5000 l. - A. On my oath, I did not. I have heard he is the possessor Lincoln house - his mother lives there; he said his estate there was worth about 500 l. a year. I did not tell him Archdeacon Wells had left 20,000 l. among my daughters, I said it was among my grand-children.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the defendant accompany your daughter to the balls at Bath, and to the races, and parade the ballrooms with her on his arm - A. No: on my oath, he never went to Bath with her once to my knowledge. I never said I believed he thought my daughter twenty years of age.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The defendant applied to you as a suitor to your daughter, to which you gave a negative answer - A. Yes; I never saw him at my house afterwards. I did not invite him to join us at the races. My daughter was with me in the carriage, she did not join him without my being with her. I heard of her going away with him about the latter end of November, and had an interview with him in London five or six days after, and saw him at Bath in about three weeks. I did not then know where my daughter was.</p>
               <p>Q. At Bath there was a talk about your each giving 1000 l. - A. Yes, Mr. Jones's solicitor was present, and mine was not, and not having seen my attorney I would have consented to the marriage if terms had been settled; the settlement never was made, nor any agreement for it. I never consented to a marriage without a settlement. I found her at Islington - she is here to day.</p>

            . I am daughter of the last witness, and have a sister named Charlotte. Lady Gould is my aunt. My sister and I went on a visit to Sir Davidge and Lady Gould's, at Orkshead, in Hertfordshire; we travelled from my father's house to Chippenham, in his carriage, and from there to London in the stage coach; the defendant joined us in the morning at Calne - he came into the stage coach. I knew it was not my father's wish that he should associate with my sister; he travelled to London in the same coach with us. In the course of the journey we were speaking of ages, he said he should take me for the eldest of the three sisters - he thought me older than either my sisters, Charlotte or Jane; I said Charlotte was the eldest, Jane and myself the youngest. I told him Charlotte was not nineteen till the February following, which was last February, and told him the ages of my other sisters; he parted with us on arriving in town. We stated in conversation with him, that we were going to Lady Gould's - we parted at Hatchett's hotel; a carriage conveyed us to Jermyn-street, where Sir D. Gould was waiting for us; the defendant knew where Sir D. Gould lived; we went to Hertfordshire a day or two afterwards, and about ten days after, I saw the defendant - he rode by the lane fronting the house; I saw him many times - he was never admitted into the house on any footing whatever. We generally took a drive every day in Sir Davidge Gould's carriage, and once met the defendant in the lane on horseback, Lady Gould was with us - he did not join us.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the appearance of this gentleman, had Sir D. and Lady Gould said any thing - A. They had written to Papa, and in consequence of that I had an interview with defendant at the gate of Sir D. Gould's garden (we had been there about three weeks) I told him Sir Davidge had written home, to say that he was constantly riding by, and that we had received an answer, to say they should fetch us home, if he appeared again before the window. I entreated him to leave the neighbourhood. he requested an interview with Charlotte, which I told him was impossible, and after some slight conversation, I left him; he renewed his appearance, in consequence of which, I wrote a letter, and got my sister to sign it - it was dictated by Sir Davidge.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Adolphus here called for the letter, for the production of which notice had been served on the defendant. Mr. Alley refused it.)</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to MISS F. LOVELL. Q. What was the contents of your letter - A. That his appearance before the window, was extremely disagreeable to Charlotte; that we had received a letter, saying we should be fetched home, and that she was determined not to marry him, without her friends consent, and entreating him not to make his appearance again; we received this letter in answer; (looking at it) the writing on the third leaf, was not discovered till about a month ago - I believe it was produced by holding it to the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the defendant, after the receipt of this letter - A. On the Sunday morning, about ten days after; Sir D. and Lady Gould were gone to church, and all the men servants; we were left at home, sitting in the drawing-room, when we heard the sound of wheels; Charlotte first went out, and when I came out, I found her in conversation with Mr. Jones at the gate, he was asking her to elope with him, the gig had then passed on out of sight - a man named Rawlins was with it. The defendant said he had got every thing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110053"></xptr>prepared, with a licence in his pocket, which he produced - I saw the outside of it; he said he had every thing ready to be married at St. Martin's church, next morning; she begged him to go away, saying, she never would have him, without her friends consent. I remonstrated with him, and requested some private conversation, and told him, if he would desist from taking her away, I would write to my father, and ask his consent, he said he never should have such an opportunity again, and no earthly being should ever make him give it up; he appeared in great agitation, when she moved down the walk as I was conversing with him; she went up one of the gravel walks towards the house, and I believe entered the house; he appeared extremely agitated, and went to her in the gravel walk, met her and siezed her by the arm, and said nothing should make him give it up; he said to me</p>
               <p>"If you will only let me take her down the lane for five minutes, on my soul, I'll bring her back again." I said,</p>
               <p>"No, he might speak to her inside the gate, but not down the lane;" he dragged her down the lane, partly by force, and I followed her; when I saw he was using force, I tried what strength I had, I took her by the other arm and pulled the other way, and said</p>
               <p>"Charlotte, is it of your own consent you are going away?" she said,</p>
               <p>"No, go I entreat you, Mr. Jones, the carriage will be come from church;" he said he was determined never to stir from the spot without her, and called me harbarous and inhuman; he then beckoned to the gig, which came up, and attempted to lift her into it - and once I completely pulled her out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she struggle against your pulling her out, or in favour of it - A. I hardly know, I was in such agitation, she resolutely said she would not go to the last moment. He lifted her into the gig - Rawlins still holding the horse. I appealed to him, and asked if he could see a lady taken away against her consent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your sister appeal to him - A. I do not recollect, but she intreated Mr. Jones to go away, and said she never would go with him. He succeeded in getting her from me - put her her in the gig and drove off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out and raise the neighbourhood - A. There was no neighbourhood to raise. I did not run after the carriage.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasioned you to stay from church - A. We both had the hooping cough, she had it slighter than myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you a grandmother living in Milson-street, Bath - A. I had; my sister was there six days, I was not with her, it was after Mr. Jones had been rejected by my father as a suitor; the visit was very sudden - she went to purchase clothes - it is twenty-one miles from home - she did not propose going herself.</p>
               <p>Q. On going to town you knew you should meet Mr. Jones somewhere - A. I did not know it till I met him.</p>
               <p>Q. On the road you learnt he was to meet you - A. Yes, I heard it at Chippenham - we slept there - my brothers came with us to Chippenham.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your brothers left you before you learnt the defendant was to meet you - A. Yes; my eldest brother that was with me, is thirteen years old, and the other is eleven. I knew my father had forbidden his seeing my sister, and perhaps I acted foolish in getting into the stage coach. Mr. Jones appeared to know we were going to Sir Davidge Gould, he generally rode by Sir Davidge's twice a week, and sometimes every day. I did not meet him at the gate by appointment - I went to tell him how angry the family were - I did not know he was coming on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you expected that he would come some time or other and take your sister away - A. I had suspicions - I did not actually know it - I rather expected it - I did not tell Sir Davidge.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I beg you to recollect, when you sister was going off with Mr. Jones, did not you appeal to her and say</p>
               <p>"Will you leave me;" and did she not say,</p>
               <p>"I am determined to go;" - A. Never, she certainly was not sufficiently firm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she do every thing to resist your attempts to prevent her going - A. She made no resistance, one way or the other - she appeared frightened. We heard she kept the house for a week, with the hooping cough, except going into the garden now and then.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is it not inconvenient to go to church with the hooping cough - A. Yes, there are many charity children who might be affected by it.</p>
               <p>The following is the letter referred to in evidence -</p>
               <p>HATFIELD, NOV. 1820.</p>
               <p>Nothing was wanting but your letter of yesterday to complete the misery you have from time to time heaped upon me; however, your commands, as for as regards me, shall be obeyed. I will give up the only ray of comfort I have known since I left Bath, that of seeing you for a moment as I pass; and cease to appear before that house that holds every thing that is dear to me, but when you bid me think no more of you, you ask a thing out of my power to comply with, as it rests with you alone. Give me back that happiness you have robbed me off - restore that heart which you alone possess, and take from me the remembrance that I have ever seen or loved you, and then I will think of you no more.</p>
               <p>The sanction of your father I once gained, but he withdrew it from me without a reason; or if he had one, without allowing me a chance of an explanation. I addressed a letter to him couched in terms that could not offend; in as much as it breathed the most fervent respect for him, and the most ardent affection for you. I only entreated, that should my endeavours to satisfy him on every point succeed, he would no longer withhold his approbation, but he rather choose to increase the anguish he was conscious I must feel, by leaving my letter entirely unanswered.</p>
               <p>The cutting style in which your letter is written, particularly its conclusion, is a cruelty I have not deserved; what conduct of mine has tended to lesson your esteem for me I know not. I have uniformly studied to preserve that interest I thought I possessed in your heart; and to loose it will constitute the greatest affliction in my life: and, remembering as I do, that happiness was almost in my grasp till removed by an invisable* hand is another aggravation to my sufferings. Believe me then Charlotte, I will ever strive to deserve you, and therefore bid you adieu; with feeling, that the love I have for you will never know a change, except by increase of affection.</p>
               <p>I have put a dash under invisable, to give you a hint.</p>
               <p>(Signed)</p>

            . I was present at a conversation between Mr. Lovell's brother and the defendant, on the 14th of December last, at Chippenham. I went to Cole Park, by desire of the defendant, and offered to take a letter to Mr. Lovell, to let him know the state his daughter was in. The defendant had informed me she was in London, and unmarried. I had an interview with Mr. Lovell, and delivered him the letter, and broke this unpleasant business to him, and in consequence of this, I and Mr. Lovell's brother met the defendant at Chippenham. Mr. Lovell's brother requested Mr. Jones to give up his niece, and if he would do so, or say where she was in London, that he might fetch her, Mr. Lovell would enter no proceedings against him, as he wished to have his daughter. Mr. Jones refused to give her up; without Mr. Lovell came down with a settlement to pay his debts. He said he would marry her providing his debts were paid, and Mr. Lovel came down with a settlement, but he would not give her up without. Mr. Lovell returned to Cole Park. The defendant called on me on his way to town from Bath, and said he had seen Mr. Lovell with both their solicitors but they could not settle any thing, and he was on his way to town by the mail. The defendant told me he was a man of very little property, and that he had incurred some debts by this running off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. He is a brother officer in your regiment - A. Yes; he served with me in Ireland. I understand his mother to be a respectable lady.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe this lady's mother requested you to introduce him to her family - A. She did afterwards. I never met him at any balls.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Pray how did the defendant's introduction happen - A. He wished me to introduce him at Cirencester, which I declined, and he called on me at Chippenham, to desire me to go over with him to introduce him, which I declined. I met him at Bath races, and he wished me to introduce him. I felt a delicacy at doing so without applying to Mrs. Lovell, and I applied to her on the race course; I told her I knew very little of him, and wished to ask her permission before I introduced him. He was introduced on the race course.</p>

            . I am solicitor to Mr. Lovell. I have heard him examined. I was present at the interview at Bath. I met the defendant and Messrs. Walker and Lovell. I pointed out to the defendant the crime he had been guilty of in swearing a false affidavit; he said he had sworn to the best of his belief. I told him he must have made a positive affidavit that she was of age. We then entered into conversation respecting matters being arranged. Mr. Walker, the defendant's solicitor stated what I consider to be the real situation of the defendant. The property was stated to be at 500 l. per annum; consisting of a large old mansion, and a few acres of land, which a gentleman that fancied such a thing would give any thing for. I happened to know the property I believe it is let at two hundred and seventy pounds a year; and I believe there is forty or fifty acres of land, let at about two hundred pounds more, and that he had one thousand pounds more in the funds. On farther enquiry, it appeared his mother had an annuity of above one hundred and thirty pounds, payable out of the property for life. The defendant stated that his mother would wave that. I said it was necessary that it should be done in writing. On further enquiry, it turned out that Jones was only tenant for life. Mr. Lovell consented to his daughter marrying the defendant on the settlement being made, which never was done, he said he could not settle it without going to his mother.</p>
               <p>The paragraph enclosed was produced by holding the letter to the fire.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. All this passed while Mr. Lovell was ignorant where his daughter was - A. Yes, he certainly talked coolly about it. If the settlement had been made he would not have objected to it.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY addressed the Jury at considerable length on behalf of the defendant, pointing out the evident consent of Miss Lovell to elope with him, and the consent of Mr. Lovell to arrange the matter subsequent.</p>

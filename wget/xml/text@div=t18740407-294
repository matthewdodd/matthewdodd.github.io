                  </hi>. I am employed by my brother, George Taylor, at his Photographic establishment in Crown Buildings, Queen Victoria Street—he also has an establishment at Forest Lodge, Forest Hill—up to 19th March, the prisoner was in his employment as chief operator, it was his duty to take photographs at Crown buildings; the negatives were then intensified, and sent to Forest Lodge to be printed—the portraits were mounted and completed there, and returned to Crown buildings to be rolled—the prisoner had access to the room where they were rolled—they then passed into the hands of Miss McDonough, who duty it was to sort them and send them out—we have had repeated complaints of photographs being missed—on 17th March, a lady called and made a complaint—in consequence of that, on 19th March I went to 89, Park Street, Camden Town—I there saw the frames produced, bearing the name of R. Stuart, photographer to the Queen—I recognised all the photographs in those frames, with the exception of four or five; there were nearly 200 altogether exhibited—I went inside, and saw a boy named Bertrand Gidney, who had been in our employment, and had left the Christmas before—he is about 18 years of age, his duty was to assist the prisoner—I saw Mrs. Turnbull as well—it was about 11 o'clock in the morning—I returned about 3 o'clock in the afternoon and spoke to my brother, he sent for the prisoner—I was not present at the interview—I saw him next morning, and told him not to resume his duties until he saw my brother—he laughed and said it was quite a mistake to suppose that he had anything to do with the business, that the business was Gidneys, he had got a very nice place and was likely to do well—I told him that Mrs. Turnbull was there; he said that was a mistake, Mrs. Turnbull was then in Rochdale—he left our employment that morning—I know his handwriting—my brother communicated with Mr. Cox the attorney, and this letter was written by Mr. Cox to the prisoner, and on the other side is an answer from the prisoner, addressed from Vauxhall Bridge Road—(<hi rend="italic">Letters read—from Mr. Cox to lie prisoner</hi>. "20th March, 1874. Sir, I have been consulted by Messrs. A, and G. Taylor, of Crown 1875. Buildings, Queen Victoria Street, with reference to a number of pictures at 1876. the house 89, Park Street, which belong to my clients, and, as they have</p>

               <p>reason to believe that you are identical with the person named Stuart, in which name the premises of Park Street is carried on, they request you to give me before 12 o'clock on Monday, a satisfactory explanation upon the subject, and failing the same, my clients instruct me to say that they will immediately take such course as they may be advised.")—(<hi rend="italic">From the prisoner to Mr. Cox</hi>: "Sir; I have just received yours from my tenant, I beg to say in reply that your client is both a liar and a fool, which I trust you will duly record to him, adding at the same time that he would be employing himself much more laudably by purchasing some yellow soap, and having a few gallons of clean water, and so thoroughly cleansing himself, thus removing a stinking nuisance to everyone who comes near him.")—After that letter I obtained a warrant for the prisoner's apprehension, and with my brother, Sergeant Bull, and Detective Outram, went to Park Street on 25th March—Outram went in and came out with the prisoner looking at the photographs and then we all four went in—we went into the first floor front room—I saw chemicals and photographs there (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are taken from negatives belonging to my brother—the cards bear his name at the back, but I am referring more to the enlarged ones, there is no name on them; the greater part of the small ones have our firm's name at the back—I saw thirty or forty negatives that were our property; there were one or two without our number, but I knew them all as negatives taken by the prisoner—I think there are one or two duplicates—the prisoner had no right to take those—all the others bear the stock number, and one or two have got the printer's mark in pencil; that shows the number printed off—we had a boy named Andrews in our employ as carrier, it was his duty to take things to and from Forest Lodge to Crown Buildings—Thomas Andrews, his brother, took his place for a short time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I saw Mrs. Turnbull at Park Street—I had seen her once before on our stairs, and you introduced me to her—I will swear I saw her at Park Street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw her at the Mansion House, and have seen her repeatedly—I believe her to be the same person—she stepped forward at the Mansion House, at the chief clerk's request for Mr. Cook's man to see her in reference to the chemicals, whether he had seen her at their warehouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor—on 19th March, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon my brother made a communication to me—I sent for the prisoner and asked if he knew anything about this place at Park Street, Camden Town; he said "No"—I accused him of being the person carrying on that business—he denied it—I afterwards went with my brother and the two detectives to Park Street, and saw my property there which is pro<lb></lb>duced and many other things—I saw some pure spirit, it is the same I use, some part of the label had been scratched off—Mr. Cook, of Hoxton, supplies us with it—I saw some cyanide of potassium—Mr. Cook also supplies us with that, we had only two bottles of it of that size in stock at the time I believe, it contains 2lbs.—there is one bottle here and I produce the other from Forest Lodge—I saw some nitrate of silver which I left there—it was similar to what I use—I recognised the bottle as mine—it was a small stout bottle and contained about 8oz. of silver, worth about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a few days before the prisoner left my employment I sent the boy James for some nitrate of silver to Cox of Ludgate Hill—he brought back one bottle of 7oz., and one of 5oz.—I handed the 7oz. bottle to the prisoner—I missed some of it—we were always missing silver—I saw some patent</p>

               <p>glass—it was very similar to what I use—I believe there was a gross of it there—it was left behind—it was more than was necessary for carrying on a business of that sort, and not the quality; it was the best we use—the prisoner would use common glass in his business at Park Street—it is very unusual to use patent plate—it would before or five times the price of common glass—the prices charged by him there would not warrant the use of it—I saw some paper, but did not look at it—I recognised an amount of old bottles, dusters and other things, and in fact mostly everything we use—it was a repetition of Crown Buildings, in fact—I saw some negatives which I identified, and all our usual chemicals for carrying on a very large business—about a month ago I saw the boy Andrews hand a bottle to the prisoner—I don't know what was in it—here is an enlargement from a negative that I took myself three or four years ago, and there are others—I never gave the prisoner permission to take any of these chemicals or negatives, or any of the property—I once gave him twelve small cartes, which I found in his house—there are some photographs here of the Albert memorial—those were taken at my establishment, our best pictures—the prisoner had no right to take those.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The name of Cook, of Hoxton, is on the bottle of cyanide, and it is the form of bottle that we always have it in—if you were to buy 2lbs. of cyanide I don't think you would get it in a bottle like that, you might—it was your duty to take home the negatives and retouch them and bring them back in the morning—if you had a good duplicate negative you would retouch both—we very rarely had the two retouched—just before the photographic exhibition you had twelve negatives to retouch, extra well for exhibition—I told you to select twelve, and no more—we did not print more copies than were ordered—you had no authority to take any of these negatives, they are stock negatives, and ought to be at Forest Hill, at the present time.</p>

I am chief printer in the prosecutor's service at Forest Hill—I have charge of the negatives—after they are printed from, the boy puts them away under my superintendance—I see three negatives here, two No. 13,455 and 14.259—I missed those from our stock; in the ordinary course of business they ought to be there now—I remember the prisoner coming to Forest Hill to get some negatives for the Photographic Exhibition, that was at the latter end of October, or the commencement of November—we keep a stock bottle of gold solution there, I missed some and mentioned it to Andrews—on one occasion I gave some to Andrews in a small scent bottle, he said the prisoner wanted it—I did not authorize him to take any—I did not give the prisoner permission to take the negatives away.</p>

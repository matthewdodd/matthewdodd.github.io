            . I am a sea faring man, and was at the Cock and Anchor on the 15th of March, when the prisoner came in, and asked to go down into the cellar to the necessary house. I saw his trowser pocket stood out on a bulge. I took a candle and went down, and found him amongst the vessels with his trowsers in his hand I took hold of them, and he offered me what he had in his pocket to let him go. I took him up, and there was the merchants constable Mr. Rawlins. We searched his trowsers, and found 5 lb of raw coffee; (produced in court, and deposed to.) We took him before my Lord mayor, where he said he had it from on board a ship called the Lion, at <placeName id="t17600416-1-crimeloc3">Cox's wharf</placeName>

               <p>I was at work in unloading that ship along with five others, and in craning the bags out, some of them burst, and a great deal of coffee fell on the ground; the poor people pick'd it up, and I pick'd up some. The captain and mate stood by, and seeing my hat full, they bid me put it in my pocket, which I did; they said poor people had better take it, than let it be trod under foot.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis. I have known the prisoner 26 or 27 years.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his character?</p>
               <p>Davis. He was reckon'd a very honest man 22 or 23 years ago; I know nothing of him since that time.</p>

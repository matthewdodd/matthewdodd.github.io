               <p>Q. Are you intimately acquainted with Mr. John Brown? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On Friday the 16th of March, did you accompany Mr. Brown to Baker's coffee-house? - A. I did, in Change-alley, Cornhill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and Mr. Brown then meet with the prisoner at the bar, Mr. Jackson? - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any bills at that time deposited in the hands of Mr. Jackson? - A. We met at the hour of twelve, and Mr. Brown then had a bill for two thousand five hundred pounds, accepted by Leerworth and Lindsey, which Mr. Brown said was not so cashable, and therefore requested it to be split into two bills, one of one thousand two hundred pounds, and the other of one thousand three hundred pounds, this was about the hour of twelve; Mr. Brown observed, that he supposed Leerworth and Lindsey, who were the accepters, and who were to be the accepters of the one thousand two hundred pounds, and the one thousand three hundred pounds, could have no objection, but he would inquire of them, and return again in the course of an hour or two; we then appointed Mr. Jackson to meet Mr. Brown at Baker's coffee-house, about two o'clock; we met at two, and Mr. Brown had then received the acceptances of twelve and thirteen hundred pounds, which he gave to me, and I delivered them to Mr. Jackson; it was handed from my hands to Jackson.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, was that one of the two bills which you handed to Jackson? - A. I am confident it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a receipt for the two bills? - A. Yes; I wrote it, and Jackson signed it. (The receipt read.)</p>

               <p>Q. At that time, was this bill endorsed or unendorsed? - A. Most positively not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between Mr. Brown and Jackson respecting the endorsement? - A. Jackson<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040011"></xptr>proposed that he should bring a person to Baker's coffee-house about the hour of five, with the money for these bills; I observed to him, that I could not be in the City at five, but that he had better bring the money to my house, with the person who was to give it, and then the bills should be endorsed, and Mr. Brown receive the money; I further observed not to bring banker's checks, but Bank-notes, or cash; Mr. Jackson then agreed to come to my house for that purpose, at a quarter after five o'clock; Mr. Brown, though engaged to dine, postponed that engagement, and dined with me at my house, for the purpose of meeting Jackson.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did Mr. Brown come to your house? - A. Mr. Brown came to my house a quarter before five.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did any person come to inquire for Jackson? - A. About six o'clock, or five minutes after; a person brought a note, but I did not see the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the note which was brought? (shewing it to him) - A. Yes; Mr. Brown shewed me the note; I have no doubt that that was the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Brown give a verbal answer to the messenger who brought that note? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did Mr. Brown quit your house? - A. As soon as his servant could call a coach; I don't think it was ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no more of Mr. Brown that night? - A. No; nor till half after twelve, or a quarter after twelve the next day.</p>

               <p>Q. After Mr. Brown had left you, did the prisoner, Jackson, come to your house? - A. He did, about half after seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the goodness to state what then passed? - A. I was in my front parlour, with some West-India friends who were going to embark, and writing some letters to send with them; I went into the back room with Mr. Jackson, and he told me he was disappointeed in getting the bills done, but if Mr. Brown would let him have them by nine o'clock the next morning, he might be certain of having the money at twelve; I observed to him, as I had an appointment in Windmill-street, at ten o'clock, it was impossible I could deliver the bills to him at nine, and therefore he had better keep them; and he appointed Mr. Brown and myself to meet him at Baker's coffee-house, at twelve o'clock, on Saturday the 17th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, the next day, meet Mr. Brown at Baker's coffee-house? - A. I did, about a quarter after twelve, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate to Mr. Brown, that night, the appointment you had made? - A. Yes; I sent my servant to inform him, that we were to meet there at twelve o'clock; we remained there about ten minutes; I was backward and forward between Baker's and Lloyd's coffee-houses several times; I was not there when Mr. Combe came in first.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you see Mr. Combe with Mr. Brown? - A. I rather imagine it was near three o'clock; it might be from half after two to three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information which Combe gave you, what did Mr. Brown do? - A. Mr. Brown and myself went immediately from Baker's coffee-house to Messrs. Newnham, Everitt, and Co. bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find Mr. Jackson? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Brown do any thing else? - A. We were a little confused; Mr. Brown, at the recommendation of Mr. Combe, traced the notes so as to stop them at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to find Jackson? - A. No; we went to the Bank, and then we went to the City-Marshal, Mr. Nalder; we could not find Mr. Jackson, we went to the place he called his accompting-house, in Spread-eagle-court, with Mr. Nalder, but he was not there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. In what line of life are you? - A. A merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Residing where? - A. In the Adelphi-terrace.</p>
               <p>Q. You are speaking of a transaction which took place as long ago as March last? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been long acquainted with Mr. Brown? - A. Upwards of twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in the habit, with Mr. Brown, of assisting him in getting money for him? - A. Never at any other time, nor at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of his applications to persons to borrow money? - A. Yes, from his own report.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Brown had been obliged to raise money in this sort of way? - A. No; he had applied to Messrs. Manning and Bosanquet, one of the first West-India houses in town, but not in this way.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing particular in this transaction more than any other transaction? - A. No; excepting from an advertising broker, and the exorbitant interest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any memorandum at the time of the transaction taking place, so that you could resort to them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what you say depends upon your memory, at this distance of time? - A. Most undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Jackson was to have come at the time appointed, and he sent some excuse by letter? - A. Yes, to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. But in point of fact, he came very soon after Mr. Brown was gone? - A. About an hour and a half after.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the bills were not to be endorsed till the money was paid? - A. That was understood, both by Mr. Brown and Mr. Jackson.</p>
               <p>Q. What period of time was there from the first time Mr. Jackson had the bills, till you met at Baker's coffee-house, and saw Mr. Combe? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040012"></xptr>The bills were delivered to him on the Friday, and we met about three o'clock on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen much of Mr. Brown during that interval? - A. No, I had not seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had the possession of these bills from the Friday to the Saturday? - A. I don't know to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, whether Mr. Brown and he met between the middle of the day on Friday and the Saturday? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at your request, or the prisoner's, that the bills were permitted to remain in his hands? - A. Neither one nor the other; but I observed that as it was impossible for me to deliver him the bills at nine o'clock, he had better keep them.</p>
               <p>Q. That you told him? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. When the bills were delivered to him, there was no difficulty at all on his part to give a receipt for them? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. He made not the least hesitation? - A. None whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. From the nature of the transaction, did it occur to you to make any particular remark, excepting the exorbitance of the interest? - A. I knew nothing of Jackson, and advised my friend to have nothing to do with an advertising broker.</p>
               <p>Q. But excepting that, there was nothing extraordinary in the transaction? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any occasion, I don't mean from any necessity of your own, but have you ever had occasion to apply to an advertising person for yourself, or any of your friends? - A. Never, upon my oath, neither; I am merely in acts of friendship with Mr. Brown, and not in acts of business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Be so good as to state what passed between you and Mr. Jackson on the Tuesday preceding? - A. Mr. Brown gave me a bill for 2500 l. and in consequence of what Mr. Brown told me, I met Mr. Jackson at the City coffee-house, Cheapside; Jackson wanted me to give him the bill for 2500 l. that he might shew it to a gentleman to discount; I told him I could not deliver it without Mr. Brown's desire; I met him again, I think, on the Wednesday, but it was either the Wednesday or Thursday, I cannot be positive to the day, at the City coffee-house, and with Mr. Brown's concurrence, I gave him the bill for 2500 l.; that bill was afterwards returned to Mr. Brown.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Curwood. Q. You were clerk to the prisoner, were you not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you know his hand-writing? - A. I have seen his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those letters? - A. I believe them to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that (another letter), do you believe that to be his hand-writing? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>(A letter read, addressed J. Brown, Esq. Buckingham-street, Strand, No. 10. Signed J. Jackson, Spread Eagle-court, 10th March, 1804.)</p>
               <p>"Dear Sir, - I am sorry to inform you a slight accident has prevented me from coming to you as I wished and promised. I have however taken the liberty of writing you a note to inform you I have seen the gentleman with whom I am arranging your business; he has informed me it will be absolutely necessary for him to have your bills unendorsed at least three hours in his possession, previous to his giving the cash, and then you endorse them, without which the bills are useless. He has made his arrangements for Tuesday, and wishes that day to compleat them, for reasons which I will tell you when I see you. If Messrs. Leerworth and Lindsey mean to accept the bills, it is of small consequence whether they accept them on Tuesday, or any other day; and as the gentleman with whom I am engaged will accept them with myself, there can be no objection to their being trusted three or four hours in our hands."</p>
               <p>(Another letter read, addressed J. Brown, Esq. Buckingham-street, Strand. Signed J. Jackson, dated 13 March, 1804.)</p>
               <p>"Dear Sir, - Inclosed is a letter I have just received from W. Combe and Co. Queen-street, Cheapside, the house that was to discount your bill. You will perceive from it the unfortunate delay which my caution occasioned, has produced a delay still more unfortunate. However, I have seen Mr. Combe, who informs me it is a matter of small consequence whether the bill is made into five, or whether it remains in one, and begs me to say, if Friday will be more convenient, their house can do it. I have written to prevent Mr. Akers an unnecessary journey, particularly as I am engaged at that hour: I appointed to meet a gentleman at Westminster. I hope these delays will not be attended with any unpleasant consequences, and I trust this letter and its inclosure will convince you of my incapability of performing my engagement."</p>
               <p>(Another letter read, addressed J. Brown, Esq. at Mr. Akers's, Adelphi Terrace. Signed J. Jackson, dated 16th March, 1804.)</p>

               <p>"Dear Sir, - Your bills are in that situation that they will certainly be done, but owing to the lateness of my friend seeing Mr. Leerworth, they cannot be done to night. If you will leave them with me to night, they shall be done in the morning, or if you have them back of me, and I can again have them at nine, they shall be done by twelve. Do send word by the bearer, which you will do. I wait your answer."</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. Q. Do you remember taking a note to Mr. Brown? - A. Yes, on Friday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive a message to carry back to your master? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Did you carry that message to him? - A. I delivered the message to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you receive the message? - A. I received it from Mr. Brown.</p>

               <p>Q. What was that message? - A. To tell Mr. Jackson to bring the bills up to him that night, and he would see him to-morrow at twelve at the City coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master was to bring the bills to Mr. Brown? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was with your master at the City coffee-house? - A. I did not go in; Mr. Jackson came out of a private room; a gentleman came out of the room after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the gentleman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it? - A. Mr. Combe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Jackson ever return to his accompting-house after that time? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where is his accompting-house? - A. In Spread Eagle-court, Finch-lane, Cornhill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Parry. Q. You say you went on Friday evening with a letter - what time was it? - A. About six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Akers? - A. I heard his voice, but did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a hackney-coach at that time at the door of Mr. Akers's house? - A. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Brown go into that coach? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive a written answer, or a verbal one? - A. I received no written note.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sworn that, to the best of your belief, the letters shewn to you were the handwriting of the prisoner; did you ever see him write? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him write his name? - A. Yes; but not to take particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how are you able to swear to his handwriting? - A. I cannot swear to it; I believe it to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. But you cannot take upon you positively to swear that these letters are his hand-writing? - A. No. (Mr. Brown called into Court.)</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. In the month of March last you carried on the business of a warehouseman, in Queen-street, Cheapside? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you for some time before that been acquainted with the prisoner Jackson? - A. About three weeks before the 13th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any application to you upon the subject of-bills? - A. In the course of conversation he mentioned a bill of 2500 l. that was about a week before the bills were dated; he told me Mr. Brown was a very respectable man from the West-Indies, and had lately purchased a large estate in this country; he said Mr. Brown had an instalment to make by a certain day upon this estate, and that he wanted to raise the money, for which he would allow 15 per cent.; and he said Mr. Brown was in the habit of consigning his goods to the house of Leerworth and Lindsey, upon whom he was going to draw bills; he told me they were to the amount of 2500 l. nine months after date, from the 1st of March; I told him at first I could not do any thing with the bills at so long a date, however respectable they might be; upon his suggestion that the house was of the first respectability, and that if that house was not liked, he could draw upon any other, I told him there were a certain description of goods for a long credit, that he might buy and sell them again at a very small loss.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you mention to him what description of goods? - A. Irish linens.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Jackson say to that? - A. I don't immediately recollect, but he told me the house upon which they were drawn, who was to accept, and where I might enquire Mr. Brown's character; upon which I made application to the house of Webster and Corbett; I saw Jackson, and told him Messrs. Webster and Corbett were perfectly satisfied with the acceptors, and would sell Irish linens to the amount of one half.</p>
               <p>Q. One half of what? - A. Of the 2500 l.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Jackson say to that? - A. He desired me to get it done as soon as possible, because Mr. Brown was a man who very much respected him, and if he could transact this to his satisfaction, he would accommodate him, Mr. Jackson, with acceptances to the amount of 2 or 3000 l. upon the same house, which, if I would give him a share in my concern, he would throw into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any agreement? - A. Yes, on the Friday, for the linens; one bill was to be 1300 l. and the other 1200 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in the course of that Friday receive from Jackson two bills? - A. About two o'clock on Friday, the 16th of March, Jackson called upon me, and said, as Mr. Brown was a man of high honour, he did not wish them to be shewn about the market; he gave me two bills, and desired me to take them to Messrs. Webster and Corbett's, to enquire into the acceptance: one was for 1200 l. and the other for 1300 l.; I took them to Webster and Corbett's in Friday-street, and gave them to Mr. Corbett.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was this bill for 1300 l. indorsed, or not indorsed? - A. It was not indorsed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them both to him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in the course of that afternoon, receive them back from Mr. Corbett? - A. Yes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040014"></xptr>in about half an hour; about two o'clock young Mr. Corbett brought them back to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after Mr. Corbett brought them back to you, did you see Mr. Jackson? - A. In about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and Jackson then? - A. I gave him back the bills, informing him that Mr. Corbett had made enquiry, and was perfectly satisfied; I desired him also to get the bills indorsed, as they were to be paid over before the linens were delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. When were the linens to be delivered? - A. As soon as the bills were paid that evening, if the bills were paid in time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appointment between Jackson and you to meet again? - A. Not particularly; he was in the habit of calling three or four times a day at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the bills with him at that time? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see him? - A. About half past six, at my warehouse; I asked him if he had got the bills indorsed; he said he had sent them to the City coffee-house for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him then to the City coffee-house? - A. No; in a short time after Jackson's lad returned, and called Mr. Jackson out; when Jackson came in to me, he said Mr. Brown had not indorsed the bills, and was rather angry at his having sent the lad up to him; I told him he must get the bills indorsed and paid before the goods would be delivered; he told me if I would go to the parties to see that the goods were getting ready, he would himself go to Mr. Brown and get them indorsed; he then left me; I went to Webster and Corbett's to see that the goods were getting ready.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Jackson come to you again? - A. I afterwards went to the City coffee-house; Jackson was not then there, but his wife and a gentleman were in a private room.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did he come to you? - A. About eight o'clock in the evening; his wife and a gentleman were present; when he came in, he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, it is perfectly right; Mr. Brown was rather displeased at first at my having sent the lad, but he was pleased at my going up, and explaining the business; his friend said he dare say I was perfectly right, and indorsed the bills." I did not understand who Mr. Brown's friend was; in a short time after, I went with him to Webster and Corbett's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you there see him pay this bill of 1300 l. to Webster and Corbett? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the bill? - A. Yes, I looked at it in Corbett's hand; it was then indorsed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you looked at it before unindorsed? - A. Yes, it was the same bill.</p>
               <p>Q. And purported to be indorsed John Brown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the linens amount to 1300 l. or something less? - A. 1338 l.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning were the linens delivered by Webster and Corbett to your warehouse in Queen-street? - A. Yes, they were, early in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. At about what time was that delivery ready? - A. From six to seven o'clock in the morning, or rather before; I am not certain to the hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made an agreement with any other house for the sale of these linens? - A. Yes; Jackson was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was it? - A. The house of Rickaby and Company in Gracechurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after they were delivered to you, did you deliver them over to Rickaby and Company? - A. Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you been with Rickaby and Co.? - A. I don't recollect whether he went with me on the Friday or not, but on the Saturday, Jackson and I went together, the moment after the goods were delivered at my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any agreement made for these linens? - A. Yes, they were sold for money.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount? - A. Those which were bought for 2500 l. were sold for about 2000 l.; there is a balance in their hands now; I went soon after to the warehouse, and saw them delivering them; Mr. Jackson went with the carts to Rickaby's, and I followed; Jackson went for the purpose of receiving the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? - A. I believe about half past twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Jackson wait there? - A. A very short time; a gentleman said, as the goods could not be examined very quickly, he would let Mr. Jackson have 1800 l. on account, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Jackson did not wait the examination? - A. He did not; Jackson wanted me to receive the balance; I told him I had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he receive 1800 l.? - A. Yes, he received a check upon the house of Newnham, Everett, and Co. at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour was that? - A. Between twelve and one o'clock; he had told me in the morning that Mr. Brown was waiting for him at Baker's coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning did he tell you that? - A. As early as ten o'clock; when we came out of Rickaby and Co's. accompting-house, Jackson turned down towards London-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the way or the opposite way to Newnham and Everett's banking-house? - A. It was from Newnham's banking-house; I asked him where he was going then, that he was not going to Mr. Brown; he said he was going to see his little woman off to Maidstone, meaning his wife;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040015"></xptr>she was with him at the time; he said he would be with Mr. Brown very shortly; I told him, if he was only going into the Borough, I would walk with him; he did not seem to wish me to go, and I, thinking he might have something to say to his wife, did not press it; he wished me to wait for him in the neighbourhood, that he might inform me how Mr. Brown was pleased with his bargain; he appointed the Antigallican coffee-house, just by the 'Change; I then parted from him. I was not altogether pleased with his manner, and I turned and looked back to see which way he was going, and I observed, instead of going over London-bridge, he turned up Cannon-street; I did not like immediately to follow him, and I turned up Crooked-lane, which brought me into Cannon-street; I then lost sight of him, and did not see him again; I then went to the Antigallican coffee-house, but he did not come to me; I waited half an hour, or more; I then went to Baker's coffee-house to see if he was there, but he was not there; I saw Mr. Brown, but I did not then know him; he is a very remarkable gentleman; I was then going home, and in the Poultry I met Mr. Jackson's lad.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing that passed between you and him, what did you do? - A. I went back to Baker's coffee-house, and Mr. Brown was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inform Mr. Brown what had taken place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to find out Jackson? - A. I first of all endeavoured to stop the check; I went to Newnham's house, and then to the Bank; I endeavoured to find Jackson that day, but could not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were taken into custody for a day or two, and discharged upon giving your word to appear? - A. Yes, I was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. In March last you were a warehouseman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Dealing in linen? - A. Manchester goods principally.</p>
               <p>Q. Linen was not an article you dealt in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you now? - A. I am in an unfortunate situation; in consequence of this I became insolvent, and am a bankrupt; I have dealt in linens.</p>
               <p>Q. But it was not the particular article in which you dealt? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have probably raised money in the same way before? - A. No, I have sold goods of my own for bills before.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken up for this yourself? - A. I was detained for two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Charged with uttering this forgery? - A. I believe there was no charge given; it was at the instigation of Mr. Nalder, the City Marshal.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my learned friend that the original cost of this was 2500 l.? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was 500 l. sunk in the article sold? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is quite an usual thing? - A. No; but under the circumstances of this case, Jackson told me Mr. Brown was willing to lose fifteen per cent. I told Jackson, as near as I could calculate, it was twenty per cent. lost; he said it was no matter, Mr. Brown must have the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the goods examined? - A. Yes; I was present when they were looked at; they were not examined; there were two or three rounds taken out of each box, that is as much as any tradesman does.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon looking at the articles, they would easily find out that they were worth more than Rickaby and Co. afterwards gave for them? - A. They could no doubt ascertain the value.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you being present agreed to this bargain, notwithstanding the loss? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>"Saturday, 1st of March, 1804, with a heart almost sinking under the weight of my miseries, I left London; the motive which led me to this conduct I may explain at another time, if I live; the present is a rough sketch of my wanderings; I took a hackney-coach to Kensington about five o'clock, then proceeded in a post-chaise to Bristol. Sunday, I got to Bristol about six o'clock. Poor F. was tired, and went to a cupboard to get some supper. Accidentally crossing a square, I believe Queen-square, I met an Irish gentleman who was going to Ireland; that very morning I hastened back to the inn, got away, and by eleven o'clock we set sail on board the Graces for Dublin; the sea sickness affected both dreadfully, however a good passage brought us to Dublin on Tuesday night; I never can forget the strange behaviour of the waiter at the hotel in Dawson-street, who would give me nothing to eat, but very kindly sent me to the Leinster hotel, Frederick-street, where we were well off; the waiter gave me a bottle of wine, and made me laugh.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you been used to Mr. Brown's hand-writing? - A. I was for five years of his Majesty's Council, where Mr. Brown was President; I had an opportunity of frequently seeing him write.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not at all like it perhaps? - A. I cannot say that; I think the John very unlike it.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think of the name of Brown? - A. It is by no means I think like his.</p>
               <p>Q. Altogether it seems very unlike? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now take that into your hand? - A. This is a great deal more like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that that is his hand-writing? - A. No, I cannot swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Brown, like other men, don't always write with the same freedom? - A. Generally; I have had his correspondence six or seven years. (The bill read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not know till this moment that the defence would have devolved upon me: I did not know that my Counsel could not speak for me: I had every reason to believe they could, and I had furnished my Solicitor with documents to substantiate my innocence; but though a great number of witnesses have been subpoenaed, no one is here. Under these circumstances it is impossible for me to make any defence. With regard to the thing itself, I have simply to say this: that I never did commit a forgery; that I took the money I confess, and in doing so, that I acted very wrong, I confess also; and if Mr. Brown had charged me with defrauding him of the money, I should have submitted to my fate, but I never dreamed of committing a forgery. I met Mr. Brown at the place of appointment; he there endorsed the bills. As I hope to see Heaven, that is the truth, Gentlemen. It is not a trifling thing for a person in my situation to appeal to the Almighty: I know not how soon your verdict may bring me into the presence of that Being to whom I am appealing; but as I hope for future felicity, I never did commit the forgery. I am confident, if the evidence had been gone into which might have been gone into, you would have been convinced of my innocence. Whether you pronounce me guilty or innocent, as far as regards myself, is a matter of very little consideration; my character is already ruined; no absolution whatever can wash me from the stain now thrown upon my character. But I have a thousand things on account of which I wish to continue in existence: I have an infant, who will be left an orphan; I have a wife who is very young, who will be a widow without support; I have a parent who will be miserable, and two houses will be defrauded of their property. It is impossible for me to make more than an asseveration, and though my Solicitor actually subpoenaed a number of witnesses, not one single one has come, or a single effort made to save me from destruction. Under these circumstances I submit myself to your decision; I have no kind of hesitation in believing you will act as your consciences dictate; but whether your verdict is for me, or against me, there is a higher tribunal to which I look with pleasure, where I am certain I shall receive my acquittal. You will observe from the evidence, that I did not wish to obtain possession of the bills in a clandestine manner. I offered to return them to Mr. Akers that very night, if I had committed a forgery, and wished that forgery to pass unnoticed. I should not have been thus open in my conduct, if Mr. Brown had been examined: he would have told you that he said to me, I have no doubt of your integrity, and would willingly trust them with you endorsed. Under these circumstances I submit to whatever decision you may please to come to, satisfied with my own innocence; and I again appeal to that Supreme Being, who knows I am innocent of the crime with which I am charged.</p>
               <p>Court. It must not be understood that there is any blame in Mr. Brown not being called by the prosecutor, because he has no power of giving evidence; the Counsel for the prosecution could not call Mr. Brown; it was not in their power to call him.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Charity called again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Look at that which I gave into your hands before - look at the signature, and tell me whether you believe that to be Mr. Brown's hand-writing? - A. I believe it is; it is more like it than the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Read it all through, and see if you think the whole of it is Mr. Brown's? - A. I don't know whose writing the body is. (It is read. Signed John Brown.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you say any thing to Jackson upon that subject? - A. I told him, I was sure the person that I saw at Baker's coffee-house was not the John Brown I saw at the Mansion-House;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040021"></xptr>he told me at the Poultry Compter, that the prosecutor was the person who had signed the receipt; I told him the person I had seen at the Mansion-house, who was said to be Mr. Brown, was not the person that had signed the receipt at Baker's coffee-house; he said it was; I told him I could not swear to the person of Mr. Brown that I saw at the Mansion-house as being the person that signed it, I refused to swear to that person; upon which, he threatened me with my life if I would not come forward and swear that was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him since? - A. Yes, frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him the next time? - A. At the Poultry Compter, again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass? - A. Nothing, except my refusing, as he asserted, that Mr. Brown was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever tell you any thing about the receipt afterwards? - A. No; I always endeavoured to obtain the receipt from him, and destroy it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever see it in his hands at any time? - A. No; he would not let me ever see it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Has any thing ever passed, with respect to any other paper, between you and him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Just look at that; is it your hand-writing? (a paper handed to the witness.) - A. Yes; I got the receipt last Monday morning, from his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that receipt, that his wife gave you, the same receipt that you witnessed? - A. It was; it had my name upon it; I then took and tore it in several pieces, and threw it into the fire, and quite destroyed it.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had so done, did you ever see the prisoner again? - A. He sent for me; he wanted me to sign another receipt, and threatened me if I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that, and see whether that is like the receipt? - A. (Looking at a paper.) This is it; he wanted me to sign that on Monday, this week, and likewise on Tuesday; he wanted me to witness it, and I refused it, at Newgate.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he procured it, or how long it had been written? - A. He did not; I then went away, and would have nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You have told my Lord, and the Jury, that he had threatened you, frequently? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say, that you believed it to be the same receipt, and that it was signed by the name of John Brown? - A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been backwards and forwards to this man? - A. Several times, and frequently been threatened by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come here by any subpoena from the prosecutor? - A. No, by the defendant.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never refused to attend, and give evidence in this case on the part of the prisoner? - A. No, never; I always said I would come and say the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you, that you were not at the same table that the man wrote at? - A. Not during the time of conversation, I was at another table.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the person who signed the name of John Brown before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor that man that was at the Mansion-house before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible that you might be mistaken with respect to the person you saw? - A. No, because Mr. Brown is so particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes now, but he might not be then? - A. This one that I saw at the Mansion-house was not the person that signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the same person that signed the name of John Brown? - A. I think I should; I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. (To Dickson.) What time was it your master went out on that day? - A. I think on that day it was about eleven o'clock; I do not remember positively.</p>

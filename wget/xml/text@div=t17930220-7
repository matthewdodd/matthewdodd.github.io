On the 24th of January I went to bed about ten or eleven o'clock, and I put my pockets under my head, which I always do of a night, my four pockets I put them underneath the bolster; when I came to get up in the morning I dressed myself all but my pockets; I could not find them; I believe it was two o'clock the next day that I got up, so I pulled the clothes off the bed, the bolster and pillow, and I could not find them. My husband does not lay with me, he has two very bad legs; but we both sleep in one room; I called the maid up stairs and told her about it, that I could not find my pockets, I told her to look for them, and I supposed they must have slipped between the sacking and the bed; she said, she knew nothing of it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the bed and sacking? - I did, it was not there. I heard that the maid, the prisoner at the bar, had got a good deal of money, and I went after her; she went away out; she did not give any notice or say any thing when she went away; I went after her; I found her and brought her home, and found the money on her; I found her at a neighbour's house; a soldier was with me that is here; when she was brought back I asked her for the money; she said, she had not got it; then we sent for a constable and searched her, and she had the money in her bosom, in a yellow bag; the constable has got the money now and the bag; it fell out on the floor as they were taking it out and they picked it up, and counted it, there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200018"></xptr>was 5 l. and more, there was sixpences and shillings, and half a guinea; all the rest in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your money in when you put it into your pocket? - It was in a yellow canvas bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much you had in it? - I can swear to more than was found on her, I had more than that; I look upon it there was as much as 7 l. but I did not find any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you put this 7 l. in a canvas bag in your pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bed room door locked? - No, it was not; the prisoner was in the room in the morning, as soon as she was up; she came up about seven o'clock she did not take it then from me; it was later than that, she came in and took the money from me; I had been poorly, and had not slept much in the night; and I fell asleep after that.</p>
               <p>Q Had you a character with this young woman? - No otherwise than that I knew she lived in the neighbourhood, she had done so for a twelve month.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How came you first of all to tell us your husband's name was Samuel? - I beg you pardon, I was thinking of my other husband; I have had two husbands, my first husband's name was Samuel.</p>
               <p>Q. I should have thought you would have forgot your other husband long ago; how long was it your husband got up before you that day? - A good while.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you think? - Eight or nine o'clock, he is afflicted he cannot dress or undress himself; it might be eight or nine or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any lodgers in your house? - No, only an old woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not got soldiers? - Only one and he was upon guard.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the day did he go on guard? - About seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he was on guard from seven o'clock in the morning till two, Do you mean to say that he is never relieved for nine hours? - They are there all the day long, they do not come off till the next day; he is down at St. James's at the King and Queen's guard.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed some money about a month before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you found there was some money mislaid, and you found it again? - No, it was my husband had taken the money.</p>
               <p>Q. You charged the soldier with it? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say about it? - I spoke about it, and said I had lost my money; but I did not charge him with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say now that you did not charge either the soldier or that woman the time before? - I did not charge the soldier; but missed my money.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe afterwards it turned out that the money was mislaid? - No, my husband had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q Is your husband here to day? - He is not, he is very bad in bed.</p>
               <p>Court. Where had you missed the money from before? - My husband took it out of my pocket when I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him take it? - I did not mind it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take it when you was asleep? - He did; but he told me as soon as ever I said I had lost it; he said don't make yourself unhappy, I have got the money.</p>

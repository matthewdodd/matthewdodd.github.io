I have as many pistols as you have; the first pistol did not go off, the second did; I returned it; one of them clapped his hand to his side as if he was touched, and then to his face; there was a ball, with eight or nine slugs; the persons I imagined were wounded, they set off; I then went and called two of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240056"></xptr>Mr. Hughes's people; all this time Mr. Hughes's people were in the house; having discharged one pistol, and having no more ammunition, I thought it not proper to follow them; I went and searched the house; there was a pistol lying between the parlour door and the street door, and two bottles of spirits; they had broke into the house, and had wrenched out the iron bar of the cellar, where I suppose liquors are kept, facing that was the kitchen, where there was a quantity of linen; I saw no more of the prisoner till about four weeks afterwards; I heard he was in the New-bridewell precinct, St. George's-fields; I got our under inspector to go over with me, I gave him a description of the prisoner; I said as soon as I saw him, that is the person; he had a blue coat on, a flannel waistcoat, and a blue apron wrapped round his body; I saw him about four weeks after; says I to Mr. Knight, that is the very person I had hold of; the prisoner denied it strongly; I went away, and some time afterwards I went to the Rotation-office; I was subpoena'd down to Ryegate in Surrey, and there was bound over to attend here.</p>
               <p>Had you a lanthorn with you? - No; it was quite star-light, and getting upon the bank, it casts a great reflection.</p>
               <p>Could you swear, at the distance of four weeks, that you know that man again, having only seen him by star-light? - He was so remarkable, that I gave a description of him to Mr. Hughes, and they told me his name, and where he lived; Mr. Hughes would not go over with me; I even told them he was about as tall as me, if not taller, and a great deal lustier.</p>
               <p>Was there any advertisement of this man put in the papers? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As they all knew where I lived at the time, why did not they come after me?</p>
               <p>Elliot. Mr. Hughes's men who worked for him, knew where he lived, and by the description I gave, they told me where he lived.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Are any of your servants here? - No.</p>
               <p>And you was not there at the time? - I was not in the house.</p>

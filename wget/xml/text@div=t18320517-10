On Friday night, the 11th of May, at ten o'clock, my shop was closed, except one door, and about a quarter-past eleven a girl stepped in and asked for an ounce of coffee - I went to the mill to grind it, and she came up to me; I asked if she was going to help me grind it - she said Yes; I said one would do for that - she stood before me, endeavouring to attract my attention, but having a few loose coppers on the counter my attention was taken to them, and on advancing from my mill to the counter, the prisoner stepped into the shop, and took my purse with its contents off a chest which stood at the end of my counter, near the window, and quickly stepped out - it was a canvas purse, containing six sovereigns, with 9l. 19s. 6d., in half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences, and an empty silk purse; I had placed it on the chest about ten o'clock that night, about four yards from where I stood when the girl came in; I had taken it out of my till, and put it there, intending to take it up stairs when I went to bed - the girl was close in front of me, between me and the prisoner, when I saw him take it; I had put all the money in it myself - the chest was a yard and a half, or two yards from the door; when he took it he stepped out of the shop, and ran away; I dropped the coffee tin from my hand, jumped over the counter, and pursued, calling Stop thief! he went into Lumber-court, Earl-street, White Lion-street, and into Castle-street, then into a house, where he was taken by Starr, a Police-constable - I saw him taken; he was out of my sight as he turned one street, but I immediately caught sight of him again; I am confident of his person - he ran all the way; I left the girl in the shop; I saw my purse at the station in the possession of Preece.</p>

On the 11th of May, between a quarter and half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was standing within the prosecutor's shop door, talking to him; there was a tea-chest at the end of the counter, and a small canvas bag on it, which I have since seen; I was talking to him for about five minutes, then proceeded up Lumber-court, and when at the corner of Monmouth-court, which is opposite Lumber-court, I heard a cry of Stop thief! I immediately ran towards the Seven-dials, and there saw the prisoner dressed in a drab great coat, pursued by Gibb, who was in his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170024"></xptr>shirt sleeves; he went down White Lion-street - I joined in the pursuit; he turned into Castle-street, and by the time I was up with him he was in Starr's custody; we took him back to Gibb's shop, searched him, but found nothing - while I was placing the handcuffs on him, a person came and said the bag he was accused of stealing had been found by a woman; I took him towards the station-house, and met a woman in Castle-street with the bag, which Starr took possession of; the prisoner was running when I first saw him, and when apprehended he appeared out of breath; I knew him well before - I have seen him at different times.</p>

On the night of the 11th of May, about half-past eleven o'clock, as I stood at my door, I saw the prisoner, in company with three others, opposite my house; I did not know him before, but am sure of him - there were three men and a woman with him; I had not staid at my door above a moment before the woman crossed the road, followed by the prisoner - I instantly followed myself; I saw the woman in Gibb's shop, and the prisoner peeping through the crack of the door - he was not there long before he made a sudden dart into the shop, and came out again as quick as lightning; Gibb instantly jumped over the counter, and followed him, calling Stop thief! I went to the door, to prevent the girl coming out, and had not been there long before Lane, a private watchman, came - I left him there; I proceeded a little way up the court, and found the prisoner in the custody of two officers - I knew him to be the same person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why did you not stop me? A.

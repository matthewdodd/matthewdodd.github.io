I have asked him eight or ten times about 11 s. 7 d., due from Skelly - he always said it was not paid; he left me five or six weeks ago, and in about a fortnight Skelly came, and gave me information. I never received the money. When he was apprehended he said he should be glad to settle it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you pay his wages - A. No; he summoned me for 22 s., and I told the Commissioners I had paid his laundress's bill. I played at cards with him once, but did not lose; we played for a new hat - his fellow apprentice lost. When he left me he went to live with a baker four doors off; I took him there. He was not answerable to me for Skelly's debt. I never said he was gone to get my customers away, and should not live long there. He desired me to pay his laundress.</p>

            . I live in Crown-court, Little Poultney-street, and dealt with Ward. I paid the prisoner 4 s. 3 d. the week before Good Friday - he wrote a receipt on a paper, which I have lost in removing. I afterwards paid him a bill of 5 s. and odd. He called afterwards and said he had received my money, but there was a dispute between him and Ward, and I was not to say that I had paid him; but I went and told Ward.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you paid him 4 s. 3 d., you still owed money - A. No; I had more bread afterwards. I paid him four shilling pieces.</p>

I am shopman to Mr. Triggs, of High-street, Deptford, boot and shoe maker—on the evening of 26th April, the prisoner came and asked to be fitted with a pair of boots—I took down a pair which I thought would fit her, and while I was lacing them she said, would I send some boots up to Mrs. Price's at half-past 10 on the following morning?—she then said her foot was so ugly she would prefer being measured—I said, "I have some that will fit you"—I put on another pair which fitted her, but she said she would give me an answer when I sent up to Mrs. Price's—I asked her what price they were to be, she said about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had served a cook at Dr. Price's before, and I allowed the prisoner to take two pairs away, worth 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the two—she said she was housemaid at</p>

This crucifix was entrusted to me to sell by auction; on the 3d of July it was quite perfect, with this skull at the bottom of it - it was on view that day; I missed the skull on the following Monday -I had a gentleman who was in treaty for it; I said I had been unfortunate in losing the skull, and as he dealt in such articles, if the skull should be offered him I wished him to stop the party; he said "God bless me, it has been offered to me in a shop in St. Martin's-lane;" this is the skull - it is beautifully carved, and has two initials on it -I do not know what is the value of it; twenty guineas have been offered for the whole, and refused.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you happen to know the prisoner? A. I have seen him occasionally at the rooms; I do not remember having seen him between the 3d and the 6th of July - there were other persons attending.</p>

            . I am a jeweller and silversmith. I bought this skull of the prisoner, I think on the 6th of July, for 5s.; I have known him these twenty years, and I should have bought any thing of him - I would trust him with 5000l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you seen the prisoner before? A. Yes; he came and asked what it was worth, I said about 5s. - in the afternoon he came and sold it; he knew I was in the habit of putting curiosities in my window - I sometimes purchased a great deal of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he give any account where he got it? A. No; we never ask dealers - it is but of small value itself.</p>

            . I am an officer, and took the prisoner on the 9th July. I told him it was for stealing a skull; a young man with me said it was a skull stolen from Mr. Jones' room, in Leicester-square - he said he did not know any thing about it; I took him to the Mansion-house - we went to Bow-street next day, and then the prisoner said he had had a skull and sold it to Mr. Neate; he had had it three weeks, and bought it of a man in Mr. Robins' rooms, but he did not know his name; Mr. Halls put it off from Wednesday till Saturday, but he did not produce him - he was remanded till Wednesday again, and then Mr. Neate came; the prisoner declined saying any thing more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He was not accused of stealing a skull from the auction room? A. Yes, he was, but he said he had not done it; I then went to Mr. Neate's, and found this in front of his window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 3d of July I was in the City the whole day, and not near his place; and on the Saturday I went to see what sales they had for the next week. <rs id="t18290716-97-verdict553" type="verdictDescription">

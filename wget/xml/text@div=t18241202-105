The prisoner was there, and said he was out of place; I gave him some victuals and beer, and then I laid down to sleep. I had 11 s. when I went into the Plough; there were 4 s. or 5 s. in shilling pieces. I had known him before, and went into the house with him; he was in the same box with me: no other person was there. I had paid 1 s. before I went to sleep, and when I awoke some person told me I was robbed, and desired me to turn out my pockets - I did so, and found all my money gone. The prisoner had left the house, but returned and was there then, in the same box; he was taken to the watch-house, and three shillings, two sixpences, and three penny pieces, found upon him; it had been in my left-hand pocket, and he sat on that side.</p>

I saw these two persons in the tap-room; Harris was sober when he came in - I did not see any one but Ling with him; they sat down in the same box together - there was another sat down on the left side afterwards. The prisoner was nearest to Harris; I sat opposite them. I saw the prisoner put his hand into Harris's pocket, draw something out, and put it into his own left-hand waistcoat pocket. I told Harris of it about half an hour afterwards. When the prisoner had taken the money he remained there for some time - the other man remained there likewise. I did not continue to watch them.</p>

I was in Charles-street, and saw the prosecutor - he told me to attend to his horses while he went to sleep, and next day I found him at this public-house, drinking with Mr. Becket's relation; he told me to go and attend his coach and horses; I did not go into the house for more than half an hour, but when I did go in I found him, Mr. Becket's relation, and two or three others, drinking together. I had a pint or two of beer, then went out, and put the bags on the horses. I went in again, and in about ten minutes they accused me of robbing him; he had been with a girl all night in the coach; he was in a state of intoxication all that day, and the day before.</p>

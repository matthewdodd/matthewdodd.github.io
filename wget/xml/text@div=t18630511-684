                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 150). On 22d April I was on duty in Bon<lb></lb>ner's-row, Victoria-park, and heard a cry of "Police!" in a man's voice—in consequence of which I went to the front door of No. 5—it was opened by some one inside—I went in and met the prisoner's husband coming down<lb></lb>stairs with the prisoner, and this box and six shillings—he handed me the box and the six shillings, and said that she was in the act of passing it to the landlady, but he prevented her, and told me to take her to the station, and he would come down and charge her—this is the box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it contained 100 shillings, ten half-crowns, and thirteen florins, all in separate packets, wrapped up in tissue paper, and sealed—they are all counterfeit—I took her to the station—the prisoner said her husband had brought it there for a <hi rend="italic">plant</hi> to put her away, and that he bought 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took the husband as well—he was afterwards discharged by the Magistrate—10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money was found on the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Millburn, a carman—on Wednesday, 15th April, I think, I removed the prisoner's goods from Wharf-road, Shoreditch, to Stratford—I don't know the name of the street—on the next Wednesday the prisoner's husband came and asked me where she bad removed to—I was present when the disturbance took place at Bonner's-row—I heard him then speak of her as his wife, and she did not deny that—he had no box during the time I was with him, from 11 o'clock in the morning till between 4 and 5 in the evening, when we got to 5, Bonner's row—before we went in we spoke to a constable, in case she should make any disturbance—we went up stairs, and the husband laid, "This is my wife and these are my things," and ordered us to take the furniture out—the prisoner then went to the cupboard and brought out this box, and her husband immediately caught hold of her and took it away from her, and caught hold of her other wrist and dragged her down stairs, and gave her in custody to the policeman—I also saw a packet in her hand at the bottom of the stair-case, which she wanted to pass to the landlady, and the said, "I will have nothing at all to do with it"—her husband took the packet out of her hand and gave it to the policeman.</p>

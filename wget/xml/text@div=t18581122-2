Mr. Gibson and his wife lodge on the first floor over the shop, and over that floor the prisoner lodged with his wife; I slept on the same floor as the prisoner—I do not know whether he was at home when I went to bed—he had a latch key and could go in and out when he pleased—on the Thursday morning I awoke about 7 o'clock—I went down and found a large piece of wood broken off the top of the door-post—I then went to the back part of the premises and saw that the wainscoating had been broken beyond the kitchen, so that a man could get through the hole: I examined the till and missed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I examined the oil drainer about 10 o'clock, and found in it a large quantity of burnt paper—there was oil in the cistern above, which must have been set fire to if the fire had reached it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Gibson, a packing-case maker. In October last we lodged on the first floor of Mrs. Fontaine's house. On Wednesday night, 6th October, I went to bed about 12 o'clook—I had heard the prisoner come home at 11 o'clock, and let him in—he went up stairs into his own apartment—he had to pass our room to go there—he was very tipsy—I could hear his footsteps—we were having our supper—I afterwards heard him go down; that was between five and ten minutes after he came in—I could hear him speaking to his wife before he came down; she did not wish him to go out, but he would go—I heard him pass the door, but did not see him—I heard his voice; they were having a few angry words about going out—I know that he went out because I heard the door shut—I heard him come home again at about a quarter to 3 on Thursday morning—I was awake when he opened the street door—he went up stairs but remained only a minute or two, and came down again (my husband was awake)—when the prisoner came down, I heard a noise as if some one was putting their back and forcing the panels out—I heard that repeated three times—I heard the noise after he passed my door in about the time that it would take for him to get to the top of the stairs—I awoke my husband, and he heard it as well—I next heard the prisoner go up-stairs again; I knew his steps because I have heard him come home every morning for two or three months—he only remained up-stairs a minute or two and then came down again, and I heard a noise as though he was wrenching off the padlock—that was in about the time it would take him to get there after passing my door—I then heard him go through into the back part of the premises, and a few minutes after I smelt fire—I then heard him come up-stairs again, and my husband went to him and said, "Cramp, what have you been doing; have you been burning anything down stairs?"—he said, "No, I have no light; I have only just this minute come in"—I said, "You have been in this half-hour, doing something down at the shop—he made no reply, but went to his own apartment—I remained in my room, but my husband went down.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you go to sleep? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After some time—the boy Evans sleeps over me on the second floot—he is not in the habit of staying out late; the latest that he stays out is 12 o'clock, and that is on Sundays; he lets himself in with a key—I know a person named Banks; I did not say to him "Sure to God he (<hi rend="italic">Evans</hi>) has not done this to make himself right when he was bad in his books," nothing of the sort—the first time we took stock, Evans said that his books were rather deficient; that is the only time—stock had been taken two months and more before that; I think it was nearly time for taking stock again—the prisoner and his wife had lodged there nearly twelve months; he was there while he was a policeman—he resigned a few days before this.</p>

               <p>burning anything—he said that he had just come in—my wife said, "Mr. Cramp, you have been in thia half-hour"—he said that he had just come in—I went down to discover whether any brown paper was burning, but could not find any—I found the partition broken away, and placed my head in it to see if I could smell any more burning paper and then went up-stairs—I have never seen this poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) before; I found it there—no one has claimed it—I gave it to the lad Evans.</p>

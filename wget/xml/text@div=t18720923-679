I am a master mariner, and live at Park Place, Hack<lb></lb>ney—about 12 o'clock on Thursday night, 28th August, I was in Aldgate; the female prisoner stopped me by Aldgate Church, and asked me to stand something; immediately afterwards some one came behind me, and struck me at the back of the head—I fell down, and I recognised this man—after I had been down a minute or two, there was another fellow came on the road, and kicked me in the mouth—I held this man for some time, and he worked his way out of his coat—I called "Police!" and said "I have lost my watch"—the woman said "Let go my husband"—the men got away afterwards, but the woman did not; a witness came to my assistance—I saw Cohen next morning about 10 o'clock; he was brought into the Aldgate Police-station, and I recognised him again—I am still suffering very much in my head, and have been deaf ever since—my knee-cap was broken from the fall, and my mouth cut, and I have another mark on my shoulder—I lost a valuable watch and chain, and about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money.</p>

I am a general dealer, in Gravel Lane—about 12 o'clock on the night of 28th August I was in Aldgate—I was leaning on a post, smoking a cigar—hearing some scuffling behind me, I turned round and saw two men and a woman on a man—I can't recognise their faces because they were turned towards the rails of the church—I heard the man call out "Stop thief, help, they have got my watch!"—I saw one dressed in black run away—I ran after him; he was too fast for me, and I turned back—when they ran away the prosecutor was staggering, and he turned round to me and looked me full in the face—I ran after the man I expected had the watch and chain.</p>

               <p>before 12 o'clock—Martin was pointed out to me, and I took her into custody—some one told me that a man had been knocked down and robbed—I left her in charge of another officer for a few minutes—I knew Cohen, and at that time the female had Cohen's coat on her arm—this is the coat—I found I could not catch Cohen—he went across the ruins through Storey Lane—I came back and took Martin—two hours after Cohen was apprehended in Whitechapel by another officer—I asked Martin how she came by the coat, and she said that she had picked it up.</p>

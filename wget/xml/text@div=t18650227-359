                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and work at Messrs. Easton and Arnor's, of the Grove, Great Guildford-street, Bridge-road—on Saturday, 4th February, I left work at 1 o'clock—about half-past 11 or a quarter to 12 that night I was in Mint-street—I was perfectly sober—Enderson pounced upon me, and the other two rushed round me, threw me down, and picked my pockets of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a door key, and took a cap that was on my head—I have not the least doubt whatever as to the identity of these three men—I swear to them—when they came and collared me, I said, "For God's sake don't rob a poor man who has been hard at work all the week, 'and I shouted "Murder!" and "Police!"—I received an injury on my shoulder when I was on the ground—I believe it was from a blow, and 1 fell on my head also; I was thrown down—when I shouted, the prisoners ran round the corner of the street as hard as they could run—I lost sight of them, and made away to find a policeman—I went to the station, gave information to the inspector, and then went home—about 3 o'clock, I was going to the station again and met a policeman coming for me—six men were shown to me then, and I picked the prisoners out from them—they had been appre<lb></lb>hended on that afternoon—I have now no doubt whatever of their identity.</p>

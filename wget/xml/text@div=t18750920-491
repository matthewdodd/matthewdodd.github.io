               <p>were a great number of railway vans about from 9.30 to 12 o'clock, the city is generally blocked at that time—I watched the prisoner for three hours—a Midland van of which William Clark was the guard, was standing still in Cannon Street—it afterwards went into Watling Street, where the prisoner jumped up on the tail-board as it went along and pulled a small truss from the centre to the tail-board and then jumped down and got it on his left shoulder—the van then stopped, and the guard jumped down to deliver that very bale there—the prisoner ran, and I followed him and never lost sight of him till I took him at the corner of Friday Street—I said "Come along, you will have to go back with me"—he said "What for?"—I said "For stealing a sale of goods"—he said "Not stealing, only an attempt"—I said "You will have to settle that somewhere else."</p>

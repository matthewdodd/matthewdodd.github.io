                  </hi>. I live at West Ham. I had three old rabbits, and five young ones, eight altogether—they were shut up in hutches, and kept in a blacksmith's shop where I work—I saw them safe on Friday evening, the 24th of Dec.; I missed them about half past 6 o'clock the same evening—I saw a lad pass with a basket about that time—I ran over to my shop, which I had left locked up; J found the door wide open, I struck a light and went in, and missed the rabbits—I ran after the lad and passed him, I did not see him—I was telling a policeman, and the prisoner passed me with the basket on his head—I went and told him he had got my rabbits—he said he found them—he was taken into custody—some of the rabbits are here, I can swear to their being mine.</p>

About half past 6 o'clock in the evening of 24th Dec. the prosecutor came to me at Bow-bridge, and said his shop bad been broken open, and his rabbits stolen—while he was speaking the prisoner and another lad passed by—the prisoner had the rabbits on his head—the other lad ran away—as we were going to the Magistrate, the prisoner said they had stolen the rabbits, and had he known he should have been <hi rend="italic">cocked</hi> with the rabbits, he would have kicked the b—lot over Bowbridge.</p>

On the 11th of August, between six and seven in the morning, the prisoner came in, and asked to look at some ribband. I shewed him a box of figured ribband. He asked for two yards three quarters, and wanted me to abate him a halfpenny a yard. I told him I could not. He looked over the box a few minutes: he then went out of the shop; but returned again, and asked me if I had got any plain ribbands. I shewed him some. He asked the price, and wanted an abatement of a halfpenny a yard in them; and he looked over them a few minutes. I told him I could not abate; and shut up the box. He asked if I had any black ribbands. I shewed him some, and he wanted me to abate him something in them. I said I could not. While he was looking over that, the servant-maid came out of the parlour, and bid me put the box away, saying that he was a thief, and did not want ribbands. He said, he was no thief, and went out of the shop. I then looked in the box, and missed a piece of black ribband. There was a person sweeping the shop: I bid her go after him, and bring him back. The piece I missed was the only piece of the sort that was in the box. He had been looking at it. The young woman brought him back, and an opposite neighbour came over to her assistance. He came back close to the counter: he opened his clothes, his coat, waistcoat, and breeches, and the ribbands all rolled out from him into the black ribband box; but where they came from I cannot tell: I am sure they were not there before. He then said, he had not got any thing. I asked how the the ribbands came into the box; he said, he could not tell, and then attempted to go out. I stopped him; and he offered me a guinea, which he had in his hand: he did not say what he offered it for. There were four half pieces of coloured ribband returned into the black ribband box.</p>

The prisoner was in the shop about a quarter of an hour.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120031"></xptr> I went into the shop, and he seemed quite confused: his eyes went like clock-work. He offered me a guinea, and desired me to get change. I made him no answer. I saw him put a handkerchief he had in his hand over a piece of five penny ribband. I then told the journey woman to take the ribband away, that he was a thief. He directly went out of the shop. The apprentice went out after him, and fetched him in again. He went up to the counter. His coat, waistcoat, and breeches, were loose. I saw him bring up the four pieces of ribband with his hand, within his cloaths, and put them into the box. Whether they came from his breeches, or coat and waistcoat, I cannot tell. He wanted to get away: we were hardly able to hold him.</p>

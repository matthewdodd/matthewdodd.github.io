As I suspected him, I counted over an hundred Dozen, and afterwards found 4 or 5 Dozen of them wanting.</p>

I always prepared the Brass for the Engine to cut, and wanting to find out the Nature of this Engine, I slip'd in 4 or 5 Pieces of my own, and which I had prepar'd, that they might be cut with 300 of his; he cut them without discovering they were mine; and I took them away.</p>
               <p>Several Persons appear'd, of whom the Prisoner had bought Brass, and several others gave him the Character of an honest Man. <rs id="t17360908-1-verdict4" type="verdictDescription">

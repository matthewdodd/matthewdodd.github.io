I am a tailor of 26, Tiverton Street, Newington Cause<lb></lb>way—I occupy the back room upstairs—the prisoner and his wife lived in the house; they have a chandler's shop, and a small back parlour and bedroom on the first floor front—my little boy, between 7 and 8 years old, slept with me in the back room—on 6th November I was in my room up to 12.30, when I came down to go out; as I went out I saw the deceased sitting asleep in a chair in the back parlour—the room was in a very confused state; the hearthrug was up and the fender was up, as if she made an attempt to clean the room—her age was 61 or 63—she appeared as if she was under the influence of liquor——she was habitually given to drinking—I said "Old lady, old lady, you are wrong, wrong again," but she did not answer—she was alone—I came back in about a quarter of an hour, and found her in the same state and still alone—the prisoner came to me about 6 or 6.30; I had not</p>

I will leave the door open for you"—I heard no reply; I was in bed—I heard nothing more that night—next morning about 10 o'clock I went down to go into the yard, and when I got in the parlour I saw the deceased lying in front of the fireplace a little more towards the partition of the shop, on her stomach, and with her face on the floor and her legs straight out—she was dressed as she had been over night to the beet of my knowledge, and she was to all appearance asleep—I saw the prisoner on the stairs about 12.30; I think he stepped over the stair that I was cleaning; that was the first time I had seen him that morning—I could see the woman lying in the same position—he went up to her and said "Are you going to get up now?"—she made no reply—he went towards her, turned her over, and said "Good God, George, my wife is dead; what shall I do? I will go for a doctor immediately," and he went out apparently for that pur<lb></lb>pose; he returned in five or ten minutes and said that the doctor was out—I said "You had better go to the police-station"—he went out and came back with a constable—Dr. Tanner came in a few minutes and went upstairs—I saw him several times later in the day, and went to the undertaker's with him—he said on the road that he could not understand how it had happened, but he supposed she must have had a fit—that was after the doctor had been—I had lived there about six or seven weeks, but had never seen any indication of a fit about her—she was very possibly that night under the influence of drink, which was very often—prisoner has more than once told me not to allow my children to get any drink for her—I had not seen her on the Saturday before I saw her lying drunk.</p>

               <p>to lead me to believe the woman was still drunk"—I heard falling about, and when he came in I heard him call out to her as if he wanted to know he where she was—when he came up to me he asked me for the rent, but did not tell me the place below was all in darkness—the slaps sounded like open-handed slaps—I heard sounds of falling a number of times during the evening, as if a person was trying to get up and falling down again—there did not appear to be a struggle, there were no broken sounds—it seemed as if somebody fell down—I did not take sufficient notice in the evening, nor went down to see what the chairs and tables were knocked about for—the prisoner and she were on very good terms when she was sober—I have heard that some time ago he left her in conse<lb></lb>quence of her drunken habits—I do not know that he came back at her request—he is a tanner and leather-dresser—his shop is inside a private house—he was perfectly sober—he has always borne the character of a peaceable, sober man—I have seen him a little fresh when he has been to a dinner, and do not call him a thoroughly sober man.</p>

               <p>Street, to the parlour at the back of the shop, and saw a woman lying with her face on the floor near the fireplace; her hair was rough and disordered, she was dead and cold, and her body was rigid—she had, in my judgment, been dead from eight to ten hours perhaps more—her clothes had been tucked in so that she was not disordered—I saw blood and saliva coming from her mouth on the floor—I Examined her all over—a constable was present—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—her face was bruised—her eyelids were filled with blood and serum, what you would call very black eyes and very much swollen, so that we could only see the eyes with great difficulty—I was obliged to place my finger under the lids and draw them over the eye to be able to see the eyes—the forehead was much bruised, the ears were very much bruised and dark and very much blackened—the scalp appeared very boggy on the top where the hair grows—boggy means swollen and distended—there were several bruises on the back and on the arms, particularly on each elbow, and there were immense bruises on each hip and several bruibes on the legs and on the external portions of each knee—I found all the internal organs were healthy, out the left kidney was very large, and the right was very small, but they were healthy—her lungs and liver were all healthy—I found on the scalp a large quantity of effused blood corresponding with the external marks which I have described as "boggy"—there were several ounces of blood there altogether—that was produced, in my opinion, by external violence—that would be the cause of death, and also extravasation inside the brain—there was a large quantity of blood extravasated between the membranes of the brain—the mark I found and the appearance of the brain would produce insensibility—the external violence would produce what I found in the brain, and would produce coma, and death would supervene—death was caused by the injury to the head, and it was death by coma—the skin wan not broken anywhere, nor were the bones fractured, nor was there any fracture of the skull—the marks on the face and head were such as must have been inflicted by blows from fists or by kicks—very great violence must have been used—the marks on the hips might nave been caused by kicks—the marks of violence were not all recent, but the great majority were—the injuries to the head and the hips had been done within the last 24 hours—many blows must have been given to produce injuries to the head, face, and eyes—I do not think they could have been caused by her being drunk and falling down—I doubt whether the marks on the elbows and knees could have been caused by a drunken woman trying to raise herself, and falling down on her elbows—she was well nourished—she had not a drunkard's liver, so if she had taken to drink it must have been recently—Dr. Barber assisted me in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The policeman told me he had sent for me—the bruises on the elbows might have been produced if she stood on a chair and fell from it, the injury to the head would not have been produced to that extent by her falling against the edge of a table—the hands were not clenched, one was partially closed and one open, blood and saliva was coming from her mouth, and her lips were not cut inside—if a person had died in an epileptic fit and I saw her some ten hours after death I should most likely find blood and saliva coming from her mouth; if she died in a fit of epilepsy, most likely the hands would be clenched, and the feet drawn, to</p>

               <p>some extent, the toes—the hands were not clenched, nor were the feet drawn—the clenched hands and the drawing of the toes might remain for hours after death—I should expect to find it eight or ten hours afterwards—the prisoner stated that she was constantly having fits, and that she no doubt died in one—I had attended her about sixteen years ago, but not for a. fit, and the neighbours said she never had fits—the prisoner suggested to me that she died in a fit, so that my attention was called to the matter on the spot—a person fairly nourished would be more easily bruised than a thin, spare person; falling about would leave more marks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> She had no fits when I knew her some years ago, but epilepsy does not come on so late in life as 61 or 63 without an injury to the head—at that age it is generally apoplexy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner in Newington Causeway—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>, and saw the state of the body—I agree with the cause of death as injury to the head—there must have been many blows given, and very great violence used—I noticed the pulpy appearance at the top of the head, that caused the injury to the brain—those injuries could not have been caused by a drunken woman falling about.</p>

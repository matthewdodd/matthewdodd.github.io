On 4th Jan. the prisoner came there, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, with another man—one of them, I cannot say which, asked for a pint of beer, and gave me a shilling—they were in company, and both of them drank of the beer—I gave 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and they both went away directly—as soon as they were gone I looked at the shilling and found it was bad—I put it on a shelf, and it remained there till I gave it to the constable—on the afternoon of 6th Jan. the prisoner and the same man came again—they called for a pint of beer, and one of them gave me a shilling; it was a dark afternoon, and I could hardly tell whether it was good or bad—I gave change for that, and after they were gone I found it was bad—I sent three persons after them—I put the shilling in the fire, and it melted pretty quickly—on 11th Jan. the prisoner came again, between 9 and 10—there was another man with him,</p>

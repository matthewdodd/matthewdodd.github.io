                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Wal worth—the prisoner was my charwoman. I missed some stockings and other things—these articles produced are mine—this print was taken out of an album of mine—this chintz and lace were taken out of my work-box—it was always kept locked—the prisoner was repeatedly in the room in which these things were—these cotton stockings have my own work in them, and my own initials—I missed some silk stockings and this pair of trowsers, which are my son's—I missed a spoon, and spoke to the prisoner—she said she knew nothing of it.</p>

I was going by Essex-street, and standing at the corner, four young men came up to me, the prisoner was one, he asked me what I wanted to give charge of them for; they had insulted me before, by pushing me about, and kicking me. I threatened to give charge of them, and then went ten or fifteen yards further, and then the prisoner asked what I wanted to give charge of them for, I said, because they kicked, and insulted me; he then struck me with his fist, and knocked me down, the other three picked me up, and as they were doing it, I called out, Watch! the watchman came, and caught the prisoner; we went to Whitechapel watch-house, and I gave charge of him for an assault - he was sent to Spitalfields watch-house, and after that, I found my three pockets turned inside out, and missed 4 s. 6 d., and a few halfpence, which I am sure I had when they first insulted me. I cannot say what time it was taken, as I was almost stunned; I cannot tell what the prisoner did when I was down, they were all four about me, I did not see any of them take my property. I had said I would give charge of them, but I did not call the watch till they knocked me down. I have never recovered my property. They had insulted me near Castle-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What had you drank - A. Part of three pints of beer, and a glass of gin. My friend keeps the house, in Castle-street; I was alone when this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. The blow appeared from revenge - A. I cannot tell. He said, "Why did you charge me?" and immediately struck me; he was one of those who insulted me, for I I had looked in his face in Castle-street, we had no quarrel at all; I had called watch! the first time, and the watchman came - he ran away. I then went fifteen yards, and they came up again, it was about a quarter of a mile from the public-house, they had to go to another watch-house, as the Whitechapel one was under repair. I found I had lost my money after he was sent to the other watch-house. I had been waiting in the watch-house all the time, as the officer said, he would stop me, if I could not have bail to appear against him, as he did not know me. The watch-house is a quarter of a mile off, only one man went with us, a good many watchmen came up, but did not go to the watch-house. I discovered my loss half an hour after he was taken to the watch-house, I was detained at the first watch-house till ten o'clock, when my bail came. I waited with the officer, I am sure my money was safe after the first time they insulted me, because I looked for it. The prisoner had gone about two doors from where I was knocked down, I had followed, holding him. I am certain he is the man who struck me, I never lost sight of him. My pockets could not have been turned out after he was taken.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 6th of November, there was a cry of watch, I was about ten yards from where the prisoner and prosecutor stood, when I came up they both stood together, the prosecutor had hold of the sleeve of his coat, and gave charge of him for knocking him down. He said, he was certain he was the man, I took him, the watch-house keeper would not take charge of him unless the prosecutor gave bail for his appearing before the Magistrate; I got the prosecutor's friend, who answered for his appearance. Five or ten minutes after he came in, I saw that his right hand breeches pocket, and his waistcoat pocket, were turned inside out; he said he was sure one of the four had stolen 4 s. 6 d. from him, and some halfpence. The prisoner said, he knew nothing about striking the prosecutor, he knew nothing of it. The prosecutor was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not come up till after he was in custody - A. The prosecutor was holding him. I am well acquainted with bad characters; I never knew the prisoner before.</p>

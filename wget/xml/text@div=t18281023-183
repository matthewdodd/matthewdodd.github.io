On the 29th of September, about a quarter-past one o'clock, I was in my garden, and heard one of my fowls make a desperate noise; I looked to a hole through which the fowls go, and saw a man's hand - I opened the back-gate, and saw the prisoner with the fowl in his hand; he put it down - I took him, and asked what he did there, it being private property; he said he was going to look at the pipe-makers - I knew his name to be Dove, but he said it was Ridley; he struggled, but the officer came and took him.</p>

                  </hi> My real name is Caroline Carey. I live in Leg-court, Peter-street, Westminster. The prisoner and his wife lived in an apartment over mine—on this Saturday night, a little before eight o'clock, I believe, I heard them quarrelling, and the woman afterwards passed through the passage muttering to herself that he had called her an Irish w—e—about fifteen or twenty minutes after she went up stairs again, and I heard them quarrelling again—by and by I heard a fall, and several blows and kicks, as I supposed—the fall shook my window and door—I did not hear what passed between them—I heard the woman say, "Go it, you b----"—that was the last expression I heard from her—when I returned in about two hours I went up and found her dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at 10, Titchbrook-street, Belgrave-road. I was called in about a quarter past nine o'clock, on the evening of the 14th April, and found two women and, I think, the prisoner lifting the deceased from the floor—she was perfectly insensible, and died within a quarter of an hour—there was no evidence of blows externally, but there was evidence of blood having flowed from the private parts—it was not then flowing, but the body was saturated—on Monday, the 16th, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, on the Coroner's warrant—it then appeared that the blood had come from the uterine organs—I found there was a contused wound on each side—it might have been caused by a kick, or striking by some blunt instrument—I think it must have been done by a single blow; and it was that blow which had created the bleeding—I think that death was caused by pulmonary congestion, which a blow over the organs of the heart, about the lower part of the chest, would be likely to occasion—the heart itself was dis<lb></lb>eased, but not to a large extent—I think that the woman being subject to spasms, and being senseless when they were on, as it was stated before the Coroner, is a symptom of the diseased condition of the heart, nothing more—that does not at all alter my opinion as to the effect of the blows—when I first went into the room the prisoner said, "I will not deceive you, Sir: we have had some words, and I have struck my wife"—he said he had struck her a blow on the side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at Pimlico. On the 14th of June, in the morning, I found this bottle of oil secreted in an iron cistern on my premises—I suspected a man named Cotterell, but about twelve o'clock I saw the prisoner coming out of the front door of my house with this oil—there is but one door—I had seen him three or four minutes previously at the part of the house where the oil was—I taxed him with it—he pulled it out of his pocket, and said he brought it from home—I said, "It is false, it is my oil"—he said his wife gave it him, that she bought it at Roberts's in Store-street—I went with him to Roberts's, and sent for his wife—both his wife and the shopman in his presence denied all knowledge of it—I sent for a policeman, he had not told a lie, he said "Yes"—the bottle is his own.</p>

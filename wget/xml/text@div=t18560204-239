                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Truby, we keep a beer shop, the Brickmakers' Arms, at North Hyde, in the Precinct of Norwood. On Monday night, 21st Jan., the prisoner came in a little after 6 o'clock—he called for a pint of beer, I served him—he had another pint of beer, one before Price came, and one after he came—the prisoner was quite sober—Price came in; I knew him, he had been in my house twice before—he came in with two men, Tripp and Johnson—when Price came in the prisoner was sitting on the left hand side of the fire, in the taproom—Price was tipsy—he called for a pot of beer—I demurred about drawing it, but at last I did, and he paid me with a shilling—he drank some of it, and oflered the others some—I then went to the bar, and I afterwards returned to the taproom—Price was then sitting in the chair by the right hand side of the fire—he began to say to the prisoner, "You villain, you rascal; I have been to your mother's and asked for a pint of beer, and she had not got any"—the prisoner said, "I cannot help it, sir, I wish I could; I would fill my mother's cellar</p>

I think he is dead!"—the prisoner said, "I hope not; I hope not"—I ran up stairs and alarmed the house, I came down and sent for the doctor, or the policeman, or any one they could find—the doctor is Mr. Leese—my husband and the prisoner went for him, and a man named Jones, a lodger—Mr. Leese came as soon as he got dressed—I asked the prisoner how this happened, and he said the man hit him first, and he returned the blow—there is a table in the taproom, and an iron rim round it, which stands up higher than the wood, because the wood has been scrubbed away, and is lower than the iron rim—there was blood on the iron rim.</p>

On Monday, 21st Jan., I, and Price, and Johnson, met at the Jolly Brickmakers, kept by a widow lady, named Slingsby—we went from there to the Brickmakers' Arms—I found the prisoner there, sitting on a chair by the fireside—Price did not appear to me to be tipsy—he walked very well to the house, which is about half a mile from the Jolly Brickmakers—he called for a pot of beer—he began to upbraid Smith for his bad conduct to his mother—I left and went to the sink, and when I came back Mrs. Truby was there, and Price was lying on the floor with his coat off, bleeding from the nose and face—I said, "What is the matter now? what are you up to now? I hope you have not hit this old gentleman; if I thought you had, I would hit you"—the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Norwood-green, about a mile from the Bookmakers' Arms. I was called up about 1 o'clock, on Tuesday morning, 22nd Jan., by the prisoner and Truby—I went to Truby's house as soon as I could dress—I was shown into the taproom—I saw the body of a man lying on the floor—he was quite dead—there was very little heat indeed about the stomach, and some part of his chest—there was blood about his face, and a good deal of congealed blood in his nostrils—there was a wound over the nose, and a clean incised wound on the inner angle of the eyebrow, quite down to the bone—it had ceased to bleed—there was merely some little clotted blood about it—it appeared as if it had been inflicted by something sharp—I went the next morning, and I noticed there was an iron rim round the table, which projected in some places, where the wood was worn away, about the sixteenth part of an inch—the wound could have been occasioned by a person falling against it; and there was a fender shown me in the room, which might have occasioned it—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the body forty hours afterwards—I examined the head, chest, and abdomen—that incised wound going down to the bone did not go into the orbit—it did not seem of great importance—there was an extensive swelling behind the ear, which seemed to have been inflicted by something very hard—I think that could have been done by a blow from a fist—that had nothing to do with the cut on the nose—it was on the same side—the cartilage of the nose had been smashed—the integuments of the scalp were much filled with blood, and other parts as well—there was a sudden arrest of the circulation in the membranes of the brain—either a fall or a blow would occasion that—there was a good deal of serum in the ven<lb></lb>tricles of the brain—that might have arisen from the man having drunk a great deal—I think a blow would have assisted that—I examined the body—the lungs were perfectly healthy, and did not contain blood—the heart contained a good deal of blood on the right side—there had been a sudden arrest of the circulation—the stomach was healthy—the kidneys were con<lb></lb>gested, which might have been caused by drink—I should think a fall or a blow occasioned his death—he was in very good health, and had a great quantity of fkt—there were no internal causes which would have caused his death.</p>

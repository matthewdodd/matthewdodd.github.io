I am married—I am the prisoner's sister—I went home to do for my mother on that Wednesday evening, as she was an invalid—the prisoner was under the window at 8.30, talking to his mother, and he was in by 10—how he came to mention the name of Martin was because he worked for nobody else in Woolwich-—when I told him of it, he said, "I am not going to run away, I am innocent; and if I see the detective I will speak to him—he lives at 16, Church Row—it would take three-quarters of an hour to walk very fast from there to Mr. Martin's—he was at home and in bed by 10 o'clock—I let him in; it struck 10 just as I opened the door—he went up stairs, and I bolted the door—I knew of his being taken in custody—I did not go before the Magistrate till too late, and the case was over.</p>

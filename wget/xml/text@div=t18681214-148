I am a constable of the Victoria Docks—I was on duty there on the night between 11th and 12th November—and near I o'clock I heard a splashing in the water, as though someone was rowing a boat—I waited some little time, and saw a barge coming across—a man, who I can<lb></lb>not swear to, was on it—I called out and got an answer, and directly after<lb></lb>wards Powell came up and said, "Have you seen my barge, Ned?"—he said, "No, I have had trouble enough to find my own"—Powell asked me if I had seen a barge adrift—I said, "No," and asked him what sort of barge it was—he said, "A decked barge, with about 60 tons of rice in it, and that he would go up the south shore and look—I walked up the south shore with him very nearly a mile, and could not see it—at the end of my beat is the pontoon bridge, he stooped down there and said, "I think I see my barge behind those steamboats, how can I get to her?"—I said, "I do not know, the best thing is to ask the man you spoke to on the other barge if he has got a boat"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186812140108"></xptr>
               <p>—he said, "I will do so, and if I cannot get a boat I will turn in, for I am very tired"—I then came up to the fireman and went with him, and saw no more of Powell—the conversation lasted three-quarters of an hour—about 2.55 I met Robert Christopher, another dock constable, I told him what I had seen—we went round to the backs of the warehouses, and came upon some bags of tobacco lying on the ground—we laid down near them, and Edward Turnbull and another man came up—Edward Turnbull took a big and turned it over down towards the bottom of the bank, which slopes towards the boundary fence—he then saw us lying on the ground, and sang out "Halloa <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, is that you," three or four times—we made no reply—Edward Turnbull came towards us with something in his hand—we got up and I said to Christoper, loud enough for him to hear, "Look out, he has something in his hand!"—Christopher immediately sprang on him, threw him down, and took him in custody—they were about seven yards from the bag of tobacco—the other man ran away—we took Edward Turnbull to the station—I afterwards saw a hole under the fence—the bags of tobacco were distributed through the hole to the top of the embankment—some of them were close to the hole.</p>

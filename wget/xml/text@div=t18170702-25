            . I am a ticket-porter. On the 23d of June, about half-past four in the afternoon, I was sitting on the bench under the church at the bottom of Lawrence-lane, and saw a man come out of Mr. Wood's warehouse with a quantity of shawls under his arm; I remarked to my fellow-porters how he ran with them, and said, "surely he has not stolen them!" I immediately went over to Mr. Wood's to inquire of the warehouseman, and found he had not sent any out. I said there was a man gone out with a quantity, as hard as he could run - He sent me after him. I went out, and took the direction that the prisoner had, which was up Lawrence-lane, and through Castle-court into Milk-street. I saw him going up by the side of Honey-lane-market, in Milk-street - he had the shawls under his arm; I brought him back; he used some very bad expressions. I told him he must take them back, and kept hold of him; he then dropped the shawls from under his arm, put up his fist, and gave me a smack on my head, a person took them into the warehouse, and I secured the prisoner.</p>

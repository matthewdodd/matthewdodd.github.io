                  </hi>. I am a collector, and live at 98, Brook-road, Dalston—on Saturday night, 20th January, about 11 o'clock I was going through Sydney-square, Stepney, four men knocked me down, dragged my trousers' pocket out, injured my arm, and cut my lip—I had from 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket—I called out, "Murder!" and "Police!"—I recognise Sutton as one of them.</p>

He was in liquor; I said, I do not mind; 'then he got into the company of another man, who was also intoxicated, and they tossed for a pint of gin, and the prosecutor won, but the other would not pay; prosecutor paid for it; the prosecutor asked me the way to Bethnal-green church; I went out to direct him; we had some more ale on the way, and I left the prosecutor going towards Sydney-square; I saw him get into conversation with two women, and after<lb></lb>wards fall against some railings; the constable, knowing me, came up and said, 'Where are you going, Peter?'

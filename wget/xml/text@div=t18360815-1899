                  </hi>. I am the son of Edward Yerlett, who keeps a chandler's shop in Britannia-street, St. Pancras. On the 19th of July, I met the prisoner in the New-road reading a book, and I saw, when the shut it up and put it under his arm, that is was my father's book—I spoke to him, and when I got home I asked my father where his receipt-book was—he could not find it, and I mentioned what I had seen—the prisoner was in the habit of frequenting our house—it was a family receipt-book—on the evening of the same day the prisoner came to the shop while I was in the parlour, and waited about twenty minutes, and just as he went out we missed a "Sacred Biography" from a shelf which he could reach—I followed him and found it under his coat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Mr. Batty. The prisoner was called into the counting-house on the evening of the 26th of October, and told we suspected him, and asked if he would go to his lodgings in Angel-alley, Cripplegate, which we did—the prisoner went into the room first, and taking up this bladder, he said, "Here is a bladder of mixed pickles, and here is a jar," and gave them to the constable—he unlocked a box—I saw a brush which I thought was ours—I took it into my hand and saw it was, and those other things—we lost two wine-glasses about two months ago exactly resembling this one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you have the kindness to account to the Jury why you told them that he mentioned Moses's name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might have said so in the hurry of the moment, without understanding the question—Moses is at present at work with us, and could be here—I cannot say exactly how long it is since I have seen this brush, but I have since the prisoner has been with us—it may be about four or six months.</p>

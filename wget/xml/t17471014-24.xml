The Prisoner lodg'd at my House, and there was a Pack of Goods which came from Manchester, left to my Care. It was about the beginning of June, I can't be certain as to the Day of the Month, the Pack was cut, and a large Quantity taken out. I found it out the 25th of July. I don't know when it was cut.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know there were these Things in the Pack? Did you see these Things in the Pack ?</p>
               <p>Booth. I know it by what was found, and what this Woman confess'd.</p>
               <p>Q. What Things have been found upon the Prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Booth. There were ten Pieces of Fustian found in her Apartment. They are worth 15 s. a Piece. At the Top of the House she had concealed these Things. There were three Dozen and a Half of Thread, two Pounds she had sold to a Woman; and there were several other Things miss'd that were not found. Mrs Ockstone bought the two Pound of Thread, was to give her half a Crown a Pound for it, but said, she little thought of it's being stole.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who these Goods belong to?</p>
               <p>Booth. I believe they belong to one

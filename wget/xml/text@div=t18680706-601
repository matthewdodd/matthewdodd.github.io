                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 10, Stanley Place, Fulham—on 22nd May, about 1 o'clock a.m., I was in King's Road, Chelsea—I had a silver watch in my waistcoat pocket attached to a chain—I had been drinking—three men attacked me, and one of them took my watch—we had a struggle and the prisoner and I fell together—the other two ran away—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of the Fulham Infirmary—on Tuesday, 15th August, I was called up to see a woman named Alice "Woodrow—I found her in labour—she was carried into the ward and confined within an hour and a half or two hours—she was delivered of a healthy child—it is alive now—she got well through her confinement, although it was a cross birth—I saw her again the same night, and found her very well—about the second day she began to droop, and complained of an increase of pain which she had described at first over the ovary—she was properly treated with appropriate remedies—she got worse and worse, and died on the evening of 23rd—I made a post-mortem examina<lb></lb>tion—the body was that of a healthy, well-nourished person; all the internal organs were healthy, but suppuration had taken place over both ovaries—one had already buret, and had set up recent peritonitis—the second one bunt under my hand—I could not attribute it to natural causes—I never saw natural causes give rise to such a state—I think violence of some kind must have been done to her, a direct blow or coming in contact with a sharp angle—I don't think a fall was likely to have produced it—it might—the rupture of the ovary was the immediate cause of death and external violence would have caused that—if she had thrown herself about in any violent way that might lead to injury of the ovaries—it might be caused in a struggle and fight, but I should have expected to find more general results, and not so localised as I did—a fall four days previous to death might have caused what I have described in a woman far advanced in pregnancy, or a straining and tumbling about might have done it—it is a case in which, I cannot give any positive evidence.</p>

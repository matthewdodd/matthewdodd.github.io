                  </hi>. I am a gas fitter, of 7, Bury-street, Bloomsbury—on 26th May, about 2 in the morning, I was going towards Russel-street, on my way home, and as I passed the north end of George-road I saw four men by the model lodging-house—the prisoner is one of them—he came forward and struck me a blow on the left side of the face, which caused me to stagger, and my hat fell off—before I had fully recovered myself, the other three men tripped me, and I fell down on my back—the prisoner then knelt on me—I struggled as hard as I could, and the prisoner tried to get at my left trouser's pocket—I clenched my arms together as hard as I could to prevent him, and called out "Police"—the prisoner called to the others, "<hi rend="italic">Gag</hi> the b—r"—one of the others immediately squeezed his hand over my mouth and nose and almost suffocated me; but I still held my hand to my waist to protect my pocket—they tore my trousers com<lb></lb>pletely up—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and took my purse by pulling the pocket asunder underneath—the other three then ran away—the prisoner, who was still lying on my chest, was the last to go, and as he got up to run away, I sprung up to intercept him—some females came to prevent me from closing with him, and he dodged about between them, but I did not let him have a chance of getting away—a policeman came up, and I gave him in charge—I felt my money safe about twenty minutes before I was attacked—there was a florin, a half-crown, a sixpence, and some halfpence—it was loose in my pocket, and I have never seen it since.</p>

               <p>and knew I was going into St. Giles's perfectly well; the British Museum is in that parish—the female very kindly came back, and after I was attacked, she went and fetched the police, or else I should have been more bruised and ill-treated than I was—I did not know her—the only corner I went to with her was across the corner of the streets—she and I were not struggling together—my hat was knocked off, and she brought it to me—I do not know what has become of her—it is not true that I was struggling with her, and that she was on top of me—I was perfectly sober—we were sauntering along, talking of love, and doing a little courting perhaps.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, E</hi> 86). On 26th May, about 2 in the morning, I was on duty in New Oxford-street, received information, went into George-street, and found the prosecutor, who said, "I have been robbed by this man, "pointing to the prisoner—they were both standing in the street together, but Dwelly had not hold of him—it was at the corner of George-street and New-street—there is no outlet at the other end of New-street—I took the prisoner—Dwelly was sober.</p>

My husband is a costermonger of St. Giles's—on the night the prisoner was taken I went out to look for my husband at about half-past 1 o'clock, and as I was going up Russell-street, Bloomsbury, I saw the prosecutor and a woman coming down; they turned the corner of New-street, and wanted to get into the corner house, but it was closed—I then saw them struggling between the fruit barrows, and the woman was on top of the man—I did not see them fall—she remained on top of him for about five minutes—I went home, went up stairs, and I did not wait to see what they were going to do—as I went up I met the prisoner coming down—he said, "Good night, Ellen"—I said, "Good night, <hi rend="italic">Jack"</hi>—I then went up stairs—I had not gone many stairs up when I heard the prosecutor hollow out "Police;" that was about five minutes after I had spoken to the prisoner—I turned back, came down stairs, and saw the prisoner stand<lb></lb>ing at the White House, and the prosecutor at the opposite corner—a policeman came up, and the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge for stealing his hat—about ten minutes afterwards the woman came saying, "<hi rend="italic">Harry,</hi> here is your hat"—I am the woman who told the constable that I did not think the prisoner was the man—when he got the hat he charged the prisoner with tearing his pocket out, and this policeman took him to the station—I went there, and I gave my evidence one day before the Magistrate—the prisoner lives in our house.</p>

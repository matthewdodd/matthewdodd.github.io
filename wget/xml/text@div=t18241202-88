On the 2d of November, I met the prisoner in Fleet-market, about one o'clock in the morning - I believe it was on a Tuesday. I had not drank more than two or three pints of beer - I was going home from Clerkenwell, where I had been to see some friends, at a public-house. I had left work at five o'clock, and walked about till eleven. I had had two or three pints of beer at different places with some other persons. I was quite sober when I fell in with this girl - she asked me to go with her, and I went to <placeName id="t18241202-88-crimeloc479">George-alley, Fleet-market</placeName>

            . I am a watchman. I heard Watch! called - I went over and took the prisoner; as I was taking her to the watch-house, she tried to put something into my right hand. I would not take it, and she called me an old fool. When she got to the watch-house, her hand was opened, and the 10 s. were found in it.</p>
               <p>EDWARD COUSINS. I searched the prisoner at the watch-house, and found the 10 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had just been with a friend of mine, who gave me 9 s. I met this man, and he asked me to go with him, and we went to Mrs. Smith's, in George-alley. I had the silver in my hand, as I do not wear pockets. I laid it on the table while I poured out the gin. I took the 1 s. 6 d. which he gave me, and put it with the 9 s. on the table; he said, if I did not stop with him, he would swear a robbery against me, as he saw what money I had; he then took me down stairs, and gave me in charge - he has since sent me word, that if I would send him the 10 s. he would not file a bill against me.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR. I never said so.</p>

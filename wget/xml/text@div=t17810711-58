I met the prisoner in Long-lane, Smithfield. She asked me to go with her to her lodgings. Unfortunately I went along with her. We had not long been there, before another woman came up; and we sent for a pot of beer. We drank some beer. I rose up, and was going home. They were desirous of my stopping there all night. Accordingly I did. I went to bed; and the gentlewoman that came to the room came to bed to me: the prisoner continued to walk about the room. She came and took my breeches from under my head.</p>

               <p>How do you know she took the breeches? Did you see her take them? - No. There was nobody else in the room. She took what was in the breeches, and flung the breeches into the room again.</p>

               <p>Did you see her fling them into the room again? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you feel her take them? - No. I had not been in bed ten minutes, before she went out: the other got out of bed, and followed her. Then I suspected something. I looked for my breeches, and they were gone. I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them): my buckles were taken out of my shoes, which were at the foot of the bed.</p>

               <p>Did you look at the woman when she got out of the bed, and followed the prisoner? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had she any thing in her hand? - No.</p>

               <p>Was there any light in the room? - Yes, a candle. She got out of bed, and followed the other down as fast as she could.</p>

               <p>Did you ever get your watch again? - No.</p>

               <p>Or any of your things? - No. I am sure she took them, because I kept looking at the other all the while I was in bed.</p>

               <p>(Isaacs, a constable, was called; but not appearing, the court ordered his recognizance to be estreated.)</p>

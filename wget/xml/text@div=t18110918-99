No, I heard my wife say, master you shall not have that loaf, and seeing her run out of the door's I followed her, and laid hold of the prisoner and threw him down on the pavement; the prisoner struggled and turned upon his back; the loaf fell from him. I took the prisoner by the collar, he then struck me with some sharp instrument as he laid upon his back; he cut me through my left eyelid, and across my nose; it did not touch the ball of my eye at all. I still continued my hold, untill a person came up and took him. This was on the 17th of September, near nine at night.</p>

I delivered the razor to Mr. Shuttleworth, the landlord of the watering house.</p>

I took the prisoner in custody, and when I got to the Compter the razor was delivered to me by Mr. Alder; there was blood on it then, and there is now. I know the prisoner, he was in the habit of coming to the Mansion-house, he appeared to be a man not in his right mind he came with papers to the Mansion-house to have them copied. I took them to an interpreter in Birchin-lane; they were all nonsense; that was six months before this transaction took place, he appeared decent then; I have seen him several times at the Mansion-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Bray has mentioned that this man came frequently to the Mansion-house - A. I have seen him frequently there. The man came creditably dressed, with a parcel of papers, they were in the shape of bills of exchange, being a foreigner I thought he was imposed upon; they had Sir Francis Burdett and liberty upon them. I have got them interpreted, and they were perfectly nonsense. I thought him an inoffensive man; he came several times after that, and then became more and more poor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a news-seller of Shoe Lane. The prisoner was in my service—he had access to the part where the "Illustrated London Newspapers" were kept—in consequence of something that occurred, I searched my stock on 12th May, and missed a quantity of the "Illustrated London News," of Nov. 28th, 1857 and Jan. 30th, 1858—next evening, I told the prisoner that, in consequence of information I had received, I had reason to suspect that he was robbing me, and that he was seen to take a parcel of newspapers from a house close by; he said that they were his own—I asked him how he came by them; he said, "I bought them up the lane"—I asked him what they were; he said, "Some were 'Illustrated News,' others were various newspapers, and some were 'Bell's'"—I told him that, unless I was satisfied that they were his own papers, I should prosecute him—he made no answer, and I sent for an officer—he then said, "I did take them from here"—I asked him what they were; he said, "Illustrated London News"—I asked him how many there were, and he said, "About two dozen"—I have seen two in Greenfield's custody of the dates which I missed, Dec. and Jan.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The newspaper that the prosecutor has in custody has my name on it, and the date when I purchased it; it does not belong to him at all; they are respecting Indian affairs; I have been out there three years, and that made me buy it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Here is on this one, T.

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Abington's service. On Tuesday, 11th May, in the evening, after the shop was shut up, I noticed a parcel of papers in a confectioner's shop—the prisoner was there—he put them on his shoulder, and took them out—there were about three dozen of them; they looked rather old; the edges were dirty; they looked like those we had in stock—I had seen the prisoner previously, coming out from his work—he had no papers with him then—I said nothing to him, but he told me that he was going to take them to his brother, in Shoreditch, who had bought a lot of old "Illus<lb></lb>trated News"—he saw me when I came out of the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Abington's service. I was present on Thursday evening, when he accused the prisoner of taking some "Illustrated News" from his shop; he denied it—Mr. Abington asked him where he bought them; he said, "Up the lane"—he asked him where, but the pri<lb></lb>soner made no answer—Mr. Abington told him that, if he did not satisfy him where he got them, he should prosecute him, and would direct one of his young men to fetch a constable—he then said that he had taken about two</p>

               <p>dozen "Illustrated London News," but did not say where from—Mr. Abing<lb></lb>ton directed him to bring them back within twenty-four hours, and as he was going out of the door he said that he could not bring them back, because he had sold them for waste paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The reason I said that I had taken them was because Mr. Abington said that if I would satisfy his mind he would keep me in my situa<lb></lb>tion. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He did not.</p>

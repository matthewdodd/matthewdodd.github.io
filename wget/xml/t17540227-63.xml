            . I am clerk to Mr. Hoare and co. The prisoner at the bar brought this note [producing one] on the 15th of December in the morning. It is in the form of a common draught on a banker; I seeing there were great variations in it from the usual writing of Mr. Brigstock, whose name it bore, suspected it to be forged, upon which I stopt the prisoner, and we asked him who he was: he said his name was Pickering, that he lived with Mr. Vincent, a gentleman in the Temple, and that he found the note that morning under some shopkeeper's window in Portugal-street; it was a very dirty wet morning, but there was no dirt upon the note. We took him before my Lord Mayor, and he there said he had found it; but the next day, or the day after, he said that he had it of one Goodchild, an acquaintance of his.</p>

            's shop about business at this time. I was shewn the note, but tho' it was very dirty weather I saw no dirt upon the note. I told the prisoner that his saying he found it would gain no credit, and desired him to discover the original author, but he strongly persisted in asserting that he found it. I asked him if it was wrapped in any thing, and he said, no, it was only folded up. He was about sending for his master, but I said he had better write to him, which he did, and I observed he was no ways master of the pen to write so well as this is wrote.</p>

             in Bartlet's Buildings. He keeps cash with Mr. Hoare. He looks at the note. I firmly look upon this not to be his hand-writing; it is not like his writing at all; he usually puts a date to his, but here is none; besides it is in a different form from his. I know nothing of the prisoner, nor have ever seen him at our house.</p>

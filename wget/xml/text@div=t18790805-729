                  </hi>. I am a sailor, at the Sailors' Home, Whitechapel—about 10 p.m. on Saturday, 2nd August, I was accosted by two women in Ellesmere Lane—they followed me to Back Church Lane, when the prisoner joined them and the two women caught hold of me and the prisoner knocked me down and rifled my pockets—I had 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and some silver—they all assisted and turned my trousers pocket inside out and tore it down, and the prisoner kicked me in the eye and said Take that for your change"—I could not see for the first three days after, and both eyes were blackened—I gave information, and the prisoner was brought to me and I indentified him.</p>

At 10 p.m. on 2nd August I saw the prosecutor in Back Church Lane bleeding very much from the face, and in consequence of what he said I went down the street and saw the prisoner and another man walking away as fast as they could—I caught the prisoner and took him back to the prosecutor, who identified him immediately—he was formally charged with an assault on the prosecutor with intent to rob—he said in reply "I kicked him, but I did not intend to rob him."</p>

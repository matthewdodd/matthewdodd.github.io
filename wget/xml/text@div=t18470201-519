                  </hi>. I am a police-constable, in the service of the London and North Western Railway Company. On the 9th of Jan. I was on duty at the Camden station—I recollect looking at a wagon that had come up, and was on the railway—it contained eight casks of tallow—between nine and ten o'clock I assisted in shifting them from one place to another, and I observed the head of one of the casks was out—the tallow was in it, but on the casks being shifted two large lumps, with some small ones, fell out of the cask, through their being bumped backwards and forwards—they fell into the bottom of the wagon—at a quarter to twelve I saw the prisoner coming from towards that wagon—he had something in his hand which appeared white—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184702010044"></xptr>
               <p>could not distinctly see what it was—as soon as he observed me he stopped—I was crossing the line, about five yards distance off him—he stopped, and turned his face towards the wagon, and held what he had, and what proved to be the tallow, between the wagon and himself—I made a pause, and as soon as he crossed the rail he started back—he turned round, retraced his steps, passed between the third and fourth wagon, and placed what turned out to be the tallow, on the foot-plate of the engine No. 90 and tender—he passed down on the same line that the engine was on—I stepped to the left of the line, and asked the engine-driver who put the tallow there—I then called the prisoner back—he came back, and I asked him what made him take the tallow from the wagon—he said, "Oh, do look over me, and allow the tallow to be put back again"—I told him it was not consistent with my duty to allow him to do anything of the kind—I took him into custody—this is the tallow—I have looked at it, and compared it with the tallow in the wagon—they are of the same kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do they use tallow for oiling the wheels of the carriages and engines? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, quite a different thing—I have some of it here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to ask the engine-driver who put the tallow there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My reason was, for more sub<lb></lb>stantial evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not think that your evidence was substantial enough? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, sir.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then how came you to ask the engine-driver? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he saw it put there—I asked him for information—I knew myself—I asked him be<lb></lb>cause I should have another witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not imagine anybody would disbelieve you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had not helped to take this bag of tallow—I had seen it before—me and the en<lb></lb>gine-driver moved the casks—the prisoner was not assisting—he might be present on the stage—he did not come close to me, and talk to me—I did not see him when the wagons were shifting—it was not me let the grease fall out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who did? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was shifting the casks from one line to another—they were bumped out by the engine—I did not move the grease—the engine moved it—while the engine moved it, it came out—the driver has charge of the engine—I have been a police-constable on this railway four years and five months—before that I was a soldier—I was ten years in the East India Company's service—the prisoner has been there seventeen or eighteen months—we have had a word or two, but it was before this—it was some time ago—we were on amicable terms—my feelings were quite good to him—I had no anger towards him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember one day the train being late, and some of the trucks were knocked off the line? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was my duty to give the signals that day—the prisoner said it was my fault that it happened—I told him he was a false man—I did not say if he was off the station I would make him smell hell—I do not recollect the terms I used—I said, 'You are a false man"—these were the words I used, as far as I recollect—a person named Heale was present I think immediately after—there might have been a few other words—I do not recollect what—I have not the best of me<lb></lb>mories.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell him you would mark him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did—I did not say, "I will mark you, you b—r"—it might be "beggar"—I said I would mark him—that was not because he said it was my own stupidity and folly—I said I would mark him because he interfered with my duty.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184702010045"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And I believe you did contrive to mark him, did not you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I remember Christmas-day—I was on duty—I did not bring up some new wagons—the prisoner came in charge of them—he brought them up to Camden-town—I did not order him to take them back to Kilburn—he did not refuse to take them back, saying he had been two days and one night at work—he never mentioned anything of the sort—I said he was drunk, but not that I would report him for being drunk—Mr. Richards, the clerk, is here—the prisoner did not insist on going to the office—I took him myself up to the office—I did not take hold of him—he walked alongside of me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not that in consequence of his saying, "I will go to the office, and have it ascertained whether I am drunk or not?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was not so<lb></lb>ber—Mr. Richards considered him so—he was mistaken—a great many cows sometimes come up by our railway—I have a can—I do not occa<lb></lb>sionally relieve the cows of any superfluous milk that they may have—I do not swear I have never milked the cows on the railway—I might—I have, but if I did such a thing I have had permission to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But how came you to swear to me that you never had? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think that is of immaterial consequence—if a man came up with a quantity of cows, and said, "You can have a can of milk," I might have had it—I have not reported it to the railway company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you used it yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have—I believe my inspector who I once had knew of it—that was Mr. Challos—I never said a word about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARNELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been in the service of the railway com<lb></lb>pany some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, four years and five months, and the prisoner has been in their service seventeen or eighteen months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During that time had you no quarrel with him previous to the occasion of your calling him a false man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. previous to that we had been on good terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During you on that occasion show your signal to your fellow policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I appealed to the guard, in presence of the prisoner, and the guard said I showed it at 100 yard distance, and the prisoner said I had only shown it at six yards distance—there were high words on that occasion on both sides, and I told him I would mark him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that the mere effect of momentary anger, or a purpose of settled malice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not malice; nothing more than heat and anger,—on Christmas-day it was not the prisoner's business to bring up the train—he had nothing to do with it, unless he acted as porter—he assisted in getting these wagons on, that were thrown off—that bad not caused any delay, or hindered another train—we moved the wagons off—I saw the prisoner on Christmas-day, at the end of one of the goods-trains, drinking out of a tin can, and a labouring man with him, who appeared to be sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner sober? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Trough the indecent answer he made me, he was under the influence of liquor, not to say drunk—a proposition was made that he should take the train back to Kilburn—it was his duty—he did not take it, because I took him up to Mr. Richards, and he directed me to report him for being absent from duty, and Mr. Richards sent another man—Mr. Richards said he thought the prisoner was not fit to take the train back, and directed me to report him, but I did not, I let him off.</p>

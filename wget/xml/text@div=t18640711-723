On 5th June, between I and 2 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty at Black heath, and found the prisoner lying in the middle of the road apparently asleep; seeing his danger, I aroused him, and told him he would be run over—I saw that he was the worse for liquor, and allowed him to rest against my knees until he was properly awakened—he said that he was going to Woolwich; and I said that I would show him the way—he then jumped up, knocked me down, and kicked me on the privates while I laid down—I got up, and he knocked me down again and kicked me on the hand, which disabled me,</p>

               <p>and I could not use my staff—he then kicked me on the small of my back—I struggled with him till another constable came—he was very violent going to the station, and tore my hair—I have suffered very great pain ever since, and it still continues—I am still very much swollen, and have great pain in my back—I am not fit for duty.</p>

I was on duty on Blackheath, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning of 5th June, and found Goodchild holding the prisoner down—he was assisted by two other persons—I told him to let the prisoner stand up, and he did so—at the bottom of Nagshill he caught Goodchild by the hair, and I strove to extricate him—he threw me on my back—he was very violent; but, when the charge was made at the police-office, he was very collected, and said that he was very sorry, and offered us half-a-crown each to let him go—he was excited by drink.</p>

I am surgeon to the police at Greenwich—I examined Goodchild at 2 o'clock in the morning, and found that he had been kicked and was very much swollen and in great pain—he has an internal abscess somewhere in the belly, and there is no telling how it may end—he is still unfit for duty and unfit to walk.</p>

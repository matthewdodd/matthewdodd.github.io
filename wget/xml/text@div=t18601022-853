                  </hi>. On Friday, 21st September, I went, with other officer, to Clerkenwell-green, about 7 o'clock in the evening—I saw John Cronin, he was coming in a direction from his own house, and about fifty yards from it an officer seized him, and he and I pushed him into the Crown public-house—he had his right hand in his pocket—I said, "Mr. Cronin, I need not tell you who I am, my name is Brannan; I have received instructions from the Mint to pay attention to you, for dealing largely in counterfeit coin"—he said, "I don't know what you mean"—I said, "What have you got in your hand?" he said, "Nothing"—we pulled his hand from his pocket, and in doing so, a paper parcel fell from his hand on the floor—I picked it up; I it contained a florin, a half-crown, and five chilling, all counterfeit, and wrapped in separate papers—I said to him, "Where do you live now, <hi rend="italic">Jack?</hi>" he said, "You know, Mr. Brannan, where you have been before"—I said, "Bit-alley" he said, "Yes"—I left him in charge of the officers and went to the house in Bit-alley—the street door was open and I proceeded to the first landing—the prisoners' room is on the left-hand side, at the top of the landing (I had been in that room before)—the room door was fast—I broke it open with a sledge-hammer, and found Margaret Cronin in the room, standing behind the door endeavouring to keep it shut—on entering I heard something rattle in an earthen pan of water that stood behind the door—I called Inspector Bryan's attention to it, and he looked and said, "Oh, Mr. Brannan, here is a lot of shillings"—I pushed Margaret Cronin away and her pockets were turned out—she became very violent—she was secured and I proceeded to the window, and found a galvanic battery in full play, containing seventeen shillings undergoing the process of electroplating; two shillings and thirteen sixpences which had not undergone any process, and a tile with white metal in the teeth of it, which had apparently been recently used—the galvanic battery was charged, and the contents of it I have here—Margaret Cronin was taken, but I was obliged to send to the station for more assistance or I do not know what might have been the consequence—I then returned to the public-house where I had left John Cronin—I told him I had been to his lodgings and found the woman and a large quantity of coin—he said, "Yes, Sir, it is a bad job."</p>

             humbly implores your Lordship to take into your humane consideration the hardships he has undergone. He had no intention of deserting when he left the ship, he fell overboard by accident; had it been designedly, there were six sentries on deck, who would have fired at him. He was six hours and a half in the water, and was so exhausted, that it was several days before he was sufficiently recovered to endeavour to regain the vessel. He then went over in a boat to Rio Janeiro, but found the ship had sailed, and he then got over to Buenos Ayres, where he worked for a printer during a period of three years. He has no doubt but that the returns of the ship at the Secretary of State's office suppose him to be drowned, and the captain of the Fanny he believes is not in England. He hopes these circumstances will have some weight towards mitigating his sentence.]</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the assistants of the master of the Union Workhouse at West Ham. On Tuesday, the 27th of March, there were some repairs going on at the workhouse—the two prisoners were paupers, and were working on the premises at that time—I saw them coming down from their work at twelve o'clock that day—after one o'clock, I heard some lead had been stolen—I afterwards gave them into custody—Hoadley ran away—I ran after him, and took him about a dozen stones' throw—I charged him with stealing the lead—he said it was in an evil hour that he did it—I saw Nelms in the afternoon—I do not know whether any thing was said to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am constable of West Ham. In consequence of what I learnt, about four o'clock this day, Mr. Mundy brought the two prisoners to me, and told me they had been to Mr. Williams's, and offered some lead for sale—they both said they had found the lead—I took them to the workhouse—I examined the top of the roof, and found some lead missing—Mr. Williams gave me this piece of lead, which I compared with the vacant space on the roof, and I have no doubt it came from there.</p>

I was sent for home, on the 27th of March, about half-past three o'clock—when I got home, I found Hoadley in my house, and Nelms at the door—Hoadley brought some lead, and put it on my shop-floor—he wanted me to buy it—I would not—I sent for May and Mr. Munday—I delivered the same lead to Smart—there were 541bs.—I weight it in presence of Mr. Mundy.</p>

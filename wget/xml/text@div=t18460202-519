                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Frederick Locke. We live in Church-street, Soho—on the 18th of Oct. I missed a carpet from my second floor—this is it—it is my husband's—I saw it safe about one o'clock in the day—it was rolled up and put outside the room on the landing, and tied up—I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she had purchased the carpet on the 15th of Oct. of a person who had formerly been charwoman where she had been in service, and gave it to a man named Dennis to beat.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labouring man and a porter—I live in Tower-street, Seven Dials—the prisoner hired me to beat a carpet for her on Thursday, the 16th Oct., about five o'clock—I am certain of it—I know it was on the 16th of Oct., by my recollection—I fetched it from her lodging on the 16th, and took it and beat it on the 17th—I know it was on the 16th I had it by my memory—there was nothing else that I did the same day that I know of—I often beat carpets when anybody gives me a job—I know the prisoner by sight, nothing further—I should know the carpet—it was a kind of blue ground—it was very much worn on one side—I beat it almost to rags on one side—I can swear that this is the carpet I beat for her.</p>

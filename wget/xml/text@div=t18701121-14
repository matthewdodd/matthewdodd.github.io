                  </hi>. I am a gas-fitter, of 16, Pitt Street, Bethnal Green Road—on 25th October, at 12 o'clock at night, I was in Shoreditch, I had just parted from my friend Curtis—I went across the road, and three or four men bounced upon me, one tripped me up—I did not see who it was; Dillon pretended to lift me up, and he put his hand in my pocket—I retained his hand a minute, and he let me go, and let me fall again—I had 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket, as near as I can tell—they ran away, and were afterwards brought back by the constable.</p>

At 12.45 on this morning, I was in High Street, Shoreditch—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the two prisoners running, Slater was the first; I ran and caught him, and Curtis came up and said "That's the man that has robbed my friend"—I took him back, and he was identified by the prosecutor as the man that tripped him up—nothing was found on him.</p>

I am a bookseller, of 6, Aldergate Street—I was with the prosecutor on this night—I bade him "Good night," in High Street, Shoreditch, and he crossed over—I turned round, and when he got to the corner, three men attacked him; Slater tripped him up, and they all fell—I ran across to him, but they had got his money, and all run away—I ran after them, halloaing "Stop thief!" and never lost sight of the prisoners till they were taken.</p>

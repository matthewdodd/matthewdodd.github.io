               <p>Q. On the 22d of November last, had you any velveteen in your house. - A. Yes, black velveteen, what we use for shoes, there were forty three yards in the whole; in the morning it was in one piece, I had divided it, there was twenty four yards in one piece and nineteen yards in the other, it was in the shop; I had seen it at one o'clock. About twenty minutes, or half past one o'clock, two men came to me and asked me if I had lost anything; their names were Broad and Poole; I looked in the shop and found the twenty four yards of velveteen was gone; the other piece remained.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the shop laying near together. - A. They were upon two boards, they lay three or four foot from each other.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the piece that was taken. A. Four pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time in November last see the prisoners at the bar near his shop. - A. It was in December.</p>
               <p>Q. to Brooke. What month was it, December or November. - A. It was December.</p>
               <p>Broad. It was the 22nd of December, between the hours of one and two; I was going to my dinner, I saw both the prisoners lurking from one shop to the other, they were going into the different shops and asking the price of things and not purchasing.</p>
               <p>Q. That you could hardly tell, you were in the street. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you only saw the prisoners go in and out of the shops. - A. Yes, exactly so; they went into one shop within a door of my master's shop; they tried on gloves, they stopped there what time I cannot say; I saw them come out and go to the prosecutor's house, and they looked through the shop window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go to any other shop. - A. They went to several shops, I saw them go in, but I saw them in the glover's; I saw the prisoner Humphry look through the window, and Brown went in; I saw nothing in his possession when he went in, but when he came out I saw a bundle of black velveteen under his arm, without any covering or paper at all; he touched me in passing. Humphry remained at the window till Brown had passed the corner of Compton-street, opposite to where the prosecutor's house is; then Humphry followed Brown, after he had passed Compton-street, and looked upon all sides of the way, as if he did not know which way to go; I saw no more of him for some hours, he went down to St. Giles'.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he go the same way as Brown. - A. I cannot say, he went in the same direction as Brown did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he followed Brown down the street he had gone. - A. Yes, in a direction down St. Giles's. I went to Mr. Brookes and told him what I had seen.

             was with me all the time; we went in search of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you saw the prisoners afterwards. A. At the bottom of Dyot-street; that might be six hours afterwards, it was quite dark, they were both together; I had been in pursuit of them the whole afternoon, I could not find them till this time. When I came to the bottom of Dyot-street the prisoner Humphry ran against me with a bundle in his hand, he met me full but, he was coming from St. Giles's into Dyot-street; I perceived a bundle in his hand in a blue handkerchief with white spots. I followed him to the Turk's Head, Dyot-street, they went in and stopped at the Turk's Head about a minute and a half; I did not go in. After they came out of there I watched them through the different streets, I cannot say the names of the streets. Humphry had the bundle in his hand; I watched them to the sign of the Horshoe in Bainbridge-street, it lies out to the bottom of Tottenham Court road as you go from Dyot-street. I immediately went and told a constable what the proceedings were. Poole was with me, Fusman the constable, and Poole and I went to the sign of the Horshoe in Bainbridge-street, we took two watchmen with us; we went in, I looked round the room, the room was full of people, they were dancing and fidling, that I could hardly perceive the prisoners. I came out again, I told Mr. Fusman I could not see him, the room was so full;

               <p>Q. Did you see any bundle there. - A. We told the watchman there was a bundle near to where they were sitting. I saw the prisoner take the bundle in the room. I had not seen the bundle after he got in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watchman afterwards with the bundle. - A. Yes, at the watchhouse: it was the same handkerchief, and it had the same appearance, it was a bundle in a blue and white handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. The bundle that you at first saw was velveteen. - A. Yes, black velveteen.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners or both of them. - A. Both of them. In Compton-street was the first place that I saw them at; they went into a hosier's shop and tried on some worsted gloves; they came out of that shop, and they looked into other shops as they passed up the street. When they came to Mr. Brookes's, Brown opened the door and went in, without any thing under his arm.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did Brown remain in the shop. - A. About three minutes, or hardly so much; then he returned out with a bundle of black velveteen under his arm, without paper or any cover over it. I was on the opposite side of the way. On his coming out of the shop with it he went along the street with it as if he was going with a message.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did he pass by you. - A. About five or six yards, as near as I can judge; he went down the street on the other side of the way; I cannot recollect the name of it, although I know it so well.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Humphry. - A. He ran after him as hard as he could.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Humphry remain at the shop window before he followed. - A. About a minute and a half, and he was quite confused to know which way Brown went.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards went in search with Broad of the two prisoners. - A.

               <p>Q. Then you got assistance of the constable and watchman. - A. Yes; I went into the public house before the constable and watchman; I saw the prisoners, there were about fifty or sixty people drinking and dancing, men and women. Brown was sitting down and Humphry was standing up about a yard and a halt near to him; I pointed out the two prisoners to the constable, Broad took the prisoner Brown. I and Fusman took Humphry.

               <p>Q. Did you after they were taken out of the house find any bundle. - A. The constable desired me to look after the bundle. I went and took the bundle away and brought it to the watchhouse; that bundle was upon a form; it was wrapped in a blue handkerchief with white spots.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was this form where the handkerchief was, to where Humphry's was sitting. - A. He was sitting close to it when I came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Then supposing you to have said when you came in Humphry was sitting down by the bundle or close by it. - A. Close by it; I took it to the watchhouse and delivered it to Mr. Fusman, as soon as I came to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was Humphry when you went in. - A. I believe about two yards from where the bundle was found, he was standing in the room when I first saw him; there were about fifty or sixty people in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. After you got in the room did he set down. - A. No. I did not see him sitting at all. This is the bundle that was brought to me by Foley. (produced it.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Foley. You said Humphry was sitting when you first went in, which do you call Humphry. - A. The tall one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sitting or standing. - A. I cannot tell; I was the last that went in, he was the nearest person to the form where the bundle was, he was sitting, as nigh as I remember.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. But whether he was sitting or standing you do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Open the bundle and see whether there is any thing that you can speak to as being your own, or whether you have any reason for believing it to be your own - what is there in that bundle. - A. A remnant of velveteen, I believe it is two yards. There is no mark upon it by which I can certainly say it is my own; I produce part of it that was not stolen. On comparing them together they appear to me one piece, the breadth is exactly the same, and the substance and shade is the same; the dye is the same, and the quality appears to me to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment do you think they are parts of the same piece or not. - A. I do think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value of the two yards. - A. A yard is three shillings and fourpence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Are there any marks upon the piece that you have now brought that you would know it to be your particular property.</p>
               <p>Court. He has brought it from his own house, he must know it to be his own property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Yes; but are there any marks upon it that you should know it if it was out of your possession. - A. Yes, there is a cut to it.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the two yards there is no mark to it for you to know it by, how long have you had it. - A. I had it in my possession the evening before at seven o'clock; I bought it the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Humphry's Defence. I went to Mr. Thomas, pastry cook, in Princes-street, about half after one; he asked me if I would go of a errand for him to the Seven Dials; I said I would. As I was going I met this lad in Compton-street, he went in and looked at a pair of gloves, he came out, and I left him at the corner of Frith-street; I never saw him no more till night.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. As I was standing at a shoe makers shop a man came up to me, he asked me if I would carry a parcel, he said he would give me a shilling; I said I would; I was to carry it to Covent Garden, and he would be after me at a public house; he came after me, I took it to the public house; he asked me if I knew the Horshoe in Bainbridge street, I told him no; he said if I would come there he would give me a shilling more, and when I went there at night an officer came and took me and this man.</p>
               <p>Humphry called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Brown called no witness to his character.</p>

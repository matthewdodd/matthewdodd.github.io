               <p>and am a brass founder. On the morning of 3rd April, about two o'clock, I was going home and met three men, who came up to me, hustled me, and in a moment threw me down—one of them struck me on the nose—while I was down they took 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a silk handkerchief out of my pocket, which was all I had—I called for the police—they <hi rend="italic">showed</hi> me on the kerb, and all three of them fell on me, and laid on me, and ran away—they all seemed to run one way, down the turning which I was going up, in a contrary direction to which I was going—I noticed one in particular; he was the prisoner—three po<lb></lb>licemen came up; one of them came the same way that the men had gone, and he must have passed them—the police took me to a house about two turning off, where I saw the prisoner—I recognized him immediately—he was stand<lb></lb>ing at the side of a bed, just taking off his coat—there was a man in the bed with his trowsers on—I could not speak to him, nut am positive as to the prisoner—I had never seen him before—there was no moonlight—there were lamps about.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policemen.</hi>) On Monday morning, 3rd April, I was on duty in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, and at about half-past two o'clock, in consequence of hearing cries of "Police!" I went in the direction of the cries, and met the prisoner—I asked him if he heard the cry of "Police!"—he said he had in Angel-alley—I then passed him, left him standing, and went towards the place—I met Haines and two other constables coming towards me—Haines' nose was bleeding—he said he had been hurt—I went with him to Lower Gedge-street, and there saw the prisoner, another man, and two females, standing on the opposite side of the street—when the prisoner saw us, he and the other man crossed the street, went into a house, and shut the door—I immediately ran to the door and heard them scrambling up stairs—I burst the door open and found the prisoner in a first floor room, just taking off his coat—I asked Haines if he was the man—he said he was not sure—there was no light in the room—I turned my light on his face, and Haines said immediately, "He is the man"—the prisoner said nothing—I gave him in charge to another constable—I told the prisoner he was charged with being concerned with two others in knocking Haines down and robbing him—he said he had not, as he had just turned out of bed, (pointing to another man who was in bed with his waistcoat, trowsers, and boots on)—I found on the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a handkerchief; not the prosecutor's.</p>

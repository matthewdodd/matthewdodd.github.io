               <p>Q. Had you in your mind any persons who were likely to have stolen them - A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. You never saw the persons before - A. No, Quintenden had a smock frock on, and Luck a drab coat; Quintenden had his frock on in prison, but I knew him without that, I had no conversation with them in the road; Groombridge fair was held the day before, it is above four or miles off; I am not quite certain what day the fair is held; it is common for horses to stand about the gate, but I could see where they went out at the end.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He had a dark coat on - A. Yes, he was coming out of the tap-room, I think he saw me; I think he had a smock frock on over his coat; I did not take the coat off till I got to the office.</p>

I went to the Basing-house, and stood at the gate, while Attfield and Gleed went down the yard, I went into the house, and just as I got inside the door, I met Quintenden with a smock frock on - I turned his frock aside, and saw what sort of coat he had on; I said,</p>
               <p>"You have brought two horses here this morning," he said,</p>
               <p>"No; I did not, the man in the parlour brought them." I jumped into the parlour, saw Luck, and said,</p>
               <p>"You have brought two horseshere this morning;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have" - Gleed came in, I told him to pursue the other, he was brought back in about four minutes. When we got to the yard of the lock-up house, I was going to put them in separate places, Luck said,</p>
               <p>"Let us both be together, and we will tell you where we brought the horses from, and who we brought them for;" they both said they brought them from a place between Maidstone and Chatham, but they did not know the name of the place, or the person they belonged to; this was a conversation between them, both spoke - I locked them up together, Quintenden's coat then had a great many grey hairs on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was it - A. A little before eleven o'clock in the morning. I told Quintenden my business the moment I saw him; both said they neither knew the parish or place they brought them from; Luck said Quintenden had been with him for a fortnight, they were very anxious to tell their story, and Quintenden said I am sorry for it. I took a pocket-book from his coat pocket, but Luck was wearing it at the time, and had it on when he was apprehended, but Quintenden now has it on at the bar.</p>

               <p>"We came together, and let us be together" - I do not know who spoke first, but one of them said, they took the horse on Friday night, about eleven o'clock, out of a field between Chatham and Maidstone, Luck said, that in the pocketbook, I should find the name of the person they were to take the horses to in London, there was</p>

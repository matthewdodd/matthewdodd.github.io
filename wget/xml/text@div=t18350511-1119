                  </hi>. I lodge at the Britannia public-house, at the top of Green Hill, at Woolwich. I knew the deceased Elizbeth Browning; she was the landlady of the Britannia—I know the priosner—on the 27th of April I saw him about ten o'clock in the morning, at the bar of the Bri<lb></lb>tannia—there is an outer bar where the liquor is served, and behind that an inner bar, which is a small parlour—the prisoner asked for a pint of beer—the deceased was serving at the outer bar—she did not serve him—she said she would not serve him—she did not say why—the prisoner asked her to speak to him—she said she would not he asked her repatedly—she said she would not, nor yet to any such a brute as he was, on account of what he had called her the night before—the prisoner then pushed her into the inner bar and followed her—there is a door to the inner room which he shut—he was sober when he came in—after he had shut the door I was turning from the bar to a side room, and heard Mrs. Browning say, "Don't begin to ill-use me"—I went away—Mrs. Browning's mother was in the inner room when the prisoner pushed her in—I was sitting in a chair by the fire, and heard a scream in about ten minutes—I got up from my chair, and ran into the inner bar, and saw Mrs. Browing's face covered with blood, and the prisoner was stabbing her in the side with a I saw the deceased's mother trying to prevent her daughter from receiving the wounds—she was standing between him and Mrs. Browning—in doing so she received the last blow with the bayonet through her thumb—I ran away directly to the baerracks, and found the deceased dead when I returned, which was in about ten minutes—Mr. Parkin, the surgeon, saw the body immediately after—after the prisoner had killed Mrs. Browning, I heard him say he had stabbed Mrs. Browning, and he meant to do it—he said so at the time I returned from the barracks.</p>

               <p>I was sitting in the side-room that night—I was backwards and forwards because he was abusing everybody about—there was no beer drank after eleven o'clock—if it had been drank I must have seen it—I do not mean to say I was there exactly every moment, for I was up and down stairs to Mrs. Browning, as she got out of his way—the bar was locked up then—I did not hear the prisoner say he would rather destroy himself than that she should report him at the barracks—nor that he should not be the first man who had destroyed himself for her sake.</p>

I am the mother of the deceased, Elisabeth Browning—she was a widow—I was at the house on Sunday, the 26th of April—I lived there—I know the prisoner—he used to come to the house occasion<lb></lb>ally, not a great deal—my daughter had somebody to tea with her on Sun<lb></lb>day, and I was one of the party—the prisoner was at the house—he was not asked to join the party—I do not know that that occasioned any quarrel between him and my daughter—I did not see him at the time—I might sit up that night till about twelve o'clock—the bar was locked up at about eleven o'clock—I do not know of any disturbance in the house after that—on Monday morning, about eleven o'clock, I was sitting in the inner bar—my daughter was with me—the prisoner came into the house—my daughter was in the inner bar—she did not go out—she had not an opportunity—I did not hear any one ask for any liquor—the room</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the wounds on both sides mortal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; one on the right side and two on the left—I have been connected with the army at Woolwich about fourteen years—it is the practice of non-comision<lb></lb>ed officers constantly to wear their side-arms—I have known the prisoner as a soldier six or seven years—I believe he has been in the 7th Fusileen once—he was always a well-conducted, sober, orderly man, while I knew him—I saw him before the Magistrate on the Monday, between one and two o'clock, I think—I did not see him before—he then appeared to be labour-</p>

               <p>ing under very strong excitement, his cheek was flushed and his eye Evidently shewed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you say whether or not he must have been in a state of perfect consciousness, two or three hours before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe verily, he was not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. Do you mean to say there was any thing singular in a man who has been stabbing a fellow creature with five or six different wounds, having a flushed face and strangeness in the eye? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By no means, but I think this man had been drinking hard—I am perfectly aware drunken-ness is no excuse for crime.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After he had slept, do you think he was unconscious? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not Know whether he had slept at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the appearances you saw, consistent with his having been greatly excited the night before, and that excitement had not passed away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was my opinion—I have been a surgeon above forty years, and have been all that time in His Majesty's service—he was in a state of great excitement; excitement is not insanity—there was every appearance of his being greatly excited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there periods of great excitement, which, at the moment, prevent a person knowing what he is about, but which does not amount to permanent insanity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I think his appearances were consistent with such a state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At what hour did you see the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think about one or two o'clock, three or four hours after the transaction—he was in custody on the charge, he did not appear in a state of unconsciousness—I think he could not fail to have been in a state of unconsciousness four hours previous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you on your oath say, in your judgment, from what you saw at two o'clock, you are of opinion that he was a man not accountable for his actions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never saw him in a state of derangement in my me, or in a state of lunacy.</p>

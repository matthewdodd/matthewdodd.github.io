                  </hi>. I live at No. 56, Paradise Street, Ratcliffe. On Saturday night, 10th April, before 9 o'clock, I was sitting in my kitchen, down stairs, I heard the door open—I went up into the hall, and missed two coats, which had been hanging up there—I immediately joined in the pursuit, and saw two men, each with a coat on his arm—I ran after them, and called for assistance—they ran into Seven Step Alley, which is no thoroughfare—I pursued one of them, with one of the coats on his back; he knocked me down, cut my head in a most dreadful manner, and broke the top of my shoulder bone—they got away from me; I got up as well as I could, and two officers assisted me home—the prisoner afterwards came to the door, and I identified him as the one who had knocked me down—he said that he knew where my coat was; I said, "You rascal, you are the one that had the coat on"—he said that he was not, but that he came to my assistance, and was knocked down—nobody came to help me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of my coats; the man who knocked me down had got it on.</p>

On Saturday night, 10th April, I was passing Mr. Ives' door, about 9 o'clock, going towards Deptford, and saw the prisoner come out, he is the man—one person was standing at the side of the door, and another at the end of the street—the prisoner had something on his arm—soonafterwards I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and a young woman came out and said that there were thieves—the men did not pass me, I went straight on and away from Seven Step Alley—I had not known the prisoner before—it was not exactly light, but quite light enough, there was a lamp—myattention was attracted because he nearly ran up against me.</p>

               <p>On Saturday, 10th April, I was standing at my door, which is not above four minutes' walk from the prosecutor's house, and saw three men with caps on, rush up the court—Mr. Ives followed them—two of them entered the enclosure, and Mr. Ives took hold of the third, and called out,"Stop thief! Murder! Police!"—they struggled together till they got the length of two houses, and then fell, and in getting up the man threw this coat off, and left it on the ground—they all three ran off—the prisoner came up about five minutes afterwards, took the coat off the ground, placed it on his arm, and said that he knew where it had been stolen from, and would return it to the owner—I said, "The police are the proper persons to take charge of it"—a policeman came, and he and the prisoner went away together—Idid not see the faces of the three people.</p>

I was called by Mr. Ives, who was bleeding from a wound on the side of the head, and complained of being hurt on the shoulders—I accompanied him to his house, and searched it, but could find no one—there was a knock at the door, and the prisoner came and said, "I know where your coat is"—I said, "Where?" he said, "At the station:" "Who took it there?" "I did; I have left my name and address there"—the prosecutor said that he was sure the prisoner was one of the three, and I asked him to accompany me to the station—the inspector asked him his name and address—he said, "John Williams, No. 42, John Street, Broad Street, Ratcliffe"—the inspector was going to send a man there, and the prisoner said, "If you send there, you will not find me there"—the sergeant was then recalled, and the prisoner was given in charge.</p>

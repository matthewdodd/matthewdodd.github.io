               <p>Q. Then the bill of exchange is not forthcoming? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen this bill of exchange, before you lost it? - A. I had it in the Court all day, till I went out to look for Mr. Rickerby, clerk to Cox and Greenwood; I found afterwards he was in Court; I went to get some refreshment, and I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was it? - A. I presume, it might be three o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your great coat on? - A. Yes, I had; I was sitting with two or three friends of mine over the way when I lost it; when I went home, my wife informed me that the pocket-book was left.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any enquiry made of the person that returned it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person who returned it? - A. A person that had been in the coffee-house with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go to him? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it? - A. It was an Irish gentleman, a friend of mine; I thought it was a fortunate event, I thought the young man might be reclaimed.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Baron. Q. You thought it right that a forger should escape in a country like this, and set with your hands before you without making any enquiry, or doing any thing to get the bill back; you have done a great injury to public justice? - A. If I have acted wrong in consulting my own feelings, I do not regret it.</p>

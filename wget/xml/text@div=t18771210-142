                  </hi>. I live at Hitchin with my sister—I have known the prisoner as a teacher of languages—he has been in the habit of giving me lessons for the last two years or thereabouts, with one or two interregnums—on Wednesday, 7th November, he came as usual about 11.30, to give me a lesson—two days prior to that he had proposed to marry me—he had told me he liked me three or four months before—I declined his proposal on the Monday—I did not see him between then and the Wednesday—almost directly after he came in on the Wednesday he asked me to marry him—I refused—he asked me again, and urged it rather—I still declined, and then he seized me and asked me to kiss him—he seized me with both hands, and then held me with his left arm whilst with his right he drew a knife out of his pocket by his side; it was open when he drew it out—he tried to stab me on the head—I tried to escape and fell down on the floor—he stabbed me several times on the head while I was on the floor—I then got the knife away from him, either by his help or by my own; I don't know whether I got it by myself, or whether he <hi rend="italic">let</hi> me take it—I used my hands to protect my head, and in doing so my hands were injured—after getting the knife away he attacked me with his fist; he twisted his fist round in my eyes as if he wished to put my eyes out—he then left off and stood at a little distance and shook a tuft of hair in front of me, which he had either pulled or cut off my head—he then walked out of the room—I got up before he left the room and stood, and then I laid down the knife on the hall table—I walked upstairs and the doctor came and attended to me.</p>

I am servant to Miss Wiles—I remember the prisoner coming to the house on Wednesday, 7th November—I opened the door to him, it was about 11.30—about 20 minutes afterwards I heard Miss Wiles scream; I was too frightened to go into the room—I did not see the prisoner leave the house—I went upstairs and Miss Wiles was coming out of the room, her clothes were covered with blood—she said "Oh, Selina, I am murdered"—her face and head were cut and bleeding—I saw the knife on the hall table; I afterwards gave it to the inspector—I went into the drawing-room after Miss Wiles had come out—there was a pool of blood on the carpet, and blood on the wall and on two chairs, and the furniture was turned over, and a flower-pot knocked down and broken.</p>

               <p>and said "I have come to give myself up for assaulting Miss Wiles"—his hands were covered with blood and pieces of hair "were sticking to the ends of his fingers—I asked him his name—he said Edward Pinder—I then asked him why he did it, he said "Is that a proper question.?"—I said "How much have you assaulted her?"—he said "I can't say"—I then left him in charge of an officer and went to Miss Wiles's house—I saw drops of blood from the station to Miss Wiles's house—I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced) lying</hi> on a sideboard in the hall, open—Selina King pointed it out to me, it was covered with blood—I then went into the drawing-room—I saw a quantity of blood on the carpet and this piece of hair (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) also covered with blood—on the evening of the 12th I was with the prisoner in the cell and he asked me what would be done with him to-morrow—I said most likely he would be remanded—he said "I did it to disfigure her"—I said "You cut your own fingers"—he said "That was done in stabbing, the knife partly shut and cut my fingers; the bones in the head stopped the blow and closed the knife, and that cut my fingers."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, practising at Hitchin—on 7th November, about half past 12, I was sent for to Miss Wiles—I found her upstairs on the bed—she was bleeding from several wounds, one on the left side of the forehead, one over the temple on the right side, and three at the back of the head—the right palm was wounded in the middle of the hand, and the left hand between the <hi rend="italic">fore</hi> and middle fingers, several scratches at the back of the hand, and one slight wound on the left breast—they were stabs, incised wounds—these at the back of the head were of considerable depth, to the bone—the wounds were bleeding at the time, except the scratches, per<lb></lb>haps—the eyes were suffused, and she could not open them, as if she had had a blow, the usual black eye, both of them—this knife might inflict the wounds—there was considerable danger of erysipelas from the wounds in the head, and the one on the hand was very near the palmar artery, which is a very dangerous place—she was under my care for about three weeks—she cannot now use her fingers from the stab in the hand—the wounds in the head have recovered—I hope she will be able to use her fingers again.</p>

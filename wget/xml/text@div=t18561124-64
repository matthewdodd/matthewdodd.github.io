Bank of England note—he gave the note over to Hagemeyer—Frost and Woodhall spoke together, and Woodhall produced a paper, on which there was writing—he gave it me to write my name—Hagemeyer told me what it was—I would not write—I saw Woodhall taken in custody, about three quarters past 11 o'clock—I saw Frost at the station, he stood there—I saw him taken into custody—I did not speak to any policeman before he was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Dun Horse. On the night of 14th Nov. I saw Greenwood and the two Germans in our house—they came in together—I thought they were all friends—I dare say they remained there an hour—I was attending to the customers—I brought them three glasses of rum and water—one of the Germans paid for it. I would not undertake to say which—that was at a little after 5 o'clock: I know it was gone 5—it was just after I brought them the rum and water they gave me the half</p>

               <p>crown to pay for it—I am sure he paid me before they left the house—I did not see anything that happened at the table; I was in another room—after 10 o'clock a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was given to me for the purpose of being changed—it was given to me by the baker next door (Hagemeyer)—I gave it back to Woodhall.</p>

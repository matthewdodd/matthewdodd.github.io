            . I am a publican at Windsor. The prisoner at the bar came to me on a Sunday in the afternoon, and had a pint of beer; he call'd me to the back door, and said he had a prize, and pull'd out this watch (producing one, which was deposed to by the prosecutor.) He said he found it on Egham causeway. He wanting to borrow a crown upon it, I lent him 3 s. Both he and his brother were inlisted in my house the next morning. Then he came to me and desired I would send him a guinea on it, saying, he was to receive his advance money; and I might do as I pleased with it, so I gave him a guinea.</p>

               <p>I was going to Windsor, and took up that watch upon Egham causeway. When I came to Mr. Pettit's, house, I call'd for a pint of beer, and shew'd it him, and asked him if he would lend me 5 s. upon it. I left word that if any body should come for such a watch to let them have it for the money that I had upon it.</p>

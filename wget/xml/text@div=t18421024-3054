                  </hi>. I am in the Royal Marines, and am quartered at Woolwich. Davie was in the service of a brother officer—on Sunday evening, the 2nd of October, I returned from dinner—Davie came up to me in the passage, and said a gentleman had been into my room inquiring for me; that he had stopped some time, then said he could not stop any longer, he would call again in the morning, and he had been gone half an hour—I asked his name—he gave me some name, which I have forgotten—next morning I missed my watch, ring, and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I gave information to the police—this is the note—I have not found the watch and ring.</p>

B.' on it"—I said, "There it is"—I took Davie afterwards—he was told by the adjutant of the charge—I said it was a bad job for the poor woman—he said, "She is innocent; when I gave it to her I told her it would be of some use to her by and by."</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Royal Oak, Stepney-green; the prisoner was in my service between four and five months at a pot-man. On the 3rd of Dec. I went to the cupboard where be kept hit shoes and brushes, and found a half-pint pot three-parts full of gin—I took it from the cupboard—he was up stairs cleaning himself—when he came down be went to the cupboard and looked about—after that he went out with hit beer—he then came to me and said he was very sorry for what he had done, but he had been taking some gin—I went up stairs to his box, and, on moving it, heard some bottles rattle in it—I sent for a policeman, took the prisoner into the parlour, and asked if he had taken any more liquor besides what I had found—he said no, and that was the first he had taken—I had the box brought down—he then began crying, and said he was very sorry for what he had done—he handed the key to the policeman, and at he wat taking the bottles out, he said it was brandy—we found four bottles full of brandy, and one nearly full of gin—he said he had got them out of the cellar—it is just as it came from the docks.</p>

On the 27th of November, about nine o'clock in the morning, I was sitting by my window looking in my yard. My fowls were in my yard. I saw the prisoner in the yard just by the privy door. The prisoner was in the habit of buttoning his small clothes up. He had got one fowl in his breeches, and one in his apron. I saw him with another fowl, one he put his head under his wing; he put that under his jacket. I saw him do this. They were all alive. I opened the window, and called out to John Hall, a man that belongs to the docks. The prisoner then bolted himself in the privy. I called out to the ostler to bring me a pitchfork. The prisoner said, do not break open the door, I will open it. He opened it, and there were three fowls then on the bottom of the floor.</p>

            . Mr. Hodgson called me as I was standing at the yard gate, and said a man was stealing his fowls. I immediately looked down the gateway, and saw the prisoner pick one of the fowls up from off the ground. He put it into his apron and walked with it into the privy, and bolted himself in. I went and stood at the privy door, waiting for the man coming out. I looked through the hole at the top of the privy door, and saw the prisoner in the act of putting one of the fowls into his smallclothes. I called out to him, and told him not to kill the fowls. He then threw that fowl on the ground. I then saw him take another from behind his coat. He had two coats on. He threw that down on the floor. He then pulled another fowl somewhere from his person; somewhere under his coat. Immediately upon that Mr. Hodgson came down. He held that fowl in his hand until the door was open. Mr. Hodgson was going to break the door open with the pitchfork. The prisoner then said he would open the door. He at first refused to open the door. The prisoner opened the door, and immediately he let that fowl go out of his hand, the fowl flew into the yard. He still remained in the privy, until we requested him to come out. He came to the door. We took him in custody, and took him into the house. A constable was sent for; he came and conveyed him to the watchhouse. The prisoner told us he was a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they game fowls - A. I believe not. He said one of the fowls was his own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the habit of fighting and feeding a few cocks for some gentlemen. That morning I was taking my fowl for a little walk. It got from me and went into this yard. I went in the yard and catched it. I was not going to take these fowls away. The other fowl was my own property.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

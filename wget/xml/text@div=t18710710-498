I live at 4, Market Terrace, Caledonian Road—I had a shop and parlour to let at No. 6, about February, 1870—a person called on me, and looked at the place; he gave the name of Harris—an arrange<lb></lb>ment was made, and this is the agreement which he signed—I saw him sign it, but I never saw him afterwards—on the Saturday week following, the prisoner called, and asked whether a person named Harris had taken my premises—I said "Yes," and I was surprised I had not seen him before, as I thought the place would have been opened—she said it was her brother, and he had gone down to the country, to bury his brother—on the following Monday or Tuesday, she came again, and had the name of Harris put up over the facial, and also a letter-box put in the shutters, and that was the only time the shutters were taken down—she remained he possession up to 9th April, when she gave up the key to my wife—she first represented herself as Miss Harris, and afterwards as Mrs. Harris—she paid the rent, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a week; I received it from her weekly—I never saw anyone but her about the premises, except a coal boy, about a week before I got possession of the place—the place was never opened except in the morning, to collect the letters—the prisoner collected them—I should say I saw her go and collect the letters at least four mornings out of the six, in each week.</p>

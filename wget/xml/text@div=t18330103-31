             (Police-constable K 228). I was standing at the corner of Three Colt-street, on the morning of the 4th of December and saw the prisoner with a cart;

            , the ostler, came up to him, and I saw the prisoner untie a rope at the back of his cart - Bannister came up to me; the prisoner saw me speaking to him - he and the other then went away; I and Bannister went to the corner of the next street, where Bannister laid down, and he said to me, "They have got them;" we ran to the place -Simmons came up to me, and said, "Will you have a glass of gin;" I said, No, I did not want it; the prisoner had then gone into the public-house - I went to an alley, into which they had carried them; I found the potatoes and sack there - I went into the house, and took the prisoner; he said Mr. Farrow gave him liberty to sell the potatoes on the road, and he would have taken the money to the person he was to take the potatoes to - Simmons said he was to give 6s. for them.</p>

               <p>GEORGE BANNISTER (Police-constable K 234). I was with Stone, and saw the prisoner undoing the rope - another man then took a sack of potatoes off the back of the cart; Simmons, the ostler, went with him down an alley - the prisoner went into the tap-room of the public-house; I asked him what he had been doing - he said his master allowed him to do so, he should make the money good to Mr. White.</p>

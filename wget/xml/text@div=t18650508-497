                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, at 39, Aldermanbury—on 21st April I was in the warehouse on the ground-floor—I saw a person of the name of Paddon running towards the door calling out—I went to the door, and saw lying there this bundle of jackets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are my property—they had been on the counter; I could not say how recently before I had seen them—I had not seen either of the prisoners in the shop that I recollect—several boys had been in inquiring for situations, but I did not take any notice of them myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of the last witness—on 21st April I saw Smith in my master's warehouse—he came in to know if we wanted a boy—I told him no—as he was going away I saw the bundle of jackets at the end of the warehouse move—I did not see what caused them to move—on seeing that I went close up to Smith and shut the door after him—he came in again in about three-quarters of an hour or an hour afterwards, and as soon as he came to the door I saw the bundle of jackets disappear—I ran to the door, passed him and saw Ward and another one putting them in a bag, and as soon as they saw me they ran away—they were in the passage—the door of the warehouse goes into a short passage, which goes up stairs—there is a way out by the passage—you come in by the street door into the passage, and then turn into the warehouse—I saw Ward and another boy, not in custody, in the passage putting the jackets into a bag—not Smith, and when they saw me they ran away—I ran after them, Smith ran away as well—he seems to have followed me, running the same way as the others did—I had run past him—he came a little way into the warehouse—the door was kept open by somebody outside—the jackets were behind the door on a counter—Smith remained in our warehouse as I ran out.</p>

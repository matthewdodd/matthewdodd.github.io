                  </hi>. I am chief officer of the <hi rend="italic">Alice Graham</hi>—I was on board that ship on the 29th June last—the prisoner was a seaman on board—I was in the cabin between 12 and 1 on the 29th June—the captain called the prisoner for the purpose of having the official log read over to him—the prisoner came into the cabin—I told him to take his cap off and stand outside the door; he did so—the master then came out—I did not see anything in his hand at that time—the prisoner and the master had some high words between them; the master pushed him into the fore cabin—I then saw that he had a stick in his hand—I saw a knife in the prisoner's hand, and he made two thrusts at the captain with it—I was at the table, writing; I said, "Look out, sir; he has got a knife"—the captain then rushed away from him—I went to get the knife from the prisoner—he thrust it at me, and it went through the fleshy part of my arm—I can't say what became of the knife afterwards; I believe it was pitched overboard—I saw the knife—I had not said anything to him before—I struck him after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the captain strike him with the stick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see him—the first thing I saw was the master shoving him out, to put him in the cabin—when I told the prisoner to take his cap off—I did not knock it off—I did not rise from the table—the master had a stick in his hand—I did not see him strike the prisoner at that time—I won't swear that he did not—I saw them struggling together, and went to separate them—the knife went into the upper part of the arm—I struck the prisoner after ho had done it—I did not see the captain knock him down on the floor and jump upon him—the prisoner was not chained to the foremast for three months afterwards—he was chained, but I forget the number of days—he was chained to the mizen mast in the fore cabin—I don't know for how long—he had no bed—it might have been fifty-one days, or a day more, I can't say—we did not let him loose ten minutes in the morning, and ten minutes in the evening—he had forty minutes if he liked, after we got not afraid of him—he was very quiet in his conduct—he was chained with a small dog chain, round the waist—it might have slipped up under his arm, and left the marks that are there now—we kept him in irons 101 days—all the voyage—I know that all the men were so disgusted that they subscribed funds for his defence—not with me—he was allowed what liberty be liked on the voy<lb></lb>age—he used to put the irons on himself—I mean to say that—it was a good, quiet crew—I never ill-used anyone in my life—I never struck the prisoner down to the deck—I struck him with my fist when he stabbed me—the chain was long enough to allow him to lie down—I never went and grinned at him when he was chained—he used to lie on his back—I saw him lying down, day after day.</p>

The prisoner had gone home to stop all night with me - he went to bed.

I found him in custody at ten o'clock with the sheet and blanket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is not your name Eliza - A. No; I never go by that name. He was not tipsy. I went up stairs to put the 4 s. 6 d. away, and had only left the room three or four minutes. I did not tell the Justice that I went out to get some supper.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he had been to the Shakespear's Head, public-house. to look for the prosecutrix - A. Yes; he had been boasting at the public-house that he had taken them from her - he seemed sober.</p>

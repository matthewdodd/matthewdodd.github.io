                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Peto, Betts, and Co., contractors; I am at present employed at the Victoria Docks. On Sat, 30th Dec. I gave a person, named Munday, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and instructed him to send the prisoner to the Great Western Railway to fetch some goods—he was to pay the carriage, whatever it amounted to—just after he left, we received this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the Great Western Railway, by which it appears that the sum to be paid was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the prisoner's return he pro<lb></lb>duced this receipt to me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. deducting 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as having been paid by him—the very same goods are specified <hi rend="italic">in this invoice</hi>—I said <hi rend="italic">that I had received an invoice that morning, stating that there was</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay; he said he "believed he had paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave me the receipt—in consequence of inquiries I made at the Rail<lb></lb>way, I gave him into custody—going to the police court, I asked him whether the receipt had gone from his hands after he left the station—he said, "No."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the Great Western Railway Station, at Paddington. On Saturday, 30th Dec, I received this receipt, but not in the state in which it is now—here is a "1" placed before the figure "7," and "teen" after the word "seven"—this other was a counter-part of it—I only received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is not the slightest doubt but that the alteration has been made since it left the station.</p>

Q.</hi> You are not in a condition to identify the prisoner as the person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not positively—these receipts are written out in a book similar to a cheque book, and left out to be given to the persons when they call, and the clerk signs them—Mr. Penn and myself are the only clerks—we relieve each other—this signature is mine—it may not have been delivered by the other clerk, we have to account for the whole of the money we sign for—I cannot say who the person was that I gave this receipt to.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose watch was that that you lost - A. A watch my father gave to me; it was only given me to wear, I left it in the privy on the 17th of January between three and four o'clock; I missed it about a quarter before five.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner Gibson at your father's house that day - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your watch - A. No.</p>
               <p>MARY BACON. Q. Did you live with Mr. Wiley on the 17th of January - Do you remember the prisoner being at your house - A. Yes, between three and four, he came after his Christmas box; there was another person with him; I saw Gibson go into the necessary, he stooped as if he picked up something, he turned round and the other man laughed; what it was he took up I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you understand that your master had lost a watch - A. He came home between four and five, and asked me if I had got the watch that was in the privy.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mary Bacon. Was it after the young man was gone to school that you saw the prisoner - A. Yes, it was after he was gone to school.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you search Mrs. Solomon - A. No. I went to Mrs. Solomon; I took Gibson to Worship-street office on the Friday following, the 24th; I went to Gibson and enquired which way Mr. Wiley could come by his watch; he told me to go to Dowde, if I met with his mate he would inform me where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention his mates name - A. Yes Wall; and Wall went with me to Dowde's.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of Gibson having any watch - A. Yes. I was going into the Bell public house the corner of Saunders's gardens, Kingsland road in January, I cannot say what day exactly, I believe it was Friday; he said he had picked up an old bit of a watch in the dust, he asked me whether I could sell it for him; he said the money should be spent in beer; I asked him to let me look at it; it was an old gilt metal watch with the glass cracked; I went to Mr. Solomon's house in Hackney-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see there - A. Mrs. Solomon; I asked her if she would buy this watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else bye in the shop - A. Mr. Solomon was in a room backwards; I asked he if she would buy that watch; she said, yes; I asked her ten shillings for it; she said she would give me five shillings and sixpence for it, I said no, I did not think that was the value of it; she said she would give me another shilling; I let her have it; she gave me a five shilling and sixpenny piece, and told me to call on the next evening for the other shilling; I gave the money to Gibson, he gave me a shilling, and told me to go on the next evening and get the shilling and keep it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wiley. Do you know what the watch is worth - A. No.</p>
               <p>Gibson's Defence. I am innocent of the charge; what that young man has sworn is as false as God is true, and what I have been in prison for I do not know.</p>
               <p>Solomon's Defence. I am innocent. I was always instrumental to help my neighbours to their property, but never to buy it.</p>
               <p>Gibson called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Solomon called nine witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

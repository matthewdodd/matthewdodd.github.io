                  </hi>. I live at the Two Chairmen, Lower Bruton-mews. On the 15th of September, I spoke to a <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> on the stand in Dean-street, Soho—I made a bargain with him, to carry my box from the Goldbeater's Arms, West-street, where I lodged—he asked 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I could not afford to pay that—as I went from the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> the prisoner followed me to the top of the street, and offered to take my box for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to the Two Chairmen, in Lower Bruton-mews—I was satisfied—I took him and my sister to a public-house in Seven-dials, and had a pot of ale, which I paid for—I afterwards went to West-street, and the delivered the prisoner my box—it contained some money, gowns, and the articles stated in the indictment, and my mother's wedding-ring—they were worth 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he carried the box to Warwick-street in my presence—I did not go all the way with him, as I had to call at two or three places—I left it in his charge, at about eight o'clock, to carry it to the Two Chairmen—I never got my box—I got there a little after nine o'clock—he had a quarter of a mile to go—I was sober—I gave information at the station-house, and the prisoner was taken—he did not deny it—he said he gave up the box to me at the door of the Two Chairman, public-house, and that I paid him.</p>

On the 17th of September, in consequence of information, I apprehended the prisoner at the burial<lb></lb>ground of St. Ann's Westminster, at about twelve o'clock in the day—he was standing, looking at a grave-stone—on our way through part of the church (the usual way from the burial-ground) I told him I had him in custody for stealing a girl's box—he said, "I did not steal it, I gave it her at the door, and she paid me for it," and he told one of our sergeants so—at the examination there was a name produced, who said he had seen the box carried to the Two Chairmen—he could not speak positively, but he had every reason to believe the prisoner was the person—that was stated in the hearing of the prisoner and the prosecutrix—he said he entered the house, and sat directly opposite the door, and he stated, on his oath, that the box never entered the house—he staid there till eleven o'clock at night—he is a man who lodges in the house, and worked in front of the house—the Magistrate did not him over, his evidence was not reduced to writing—they said that the prisoner's confession, that he carried the box to the door, was sufficient—this was at Marlborough-street office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I left the prosecutrix talking with a young man—while I took it to the door, and put it down, this man came out, and said, "Do you think we shall have any wet?"—I said, "I think we shall"—the prose<lb></lb>cutrix came up and paid me the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I asked if I should take it in for her, and she said, "No"—she staid in six public-houses and treated me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I did not—I went to the Bricklayers' Arms, where I had lived, and where part of my things were—I had two or three places to call at.</p>

                  </hi>. Yesterday morning, the 7th of February, I was at the shop of Robert Barker—I bought a leg of mutton and a piece of brisket of beef—I do not know what they weighed—I bought them of the prisoner, who was serving in the shop—I asked what they came to, he said 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I paid him—he said nothing about weighing them—I said, "I want 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of meat," and he gave me the mutton and beef—the officer afterwards met me, and stopped me—I produced the beef from under my cloak, and then the mutton—there were two women inside the shop, and several outside.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Yesterday morning, about twenty minutes after six o'clock, I was in Dorset-street, Marylebone, and saw Stanley receive a piece of beef from the prisoner—she closed her apron, pulled her cloak round it, and walked off very fast—I followed, stopped her, and asked what she had—she said, "A piece of beef"—I asked where she bought it—she said from Mr. Barker, and she gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I said she must go with me to the station-house—she then pulled a leg of mutton from under her cloak, and said she gave 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher. The prisoner was nearly twelve months in my service—the policeman brought the meat to me which he took from the woman—it was Bury mutton—that leg is worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the beef is worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had no conversation with the prisoner about it—I allowed him to sell to customers, and receive money, which he should give to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 24th October I went to Sir William Palliser's premises, 154, Minories, about 7 o'clock p. m., when the menknocked off work—the prisoner Clifton was called into the office as he left, where one or two members of the firm were present—I said to Clifton "Iam a police officer, and in consequence of something that has occurred Iwish to ask you a few questions; first, have you anything about you?"—hesaid "No"—I said "I must search you"—I did so, and found three smallpieces of leather in his trousers pocket—he said "I picked them up offthe warehouse floor, I thought there was no harm in it"—I said "Do youknow a woman named Brown?"—he said "No"—I said "Do you knowanyone living on the Seven Dials?"—he said "Yes, I know Mr. Darling, 17, Little Earl Street"—I said "I want you to tell me all you knowrespecting Mr. Darling"—he said "You will be very much surprised tohear what I have to say; there is a man, an old servant of the firm, whohas been robbing the firm for some time, his name is Larkins; I, with amate of mine, named Pearson, suspected him and watched him; one night, two or three weeks ago, we followed him out, and stopped him and said 'You have something in your pocket you ought not to have, we shall giveyou in charge of the first policeman we see; 'but he begged so hard that wedid not do so, as we ought to have done; a week or two after that we sawhim leave again, and followed him into Holborn, we stopped him and said 'You have got something in your pocket again; 'he said 'No, I have not; 'we then made him show us the shop where he had been in the habit ofselling the leather, and he showed us the shop of Mr. Darling, 17. Little Earl Street; me and Pearson went in and saw Mr. and Mrs. Darling, andtold them they had been receiving stolen leather. Mrs. Darling begged sohard, and Mr. Darling gave us 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and we said nothing about it Wewent again another night to Mr. Darling, and Mrs. Darling again beggedvery hard that we should not say anything about it, and Mrs. Darling gaveus a sovereign each, making 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we left a paper with Mr. Darling, undertaking not to trouble him again"—While he was saying that, Larkinssaid "I did not take the leather to Mr. Darling's myself, a woman alwaystook it"—Pearson was then called in, and I said to him "I ama policeofficer;" and, as he is rather deaf, I said "Have you heard what I havebeen saying to Clifton?"—he said "No"—I said "Do you know a womannamed Brown?"—he said "No"—I said "Or any woman passing by thename of Brown?"—he said "No"—I said "Do you know Mr. Darling, of Seven Dials?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Tell me what you know"—he said "A man named Larkins has been stealing leather some time, and me and Clifton suspected him and watched him; on two or three occasions I sawhim put something into his coat pocket—and one night, three or four weeksago, me and Clifton followed him out, and told him he had something in hispocket he ought not to have, he said 'Yes, 'and begged very hard of us notto give him in custody, and we did not; another time we followed him into Holborn, stopped him, and told him he had something in his pocket, hesaid he had not; we compelled him to show us where he sold the leather; he took us to Mr. Darling's," 17, Little Earl Street, Larkins remained out<lb></lb>side; we saw Mr. and Mrs. Darling, who gave us 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and we saidnothing about it; when we came outside Larkins was gone, so that I do</p>

Wontner were instructed next morning at the Mansion House—I searched Pearson's house, and found some pieces ofleather—Clifton picked out one piece, and said "One piece I bought, andthe rest I picked up off the warehouse"—I went to Mr. Darling's and re<lb></lb>ceived from him some leather and elastic webbing.</p>

I am a leather seller of 17, Little Earl Street, Seven Dials—as far back as 5th June, some leather was brought to me by awoman named Brown, and she brought more from time to time—I handedover to Child what portion of the leather I had left—I received receiptsfrom her for the money I paid her—on 14th October, Pearson and Cliftoncame into my shop, Pearson said "We are two confidential men in a largefirm and wish to speak with you. Will you come outside with me?"—Isaid that I could not, because my wife was ill, and I asked them into theparlour—Pearson said "There has been a robbery of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we areinstructed to search it out; we are not to give the name of the firm, asthe firm wish us not to—(<hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>

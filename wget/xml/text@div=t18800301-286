I am a labourer—on Friday night, January 30th, I slept in Mr. Tostle's brickfield at Tottenham—Pavitt and Donovan came into the shed—I said to Donovan "What is the time?" and he said "About a quarter to 11"—they asked if there were any gals up there—I said "No"—they said "We have left one down at the bottom of the brickfield"—they laid down, and left about 12.30 o'clock—I said to Pavitt "When are you going?"—he said "Home"—they both came back between 1.30 and 2 o'clock, but said nothing—they laid down and went to sleep (<hi rend="italic">The Court cautioned the witness that he would be sent to prison if he did not tell all the truth</hi>)—I said before the Magistrate "I asked them where they were going," and Donovan said "To do a bit of business"—that was before they came at 1.30 o'clock, and I say so now—I also Raid "They got up at 5 o'clock in the morning and began to halve the stuff"—that was knives and forks, two pencil cases, two pieces of gold, and two pearl<lb></lb>handled knives—I cannot swear to these things, as I was lying down, and they thought I was asleep—I saw Pavitt again on Saturday outside his shop—I asked him whether he had got rid of the pearl handled knife—he said "It is planted, but Donovan has gone to get it to sell it"—I asked him where it was—he said "Donovan has gone to sell it along with Wheeler."</p>

               Writing, Printing and Publishing an Unlawful, Malicious and Seditious Libel, Intituted, An Apology for Gods Worship and Worshippers: But containing most Infamous Reflections against his Majesty and the Government
            </rs>. The Witnesses against him were first, the City Marshal, who went to seize him, and found a Dozen of those Books, in the same Room with Mr. Ralphson. Also, one of the Kings Messengers found about Fourscore of them at a Printers. And one Cater, a Bookbinder, was produced, with whom Mr. Ralphson had contracted to Bind 200 of the said Books, and was to be his Paymaster.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ralphson then prayed the Indictment against him might be Read in Latin; which being accordingly granted, he desired the Judges on the Bench would be Councel for him, if there were any Points of Law therein. The Court let him know, that he might have retained Councel if he pleased, for it was not denied in Cases of Trespass.</p>
               <p>The said Ralphson continued to ask several unusual Questions: As by what Warrant the Marshal came to seize him? Whether they could Swear he was the Publisher; and whether the laying it to be Written, Printed, and Publlisht the 12th of November, did not make void the Indictment, since it was a thing not attainable to be done in one day: Which Questions being all very easily Answered. He yet continued to use some kind of Reflections upon the Court, as if he admired that any Protestant Court should think his Book a Reflection; pretending it only tended to disclaim all Jesuitical Clangs and Cabals. But the Court detected those fallacies: and discovered that the word Protestant, is made use of to drive on all manner of Ill Designs, as if none were True Protestants but such as lived in contempt of the Kings Laws. In conclusion, the Jury found the said Mr. Ralphson <rs id="t16840116-18-verdict81" type="verdictDescription">

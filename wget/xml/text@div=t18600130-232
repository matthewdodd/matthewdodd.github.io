                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police-inspector</hi>). On 23d January, I was on the river in a galley at Blackwall Reach, and saw the prisoner, Spooner, in a skiff laden with old rope—I asked him where he brought the rupe from—he said, "From Victoria-dock"—I asked him what ship—he said, "The Lady Combermere"—I asked him if he had any note or receipt to show that he had brought it from that ship—he said, "Yes," and produced a receipt, signed by the captain of the Lady Combermere, for 8cwt. of old rope-there ia no complaint in reference to that, but I observed these two other coils (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the fore pait of the boat—I asked him if he had bought them also as old rope—he said, "No, a man <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> them into my boat"—I doubted it, and he said; "Yes; it was in the captain's presence"—I said, "I have a doubt, and I must certainly take the rope and you to the station, and make further inquiries"—I took the rope into my galley—he then said, "To tell you the truth, I bought it of a lighterman named Brown, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him where the lighterman was, or whether he knew him—he said, "Yes, he has a barge now outside the Victoria-dock entrance, and if you like I will go along with you and show you the man"—he went with me to the Victoria-dock entrance, got on to the dummy and said, "There, that is the barge he belongs to, that he came out with"—I went on board the barge and found two Custom-house officers in the cabin—it was laden with old rope from Sebastopol, and one of them was it. charge of it to see after the duty—I afterwards received information, and went with Spooner to the Bell and Anchor at Plaistow—I met Knox near Plaistow, coming out of his own door, and asked him whether he had sold, any rope to anybody that day; Spooner then was 180 yards from me—Knox said, "No, I have not"—I said, "From information and description, I have every reason to believe you have"—he said, "No, I have not, Mr. Thompson, I have sold none"—I proceeded with him to where I had left Spooner; and said, "Is this the man you bought the-rope of?"—Spooner said, "Yes"—Knox said, "Well to tell you the truth I have sold him a little bit"—I told him I should have to take him in custody for it—he said he hoped not—I asked him how he came in the possession of the rope—he said, "It was in the barge cabin, but how it came there I do not know, and I took it out and sold it to him; my two young masters, Thomas and James, threw it out of the ship's deck into the barge on Saturday last"—the 23d was Monday—I asked him the name of the vessel—he said, "John Muers,"</p>

               <p>and that she laid at the bottom of the dock—Knox worked on board one of Widow Blencoe's barges at that time, but I do not know the name of it—I can't say where the barge in question was on Saturday—the captain says this rope is worth 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I consider it is worth 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

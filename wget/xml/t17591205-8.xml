The prisoner at the bar put me to bed on the 13th of November last; my watch was then in my breeches pocket, and also my money. In the morning, at putting on my things, the watch and a half guinea were missing from out of my breeches, which had been laid under my head. I had a suspicion of the prisoner taking them, because he had once before taken my watch away in a joak. I had a warrant to take him up, and he surrendered himself last Monday.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he confess any thing ?</p>
               <p>Potts. No, he did not; I never have seen my watch since.</p>

            . I live at the Albemarle's Head in Clerkenwell, where the prosecutor lodges. My mistress having a suspicion of the prisoner, because he had taken the watch once before, she sent me upstairs to listen what past when he was putting the prosecutor to bed. I went up, and heard. Mr. Blasby say to him, "D - n you, you was jealous of my stealing your watch before, but I will take it to-night, and what then?"</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he did take it?</p>
               <p>S. Skelton. No, I do not; it was missing the next morning: My mistress called me down the instant them words were spoken.</p>

             lodged in my house, whom the prisoner put to bed some times; he did so that night; the watch and money were missing the next morning. Before the prosecutor went to bed he had two half guineas in his pocket, which I saw. I got him up the next morning, and as I was putting on his stockings, and the thing belonging to his wooden leg, I missed his watch string, so asked him about it. He said he had it in his breeches the over night. Then I said, I'll see if your money is safe; I looked, and a half guinea was missing.</p>

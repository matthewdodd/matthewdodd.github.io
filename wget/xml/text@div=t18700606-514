                  </hi>, I am traveller to Messrs.

Gracechurch Street—I subsequently applied for payment—I did not get it—I called on several occasions—I only saw a woman—there was no business going on—I went to the address given of Mr. Meyer's; there was a name on the door poet, referring to the second floor; but I could not find him—I have never received any portion of the account—the place at Sun Street was subsequently shut up.</p>

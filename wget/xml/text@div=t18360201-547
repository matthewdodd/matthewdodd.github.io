                  </hi>. I am a glass-cutter, in the employ of Mr. Edward Chuck and others. The prisoner came on the 21st of January for a piece of new lead—he went down to where the lead is cut, and had it cut out—when the weight was brought to me—he said, "I have got 4lbs. of old lead to sell, "which I refused to buy—he said it was his own.</p>

About five o'clock on the 21st of January, Church came, but the bill was thrown out against him—I was present when the prisoner came with his master and picked out the lead which he had sent in by Church to be sold—I am speaking of this lead, it being</p>

"They did not buy it give it me" he said, "I have sold it at their other shop, in Kingsland-road"—where he said that Church had sold to George Meakin—he said that was the lead—that he had taken it from the other shop in Nor<lb></lb>ton-falgate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live in Glass House-street, Rosemary-lane. On Sunday morning, the 12th of December, between eight and nine o'clock, I was at a beer-shop in the Minories, having a pint of beer—the prisoner was outside the door—I knew him before by sight—said to me, "<hi rend="italic">Flashy place</hi>,"or "<hi rend="italic">flashy chap</hi>," I cannot say which—I he said, "Go on; what are you hallooing at? what do you mean?"—I waved my hand at him, and I might have slapped him on the face, I do not know—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184112130042"></xptr>
               <p>he then called me "Irish s—," and "<hi rend="italic">Flash Tom</hi>"—that made me rather angry—I ran after him to Tower-hill—he ran away as far as Postern-row—I overtook him, and was going to hit him—I cannot swear I did not hit him—he stooped down, with his back against the railing—he drew his hand behind me, and I found myself cut in both my thighs—I saw a police<lb></lb>man, and said I was stabbed—the policeman took him—I said, "You have stabbed me twice"—he said, "No, I have only stabbed you once"—I was taken to the doctor's—the prisoner said to the policeman, "Here is the knife"—he had it in his hand—I am twenty-four years of age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He swore twice at Lambeth-street that he did not strike me, and he struck me two or three times. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I cannot swear I did not strike him—I was not struggling with him at the time I was cut—he was waiting for me coming up to him—he stooped down, and I fell against the railings with my hands—he then put his hand behind me, and I felt my<lb></lb>self cut.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 187.) I heard the prosecutor say, "Policeman, I am stabbed"—I went up, and saw the prisoner—he was coming against me, and when he saw me, he said, "I have stabbed him, and here is the knife I stabbed him with"—I asked him why he did it—he said, "Because he struck me," that he ran after him from the Minories till he came up to him, and struck him, and with that he used the knife as resistance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. The prosecutor was brought to me by the policeman between eight and nine o'clock—I dressed the wound—it was on one thigh—it was about four inches in length across the cen<lb></lb>tre of the thigh, and about a quarter of an inch deep—it just went through the integuments into the muscle—the knife had evi<lb></lb>dently gone across the left thigh, and jobbed into the other, so that it had occasioned a punctured wound in the right thigh—being in a good muscular part, it would soon get well—the policeman showed me a knife, and it appeared to have been done by such an instrument.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. On the Sunday night, I and my brother came out, and crossed to look at this beer-shop, as another man had taken it, and there were some new things on the counter—the prosecutor was standing at the front talking to some one—he said, "Go on, what do you want there?"—I said, "Oh"—he came out, and was going to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> me away—I had a stick in my hand which I was cutting—I held it up as if going to hit him, but I did not—he hit me across the mouth rather hard—I then called him <hi rend="italic">Flash Tom</hi>, and Irish—he ran after me—when I got to the pump, I stooped as he was close to me—he struck me two or three times—I went to clasp my arras round him, and the knife cut him—I did not do it intentionally—I should not have taken out the knife, but I was cut<lb></lb>ting the piece of stick, and had it in my hand.</p>

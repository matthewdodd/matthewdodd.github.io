I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment, except the ring, on the 6th of December, out of a bureau in the bed chamber; the diamond ring I lost on the 21st of July: in fact, I did not miss them till the 17th of this month, only I heard the prisoner acknowledge the time she took them. The bureau was sometimes lock'd, and sometimes left open; I had no servant but the prisoner, and she did not quit my service till last Saturday se'nnight; she had been with us three years and two months in the whole. On Saturday the 17th of this month my wife missed all the things, except the ring, out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230050"></xptr> bureau; the next day I desired her to see whether the ring was safe; on searching we found that was gone. My wife charged the prisoner with taking them about one o'clock on Thursday; she would not see her but locked herself up in the kitchen all right: about eight o'clock I charged her with this ring; I said, What have you stole the diamond ring too; on which she put her hand in her pocket, and took out a pawnbroker's ticket, of the name of Jasson, who lives in Brown street, and delivered this ticket to Mrs. Teed. On Saturday morning, me, my wife, the prisoner and the constable went to this pawnbroker's. Jasson acted in a very scandalous manner, for he refused to shew the ring; but the constable's taking him into custody, he did go before the justice, and there shewed the ring. Mrs. Wright, the other pawnbroker, not being in town, appointed us to come on Monday twelve o'clock, and to appoint the other pawnbroker. In the mean time my wife was detained by illness till after eleven o'clock, then this Jasson was gone. The prisoner is about eighteen years old, her parents live at Putney; they are honest, poor people, for what I know. The prisoner did not own the things when first charged, but desired her mistress to look about, and see if she could not find the things. She did not go to bed that Thursday night nor Friday; the kitchen was not the room where she usually lay. I was not afraid of her running away on Friday; it was then day light; I should have been able to have recovered her.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you carry her before the justice on Friday?</p>
               <p>Teede. My wife wanted to consult her friends what course to take.</p>

            . I kept the things in my bureau in my bedchamber; it was sometimes lock'd, and sometimes not. I had no suspicion of the prisoner; she had been so long in the family. On the 17th of October, between one and two o'clock. I missed all the things except the ring. I asked the prisoner where they were; the prisoner said she knew nothing of them, made various protestations of her innocence, and desired me to look and search after them. I did all day and next morning, and to no purpose; the prisoner was locked up in the kitchen. I did not see her to speak to her till Saturday; I said nothing to her about confessing, nor did I hear my husband say any thing. My reason for putting her there was that as she had done this fact, as I suspected it on Thursday, and knew it on Friday. I was afraid to have her lie so near me. On Friday evening my husband asked me if I had got all my rings; I searched my bureau, and presently missed my diamond ring, which I told my husband of. The prisoner, my husband, myself and the constable went on Saturday to Jasson's; Jasson said he had the ring, but I should not have it without paying for it. At last, however, he went with us to Justice Wright's, and produced the ring. I saw it in his hand; the prisoner being present there, he would not give it out of his hand, he only let me look upon it. I told the justice I was sure it was my ring; being ill I did not come next time to justice Wright's till half past twelve, then the prisoner was gone. Mr. Jasson afterwards came to my house at night, along with another person, they frightned me very much by their behaviour; he threw the ring down, and said, he had rid his hand of it, and I must take care of it.</p>

               <p>Jasson. This gentleman came to my house, and said there was an earring pledged in that name; she found it, and she insisted upon my going before the justice. I said I would go; she began to be very cross; then she gave charge of me, and the constable went with her and me to justice Wright's; we staid there above an hour and half, till Mrs. Trusler's people could not be found; it was put off till Monday twelve o'clock; an acquaintance of mine went with me. I said, madam, you need not be afraid to open the door, at last she opened it; I told her it was impossible for me to know the person of the prisoner: she said she would not take charge of the ring; when I offered it to her, my only motive for that was, because I would not sware to the prisoner.</p>

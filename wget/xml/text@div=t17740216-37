            . I am a constable; a watchman sent for me; when I went, I found the prisoners at one Mr. Newton's, a public house, where they had been taken by the watchmen; I took charge of them and wrote a catalogue of the goods. (The goods produced and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

               <p>- Westwood. I am wife to the prosecutor; I went out about a quarter of an hour after my husband; I locked the door, after which I lifted up the latch as I always did, and found it was safe ; when my husband and I came home we found the door broke all to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you been from your own house?</p>
               <p>Westwood. I had been to Mile-end; we found the place very much disordered; many things were broke to pieces; and the things mentioned in the indictment were missing.</p>

               <p>Blundell.

               <p>I was coming along Moorfields, just as I came from on board the vessel, going up to see the captain's sister; this lad went with me across the fields: coming back a man stopped us, and asked us if we would watch the bundle for him; he said he would pay us for our trouble. As he did not come, this lad took it up, and said he would carry it home, and get the cloaths washed; we took up the tinder box and bar with them; he gave me the fiddle. Going along these men stopped us, and took us into the alehouse; there they were bragging they would get 40 l. for us. We asked them what they meant by that; they said they would get 40 l. for hanging of us: the two men said that when they had hold of us.</p>
               <p>Q. to Taylor and Blundell. Did either of you say such a thing?</p>
               <p>Taylor and Blundell. No such word was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Jones. The next day after they were committed, we tried this bar to the marks in the door, and they answered the size of the crow .</p>

            . I observed the prisoner when I was at Guildhall, attending my duty as a constable during the poll on the 28th of September, very busy about the hall; I suspected what he was about and watched him from place to place, at last I saw him go near the prosecutor, I thought he had picked his pocket; I went up to the prosecutor, and asked him if he had not lost his handkerchief; he told me he had; I followed the prisoner and caught the handkerchief in his hand before he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230006"></xptr> time to drop it; I found two more in his breeches.</p>

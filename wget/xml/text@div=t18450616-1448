                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Bird, we live at Lambeth. On the 17th of June we had a fire—the prisoner was helping to carry away some things—I paid her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for her trouble—I missed a pair of ear-rings, a brooch, and a needle-case—these are them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 182.) I heard something, and went to a Mrs. Roberts, and found the prisoner—I asked her what she had been doing at the fire, she said, assisting—I asked if she had any property which did not belong to her, and she gave me this needle-case—I said she must go to the station—she said, "Give me my bonnet"—I asked if the had any more property—she said, "No"—as she was going to the station she gave me this red case, containing the ear-rings and brooch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I said I left my bonnet and shawl up stairs; I said, "Here is a box I have found;" you know I speak the truth. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am sure I asked her if she had anything else, and she said, "No," and she gave me this three or four minutes after, as we were going to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I saw the fire, and went to assist; I did not want these things; I knew not what was in them till they were opened at the station.</p>

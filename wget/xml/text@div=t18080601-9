             to watch, he sat up several nights; the banks were robbed after he came away; I desired him to call me on Friday morning the 29th of April, which he did at half after three o'clock I desired him to go over the banks and I followed him immediately; at the time I came up to him I discovered him with a woman, I saw a quantity of potatoes laying by her, I asked her what business she had there, she said it was the first time of her coming. I took her to the constable and gave her in charge, and kept the potatoes ever since under lock and key; these potatoes had been taken from the bank; the bank contained about seven ton.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity taken away - A. About fifty pound weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where she lived - A. In Meeting House lane, within about half a mile from the place.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether she had any children - A. No, only what she informed the magistrate that she had two children.</p>
               <p>JOHN WHITE. Q. Are you servant to Mr. Whitbread and Morrison - A. Yes, I was employed to watch the potatoe bank. On the 29th of April, about half past three, I saw the prisoner, she went to the potatoe bank, she turned the straw of oneside and pulled about a bushel of potatoes into her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts were the potatoes - A. In the field, in the parish of Edmonton. I apprehended her with the potatoes in her apron; there is a foot path in the field, it is a bye road. She threw the potatoes down, and begged of me to let her go. I told her it was more than my life was worth to let her go.</p>

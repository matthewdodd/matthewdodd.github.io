               <p>On the 21st of last June, I took my watch from my side and laid it upon a little chest of drawers in the back bed-chamber, the room in which the prisoner and I lay. I went out for a pint of beer; when I returned I found my watch in the same place I had put it in; I sat down at the door of this bed-chamber in a front room; the prisoner went to bed a quarter of an hour before me; when I went to bed I missed my watch. I looked for it; she laughed. I said don't make a joke of it but let me have my watch. She laughed and said, d - n you and your watch; and she said it should be the dearest watch to me I ever saw. I have never seen my watch since. I took her up the next morning to Sir John Fielding's office, there she was discharged. The next time I saw her was in Clerkenwell prison; I went to see if she would own to the watch, and if it had been in pawn I would have released it. I asked her if she knew any thing of it; she said it was in a person's hands for a little money, and I should have it again when she came out of prison. She would not tell me where it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She charged another person with it? - I took all the three lodgers up, upon suspicion, because they had been in the place, but nobody could take it but the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I recommended the prisoner to Mrs. Cavenagh, for a lodging. Her box was left at my house while I was out, I afterwards saw the prisoner take the watch out of her box and wind it up. She said, by G - d the right owner shall never get it.</p>

               <p>I was present when Mrs. White was putting some things into the box, she found the watch in it; I knew it to be Mrs. Cavenagh's watch. The prisoner was at that time in Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Do you know that to be the prisoner's box which you are speaking of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is become of that watch? - The prisoner came after that and took the watch away; the constables did not see the watch when they searched the box. They searched the box for a gown and coat.</p>
               <p>How long did you know the watch was there? - Mrs. White was putting some things of the prisoner's into the box, after the constables were gone, and found the watch.</p>
               <p>Did she leave it there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What became of that box and the things afterwards? - The box is in Mrs. White's room now.</p>
               <p>To White. What became of the watch you saw in the prisoner's box? - I left it in the box. The very day she came out of prison, being discharged from the other accusation, I saw her take the watch out. She was in prison for stealing a gown and petticoat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That was a gown this woman gave me for taking it out of pawn.</p>
               <p>To Langham. You knew this to be the prosecutrix's watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You knew it at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you not to mention it to the prosecutrix? - I mentioned it to Mrs. Cavenagh that I thought it was her watch.</p>
               <p>How soon after? - not above three or four days after. Mrs. Cavenagh knew her watch was in the box before the prisoner came out of prison; but she did not think she had a right to take it out of the box, nor did I.</p>

I received some information from my servant, on Monday, the 8th of November, and saw one of our pigs in the possession of Ball, at his cottage on Ealing-common - he is a labourer in our employ. I knew it to be ours, but cannot say that it was the last one stolen; he ran away, but was taken in about a quarter of an hour - he said he had bought it at Brentford market for 16 s., but could not say of whom; 16 s. is perhaps more than it was worth.</p>

            . I am headborough. I went to Ball's with a search warrant, on the 8th of November - he knew me; the door was fast, but I got admission by sending my fellow officer round to the back door - Ball was no at home. I found the pig in the stye. I saw Ball afterwards - he had got across two or three fields, and was getting over a gate to the turnpike-road; he said "Do you take me for some money I owe you?" I said "No, for taking a pig of Mr. Thorn's;" he said he had bought it at Brentford market.</p>

            . I am a labourer. On Tuesday afternoon, the 2nd of November, about three o'clock, I saw Sumpton go towards Ball's house, and in the course of ten minutes, he returned with something under his arm like a sack; about a quarter before five o'clock, I saw the two prisoner's coming together from Mr. Thorn's with something in a sack.</p>

Accordingly he did, and being informed that they were at that Time cleaning their Pistols, he went and apprehended Levee and Blake in Fleet-Lane, and heard that Flood was that Day apprehended for some Fact in Southwark and sent to Bridewell, where he found him. And the Person who gave him Intelligence where to find Levee and Blake, told him he had two Rings to sell, so he they might be of use to detect the Prisoners, lent him 12 s. on them.

               <p>JOSEPH JOHN GOODE. My father is a pawnbroker in Goswell-street - I produce two bed-curtains, a tea-caddy, six cups and saucers, and a tea-pot - the cups and saucers I took in of one of the witnesses, and the curtains and caddy of the prisoner - the curtains being pawned twelve months since, I am not so positive about them; but I am of the caddy, which was pawned in June for 10s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not pawn the curtains. Witness. I believe she did - they were pawned in the name of Ann Tweed, which is the name she always pawned in.</p>

             ASHTON (police-sergeant G 11). On the 28th of December the prisoner came to me and gave herself up - she knew I had been after her for a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Brown told me he would forgive me, and he gave me Â£2 for my husband to get my clothes, that I might go into the country till all was settled, and then come back.</p>
               <p>MR. BROWN. I sent for her husband, and said, "This is a dreadful thing; take these two sovereigns and send your wife out of the way, and never see me any more;" but they came back again, and I found them on my premises - I think her mother, who lives in the neighbourhood, has led her astray. I wish to recommend her to mercy.</p>

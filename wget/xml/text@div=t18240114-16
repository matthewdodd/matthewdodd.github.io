            . I live at No. 19, New North-street, Red Lion-square. On the 1st of January, at seven o'clock in the evening, I was standing at my door, and observed two men walking up the street by Mr. Ingleson's house, which is in <placeName id="t18240114-16-crimeloc97">East-street</placeName>

I drew back into a dark part of my passage; they walked a little way down the street beyond the prosecutor's house, then returned, and the prisoner, who was one of them, got on the iron railing, and put his hand to the window, the other man walked on - the prisoner got down again and met him; they walked down the street again, crossed, and returned on the other side; then the prisoner got on the rails again, pushed the window up, and got in. I immediately ran over to Tylcoat, at the corner house, called him out, and while he was coming, I ran to Ingleson's door. Tylcoat joined me - I went to the window (the other man had gone down the street and returned - he ran away); we waited while the prisoner came out at the private door. I heard the parlour door unlocked, and then he opened the street door and came out. I collared him, and asked if he lived there? he said Yes. I think he had seen us at the window. We took him into Tylcoat's house, and fetched a constable. He was searched, and nothing but one shilling found upon him. I am sure the window was shut down, for I saw him push it up. Mr. Ingleson was not at home. I saw nobody belonging to the house.</p>

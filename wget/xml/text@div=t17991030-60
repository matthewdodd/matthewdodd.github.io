               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Furness is a very considerable manufacturer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he deals with other houses of course? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you examined, for the purpose of ascertaining whether you did miss a ream or not, you could not miss it? - A. I could not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long has he lived with you? - A. Four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him any questions about it? - A. He said, in a confused manner, that it was given to him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who had known him from his infancy, and gave him an excellent character.</p>

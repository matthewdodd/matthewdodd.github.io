                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City. On Monday after<lb></lb>noon,10th May, I was outside this building, about 3 o'clock, and saw a crowd—two women were quarrelling—I crossed from one side of the Old Bailey; I crossed to see what it was about, and had only just got into the crowd, when I saw Waldron's right hand under his left arm, leaving my waistcoat pocket—my watch was in his right hand; I was standing on his left—he had some bread and meat in his left hand—my watch was detached then; it had been attached to this hair guard, as it is now—I saw his hand, with the watch in it, pass to the hand of Hartley, who was standing close to him—they dropped it between them; I cannot say whose hand it dropped from, but Hartley picked it up—I collared Waldron immediately, as this only took a second or so, but when I saw the watch picked up, I let go of Waldron, collared Hartley, took the watch out of his right hand, and put it into my pocket—I pulled him into the road, collared Hartley a second time, and they were secured—Hartley said, "It's a bad job, and cannot be helped," or something of that sort.</p>

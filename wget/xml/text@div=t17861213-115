               <p>Do you remember the maker's name? - I think it was Chivers.</p>
               <p>How long have you had that watch? - About six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Did you wear it constantly? - No; I sometimes wore it, and sometimes left it upon the mantle piece.</p>
               <p>Did you lose your watch any time in September? - Yes, I missed it in September.</p>
               <p>What day, do you recollect? - No, I do not; I believe it was in the beginning of September.</p>
               <p>Where did you miss it from? - I did not miss it; it was my maid that missed it; a gentleman came to take the lodgings, and after he was gone about a quarter of an hour, she missed the watch off the mantle piece, she told me.</p>
               <p>Had you seen it there? - Not that day.</p>
               <p>How long before? - I really cannot recollect how long before.</p>
               <p>Did you usually leave it there? - No, I did not make a practice of it.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time leave it there? - Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>In what room was it? - In the dining room.</p>
               <p>Did you know the number of it at that time? - Yes, I think I did at that time.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the number of it? - I really cannot say how long; I put the number upon a bit of paper since this happened.</p>
               <p>What have you done with that bit of paper? - I was looking for it, but I could not find it.</p>
               <p>As soon as you missed it what did you do? - I went to Sir Sampson Wright's.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the last witness? - I went to several pawnbrokers, and among them to Mr. Cooper's in Wych-street.</p>
               <p>At what time did you go to him? - I believe it was about three the same day.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him the number and name? - Yes, I believe I did.</p>
               <p>What sort of a chain had it then? - It had a steel chain.</p>
               <p>When was you sent for again by Mr. Cooper? - I cannot tell when it was; I was sent for the same day in the evening; I first called at his shop and then went up to Bow-street, there I saw a person that was detected of taking the watch.</p>
               <p>Is that the person that was in custody? - I really cannot tell you; if it is him he is very much altered indeed.</p>
               <p>Then you do not mean to swear to the man? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you never saw the prisoner before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him since he has been in custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you for to see him? - He sent for me to let me know about his friends.</p>
               <p>When was that? - About two or three days after it happened.</p>
               <p>Was he then so altered that you did not know him? - No, he was not so altered then; there is a great deal of difference now.</p>
               <p>Do you know the watch enough to swear to it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, upon this evidence I think I need not call the prisoner on his defence; you are to deliver<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130140"></xptr> your verdict upon the evidence that is before you; and whatever one thinks of Clifton's evidence, he is to answer for that, that is between God and his own conscience; he will not swear to the watch; I think you cannot convict him.</p>

            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. Baron HOTHAM.</p>
               <p>Court to Clifton. I said to the Jury that the evidence you have just given was between God and your own conscience; the man is acquitted by the laws of his country; but as to you, it is impossible but any man that has heard your evidence must be of opinion that you have now in a very gross and scandalous manner concealed a fact that you might and ought to have proved against the prisoner; it is impossible not to see that you have sworn in the manner you have done, in order that he may evade the justice of his country; he has evaded it by your means; I hope that escape will induce him to lead a better life hereafter; but as to you, you have most scandalously transgressed the laws of your country, in giving the very prevaricating evidence you have done; it is impossible to believe that you could so suddenly forget the man you saw in custody, or the number of your own watch, when you did know it immediately on your loss, and when your passions were warm, you then went to the pawnbroker's, and told him what the watch was; at that time you had had no conversation with the prisoner; since that you have been bought off to enable him to evade justice; and you will now go home with the mortification of having been thus disgraced in the eyes of your country, and of having committed a gross offence in the eyes of God; therefore go and make your peace with him for your conduct to day.</p>
               <p>Court to Pawnbroker. Who has the watch? - I have it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then keep it; it does not belong to the prosecutor.</p>

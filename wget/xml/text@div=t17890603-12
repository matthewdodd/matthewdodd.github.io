               <p>Court. How can you be sure he was not out all night; did you lay in the room? - No, I saw him in bed the next morning between seven and eight o'clock, I breakfasted in the room; Mr. Dancer keeps the key of the house; I heard he was taken up on Friday.</p>
               <p>Macmanus. I went there on Thursday, and this woman and the prisoner's wife were washing together, and they very freely shewed me every part of the apartments.</p>

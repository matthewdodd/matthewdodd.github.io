               <p>RICHARD TOWNLEY. The prisoner never gave me an account of this; it ought to have been entered in the day book, which was kept in the warehouse, and which was missed some days after the prisoner left me; this sum of 2l. 3s. 6d. could not have been entered there, or I should have seen it; and it was my uniform practice to go over that book, and enter the cash in the cash-book, and the balance was struck at the bottom by the prisoner; it might sometimes be a week or two before I made the entries, but it was always his duty to hand over money to me, and if it had been entered in the day-book regularly, in the course of a day or two, or a week, or a fortnight, I should have gone over it and entered it into the cash-book; there is no entry in the cash-book of this sum; when he left he was in my debt, we had not settled our accounts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When had you seen the old day-book? A. I missed it on the 5th of September, but I cannot be positive as to when I had seen it; there was a new day-book in use on the 2nd, and I will swear I saw the old one after the new one was there - I took the old one out of the bookcase where it had been, and threw it down, and reproached him with indolence; I said "If you had any management you would put this out of the way, you will have very little occasion for it now" - I cannot say that there might not be three weeks elapse between the times of my looking over the day-book- I should not wonder if there had been five weeks elapse, I was so oceupied in my business; but he had no right to keep money a single day - he always treated me with respect.</p>

            . I do not assist my husband in his accounts; if the prisoner received money, and my husband was not in the way, he paid it to me, but I never put it down, the prisoner put it down in my book, which is here - he did not not account to me for this sum - I have not particularly looked into the book for this.</p>

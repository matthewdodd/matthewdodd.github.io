               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You really was in such a state of compleat intoxication, you do not know how you lost it? - I do not; I have seen my watch since at Guildhall, the day after, on Monday, the 2d of August, about ten, in the hands of Mr. Hillear, belonging to the Poultry Compter; I do not know the number, or maker; but the outside case is carved round the edges; a silver watch; no other particular mark.</p>

               <p>I am a labouring man; I was in St. George's Hospital, about nine weeks ago, and came out to get a clean shirt; about seven, I saw two or three people at the end of the court in Butcher-row, and Mr. Taylor, the prosecutor, was laying on the ground, and the prisoner was laying on him, beating of him; I said, it was a shame, and I pulled the prisoner from Mr. Taylor; the prisoner said, he was his first cousin; as he was draging him along, Mr. Taylor's watch fell out of his pocket; then Mr. Taylor tried to get his watch, though he was drunk, and he stooped to take up his watch, and laid hold of the string, and the prisoner snatched at it, and took it and clapped it into his waistcoat pocket; says I, it may be your cousin, give him his watch, take a coach, and take care of him; he would not have a coach; they then went along, and he brought him back to the passage where I first saw them; he left Mr. Taylor, and went on to Fleet-street; I pursued him, and brought him back; he would have given the watch to me, I took him into custody, and brought him to the Poultry Compter, and put him to bed; I went there in the morning, and found him there; I delivered the watch and half-a-guinea to Mr. Hillear, and the two shillings I paid for a coach; Mr. Hillear is ill, but

               <p>Have you never been charged with one? - Let us see; I kept a shop about two years ago; then there was a change about some lead that was brought into my place, in Grey-eagle-street; I was taken up on suspicion; the people that brought in the goods are convicted; I was tried and acquitted; I was an evidence them, but never since.</p>

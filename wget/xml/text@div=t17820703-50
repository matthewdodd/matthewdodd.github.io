On Wednesday last, near seven in the evening, I was in Basinghall-street, sitting on the coach-box; I thought I found the coach to sway backwards and forwards; I looked over my left shoulder, and saw the prisoner come from behind the coach with my fellow servant's great-coat; she was wrapping it up in the skirt of her gown; my fellow-servant had left it hanging in the holders behind the coach; it is my master's property. I got off my box, pursued, and followed her from Basinghall-street to Wood-street; a person told me she was run into a public-house; I went into the public-house, and saw her sitting in the corner, with the coat in her apron. I asked her how she came by the coat: she said she picked it up. She gave it me, and said, There is your coat.</p>

               <p>Coming along, the coat lay in the footway; I took it up, and put it into my apron, and went into a house in Wood-street; the gentleman came in, and said he had lost a coat, and I gave it him.</p>

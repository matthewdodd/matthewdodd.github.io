            " to this deposition is not my writing - I did not swear to this deposition - (looking at a note), with the exception of "Sunday, 1831, and 9 tomorrow, Mr. Rose;" this is in the hand-writing of the prisoner - he gave it to me before the 6th of June; he handed it to me with a statement, requesting me to attend before the Proctor in the Ecclesiastical Court, and swear to the contents, agreeable to that paper - I knew his hand-writing well - (read).</p>
               <p>"I saw Mrs. S. Lewis in St. Martin's-lane, near St. Martin's church, Charing-cross, on Sunday morning, the 25th of September, 1831, just before church-service; I knew her by seeing her two or three times at Mr. Rose's, Symond's Inn - I said,"You are in a hurry, Mrs. Lewis; "she said she was going to see her niece married - I asked who to; she said to Mr. Rose, but she was fearful she should be too late - I returned with her, and we both went in at the great entrance; Mr. and Mrs. Rose were then being married - Mrs. Lewis said she would not go up to the altar, as she was too late; I think the ceremony was over in about five minutes - Mrs. Lewis is about forty or fifty, of middling stature, and thin, dark, and pale; I do not know her further than seeing her frequently at Rose's, in Symond's Inn."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of these circumstances? A. No, and I did not swear to them; I informed Mr. Knight's proctor of what was going on - this letter is in the prisoner's handwriting - (this was the letter produced on the trial of Throp;) before the 6th of June the prisoner stated to me that he had procured a d-d good fellow to go in and win, and it had cost him 4l.</p>
               <p>Q. To go in where? A. In the cause of Rose against Knight, and he said, "When the thing is over we will have a d-d good tuck out," by which I understood a dinner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How do you get your living? A. By doing what I can;" I am an accountant - I am employed by many persons in difficulties, and think it improper to mention their names; I now live at No. 130, Holborn - I do not keep the house: I have an apartment, but there are so many rooms in it, I cannot say whether it is on the first, second, or third floor - I have been there five or six weeks; I may have slept on the first, second, or third floor - the person who keeps the house is in the Fleet prison; his name is Norris - I am perfoming some business for him, and the rent is a set off; I was to pay 7s. a week, and have the range of the house - I do not know on what floor I sleep; if you were in the house, you could not find you way out of it - it would puzzle you to say what floor it is; it is one of the oldest houses in London, and is curiously built - I will say it is the second floor; I was very intimate with the prisoner - I know Mrs. Rose, who lives in Great Russell-street, Bloomsbury; I was not present at their marriage, which I understand was in 1815 or 1816 - she lived with the prisoner till within these twelve months.</p>

               <p>Q. The suit against Knight was for defaming the character of Rose's wife? A. Not of his wife, but of a female representing herself as Mrs. Rose; not the Mrs. Rose I mentioned - I never spoke to the female in question, in my life - I am personally acquainted with Mrs. Rose - I never justified bail in my life, or proposed myself, or provided other persons for bail; I had a conversation with the prisoner before he gave me the paper - he requested me to go with him to Mrs. Lewis, the mother of the person he represented as his wife - I did so, and she was out; he then requested me to go next morning to St. Martin's church, to swear to the particular situation of the church, and to see Mrs. Lewis, to identify her if she should be brought before me; I did not go to the church - I went to Mrs. Lewis' house, somewhere at the back of Queen-street, Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention to you his object? A. He did; he said he meant to fix Mr. Knight and ruin him - I immediately furnished the party with the information; this conversation was before I went to Strond, which was on the 23rd of June: the first conversation with him was at the commencement of the suit, about sixteen months ago - I returned from Stroud on the Sunday after the 23rd, and I think on a Monday I furnished Mr. Robart's with that document; my first conversation with him was many months before that - he then wanted this deposition made: I did not see Mr. Knight before I made the communication to Mr. Robart's, nor any person from him - I considered it my duty, as an honest man, to give information; I had no other motive: I was never accused of forgery or fraud - I was in custody for one night on a charge of felony; it was decided the following morning by the Magistrate: I have been accused of many things, and been many nights in custody.</p>

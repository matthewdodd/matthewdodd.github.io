             helped me to remove to Mr. Iredale's house. Soon after we got into bed she told me, she was going to try something, and she laid the poker and tongs and things across under the bed; this she continued for several nights. She cut out rings, and different things, out of white cloth, which she placed in the fire-place, then she filled a tea-cup with sand and put a sprig of Southernwood in the middle, and cut figures out of paper and placed them round them. She placed the cup on the shelf, it remained all night; she made a cake, and gave me some to eat; she made some broth, put some powder in it, which she gave me to eat, and afterwards told me what she put in it. About the 9th of August, in the evening, as she and I were sitting at the table, a knife was thrown at me from the other part of the room. It was not thrown by her, she was sitting at the table with me. She then told me, the spirit of the man she now is married to threw it, because what I had done I had not done quick enough. I believe it was the same night, being in the dark, she stood by the window, she talked as if she was talking to a person, but I could not see any thing. She cut bread; and cheese, and butter, and different things that were on the table; she held it as if to give to some person, which she said, was the person of the man; and she told me, to look up against the wall, which I did, and I saw the figure of a lamb, about the size of a large cat. After we were in bed, she told me to look at the other part of the room; I looked, and I saw faintly the figure of a man with something white over his shoulders; he was sitting on a chair. She told me, he wanted something out of my box; I asked her, what? She said, <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100026"></xptr>clothes out, and when he came to what he wanted he would claim the same, I took a great many things out of my box being very much frightened; and in the morning I found them all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this box from whence you took them - A. By the side of the bed; I got out of bed to get them out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the side of the room where the spirit was - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Mrs. Salter - A. She remained in the room and did not go out to my knowledge; Mrs. Salter made a great noise about the same time as if somebody was strangling her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that while you were taking the things out - A. It was both before and after a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the articles that you lost this night, let us have the particulars - A. A sprigged muslin gown, and a cotton gown, petticoat, stays, a spencer, I gave her four shillings for them back again; I missed four habit shirts and five caps.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever since seen any of these articles after that night - A. She told me that some of them went down to a Castle in Devonshire; I saw her with some of them on a few days or a week afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she continue to lodge with you - A. She continued for eleven weeks; she told me that these apparitions told her that she must wear my clothes or else I should be tortured.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you agree to this - A. No; she told me if I said any thing about it I was to be turned into a different shape and be tortured that kept me quiet, I dreaded the consequences; she so deluded me that I believed it was in her power to do every thing she said.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these all the circumstances that you know of the woman prisoner that was transacted that night. - A. Yes.</p>

             - A. He used to come to my apartments pretending to see me, they were always together, I did not wish him to come but she always asked him, he was there that evening he worked for Mr. Iredale, he was always coming to and fro.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him in possession of the things that you lost that night - A. He said that he helped to take my goods away on the 2d of October, he said nothing about my clothes, I do not know any thing that he did at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the articles that you saw her wear - A. Handkerchiefs, caps, and stockings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You seem to have been affected a good deal by a spirit that night - A. I never heard of any such things before, I was very much alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew this man before did not you - A. Yes;</p>
               <p>Q. He paid his addresses to you, did not he - A. He pretended so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then afterwards he married this woman - A. I understand so.</p>

               <p>Q. These things that you have described you produced for the apparition or any body else to take, you laid them out - A. I laid them out.</p>
               <p>Q. And part of the things the woman wore and continued with you eleven weeks afterwards; wearing them when she thought fit - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you took these people before a magistrate - A. As soon as I found them out about two months ago.</p>
               <p>Court. What was it that induced you to suspect this fraud at first, you went on with her eleven weeks. - A. I did; under the terror of this apparation, when she went away from me she said, she was going down to where my clothes were to be tortured all her life, because she made use of this magic. I was told by several friends that they had seen her in the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you learn that there was no reality in all this magic - A. I found that she was living in a shop; and was not gone to where she told me, I heard where she lived, I applied to Mr. Bly the officer to take her up.</p>

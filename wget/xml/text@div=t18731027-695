I am a cabman, and live at 9, Bermondsey Buildings—on the night of 25th September, I was coming down the Bridge, about 11. 40 towards High Street, Borough—the prosecutor and prisoner were in a door-way—the prosecutor hailed me, and I stopped; he held the prisoner and came against the wheel, the horse moved and the gentleman got on the footboard, and the prisoner got on, too—some money dropped, and the prisoner jumped down and went round the back of the cab—the prosecutor said "Cabman, I am robbed"—I went after the prisoner, and caught him in the middle of the market—I threw him down and held him till a constable came up and took him—I did not lose sight of him—I was close to him, and there was no one about—I found the prosecutor in the cab when I came back, with the door shut—I asked him if he had picked up the money—he said no, he was in there, and he intended to stop there—the prisoner and I were both on the ground when the policeman came up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prosecutor was in liquor—I said, before I was on my Hansom in High Street, Borough; it was about 130 or 150 yards from the Bridge—after the prosecutor called me, the prisoner went on following him towards the cab, then he jumped on the pavement and went round the cab—the gentleman told me he was robbed, and told me to go after him—I saw no violence used; if I had I should have got down and used some towards him.</p>

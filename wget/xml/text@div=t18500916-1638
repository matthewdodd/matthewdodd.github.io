                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin Cook, of Oxford-street, Stepney. On 9th Sept., in consequence of something that was said to me, I looked in a box in my bedroom, and missed a frock and some napkins, which I had seen safe about two months ago—during that time I had employed the prisoner two or three times a week in washing and cleaning, and she was in the habit of going into the bedroom—I spoke to her about my loss, and told her if she would give me the things, or tell me where they were, I would not do anything with her—she said she knew nothing about them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Crown-court, Whitechapel, and know the prisoner. On 6th Aug. I bought this ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the prisoner for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said it was for a child's frock, which was pledged for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and had been in for 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. before—she went with me to change the ticket, and I had it put in the name of Cain, the person I wanted the frock for.</p>

This frock was pledged with me on 5th Aug., by a woman in the name of Ann Watson—I know the prisoner's face very well, but I do not know that she is the person who pledged it—it was changed on the 6th by Mrs. Jags with another person—I knew the prisoner by her coming to the shop at different times.</p>

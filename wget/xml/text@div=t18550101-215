                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Page, of No. 1, Garden-walk, Willow-walk, Shoreditch. I knew the deceased, Elizabeth Hyson; the pri<lb></lb>soner was her daughter—seventy-two was the age upon the deceased's coffin—they had both been living with me for six years and a half; they used to quarrel very frequently at times—on Tuesday, 14th Nov., about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I was alone in my front parlour; the prisoner and her mother were at home in their room, the first floor back—I could not hear anything which took place in the room unless I was listening—I did not hear any<lb></lb>thing, but the prisoner came down into my room very much excited, and said, "I think I have given the old devil her death blow"—I said, "What have you been doing?"—she said that she had stuck a pair of sharp pointed scissors into her mother's hand—I said, "Oh, dear! how came you to do so?"—she said, "She had been teasing me, because I was so long over my bonnet; she would interfere with me and my bonnet"—I said, "What is that on your hand?"—she said, "It is some of the old woman's blood," and took up her apron and wiped her hand—I said, "Pray do, Sophia, put on your bonnet and go out;" but before that she took up my scissors, I being at needlework, and said, "I have scratched her across the hand, in that position"—I did not think it a very serious matter, and did not go up, nor did I on the Wednesday; but on Wednesday the prisoner came and told me how bad her mother's hand was—I asked her what she had done to it; she said she had put some dripping to it—I said, "Pray do not put that to it any more, put a poultice to it;" and she did so—on Wednesday night she told me that her mother's hand was very much worse, and was full of pain—I told her to apply a warmer poultice, and to send for a doctor in the morning, and she did so—on the Thursday morning, before the doctor came, I went in to see the old lady, and I never saw such a wound in my life; it was on the back of her hand, across these three bones—the deceased said, in the prisoner's presence, "The girl has done this;" the prisoner said nothing to that—a doctor came, and attended the deceased from this time—she died on the 19th—the prisoner remained with her mother till about the Thursday week, and was then sent away by order of the doctor, and a nurse came from the workhouse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I think it was on the 7th that I hurt my mother's hand, it was the day after Guy Fawkes day; my mother lived six weeks after I hurt her hand. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Kingsland-road, Shore<lb></lb>ditch. I know the house where the deceased lodged; it is in that parish—I was sent for on 16th Nov., and found a wound on the back of her right hand, about an inch or an inch and a half in length—there was a good deal of erysipelas about it, and a commencement of sloughing; that condi<lb></lb>tion kept getting worse, until she sunk on 19th Dec.—I did all I could to save her—when I first went, I found that the wound had been poulticed—I saw the prisoner on every visit; she said that she had done it—that wound was the primary cause of death, it produced erysipelas, which went on to mortification—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the body, and there was no other cause of death—erysipelas is a very common effect of a wound on an old subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the nature of the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was deep; but I saw it two days afterwards, and could not form any positive opinion about it, because erysipelas had set in, and the hand was very much swollen; it was a gaping wound—I should consider that it had been done with violence from what I have been told since—it was through the skin, but did not go to the bones—a pair of scissors dragged across the hand would have pro<lb></lb>duced such a wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a weaver; the prisoner is a cousin of mine. I have merely come to state her insanity—I have known her all her life—she has not been fit to live with her mother for some years past, but it was her mother's wish—she came out of Peckham mad house, she has been there twice—the last time was eight or nine years ago.</p>

She did not come out cured, but she was not bad enough to be in the asylum—it was the wish of the parish to have her under their care, but her mother wished to have her with her—before that, she was confined in Miles's mad house, and she has been in St. Lukes' mad house; that is about twelve or fourteen years ago—her mother was a poor woman for the last thirty years, and always lived on charity—fifteen or sixteen years back the prisoner was in service, and used to give a portion of her earnings to support her mother—for the last eight years the mother has been expected to die day after day, and the prisoner being so excited, they used to <hi rend="italic">worret</hi> one another—I have not been at her mother's house for the last seven or eight years, but the prisoner has been at my house over and over again.</p>

               <p>death—her conduct was so queer, that it was my opinion that she was not in her right mind, and I ordered her to be removed—her conduct appeared strange on 23rd Nov., and I considered that she was not in her right mind; she treated the wound violently, and pulled it about roughly in my presence, and talked at random about her mother—she said that she had always said that she should be the death of her mother; that her mother was more like a beast than a woman; and I made up my mind that she was not a proper person to be there—that expression did not appear to me to come from a person of sound mind—I did not know at that time that she had been two or three times in confinement.</p>

I was robbed on Thursday, the 31st of July, about eight o'clock in the evening; I was serving another woman with a petticoat, on the opposite counter, to which this woman and another came in, on which counter, opposite to where I was, some cotton were laid, they began looking among, then to reach over; I said, what do you please to want? they gave me no answer, they kept among these goods; while I was cutting this young woman her petticoat, I perceived they stood remarkable close to each other, which gave me a suspicion that they were not about any good; as we are pretty well used to these kind of people, and I observed the prisoner at the bar her gown stick out rather further than what I thought was necessary for it to do; I concluded she had something, I saw the the gown move in fact; I immediately went round the counter that I was at, and went between them, and laid my hand on her clothes, and turned her round, and then I went and looked in, and found that piece of cotton, that will be produced, under her clothes, seven yards of printed cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she a cloak on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it under her cloak or gown? - Under her gown, secreted; I secured both the women, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the other not here? - I fancy the grand jury cast the bill out.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the property? - The constable has got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you delivered the same you took from the woman to the constable? - I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of it? - Twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have told us now every thing you said before my Lord Mayor? - Every thing that is necessary, respecting that business.</p>
               <p>Q. So you judge what is necessary? - Yes; I have nothing to say about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you pulled the print from the prisoner's gown, did you say so before the Lord Mayor? - I said from her clothes, I said so before the Lord Mayor, I think so, if I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you will swear; on your oath did you say before the Lord Mayor, did you say that you took the print from her clothes? - I said I took it from the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take on yourself to swear that? - I cannot recollect what I said before the Lord Mayor, I cannot take my oath about it.</p>
               <p>Q. I will tell you what you did say, you said this, that Morton dropped the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170214"></xptr>piece of printed cotton? - I said before the Lord Mayor, that I laid my hand on her, and turned her round, and the things sell from her clothes, and I took them.</p>

               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner at the bar a child in her arms? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Fielding was there, you know that we know her pretty well? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. On your Oath don't you know that the grand jury threw out the bill; how many persons have you prosecuted here, within these few years, in this very place? - That is no consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have an answer? - To tell the truth, I never was in this court before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you prosecuted any before magistrates? - Not before this court.</p>
               <p>Q. How many have you prosecuted before justices of the peace? You don't hear me? - Yes, I do, but I don't think it wants an answer; suppose I have prosecuted twenty, what is that to the business.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons have you charged with different things, and received money in order to drop the prosecution? - I came here to speak the truth, and you shall not put me out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you took the cotton from her; upon your oath did not you take it out of her hand? - She said she was coming to bring it to me, to ask me the price, but she had no business with it under her clothes in the mean time.</p>
               <p>Q. You had her searched I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And what did you find on her? - Nothing at all but that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you found nothing in her pockets, no child's clouts, or any thing of that sort? - The constable examined her, you must ask the constable that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see clouts? - Yes, I believe there were some.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see her take it? - No, it was given up into the constable's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it cotton or callico? - It is printed callico, or printed cotton, it is all the same thing.</p>

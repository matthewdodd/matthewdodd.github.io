             sworn. - I am one of the constables of the parish of St. Giles's in the Fields: On the 11th of January at night, about half past eleven o'clock, I received some information from Mr. Dignam, desiring me to go to a house in Orange-court, Great Wild-street; accordingly, about one o'clock, when the patrols came into the watch-house, I took them with me; I heard some people talking, I went into the parlour upon the ground-floor, and there were two young men, and four women, they were disputing about some handkerchiefs, and I desired them to give the handkerchiefs to me; they one and all said there were no handkerchiefs there, they had none; I then proceeded to search, and the first I searched was the prisoner at the bar; I searched his pockets, and all round him, but could find nothing, he kept his hand down to his breeches; I then asked him what he had got there; he said, nothing; I insisted upon seeing, and one corner of this blue handkerchief I pulled out of his breeches; I asked him how that came there; and he said he was injured; our patrol then said, their might be more, and I saw him pull out four more handkerchiefs; he accounted for the whole in this way, that coming down Orange-court to this house, he picked them up; I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have never made any attempt to find out the owners? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they may not be stolen that you know? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>PHILIP DIGNAM sworn. - On the 11th of January, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was going for a nurse to attend my wife, and in going through Orange-court, I heard some conversation in this house; the street-door and parlour-door being open, I could see the prisoner, Simmons, taking up handkerchiefs one by one from some person by the fire-side, putting them about her neck; this silk handkerchief, she said, would bring three bobs, and a white one, she said, would fetch a bob; then she handed that back, and received another; she did say, what she thought they would fetch, to some person by the fire-side; they thought they would not fetch so much; the prisoner said, she knew better, for she had popped many hundreds. I could discern, from the conversation, that they were not honestly come by; I heard the voices of two men, one said, I could have had many more, if you would have stood by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish the person of Williams? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. The meaning of the word, pop, is pawn, is it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY PENDEGRASS sworn. - I am a patrol: I went with Mr. Brookes to this house in Orange-court, the door was shut; we called, and they made answer, they would not open the door; I went to the window, and pushed it up, and

             the curtain on one side; I saw the prisoner Simmons make her escape to a back room, the door had been wrenched off the hinges, she slapped down the door; and the prisoner Williams and another man were by the fire; she slapped the door down upon them both; Williams got up and shoved the door upright against the same place again; then another woman opened the door and let us in; as soon as I went into the back room, I saw Simmons upon the bed, pretending to be asleep with a sick woman; I asked her, if she was asleep, and she said, she was, and had nothing to do with the affair; she was brought out and examined by one of the patrols, but nothing was found upon her; then Mr. Brookes wished to have Williams searched; after searching his pockets, he clapped his hand upon his right thigh, he said, he had a pocket handkerchief there to keep himself clean; I said, let us see what sort of a handkerchief you have got there; he was unwilling; He had hold of the corner of this handkerchief, and pulled part of it, and Mr. Brookes pulled the rest out; I said, I see you have left something behind; and I then put my hand down in his breeches, and he prayed me not; I put my hand down, and pulled four handkerchiefs out of his breeches all together; then he said, he had found them in the court; he did not give any reason for their being so concealed; Mr. Brookes has had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Williams's defence. A few days before this, I happened to see this young woman in Drury-lane, I asked her where she lived, and she said, No. 8, Orange-court; and the same night I was rather in liquor, and happened to go down the court to see the young woman, and kicked a bit of a bundle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200053"></xptr>before me, tied up in brown paper; another young woman happening to go in, saw me pick it up; she cried halves; and upon going in to examine the bundle, I found the above property, and I put them into my breeches, because I would not lose them out of my pockets.</p>
               <p>Simmons's defence. I did not know the young man, nor had not the property in my hands; I had been up stairs, and coming down, I heard them talking about the property, but I never had them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Williams called three witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>

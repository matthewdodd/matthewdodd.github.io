That he spoke to the Prisoner not to be so passionate to her Maid, who replyed, D-n her, a B-, I'll be her Butcher one times or other; he replyed, have you a mind to be hang'd for her then, and she answered, that for believed no Body would think it worth their while to hang her for killing of her.</p>

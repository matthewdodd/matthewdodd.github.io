               <p>MOSES MOSES. I live in Parson's-street, East Smithfield. On the 25th of July the prisoner came to my shop, and offered me a gold watch-chain for sale; I asked him if it was his own, he said it was-it had no ring to it. Suspecting him, I asked him what he wanted for it; he said, either fifty shillings or fifteen shillings, I do not know which; I told him I was doubtful of its being gold, and would take it to a neighbour to try it - He said I should not take it without he went with me. I took him to Nathan (he is an officer), which was within a few yards of me, and Nathan told him he must detain him on suspicion - He made a very great resistance, so that four of us could hardly take him to the watch-house. Several broaches and other things were found upon him.</p>

            . I am a headborough of St. John's, Wapping. The prisoner was brought to me by Moses, who spoke to me in Hebrew. I asked the prisoner what had become of the ring of the watch, and the chain and seals? he said they were gone. I told him that I was an officer, and must search him. The moment I spoke he turned to go out; I secured him, with the assistance of three or four others - We could hardly get him to the watch-house; I told him I must search him there - He said he would not let me. He took some things out of his breeches pocket, and some I took from him myself. I also found the following articles upon him - A coral, a toothpick-case, the rings which belong to the chain, a gold ring, a gold broach, a pair of silver studs, a silver<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170012"></xptr>earpick, a toothpick, a gold ear-ring, a silver stockbuckle, two pair of silver clasps, a hair watch-chain, a tobacco-box, and a Norfolk latch-key, which will open any door. Moses gave me the gold chain. The things are worth about 6l.</p>

On the 24th of July, about five o'clock in the evening, I went out, and left my wife and my apprentice in the house; I returned about ten o'clock, when I found my bed-room door and closet, which is on the first-floor, broken open, and the articles stated in the indictment gone-my passage door is kept shut. On the 28th I saw the property advertised, and found it at Nathan's - I knew it to be mine. They might have got in at the private door if they had a key. The property is worth 4l.</p>

About 2.45 on the morning of 11th July, I was on duty in Commercial street, and heard a breaking of glass—I went to the corner of lamb street and saw the prisoner running from the prosecutor's door, 5, commercial street, with something bulky under his coat—he ran through corbet court, and threw something away up peeke Yard—I followed him—he stopped, very much exhausted, and said, "All right; what is it?"—I said, "Come back with me; you have been into a warehouse"—he said, "All right; I do not Know anything about it"—I took him to the station, went back, and found five skins of leather, where I saw him throw something away—I examined the prosecutor's warehouse, and found 62 skins partially removed through a fanlight, and overhanging the street—the glass was broken, and there was a hole big enough for a man to get through.</p>

I am a shoemaker, of No. 5, Commercial Street—on 10th July, at 7.45, I saw my premises safe—I missed 65 skins next morning—these skins are mine, and were safe when I left—I found a large piece broken out of the fanlight next morning—it was cracked the previous night, but not perforated—the skins could be reached by placing an arm through.</p>

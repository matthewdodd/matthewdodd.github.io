             (policeman G 174). On the night of the 1st of September, I was in Whitecross-street about eight o'clock, crossing Chiswell-street, I saw nine or twelve persons standing opposite; Martin the officer was with me - on my coming there they ran away, and I saw the prisoner on his knees, and the prosecutor lying on his back on the ground, and the prisoner by the side of him on his knees - the mob which dispersed had separated from the spot leaving the prisoner in view; they had previously been round him - I saw the prisoner draw his right hand from Allen's left hand trousers pocket, and the pocket came out with his hand, turning it inside out - he ran off; I ran after him and lost him in the crowd - I took the prosecutor to the station-house - when we first raised him up he was quite senseless, but before I got him to the station-house he got better and could walk alone - I knew the prisoner well before, and can swear to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What can you swear to me by, did you ever know me in trouble? A. By seeing you so often- have not I frequently ordered you off, and threatened to take you before the magistrate? I have seen you at different times with a gang of thieves.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At the time the prisoner drew his hand from the prosecutor's pocket, was any other person about him? A. There was two, one of whom I could swear to if I met him - a portion of the crowd parted, leaving the prisoner with his hand in the prosecutor's pocket, and two others by the side of him, and they all three ran away - I swear the prisoner drew his hand from the prosecutor's pocket.</p>
               <p>JOHN ALLEN re-examined. When I stood at the bar of the Cat public-house, about fifty yards from the spot, I felt money in my pocket; I felt the silver in my pocket.</p>

             (policeman G 202). I was with Brooming. On the crowd dispersing, I saw the prisoner on the ground on his knees, and his hands very close to the prosecutor's pocket, which was turned inside out - I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and saw him about half an hour after at the corner of Banner-street; he appeared to be peeping round the corner as if on the lookout - I laid hold of him - he asked what I wanted of him- I said he knew very well - he said he had been in the fields all day; that was the first time he had been in Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down Banner-street with some pudding in my hand, and turned down Whitecross-street, and saw Martin and another officer with him; the other said, "Is this him" - he said "Yes" - I said,"What do you want with me" - he said, "Come to the station-house, and I will tell you" - but as to his catching hold of me it is false; it was not above a quarter past eight o'clock.</p>

            . The officer who was with me laid hold of him, because I thought if I had gone after him he would have ran away - I was rather behind the other man - he took hold of him and handed him to me - it was about half-past eight o'clock; he was eating pudding.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went with him to the station-house, and they said I had robbed Allen; I said I had never been there all day - I had been to Tottenham on the Sunday, and I had just come down Banner-street - I know nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>JOHN MARTIN. I swear he is the man who was kneeling by the prosecutor's side; I have not a doubt of it, I see him so many times every night, and have occasion to move him and a gang who follow with him - I cannot be mistaken in him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If I had been concerned, I should not have come down right into their hands - it is false that he saw me at the bottom of the street; ke knows he did not see me in Whitecross-street all day, for I was not there all day until the time he took me to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>JURY to JOHN ALLEN. Q. Where was your money? A. The silver was in my waistcoat pocket, and the coppers in my right hand trousers pocket; I lost every thing but 2s.</p>

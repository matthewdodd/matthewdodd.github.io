                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, of 5/5, Piccadilly—I formerly carried on business at Oxford—I knew the prisoner there thirty years ago, but lost sight of him till 23rd December, 1874, when I met him as I came out of a dining-house in the City—he was in deep mourning—he stopped me and said "Mr. Wells, how are you?"—I said "Very well, who are you in mourn<lb></lb>ing for?'—he said "My father-in-law, who has just died," and I think he said he had <hi rend="italic">cut up</hi> very well, and had left him 45,000?. which, after paying all demands, would realise 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. yearly, and he had also left him a legacy of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to reinstate the plate, and he said "I can give you a turn if you can do it"—I said that I thought I could—he said "By the way, I am a director of a company, and we want to give one of the directors a coffee-pot, a salver, and teapot, something that you can supply at once"—I was to send it to 4, Victoria Buildings, Queen Victoria Street—he sent a man to fetch it, but I said "No, I had rather deliver them myself"—he said that he was leaving by the train from London Bridge, and if it was not there then it would be too late for the presentation—I packed it into a bag and went to London Bridge Station and he came up to me and said "I have not a moment to spare, the train is off," and he took the tray from me and said "Take the coffee-pot to 29, Munster Street," and away he went through the gate—I took the tea and coffee pots to Munster Street about 9 o'clock that night—he had then come back and I saw him—those goods were of the value of 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I told Mr. Webb that Mr. Dawson's daughter and family had come into 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year. I was engaged to Mr. Dawson's daughter in 1849, and before our marriage he called me into his private room and said that he should divide his freehold property between his three daughters. Afterwards, in consequence of becoming security for over 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I became bankrupt, which caused my father-in-law to be very antagonistic to me, but I did not know that he had altered his will I admit saying that my family would have 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and so I expected. At the time I saw Wells I was manager of an association in Queen Victoria Street. I had formed various companies, such as the Inns of Court Hotel, Holborn, the Bedford Hotel, Brighton, and others, and it is my invariable practice when I meet with assistance from any gentleman, to present him with a piece of plate, and I required this plate for that purpose. I had invented a ship's screw, and went down to Birmingham to sell the patent, but was taken ill there, and prevented from doing so. I was also engaged in Dr. Hale's chlorate of potassium, a patent medicine, for which I was voted 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the expenses of the company, and though I admit being made bankrupt, I was in a position to pay 205. in the pound, and I never incurred a single debt without having the full intention of paying it, and I never defrauded a person of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my life. I totally deny having a female in my house, and defy Mr. Webb to prove it; it is the greatest lie ever stated.</p>

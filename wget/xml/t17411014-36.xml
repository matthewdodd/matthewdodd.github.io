            . When my brother and I had stolen Mr. Glyn's plate, we carried it home. The prisoner was then in bed, and I desired her to put it under the bed-clothes, for fear any body should come in.</p>
               <p>Council. Do you know any thing of these things coming to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Ramsey. The candlesticks, snuffers and stand I sold to Mr. Lee, and my brother desired her to sell the coffee-pot; and she took it out, and said she had sold it to Mr. Brown, on the other side of the water.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did she know it was stolen?</p>
               <p>Ramsey. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Counc. How did she know it was stolen?</p>
               <p>Ramsey. She knew we went out to steal, and we told her we stole these things from Mr. Glyn's. I took the coffee-pot with a design to sell it myself, but observing a man to go into the silver-smith's shop with advertisements, I was fearful of it, and so my brother desired her to sell it.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Was not I a servant in the family?</p>
               <p>Ramsey. No, she lived entirely with my brother. He kept her, and the money she gave to him to keep house with.</p>

            . My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury: I have known the prisoner 9 or 10 years, and to my certain knowledge she had a very good character. I have trusted her with what I had about me, and she might have done me a great deal of prejudice. She lived in very good reputation, only the worst misfortune was, that she had a bad husband.</p>
               <p>Counc. Is she a married woman?</p>
               <p>Pow. I don't say so.</p>
               <p>Council. Does she not live with somebody else?</p>
               <p>Pow. Not that I know of; such things might be talk'd or heard of, but I don't know it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. - Gray . I have known her 14 or 15 years, and never heard no ill of her. I never heard she was addicted to this. She always bore a good character to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Reynolds. I have known her these ten years, and she always bore a very good character for any thing I knew. I never heard that she was addicted to pilfering . She lived with Mrs. Gray three months, and since that time I can't tell where she lived.</p>

             . I have known her 14 or 15 years. I have trusted her in my house with quantities of money and goods, and never found but that she was particularly honest. I have seen her frequently, and never heard her character attainted in any publick station of life.</p>
               <p>Council. Where does she live?</p>
               <p>Wiseham . I may as well ask you where you live, for I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. - Pope. I have known the prisoner above 20 years; she always bore a good character 'till latterly, being with this bad man, Ramsey; and if she were at liberty, I would willingly take her into my family. <rs id="t17411014-36-verdict178" type="verdictDescription">

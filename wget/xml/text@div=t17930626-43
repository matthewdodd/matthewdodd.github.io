               <p>On the 5th of June, about eleven o'clock at night, I was coming down Brick-lane, into Whitechapel, and I met the prisoner and another woman, they came and spoke to me; I had seen them before, but never spoke to them before; the other woman that was along with her I went home with, I gave her six-pence for something to drink, after I gave her the six-pence I put the purse into my jacket pocket again; after she had gone down a few minutes this woman at the bar came into the room; I stood behind the door as she was coming in, she rushed her hand into my pocket, and took my purse, and ran down stairs, and I after her; my purse was in the left side of my jacket pocket; there was a very good light in the room; I went down below after I followed her, and went to the people in the next room, to lend me a light, to go backwards to see for her, as I was not certain whether she went backwards or forwards; they would not lend me one for about four minutes, so I never saw the prisoner till I see her at the office on Monday last; afterwards the young woman, that I went with, gave her oath at the justices, that Catharine<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260065"></xptr>Carter was along with her, and afterwards gave her oath that she never saw

             before. She is in New Prison for perjury.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was this? - A one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. As I understand you, when the other woman was gone for the liquor, this woman came and immediately snatched at your pocket; did she say any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she offer to take hold of you, or do any thing, or say any thing to you? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do or say to her? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave the other woman the six-pence, this woman was not there? - She was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she attempt any other pocket? - She did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came up in the room and took the purse, how long might she be in the room before she went out? - She went out that instant, it was done instantly; she was not there above a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the room was the candle in? - The candle stood behind me in the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been in that house before? - Never before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober? - I had part of a pint of beer, and a pint of ale.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you perfectly sober? - I was not perfectly sober, nor I was not drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you lose? - Ten guineas, two half guineas and the rest in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have so much money about you? - In my business; I went to pay a bill, and the man was not at home, and I meant to bring my money home again. I went but about eight o'clock,</p>
               <p>Q. That is a late hour to pay a bill? - No. I was very near home when I went with this woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suppose you was more safe because you was near home? - The first woman asked me to give her some beer; I said yes, and I gave her six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing on her when you took her up? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has false swore what he has said, this young man has taken up another girl and has had two hearings. - I took the other girl up first to tell where this girl was, because I supposed that she went down and told this girl which pocket the money was in.</p>
               <p>Court. What business are you? - I am a butcher.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This girl said that she thought I was the person; on that I was taken up the last Sunday night, when I came up on Wednesday before the justice, they asked the woman whether I was the person? she said she never saw me in her life time, she took her oath so to the justice; he knows nothing of me no more than what he goes by hearing; I never saw the man in my life time till I saw him last Monday. I am a misfortunate woman.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had seen the prisoner before that time in the street.</p>

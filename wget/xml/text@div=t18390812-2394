                  </hi>. I live in Unicorn-yard, Tooley-street. The pri<lb></lb>soner lived with me for seven years, off and on—he lived with me when he was sent to prison in July, 1838, for assaulting me and Kinsey, the officer—he came out of prison on the 5th of July last, and came to my house that night—I had a constable taking care of my house at the time, as I was away—on the 29th I was at my front-door, near upon two o'clock is the morning—I did not see the prisoner myself—he was in the next house—he got on the wash-house, and came over from the next house—when I went in doors I found him sitting down on a chair near the door—I said nothing to him, but he called me abusive names, caught hold of me by the throst, and tried to strangle me—he made a mark on my throat with holding it, and he struck me violently and knocked me down—I have marks of his violence now on my face and neck—I called out, "Murder" and "Police"—my son opened the door—he is nine years old—Jennings, the police<lb></lb>man, came in and caught hold of the prisoner—he got him away, and I got up stairs—I heard a great scuffle between them down stairs after I got up—I came down directly and s'aw them outside, both lying down in the kennel struggling together—I saw Mrs. Morgan pick up this knife about the spot where they were on the ground—I had seen it in the prisoner's possession before, and know it is his knife—Jennings's face was covered with blood.</p>

                  </hi>.(<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 59.) About two o'clock in the morning of the 30th of July, I was coming up Vine-yard, Tooley-street, and heard the cry of "Murder" and "Police"—I went into Unicorn-yard, where the cry came from—I heard screams inside the house, No. 1, and knocked at the door—it was not opened directly—I said if it was not opened I should break it open, and in half a second a little boy opened it—I went in and saw the prosecutrix on her back, and the prisoner with his left hand on her throat—he had something in his right hand, what it was I could not tell—I told him that would not do for me—knowing him well, I</p>

               <p>said, "I shall take you out of this;" and took him out of the house—he said, "I want my pipe, I shall go in"—I said, "You shall not go in again"—he said, "I will let you know," (with a very heavy oath)—"that I will go in"—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Bill,</hi> you shall not go in"—he said, "Then, bl—y <hi rend="italic">Itty,</hi> by G—you shall have a bit of this, before you shall take me" which was a knife he had in his right hand—we then scuffled together—I threw him, and I was upwards—while he was on the ground he drew the knife right across my face, which you can see the scars of—he stab<lb></lb>bed or cut roe right through the nose, and cut me from the ear right to the nose—there are four distinct marks in my face from the ear to my throat—it was intended as one cut, but the hair of my whisker checked it, and it made four marks, and afterwards he cut me right through the nostril—I sprang my rattle two or three times—Murray came up to my assistance while I was holding him—the prisoner knew I was an officer—I had not drank with the woman at all that night—the prisoner had come out of prison on the 6th of July.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

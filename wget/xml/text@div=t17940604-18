               <p>Q. When had you last seen it? - I cannot tell, they were constantly in the house, and about the house, it was marked with my own name at full length, I have got one of the same here; I found it broke to pieces, it was brought to me by Mr. Norman about nine or ten o'clock in the morning of the same day, the 22d of May.</p>

               <p>I live in High Holborn, I am a silversmith and jeweller, I have got the fork in question, about nine o'clock on Thursday the 22d of May the prisoner came to dispose of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in this state when he brought it in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the name distinguishable on it? - I see the name on it, and I suspected him from that; my son was in the shop and a maid servant when he came in, and he gave her the fork, she came up to me, and says, sir, here is some old silver brought to sell; I looked at it, says I, it is stole; and I came down and says to the prisoner, you have stole this; no, says he, I have not; says I, how did you come by it? and at last he said, the dustmen had been at their house, and he found it in a chimney corner. I asked him where he lived? he said, at the Crown in Charing Cross, and his master's name was Smith, I told him it was very proper for me to go down with him to his master; he said very well, but he had had a letter that his mother was very ill, and he could not get out any other time; says he, you can keep the fork, and I will call as I come back Says I, that will not do, and at last he agreed to go, I took him down Drury-lane, and he walked down very quietly, and when we came near to the office I said, you had better settle the business here; he seemed disposed to go towards Charing Cross; I took hold of his collar and told him he had better go quietly, and I took him into the Brown Bear, and put him into an officer's hands, and he acknowledged where he did live; he said, he lived at Mr. Holyland's. in the Strand, and I went down to Mr. Holyland's and asked him if he had lost any thing? and shewed him the fork, and he brought me five more directly out of the drawer that matched them. The name is attempted to be seratched out, but it matches the other forks exactly; and we had him before the justice, and is the evening he was committed.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my fork; it is the same as Mr. Holyland produced; the prisoner at the bar was a servant of mine, he came to me the 23d of April last.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character.</p>

            . On the 17th of January, I met the prisoner with a cake of copper on his back; I asked him what he had got. He said, it was no business of mine. I told him, I was an officer, and it was my business. He said, I should not see it. He threw it into Aldgate-church-yard. I seized hold of him. I got the copper out. I asked him, how he came by it. He said he could not tell. I asked him, what he was going to do with it. He said, he did not know. He said, he wished I would shoot him. I told him, I had no authority to do that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any other pieces - A. No. This is the piece.</p>
               <p>Bendell. That is my master's copper. This is the only piece that is found.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. He had a constant situation at Preston's lead manufactory. He worked there about eight or nine months, but not for the last seven years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The copper I found under some pales. I knew no more of stealing the copper than a new born babe.</p>

On 12th Jan., between four and five in the afternoon, I missed a tent furniture, which I had seen safe on the drawers at ten in the morning—I went to Mr. Davis's, and they produced it to me—this is it—I am positive this was not sold—I was in the shop nearly the whole day, except going to my dinner for about a quarter of an hour, and such a thing as this would have been mentioned to me.</p>

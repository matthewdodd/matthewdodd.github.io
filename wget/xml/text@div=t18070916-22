             said I am not far from home, I will not stay any longer, being a poor old woman I am not afraid of any body hurting me; she left our company. These three men stood a little while arguing with us; they left us and followed her; we thought they were upon no good; we set off after them. Just before we got in sight we heard

We ran after him; we left her and the two Irishmen; there she was lying on the ground; we ran about three hundred yards and catched him as he was getting over a hedge; he cried murder, and said if we would let him go he would shew us where the bundle was; we said we would; he shewed us where the bundle was.</p>

             said she would go home, she had but a little way to go, being a poor old woman no body would meddle with her; we went away, and we said it was not safe for the woman to go by herself. We followed her, we saw them run and we run after them; we heard the old woman crying murder just as we got in sight of her; we saw her lying on her back, O'Brien astride of her, and the other two, men of the side of her; she cried, oh! he has robbed me, he has got my property; just before we got to him he run from her; his companions stood about twenty yards off. He ran away, and we followed him about three hundred yards; then we stopped him; he began crying murder, and said we were robbing him.

            . I am a constable of Hammersmith. The prisoner was delivered into my custody by the three witnesses on the 25th of July; it was one o'clock when they brought him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was the 26th of July. - A. Yes. This handkerchief and three pound of beef was delivered to me. I kept the handkerchief and Davey had the beef.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (read in court). My lord, and gentlemen of the jury - on Saturday night the 25th of July, between twelve and one o'clock; after leaving the pay table and drinking pretty freely, I drank with two women and two men; the prosecutrix was drinking with us; we passed some jokes together. When we came out I took the prosecutrix by the arm, thinking by the liberties she let me take I might. She left her companions, I gave her a shilling; when she was out of sight of her companions she consented to let me have connexion with her; she was very much intoxicated in liquor, and when she saw her companions coming she cried out. At the time she took my shilling she threw the bundle behind the dunghill; her companions came up and swore I had taken the bundle; they found the bundle behind the dunghill, where the prosecutrix throwed it. I hope you will take my case into your humane consideration, as my prosecutrix intends taking my life if she can by false swearing, for the sake of the reward. I had no intention of taking the bundle from her.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Are you are a married woman. - A. No.</p>

            . I am a clothes-salesman, and live in Park-lane; the prisoner brought me six duplicates. I bought them of him - he wanted me to lend money on them. I refused; he said, if I would buy them, and keep them until to-morrow night, when he was to come and buy them of me; he did not come, and I sent my son with five of the duplicates to redeem the goods.</p>

I received a parcel from the country, at their house; she sent for me to come, and upon opening it, I found there was 12 s.; she said if they were sovereigns, it would be all right. I offered her 7 s. of it - and said, I would redeem the things with the other 5 s.; but she gave me in charge.</p>

             was a boy to attend him; I had a clerk named Rodgers, who came to keep my books.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it happen that your memory is generally treacherous about accounts? A. I cannot say I never make a mistake; I received some money from Mr. Brown, of Seymour-street, a fortnight or a month before the prisoner left - I think it was 6s. and 4s.; it was under 15s. - I did not charge the prisoner with embezzling that; I asked him why he had not paid me 6s. from Brown, (as he represented him as a friend of his keeping a private house) it was a trifling sum and I did not wish to have it on my books; I asked him for it and he brought it -I do not know whether I entered it at the moment, but I did enter it; I never asked him for it after I had received it - on the Saturday night I asked him for the money; in balancing the account it might have been paid, and not put down, then as I balance every Saturday I might have said I had not had it, till it was recollected on balancing the account - I received 6l. from Mr. Good; I never charged him with not having paid that after I received it - the cash is balanced every Saturday, and if there is any error it is settled in balancing; I might ask my young men on Saturday if they had received such a sum, and if so I have put it down - I mean that in the hurry of business in the course of seven years I may have omitted to have put a sum down; it may happen five or six times in the course of a year, but the prisoner was never charged with keeping it to himself - if money is not put down at the moment, the balance on Saturday sets it right.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not repeatedly happened that you had a larger balance of cash than you could account for? A. Not repeatedly, it has always been settled; I occasion<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270036"></xptr>ally preach at Woolwich - (refers to a cash-book) Brown's name would not be entered in my book, as it was so trifling a sum; I had a sum of 10s. for two accounts of 6s. and 4s. between the 1st and 20th of March, but cannot say on what day, as these small accounts are not entered in separate lines, and have no names to them - I received the 6l. from Good on the 15th of April, that was entered within a week of its being received, because it could not go over the Saturday; Good had an account with me, and it is entered in his name - if it was not entered directly, it was entered next day at the furthest - it is my writing; the impression of my mind is that it was entered at the instant - I remember four years ago a piece of Irish being sold, and I never knew it for three months after, when it was paid for; I might have sold it myself -I did not charge my men with applying that to their own purpose; Bates might have reminded me of receiving the 10s. from Brown, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any means of knowing whether money was accounted for by your clerks, except finding on Saturday more money than the book shewed, and your asking your clerks to make out the difference? A. There is no other way in such a case.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When were you applied to for the money? A. About six weeks after the prisoner had left them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HAMPER. I am a constable. On the 4th of May Mr. Sibley gave the prisoner into my charge at his warehouse, and charged him with embezzling money to a great amount; he did not say what - the prisoner said nothing; I found 3l. 2s. on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was no specific charge? A. It was for embezzling at various times to a very large amount; no name was mentioned - Sibley said he had not had time to get up evidence, as he had unexpectedly met him in the street.</p>
               <p>MR. SIBLEY. The 2l. from Hamper has never been accounted for - it stands in my book against him now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Point out the entry? A. Here it is in Rogers', the clerk's, writing; he is not here - it was not Rogers' place to receive money - he is a clerk in the India-house, and comes to make up my books; the goods are entered in the prisoner's memorandum-book in his own hand as sold, and he had put in here"cash;" I found this book the day after he left; it has never been paid to me - I dismissed him from my employ on suspicion of robbing to a great extent; I never looked into this book till after he left - I had only seen it in his hand before; I made this charge before the Magistrate - he did not say he had paid it; he said nothing - I have known him ten years; I took him with an honest character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it his duty to account for this sum before the 15th of April? A. He should have paid it the day he received it; the money, as it is brought to me, is entered in the cash-book - I post it from that to the ledger; I swear I have not received it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I conceive my innocence is very palpable, and it is useless for me to make the slightest observation - the money I received I always paid to Sibley; payments were frequently made to him and not entered in the cash account.</p>

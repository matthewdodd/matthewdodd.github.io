               <p>EDWARD EPSOM. On Thursday morning, about seven o'clock, I found the prosecutrix's door open, and alarmed her. I took the prisoner into custody next day.</p>
               <p>JAMES ADKINS. On the 12th of February, at six o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought me a handkerchief. I lent him 2s. on it.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEONARD. On the 12th of February about four o'clock in the morning, I was going to work; coming down Great Church-lane, about fifteen yards from the prosecutrix's house, I saw two men standing at the prosecutrix's kitchen door; as soon as they saw me, they took up something, and ran away. They ran down Rose and Crown-lane - I followed; they turned into another lane; I waited at the corner. I heard one of them throw something away - I went to the Rose and Crown, in King-street, and heard two men coming behind me, in the same direction as the two men; they came out of the same lane, on the left-hand side. When they got near me one of them crossed over to the right, and came close to me it was the prisoner. His brother was on the other side, with something on his back. I believe them to be the same persons I saw at the door.</p>

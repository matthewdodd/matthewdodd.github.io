                  </hi>. I am a mariner, and was residing in Colchestef about three years ago. About two years ago I was an apprentice on board the <hi rend="italic">Essex Lass</hi>, Mr. Robert Turpin's vessel—we left Colchester for Amsterdam, and then went from Amsterdam to the Mediterranean—I do not remember about what time it was that we left Zante, but some time after we left Zante we got near a place called Faro on the coast of Spain—one morning, about half past 8 o'clock, I was standing at the helm, and saw the captain take an sugar out of the locker, with which he bored some holes through the ship's side, under his bed <hi rend="italic">bunk</hi>—I should think that would be below water mark—it went through the skin and the lining—I said nothing to the captain of it at the time; I remained at the helm till 10 o'clock—the watch was called at 12 o'clock, and I then made a statement to the rest of the crew—in the ordinary course of business the watch would be again called at 4 o'clock—the well was sounded at the 4 o'clock watch, and there was five feet of water in it—the pumps were then set going; we worked them from 4 o'clock till 12 o'clock at night—the captain then said it was of no use pumping any longer—we had pumped all that time, but the water still gained on us (I cannot tell whether it was spring, summer, autumn, or winter)—at daylight in the morning the captain said we were to get the boats out—there was a boat there called the <hi rend="italic">dingy</hi>, which was alongside in the water; I got into it, and so did the captain—he had an adze in his hand, which I saw him go and get out of the cabin five or ten minutes before; he cut the starboard port out with it—we then went round the ship's stern and cut the larboard port out—those ports might be about a foot long—they are for the purpose of taking in ballast—the lowest part of the port was at that time about ten inches from the level of the water—supposing the vessel to be sunk down to the level of where the ports were cut out, the water would run in like a sluice and sink her—at the time the ports were cut open, I observed a schooner about thirteen or fourteen miles off, and there were some smacks from the shore about the length of this room from us; they were coming off to us—we were twelve or thirteen miles from the shore at that time—with the leakage the vessel was making when the ports were cut out, she could have reached the shore at the rate she was making—the crew consisted of Joseph Turpin the mate, who was a relation of the owner, Benjamin Munson, Philip Erle, Robert Howard, William Cooper, myself, and the captain—about nine or ten months back I saw the captain at Sunderland—he came and asked me, "What ship?"—I did not tell him—he said he hoped I should not say anything about cutting the ports of the <hi rend="italic">Essex Lass</hi> out, or else he should get transported for life.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time this happened, how many knots were you making? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None at all, only just knocking about—I was standing at the helm, and my duty was to keep a look out and to steer—I saw these holes bored by the captain through a skylight; the skylight hatch was off, and I could see down into the cabin and all over the cabin—the skylight was behind me, but I happened to turn my head at the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310070"></xptr>
               <p>time, and that gave me the opportunity of seeing it—I did not take my eyes off until it was done—I did not think it necessary to look ahead; while the captain was sinking the vessel it was not much use steering—we were in tolerably deep water—I do not know whether the vessel has ever been got up—I cannot swim much—we should all have got drowned if it had not been for the boats, yet I said nothing to anybody from half past 8 till 10 o'clock—I do not think it a pleasant thing to be drowned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But when a man is knocking a hole in a ship whichyouare in, and you are not able to swim, is it not worth while to speak? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She would be a long while sinking if he had not cut the ports out—I did not interfere, because I was afraid; I did speak of it when the watch was called—I did not leave the tiller up to 10 o'clock—during that time the captain was boring the holes in the vessel—I spoke when the watch was called; I cannot give you a reason for my not speaking at half past 8 o'clock—the other men were off the deck—I spoke about it at 12 o'clock—all the damage was not done then—the holes were bored then—it was a copper bottomed vessel—it went through her side—he might go through the copper too; he must—he made three holes—I was able to count, and can swear to three that went through the ship's side, through the woodwork and through the copper, I standing all the while and saying nothing to anybody until 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You went away from the tiller at 10 o'clock, and you must have seen that the water was coming in; would it not have been worth while to mention it at 10 o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not see the water coming in, it ran between the outside skin and the lining—I did not hear it, but I was sure it was running in—I spoke about it to all hands on deck—<hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Munson succeeded me at the tiller; I might have mentioned it to him, but I do not recollect it if I did; I will not swear to it—there was only him and me on deck—I cannot swear whether I mentioned it to him—the watch on deck at the time were me and <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Munson, the boy, whose name is William Cooper, and the mate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why, if you saw the captain do this, did not you call somebody's attention to it at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I spoke about it at 12 o'clock, and I might have spoken of it at 10 o'clock, for what I know of; it is a long time back—it was 4 o'clock when the pumps were called, not 12 o'clock—if I told the men at 12 o'clock, none of them said anything to the captain—though I told the ship's crew at 12 o'clock, we did not say anything to the captain, or work the pumps—the auger might be half an inch broad, a foot and a half long, and about half an inch at the point; it was bigger than a man's finger—he bored with it—he went down on his knees, and went working away at it as if this was the handle; he bored it so (<hi rend="italic">imitating the action</hi>)—when he had got well through one hole he made another, I looking all the while, and not saying a word to anybody—he might be better than a quarter of an hour at this work—I had been in the cabin before; there was a table in it, and there were two or three cupboards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a cupboard in which the captain kept Hollands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was in the locker—I got into the <hi rend="italic">dingy</hi> first, and the captain followed—it was not an axe that the captain had, but an adze such as carpenters use, made of iron and steel—it was square, with a handle about two feet long, and an iron blade at the end, such as you cut with; he used it with two hands, chopping—I had seen it before, but never used it—I did not chop the port holes of bore a hole; the captain did it—I am quite sure it was not myself—I have nothing to do with it; I only got into the boat—I mean to swear, on my solemn oath before God, that I had nothing to do with taking out the ports</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310071"></xptr>
               <p>—the <hi rend="italic">dingy</hi> is a small boat—the captain was in it, nobody else—he stood up in it, and chopped the starboard port out with both hands—the boat did not keep steady; I had to hold on by a rope from the ship while he chopped—that was for the purpose of having the port chopped out—I was obliged to do as I was ordered, and I held the boat on and the ports were chopped out—I held the boat for that purpose, and then did the same thing to the larboard—it was not long coming out—he used the adze with both hands, the crew looking on—I cannot tell you what time of year it was—I made no complaint till very lately, but it has been mentioned plenty of times—I first embarked on board the vessel at Wavenhoe—I was an apprentice to Mr. Turpin, the owner—I recollect the vessel being at Hamburg; that was before this affair—I cannot tell how long before—I cannot tell whether it was a year before; it might be three years before, but I cannot say—I cannot say whether it was one.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did your apprenticeship begin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell, but she has been lost two years last Christmas; it was just after Christmas that she was lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long, before the vessel was lost, were you at Hamburg? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had only been one voyage; I was an apprentice while we were lying at Hamburg—Mr. Wilson was the captain then, not the same man; I do not know whether it was his brother—I do not remember doing anything to the captain's cabin then; I am sure about that—the prisoner was mate at that time—I do not recollect charging the mate with breaking into the captain's cabin, and stealing some Holland—he never knocked me down—he struck me at Hamburg, because he said I had been and broke into the cabin; I said I had not been in—I did not say he had been into the cabin—he did not knock me down, he hit me; he did not make me bleed, or give me a black eye—he hit me somewhere in the head—I did not their say I would be revenged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Be cautious; did you say you would go on shore and be revenged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not say I would have him taken into custody, on my solemn oath—I did not say I would pay him out—I might be angry when he struck me; if I said anything I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, if you cannot remember whether you did or not, will you swear you did not say you would be revenged on Wilson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I did, it is a long bit back, and I do not remember it—I cannot tell how long it was before the vessel sank, that Wilson struck me—he afterwards became my captain, and Isailed with him—I recollect, while in the same employment, being on board the <hi rend="italic">Ocean Queen</hi>—I brought some women on board that vessel—(it was after this ship was lost)—she was lying at home at the time I brought the girls on board—I did not get drunk—I was not charged with getting drunk—I brought my brother on board too—I left the ship without permission; I walked away, taking my indentures and ticket; I got them through the mate giving me the keys of the cabin; I did not tell him what I wanted them for; he had no business to give them to me—I got them that I might get my register ticket and indentures—the crew did not say their berths had been robbed; there was only one robbed of a coat, and there was a London man taken for that—he was not one of my companions—I was accused of it, but there was one who knew better than that—I do not know that there were a great quantity of things taken, and returned on the following day by my brother; he brought back nothing at all to my knowledge—nothing was brought back—I never joined the <hi rend="italic">Ocean Queen</hi> again—I did not run away; I was about home—I went away—that is twelve months ago; I have not</p>

               <p>been in England ever since that; I have a good deal, and in the neighbourhood of Colchester—I did not apply to Mr. Turpin to engage me again, or to anybody to be engaged on board Mr. Turpin's vessel at any time, never since—the <hi rend="italic">Essex Lass</hi> was not heavily laden; it was currants—there was ten inches from the water to the ports, and the ports were about a foot each way—the captain cut away the ports standing in the <hi rend="italic">dingy.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I was an ordinary seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Essex Lass</hi>; it was my first voyage to sea. Cudmore was an apprentice on board—he is four years older than me—I recollect taking in a cargo of currants at Zante; we sailed homewards, and came out of the Gut of Gibraltar—I remember coming to Faro—when we were at some distance from Faro the vessel was in a leaky state—I cannot say whether the pumps were sounded; I was in bed—I remember the vessel going down; the pumps had been worked the night before that—(the prisoner used to do the carpenter's work on board)—we pumped from 4 o'clock in the afternoon till between 12 and 2 o'clock in the morning, but the water gained on us—I had no orders given to find out where the leak was, but I went without orders—the pumps were going because she bad the water in her—we knew the water was in her, otherwise we could not have got any out—I went all forwards wherever I had anything to do with the vessel; I might not go aft without the permission of the captain—we pumped till between 12 and 2 o'clock; we left off by orders from the captain—I stowed the flying gib myself; that sail was no good to the vessel at all, even if it was set; the vessel was going before the wind, what little wind there was, and that would do her no good at all; the wind was aft at that time—the boats were got out about six o'clock in the morning—there was a boat called the <hi rend="italic">dingy</hi> there—I cannot say who was in her, if any one—I saw no one in her until we left the ship, and then Cudmore was in her; he might have been in her before, but I did not see him—there was a larboard and a starboard port—I saw the captain cut the larboard port out that morning with an adze, and when we left the vessel I saw that the starboard port was out; I did not see who did that—the captain was on deck when he cut the larboard port out; I saw him on deck when he cut it out—the vessel was not afloat more than five minutes after we left her—I saw the water running in on both sides into the ports.</p>

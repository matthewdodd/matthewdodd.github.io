                  </hi>. I am an engraver, and live at 47, Holywell-street, Strand. On 10th Jan. the prisoner Grimaldi came to my house in the middle of the day—he rang my bell—I went down to him—he asked me at the door whether I could engrave a medal die—he spoke broken English, that it was rather difficult to understand—he showed me a medal, which from the glance I had of it I thought was a foreign coin—he followed me up stairs into my workshop—he produced a half sovereign—I took it up and examined it—I found it was bad—he stated that he wished me to engrave the reverse side of that, pointing to the half sovereign in his hand—I said I could do it—he wanted the milled edge done—I said "That is a bad half sovereign"—he produced another half sovereign, saying that the edge was better on that—that was a good one—I said I could do the edge—I asked him what he wished to have the half sovereign engraved for, and he said it was for an exhibition in Italy—it was to be done in twelve days—I said I should want 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the engraving—he said he would give me 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I agreed to do it for that sum—I did not know his name at that time—I asked him his name and address, and he said it was no consequence, he would call for it in twelve days—he did not give any card, or name, or address at that time—he left the half sovereign with me as a deposit—after he had gone, I made a communi<lb></lb>cation to Bow-street office—on 14th Jan. Grimaldi called again, to know how I was progressing—he did not see it—the die was in progress—he came again on 14th Feb., between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening—I saw him—he said he had got lots of work for me—I had the die in my workshop—I showed it him—he took it in his hand—he did not like it in the first instance—he looked at it, examined it, and seemed very much hurt that it was not done better, but I stated it was not finished, at which he seemed pleased, and he wanted to know when it would be done—at the time he examined it he had a half sovereign in his hand, not the one he had left with me, but one he took from his pocket—at the time he was looking at the die he was looking at the half sovereign—I said it would be completed on the Monday following—he said he had lots of work for me—he held up his hand in this way (<hi rend="italic">with the fingers extended</hi>) meaning, as I understood, that he wanted five dies—the side I was doing on that occasion was the reverse side of the half sovereign, and he said he wanted me to do the head part—he took the half sovereign from his pocket, and pointed to the head part—I pointed to the head, and he said, "Yes, yes, yes!" nothing was said on that occasion about the cost of the head part—he called again on Monday, the 23rd—I had the die all ready for him—I sent my brother down stairs to open the door for him—he came into my room—I showed him the die—he seemed very much pleased with it—I had a white wax impression taken of it, which he examined, and seemed very much pleased—he looked at the rim of the die, and compared it with the half sovereign he had—he wanted to know what the expense was—I made out the amount—the amount for the die and the rim was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he made some difficulty about that—he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were left to be paid—he gave me an address and name, and took away the die—but before that he wanted to know what would be the expense of the head part—I told him that would come to a great deal more than the other part, being more difficult—he asked how much—I told him three guineas and a half—he made a great demur about that, and thought it a great deal of money—this is the die and collar that he took away on 23rd Feb.—I wrapped it in a paper, and</p>

I saw the prisoner Grimaldi in the private door of No. 47—he left, and I followed him to the bottom of Holywell-street, to Picket-street, where he joined the other prisoner, who was waiting at the bottom—when they joined, I saw Grimaldi pass a small paper parcel to Le Guardia—I could not see where Le Guardia placed it, because he had a large cloak on—they separated, and went the same way, up Clement's-lane, and then separated, one went up Exeter-street, the other, the other way—I sent an officer after Le Guardia, and I took Grimaldi—I told him I was an officer—he said, "Me no compre<lb></lb>hend"—I took him to Bow-street—Le Guardia was there about half a minute before Grimaldi got in—I searched Le Guardia—he dropped the paper which contained this die and collar—I showed Le Guardia the die—he shook his head—I found a pocket-book on Grimaldi—I had been watching the house in Holywell-street nearly six weeks—I had seen Le Guardia on llth Feb. at the bottom of Holywell-street, within a few doors of No. 47—I saw Grimaldi at No. 47 at the same time—I saw the prisoners in company that day—after Grimaldi had left 47, Holywell-street, they walked in com<lb></lb>pany together as far as Southampton-street, Strand—they there separated, and I followed Grimaldi to the house he lived in.</p>

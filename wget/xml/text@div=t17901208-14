               <p>I am the hostler: a little after five on the twenty-second of November; I had been on a message, it was very dark, and a rainy evening; I went into the stable to pull off my coat; coming out, I saw a man stand at the parlour window; I thought it was an acquaintance; I waited at the stable door, directly opposite, about five yards off the place; by and by he opened the window and leaned in; the windows were about the heighth of his breeches waistband; I could see by the light of the kitchen window, he did not find any thing, he came out again, pulled the window very gently down, went to the other window and lifted that up, then he likewise stooped himself down to the parlour, and felt about there to the right hand, where were the books on the bureau; by and by, he seemed surprized at some body<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080023"></xptr>in the kitchen, he came out again, and couched under the window about a second, then he whipped up at the window, and pulled down the window almost a hand's breadth, and couched under the window, then rose up again, and run off; I caught him; I found nothing upon him; the maid went into the parlour to see if there was any thing gone, with a candle, she said nothing was missing, the prisoner was taken before Justice Addington, he was committed.</p>

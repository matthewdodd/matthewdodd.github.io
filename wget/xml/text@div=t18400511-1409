                  </hi>. I am the son of John Johnson, a corn-dealer in William-street, Knightsbridge—he has a granary there—he does business in Thames-street—Crooks was in his service for three or four years, and Whiffen one year—they were carmen—they came at five o'clock in the morning—it was the custom to give orders to Crooks in the evening—I was present on the 9th of April, when my father gave him directions—there had been corn lost from the granary—I stationed myself, on the 10th of April, in the morning, in the lower granary—the corn was in the granary over my head—the prisoners both came about four o'clock—I was at the back of the hay, concealed—I could not see them come in, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184005110067"></xptr>
               <p>I heard some one, and knew Crooks by a particular cough that he had—I then heard them go up stairs to an upper floor—I got on the top of the hay, and heard them up stairs for nearly a quarter of an hour—I heard them scuffling and stamping, and, as I imagined, dragging the sacks along the floor—I then saw Crooks come down the ladder, and go out into the yard—the sacks are lowered from the upper floor out of the window, by the hands—I saw four sacks descend, one after the other—I could not see who put them down, but I saw Crooks receive them, take them on his shoulder, and pitch them down in a cart—Whiffen then came down the ladder very cautiously indeed, and went out into the yard, and shut the granary door after him—I waited a little, and then went and spoke with my father—he got up and came down—I went out into the street, to stay a good way off, as I intended to follow the cart, and then I heard a noise of a cart, and thought they were gone—when I got out I met a policeman—I sent him to the yard—soon after that I saw my father, and saw Crooks running away across the road—the policeman followed him—Whiffen was there, and my father held his collar—I then came into the road where the cart stood—I examined it—there were four sacks in it full of oats laid n the bottom, carefully covered with the tarpaulin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor—the prisoners were in my employ. On the 9th of April I gave Crooks some directions on paper what he was to do the next morning—this is the order—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—" Mr. Richardson, Please receive ten quarters of foreign oats and ten of Scotch oats." He and old <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> had to go to a wharf to load these oats—Whiffen had no business to attend Crooks that morning—his duty was to cart corn in our neighbourhood—he had a horse and cart for that purpose quite distinct from Crooks—it was kept in the yard at Knightsbridge, and Crooks's were kept in Williams's mews—neither of them had any direction to take any corn from my premises the next morning—Crooks would have to take sacks—on the morning of the 10th I was awoke by my son—he told me something, and I came down—I went into the yard when I found Crooks had got his horse from Williams's mews, and placed it in the cart—he was about to go out of the yard, and Whiffen was standing there doing nothing—the gates were open—my son was with me—he did not go into the yard—I let him out at my private door—I said to Crooks, "I think I am up a little before my time, but I see you are going to start earlier, as it was my wish"—he said, "Yes, but I have not got my sacks"—I said, "You had better put them in"—he then put in about twenty empty sacks—I had observed nothing in the cart at that time—he did not tell me he bad anything—he then shuffled about and said, "Oh, master, I have lost my notice, I have lost my order"—he drew his cart out into the middle of the road, while I went, as he supposed, to write fresh orders—with that a policeman came up, and spoke to me—I seized Whiffin and told the policeman to seize Crooks—Crooks immediately dropped his whip, and ran as fast as he could up a court, and over the park wall, and the policeman after him—he returned in about a quarter of an hour, bringing Crooks back in custody—during that time I kept Whiffen—I searched the cart, and four sacks of oats were found in it, covered over very carefully with a tarpaulin—they were worth from 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had not desired Crooks to start earlier than usual that morning—we wished him to start</p>

               <p>about half-past five o'clock—neither of the prisoners would have authority to take that quantity of oats from my granary—the first thing they had to do was to deliver twenty quarters of corn from Wheat Sheaf wharf.</p>

Howe said, "You know me, and Mr. Smith knows me, I am well known in your neighbourhood "—I said, "Very likely "—I said, "I am not going to lose my recognizance," but I did not say that I believed Whiffen to be an honest man, nor any thing of the kind.</p>

Clarke and Woodham were there. While I was walking about (I was a little fresh, but not drunk; they were quite strangers) they asked me to give them some drink - I gave them some liquor at the bar. I put my jacket and waistcoat on a cask by the bar, and walked about without them; I missed the clothes - the women were then gone; this was between half and three quarters of an hour afterwards. I went into Holborn, and told an officer; they were taken very soon afterwards, with the things - they were brought into the watch-house; I only remember Woodham and Clarke; I saw my jacket and waistcoat at the watch-house next day, and knew them; I am sure they are the women who were at the public-house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner WOODHAM. He took me out of the market into the public-house, to drink. PROSECUTOR. I did not - they did not go in with me; I think they must have been in before me; I cannot swear they did not go in at the same time with me. I did not speak to either of them in the market; I did not know Woodham before - I never spoke to her before.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Mansion House. On the 11th of July, a little after five o'clock, I saw Large, who said he had been robbed of some money, a knife, a jacket, and a waistcoat - that he had been drinking with some women at the Key, in Fleet-market; he was far from being sober; I went to a house in Fleet-lane, and saw Paine and Clarke; Paine had the jacket and waistcoat in her possession; I asked where she got them - she said she had them that afternoon from a woman, who told her they belonged to her husband, who was dead - I said,"Where?" she said, "At the Key, in Fleet-market;" I took them to the watch-house; Large said the clothes were his; he said nothing about the women; I then went to the Key, and found nobody there. I then went to the watch-house, and told Paine the woman was not there; I took Paine to her lodgings in Parker's-rents, and found Woodham in bed there - she denied the charge; I took her to the watch-house; Large was there, and said she was one of the women, but he did not speak to either of the others; Paine said to Woodham, "Ought not you to be ashamed of yourself for getting an innocent woman into trouble; Large did not identify Clarke till next day, at Guildhall. Woodham had been drinking.</p>

               <p>WOODHAM's Defence. When I met him he had not a farthing in his pocket - I have known him many years; he used to come backwards and forwards to me in Peter-street - he had been treating some girls; I went into the Key, and treated him with two quarterns and a half of gin; he put down these things, and told me to take them and make what I could of them; I was quite tipsy when I took them - he had been fighting in Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>PAINE's Defence. I was at home and in bed; I had laid down after dinner, and these things were brought to me - I was to pawn or sell them. I thought they looked too old to pledge; I tried them, and nobody would take them in - I offered them for sale in Fleet-lane, believing them to have belonged to Woodham's deceased husband; a man gave me 1s. 6d. for them, saying he would return them in half an hour; I went to Woodham, who said she must have more; I went and was stopped, as they were stolen; the first time I saw the man, was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>CLARKE's Defence. I met him talking to Woodham; they went away together - I saw nothing more.</p>

On the 8th of July, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I saw these four oxen safe in that field; and about seven on Monday morning, the 9th, in consequence of what my man said, I went into the field, and missed them; they were all black bullocks; one had his old coat on, and a white ring round his tail at the bottom; another had his right flank white - another had a white streak along his back, from head to tail, a white tail, and a grey star in his forehead, and a piece<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250004"></xptr>chipped off the point of his right horn; the other had a brown muzzle. On Tuesday morning, the 10th, between six and seven o'clock, I saw two skins at Leadenhall-market; they were then marked F. on the nose. I saw the other two hides in a slaughter-house in Newport-market the same day - it was a common slaughter-house - they were marked D. on the nose.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What makes you recollect that it was on the 8th you saw them safe? A. Because I was in the field; I had more than thirty-two head of cattle, but only these four were in that field; I had sold no beast that year; they were not fit for sale. People pay a commission to kill at this slaughter-house.</p>
               <p>JOHN FRENCH. I am in partnership with Mr. Whaller. I saw two of the hides at Leadenhall-market on Tuesday, the 10th of July, and knew them; we had no private mark on them; I knew them by the colours, and the natural marks; there was F cut on the nose; on the same day I found the two others in a slaughter-house in Newport-market, marked D. on the nose. I have no doubt of their being the hides of our bullocks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you take an active part in the business? A. I attend the market - we bought thirty-two in one lot; I was present when they were bought - Mr. Whaller looks after them generally. If they had been sent to market I should have marked them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were these four part of the lot of thirty-two? A. Yes. I saw them three or four times a week?</p>

            . I assist at the toll-gate on the Iron-bridge, at the beginning of the Plaistow-road. I sat up on Sunday night, the 8th of July, and on Monday morning, between two and three o'clock, four bullocks passed through the gate; they were all over dust, and were panting - it was day-light. I believe the prisoner Tarnan was with them - I am quite sure he is the man. The toll was 21/2d.; Tarnan gave me half-a-crown - I went in to get the change, and when I came out with it he had gone on a few yards without the change - I followed, and gave it to him; I had told him the toll was 21/2d. Mr. French's boy came up in about five minutes, with about eight score of sheep; a man came up soon after, and asked me if four beasts had gone over the bridge - I said Yes, and he went through the gate; he had 3d. in his hand - each foot passenger pays 1d. It was a person exactly like Tarnan, of his height; I am quite certain he is the man - I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why did you say just now that you believed it was him; had you not some doubt of his identity before you came here to day? A. Why, Yes - I saw one Sturgeon before the Magistrate, and said he was the man who went through the gate; there were two men before the Magistrate beside the prisoner. I swore to Sturgeon - he and the other man were discharged. I am in the habit of sitting up all night; I know it was the 8th of July, because Mr. French's boy came up to me. I had sat up till one o'clock the night before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was not what you said before the Magistrate, that Sturgeon was the man who came up and asked if four bullocks were gone through? A. Yes; I did not swear he drove the cattle through. Tarnan drove them through, and gave me the half-crown - I swore so before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>MR. WHALLER re-examined. My field is rather more than half a mile from Plaistow-gate.</p>

            . I am a sailor. On Sunday, the 8th of July, I was employed at Newport-market - I slept that night in the bullock-pound in the market, under the shelter, close to the slaughter-house; the pound is a place where they keep cattle till they are slaughtered. Saville, the foreman, called me up at half-past three o'clock on Monday morning, and asked me where the keys of the pound were; I said I had them - he said, "Give them to me;" I did so, and he said I might go to bed again; I said I should not, but should take a walk to Smithfield. I did not go to Smithfield, but stood at the corner of Litchfield-street, and in about ten minutes I saw four black oxen; one had a white streak along his back: Tarnan and another person were with them - I had seen him before in the slaughter-house, and have no doubt of him; I told Saville there were four beasts - he said nothing to it; the beasts were very dusty. As I stood at the corner of Litchfield-street; Tarnan asked me if Frank and the other man were in the slaughter-house; (Saville's name is Frank - he is foreman of the slaughter-house;) I told him I did not know. The man who was with Tarnan had a white smock-frock on. I saw Saville and that man come out of the pound together, and when they came out Tarnan, who stood at the corner of Litchfield-street, called Frank; they all three went down Litchfield-street, towards Long-acre together; the beasts were then in the pound; I had seen Tarnan two or three times before, and have seen him and Saville going out of the slaughter-house before - he always called him Frank; they appeared to know each other. I never saw them drink together. I had heard Saville say, about three weeks before, that he expected a countryman was going to fetch him four beasts out of the country. I saw them again about ten minutes before eight o'clock that morning, in the slaughter-house. The tails of the beast had then been cut- when I saw them before they had not been cut. The beasts were then in their rough state; the tails are usually cut in Smithfield. When the beasts came to be killed two were marked D. and two F. on their hips, and the same marks were put on their noses after they were killed, to know who the skins belonged to. I never knew Saville get up so early before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose somebody is owner of this place? A. Yes - Mr. Baker. I had been employed there about three weeks, in the room of a man who was ill - he is now well, and I do not work there now; there may have been two or three hundred heads of cattle slaughtered there while I was there; the place is used for the whole market; there were eight more beast in the pound at that time: they are marked to distinguish whose they are: cattle usually come from Smithfield, but they sometimes come direct from the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been threatened to be prosecuted about this affair? Q. No. Saville is paid as a servant to Baker; I always sort the skins, and put them into seperate heaps for the owners.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do beasts which are brought to the pound come with marks on them or not? A. They come with marks on them; these were marked on the hip after they were put into the pound.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Do you mean to say they never come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250005"></xptr>to the slaughter-house without marks? A. Not from Smithfield; I have known several come there without marks.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did not know this slaughter-house before you were employed there? A. Yes; every body about there called Saville Frank - he was foreman of the place; he asked me for the keys about a quarter of an hour or more before the cattle came - he had to see the beasts killed - Monday is Smithfield-market day, when we often have cattle brought; we open the pound about seven o'clock, not before - we slaughter every day, and generally expect cattle on Monday morning. Saville's business is to see them properly put into the pound, if any are brought - the persons who bring the beasts bring a man to kill them.</p>
               <p>MR. WHALLER. I bought these beasts about the 2d of April, and always kept these four by themselves in the same field.</p>

            . I am an assistant slaughterman, in Newport-market. On Monday, the 9th of July, I went to the slaughter-house as usual, about half-past seven o'clock, and after eight, nine beasts were driven from the pound - eight of them were stale, as we call them - they were left from the Friday's market; the ninth was a fresh one: I marked the eight stale ones, as I knew them; Saville told me to put F. on the ninth. Soon after, seven others were driven in from the pound; I marked four of them, which I knew belonged to some butchers in the market; I did not know the other three, and asked Saville how to mark them- by his direction I marked two D. and one F. Thomas Page, who is servant to Mr. Griffiths, took away the two hides marked F.; the two marked D. remained - they were put into Mr. Challis' heap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you worked at this slaughter-house? A. Six years, for Mr. Baker; Saville was there before I came; he was a servant like me: we slaughter for all the market, and mark all the cattle and the skins to distinguish the owners; we sometimes have them from the country; they are driven in in a rough condition; if a stranger brought cattle we should kill them; I saw nothing of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you always on the spot? A. No; I live in the market, and leave a good deal of the business to Saville, but I never heard of such an instance; I do not examine the hides myself, but I know it is customary to clip them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who takes an account of the beasts slaughtered? A. Saville; he gives it to me once a week.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your employer is proprietor of the slaugter-house? A. Yes; she is a widow; we have so much a head for slaughtering - we should not refuse to kill for a stranger - they might come from a fair or from the country, without going to Smithfield; if I saw a beast without a mark, I should not order it to be marked; we have no notice of what cattle are coming.</p>

I apprehended Saville, and asked him who brought the beasts to him; he said two men, but he did not know their names - he did not give me either of their Christian or sirnames; he said they told him to mark two with an F., and two D.; I asked what address they had given; he said they stated they had taken a shop somewhere by the Regent's-park, and that he did not know them at all; I asked how they came to leave the heads behind, when they took the rest of the offal away; he said the man who took the offal said he understood the heads were sold, and would not take them, but would take the tongues; and they were cut out; I afterwards went with French to Leadenhall-market, and saw a cart full of hides belonging to Mr. Griffiths; I saw Page take from the cart two marked F. in red ochre; French claimed them directly; a witness, named Aldridge, has been out of the way ever since last Session - I believe he is a helper about Whitechapel-market.</p>

            . I am a patrol, and went with Mr. Waller to the slaughter-house; he claimed two hides there marked D.</p>
               <p>TARNAN'S Defence. I wish to observe, that I have been told by a man, who is now under sentence of death, that he was at the toll-gate that evening, and that he is the man who took the money instead of Pilgrim; and that his evidence is false. I declare I was never in the slaughter-house is my life, nor was I ever in the market but twice in my life.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PILGRIM re-examined. I am sure I was at the toll-gate all night on Sunday; my partner Const was asleep in bed; I attended at the gate, opened it, and received the money. I awoke Const, the toll-man, to get the change; he gave it me, and then kept up a little.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did Tarnan go through the gate? A. Between one and two o'clock in the morning - the gate is three miles from Whitechapel church; I did not look at the clock, but think it was between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HARRISON. Saville called me up about half-past three o'clock - I had no clock, but I heard the watchman calling half-past three o'clock when I came out, and it was a quarter of an hour after that when I saw the beasts.</p>
               <p>DAVID GEORGE ALDERSON. I think it is between two and three miles from Whitechapel church to Newport-market.</p>
               <p>SAVILLE'S Defence. I did not know they were stolen; the two men came with them a little after four o'clock. I called the witness up for the key, as somebody was coming to take the dung out: these two men came and asked if I belonged to the slaughter-house, and asked at what time they could have the beasts killed; I said when we began to kill, but we must kill the stale ones first, they told me how to mark them; they said they brought them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250006"></xptr>from market; that they had a shop in the Regent's-park, and were to come in a cart in the afternoon for the offal.</p>

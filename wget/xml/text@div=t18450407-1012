                  </hi>. I am in the Royal Artillery. I was at Richmond, recruiting—on the 31st of March, about nine o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in the street, and went with her to the Magpie public-house, for about an hour, drinking with her—I had my watch in my watch-pocket—I had not my belt on—I afterwards came out, walked about with her till about twelve o'clock, and then went back with her to the Magpie—she left, and after she was gone I missed my watch—there were other persona in the Magpie besides her—I had taken my watch out, and put it into an<lb></lb>other pocket by my side—I am sure I had it when I first left the Magpie with her—I had not been in any other house with her—this is my watch.</p>

At a quarter before one o'clock in the morning, on the 1st of April, I met the prosecutor—he was not sober—he gave me information, and I went after the prisoner—I found her in Cleaver-street, Richmond, the next morning—she said she had not been in Richmond the evening before, she had been to Hampton fair, dancing with some soldiers there, and had just returned—when I first saw the prosecutor he was dozing, and when I spoke to him he told me of his loss—his jacket was unbuttoned, and his trowsen a little unbuttoned, and his braces hanging down behind him—I took him home, and put him to bed—he was stupidly drunk.</p>

I saw the prisoner with the prosecutor that night in George-street, Richmond, about 300 yards from the Magpie—I afterwards saw her about a quarter past twelve o'clock—she was running—a man called to her, and she said she could not stop—I afterwards saw the prosecutor coming up an alley, very tipsy—he could scarcely walk—I then met Millichap, and we found the prosecutor sitting down near the road—we lifted him up, and took him home—I do, not believe he knew what he was about.</p>

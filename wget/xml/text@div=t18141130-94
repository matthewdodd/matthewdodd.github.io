            , JUNIOR. I am an officer; about six weeks before I apprehended the prisoner. I saw How and his wife in a court in the City-road; I saw the watch there in the possession of Mrs. How; I took possession of it after Bourn claimed it. I then went and took Brooks up; I understood he had bought the duplicate; I took him before the magistrate; he there said he bought the duplicate of Mahon. Afterwards I apprehended Mahon; I produce the watch.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you by a watch that was claimed by Brown - A. On the 3rd of September, I believe it it was the day Bartholomew fair was on, Mahon came to me, and asked me if I would buy the duplicate of a watch; I said I did not exactly want one. He asked me two or three times; he wanted five shillings for the duplicate; I borrowed two shillings of the waiter and gave it him; he was to come for the three shillings another time; he delivered me the duplicate, and called again on the Sunday after the fair for the three shillings, and I went to the pawnbroker, and paid for changing the duplicate into my own name; and on the Tuesday following I redeemed the watch. After that I went with Beer to How the watchman; he asked to look at the watch; I let him look at it, he said it was a nice watch; the next day when I went to How's with Beer Brown was there, he asked to see the watch; I shewed it him, he claimed it; I left it there.</p>

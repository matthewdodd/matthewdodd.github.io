About five o'clock I went to my work; about ten I had them both taken up, and the watch I found.</p>

About two hours afterwards, a man from the Rotation Office in East. Smithfield came to enquire of me if I had taken any silver watch that forenoon; I told him I had taken in one, and he called in the owner, who identified it. I attended the Justices in the evening, and the two prisoners were there: I thought I had some faint idea of the shortest, though I could not positively swear. She peremptorily crossed me in my evidence, that it was no man that pledged the watch at all. I was then struck more forcibly with the identity of her person, and I am of opinion that it was that woman herself, disguised in sailor's clothes; that was

               <p>This pawnbroker, I never saw him, so help me God, till I saw him in the Justice's office, if I am to be believed as a Christian at the bar. I drank part of a pint of beer with the prosecutor; he was out of my company very near three quarters of an hour; he came in again, and went out sick; he went into the open street, there was about a dozen women, and he had one of them in the house, and made her sing songs, and then a fighting arose, and he was in the midst. I did not perceive any watch he had about him. He said to me, I should be glad to lay down any where, it is too late for me to go home. I worked at hay-making with this woman; I asked her to let him lay down; I covered him with a blanket on the floor. I went to bed immediately with this woman. He awaked in the morning, and asked this woman for his watch. The last word he said, when he went out of the room, he said, I had my watch in the public room, but I will not be positive I had it here. He desired me to come where he lived, if I heard any thing of it.</p>

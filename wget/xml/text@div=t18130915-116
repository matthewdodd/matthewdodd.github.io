On the Thursday night I missed two three-shilling pieces, on Friday morning I missed one three-shilling piece; on the Saturday morning I mentioned it to the landlord of the house, he desired me to mark the money. I marked four three-shilling pieces, an eighteen-penny piece, and a shilling. I marked them on the tail side, and my landlord on the head. I had been in bed about a quarter a quarter of an hour when the prisoner came up in the dark. I then heard the prisoner taking more money; he drawed the breeches from under the pillow. He got up the morning between five and six; I got up, and ran down stairs; I called for assistance. My landlord and I went up stairs; we accused him of taking a three-shilling piece, an eighteen-penny piece, and a shilling; he denied it.</p>

            . I am a chandler. On Saturday morning the prosecutor told me that he had been robbed by the prisoner. I advised him to mark some money, and in the night I would fasten him in that he should not get out. On Sunday morning he said he had been robbed. I went up stairs and insisted upon his taking the money out of his pocket. He took out a three-shilling piece, an eighteen-penny piece, and a shilling that I had marked the preceding evening.</p>

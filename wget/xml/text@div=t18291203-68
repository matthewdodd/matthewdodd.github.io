            . I am a bookseller, and live in the Commercial-road - I know the prisoner very well; she has often been to my shop; here is "A Digest of the Laws of England," the seventh volume of "Lord Coke's Reports" with a name scratched out, but I have no knowledge of that - "Carey's Chancery Reports," and "Proceedings of Conveyancey," by Barton; and the sixth volume of "Vesey's Reports;" I bought them all of the prisoner as waste paper - the covers are on; I bought them at 3d. or 4d. a lb - the books are valueable, but any gentleman in the profession knows we are much exposed in our line; I am a bookseller, but deal in waste-paper.</p>
               <p>Q. In the front of this book the name, which was pasted on it, is torn out, you know nothing of that? A. No; here is an erasure where a coat of arms is usually pasted - I never noticed that before; I bought them as odd volumes, without looking for the names; I think I told her I would buy no more with the covers on - I have no doubt of it, because they would be in a better shape to sell as waste-paper; I knew the sets were valuable - I asked how she came by them: she said they belonged to her son. who was in an attorney's office.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she say she came by "Vesey's Reports." which cost 30l. or 40l.? A. She only brought an odd volume; they are all odd volumes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you been in the trade? A.About twenty-five years; I do not pretend to know the value of law books - I buy them as waste-paper, and sell them as such; I told her I would buy no more with the covers on, as I would rather buy them in the shape of waste-paper - I made no deductions for the covers; I took no notice of the names being erased - I did not examine them inside; I do not know the value of them - I gave her 3d. or 3 1/2d. a lb.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I am very sorry for what I have done - extreme distress occasioned me to do it; Mr. Mann told me to bring them without the covers - he gave me 3d. a lb.; I acknowledged where I took them to directly.</p>

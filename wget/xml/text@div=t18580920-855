                  </hi>. I am shopman to James Butcher, of 81, Long-lane—on 2d September the prisoners came into the shop about 4 o'clock—Leather asked me to show them some shawls out of the window—I showed them some—they said they did not suit, and asked to see some more—I told them that I had no more of the same quality—Roe then pointed to a parcel behind the counter, and said, "Let us look at those," and she went round the counter—I said I would show them the shawls—she said she thought she would save me the trouble—I then showed them the shawls, and I counted 7 in the parcel—Roe then asked me to show her another shawl out of the window—I went to the window for that purpose—before doing so I placed the 7 shawls on the counter, near the edge where the customers stand—when I brought the shawl from the window, Roe said, "Will you hold one corner while I see the size"—she laid hold of one corner and I held the other—I was near the window, and she at the other end—the shawl almost hid those that were on the counter—while I was holding it I saw the shawls on the counter move—Roe then said that the shawls would not suit, that the colours were too gay, and her mistress would not like them—she said that she had been told that Mr. Butcher kept such a nice assortment of shawls, and they were recommended there—I told them they were not such a good assortment as we generally had got, because we were taking stock—she asked if we would send some up to<lb></lb>morrow at the Victoria Hotel, opposite the post-office—I said I would speak to Mr. Butcher about it, and if I did it would be about 4 o'clock—she said I should see a lot of servants there, but I was to go down stairs and ask for Ann—they then left the shop together—as soon as they were gone I counted the shawls that were on the counter, and missed one—I directly went after the prisoners—I secured Roe; another witness took Leather—a person named Shreeve gave me this shawl—the witness Morgan had given it to him.</p>

               <p>shawls when I took them from the parcel—they were tied up in paper—I took them out one by one, and counted them in that way—it was Roe that held the shawl while I measured it—I was on one side of the counter, and they on the other—Leather was behind the shawl as I held it up, so that I could not see her—she was sitting on the other side of Roe—I got the shawl back in about 5 minutes—I received it from Shreeve in Cloth-fair—I found Roe in one of the courts near, I think it is called Back-court, and I chased her till we got to Cloth-fair—when I first saw them, they had only got a few yards from the shop—I did not see the shawl dropped.</p>

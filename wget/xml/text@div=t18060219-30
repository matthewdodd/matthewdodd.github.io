The 8th of February, Saturday evening, twelve o'clock precisely; I saw every servant to bed before I retired to rest; the prisoner at the bar on Sunday morning came to my bed room door to get the key of the parlour to clean it against we came down to breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the opportunity by that key of getting into your shop. - A. The moment she got that she had access to any part of the house, because there were no part locked up besides.

The man servant was not gone out of the house, a constable came in; the prisoner at the bar, when the constable knocked at the door, was in the very act of robbing me; she had her hand in the cupboard where my liquor and spices and every article of value were; the constable laid hold of the man, and said if you have any more servants in the house I shall search them all; this woman was searched; in her pocket was found six nutmegs that I had marked the night before, and a gold ring was found upon her, which was my own; the constable searched her box, and found cinnamon, mace, cloves, two cakes of Windsor soap, and two sticks of sealing wax; them articles are my own, and what I deal in.</p>

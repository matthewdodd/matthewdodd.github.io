                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Edward Jenkins—we are slop-sellers, and live in Penny-fields, Poplar. On the 6th of October, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I was about closing my shop—the prisoner James was passing the door—I was standing there—he said, "Well, tailor, how do you do?"—I asked him what ship he belonged to—he said he had come from Sheerness with the captain, and that he be<lb></lb>longed to the ship <hi rend="italic">Hartley</hi>—he came into my shop—I asked him if he wanted any clothes—he said yes, he did—I took him into a back shop—I asked what he had got a month—he said 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other man (meaning Johnson, who was at the door) had only 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—I asked him if the other man wanted any clothes—he said no, he was too stingy—while we were talking Johnson came in—I was then serving James with clothes—I asked him what he had got to take—he said he was going to be paid next morning in Cheapside, and he appointed to meet me or my young man at the Sailors' Home on the following morning, to go and re<lb></lb>ceive their wages, which the captain had appointed to pay them the follow<lb></lb>ing morning, at Laurie and Hamilton's—James got a pair of pilot trowgen, a waistcoat, and a pilot jacket—Johnson got a jacket and a cap—I let them have them on the supposition that they were going to be paid the next morning, the one 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per month—we are obliged to let sailors have clothes before they have their money—I ex<lb></lb>pected to be paid the next morning, and I sent my young man to the Sailors' Home—they represented Laurie and Hamilton's to be the owners of the vessel, and that the captain was to meet them there to pay their wages—James said he had 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's servant. I was ordered to go to the Sailors' Home, and on my way I met the prisoners—they had not got the clothes on which they had of my master—they spoke in their own language—I asked if they had been paid—they said, "No"—when they got to our shop they got half-a-crown each from me, which I got from the firm—they then said, if I would go with them to Laurie and Hamilton's they would get their money—I went with them by an omnibus—they said they wished me to go with them to see them get their money, and then they asked me for the half-crown each—I went with them to Laurie and Hamil<lb></lb>ton's—they told me to wait outside, and they would go in and get their money—they went in and came out, but did not bring me any money—I then went into the office by myself—I left the prisoners in Cheapside, and the next morning I went to the Sailors' Home, and could not see them—I went again in the evening, but they were not there—on my way back found the prisoners in the Back road, drinking and carousing—I had my suspicions, and spoke to them—they told me they had not been paid—I waited a good bit, and then they said the second mate had been to tell them they were to be paid at the Sailors' Home.</p>

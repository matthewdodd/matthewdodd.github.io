               <p>Davis. Q. Did you see me among the three men? A. I cannot swear to any of them till I saw you with the truss; you made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What time was this? A. Half-past six o'clock; it was dark - that is a great thoroughfare; there were other persons - I cannot tell where the carter was at the time the truss fell; I cannot say it did not fall by accident, or that the persons I afterwards saw with it were those I first saw with the cart- the third person got away; they had got thirty or forty yards from where I saw the truss fall when I took them.</p>

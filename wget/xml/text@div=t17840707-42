               <p>I know the prisoner very well, I lost a pair of stuff shoes last Monday, the prisoner came into my shop about eleven o'clock, and wanted to be fitted with a pair of shoes, I shewed her several pair, she put one pair down by her side and desired to see some others, I shewed her some others, she had some objections to them and said she would call again, and asked when I should have some others that were more to her mind, I asked her for the pair of shoes that she had put by her side, she said she had none, and that I had them all again, I was very positive she had some, she expressed great surprize at being charged, and stood up there was no shoes on the floor, I let her go away, my child was coming into the shop as she went away, and I told her to follow the woman to see if she did not take out shoes from her pocket or pockets,</p>
               <p>Court. How old is your child? - Eleven; in two minutes the child came back, and told me she saw her take them out and shew them to a woman, I had a sight of her going into a public house, and I followed her and insisted on having the shoes, she denied them, I insisted on it, and she said she had one pair that a fellow servant gave her that morning to carry home for her, she took them out of her pocket and shewed them to me, I missed that pair in particular.</p>

               <p>I went for a pair of shoes; and accidentally some how or other the shoes bung fast in my petticoat, I found something kick the side of my ancle, and I set down my basket to see what it was, and before I could return with them the gentleman came into the house.</p>

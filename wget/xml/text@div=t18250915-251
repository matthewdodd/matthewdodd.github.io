On the 11th of September I was the last person up. When I got up in the morning, I found the first floor window open; I had fastened it the night before: I missed the plate as stated in the indictment, out of the closet, mistress's watch from her drawer, a gold chain, tortoiseshell combs, nineteen handkerchiefs, four rings, and several other things.</p>
               <p>GEORGE CULL. I am a constable of Mary-le-bone. On the 12th of September, about a quarter past six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Lisson-grove, north, with a bundle under his left arm, and a red shawl swinging in his right hand; I ran after him, and got just before him about two yards, turned back and asked him what he had got there? he looked me very hard in the face, and said "What is that to you?" and made round a wall; I ran and collared him, took him to a public-house, searched him, and in the shawl were two large table and four tea spoons; I took him up stairs, searched the bundle, and found five combs, a silk handkerchief, nineteen white pocket-handkerchiefs, a pair of silk stockings, two white dresses, two silk dresses, a cruet and stand, and three salt spoons - the purses, some trinkets, and a gold watch and chain, were in his pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. After he was taken to the watch-house did not a person come and say they had seen a man come out of this house? A. No - When I asked where he got them he would not tell me; I shewed him my staff. I never heard him give any account of them, except telling the Magistrate that he pulled them out of a ditch. I met him in the public road, going towards the New-road. I found a miniature painting upon him.</p>

This property is all mine - I lost about 130 l. worth altogether. I have no knowledge of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I arose at half-past five o'clock in the morning, and was walking in the Regent's-park before breakfast, intending to breakfast with my sister, at Bayswater. My attention was attracted by the bundle and articles in a ditch; I collected them together to take to the office to be claimed, when I was arrested by this man, in a rough manner, saying, "What have you there?" I said, "What is that to you?" judging from his appearance that he might be concerned in the robbery; he took me to the watch-house, and in three quarters of an hour a labourer was brought from the grove, to see if I was the person who had been seen coming out of this house - he said it was a much taller and stouter man; and in the lock-up room, in the presence of four people, one of the men said, I was a likely man to run; I applied to the witness to know if I had attempted to run; he said, No, but told the Magistrate I had turned round to attempt an escape. At the second examination the Magistrate spoke to him about this, and he said I had not run.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Did the bundle appear to have been in a ditch? A. It was not dirty at all - it was tied up in a black silk handkerchief.</p>

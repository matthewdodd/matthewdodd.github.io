               <p>- COX sworn. - I am a publican, and keep a house in Petticoat-lane: On the 13th of May, a man came to my house, and told me there was a man with a quart pot to sell, and asked eight-pence for it; I went up the lane, and could not believe that was the man, by his appearance, I saw him with a pot under his arm; there is an old iron-shop just by, and I thought if it was him he would go in; I watched him in, and then I took him by the collar, he said nothing; I felt in his pockets and found this quart pot, and asked him how he came by it; he said he did not know; I told him he must have some knowledge of it; then he said he found it; I have kept the pot ever since, there is the name of Benjamin Noy on it; I suppose he was better than a quarter of a mile from Mr. Noy's house; I sent for a constable and gave charge of him, and sent for Mrs. Noy.</p>

             sworn. - I buy old clothes: On the 13th of May, a man passed me with a bundle under his arm, and I asked him if he had got any thing for me to buy; he asked me if I would buy a pot; I told him no, I did not want to buy such things; he said he had a quart pot to sell; immediately I went to Mr. Cox, and told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190054"></xptr>him of it; he asked me which way he went, and followed him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Noy. I went and saw the pot before the Lord-Mayor, the man was there; our pots are not numbered; I only know the prisoner came to our house at seven o'clock in the morning, I never saw him before; when I went home the girl had missed the pot; I am satisfied, from my own knowledge, there was one missing; I have kept the house nineteen years last June; we return the old pots to the man who makes them, and have new ones, but have not returned any of late; I have no doubt of it being our pot, it has a particular mark, and was going to he put by, having been burnt by the fire; the value is one shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I stand here at the bar of justice, before this honourable Court, with a sorrowful and contrite heart, conscious of having done wrong; I am friendless and pennyless, two hundred miles from my native place, having worked in the Dock-yard, where I worked as a smith for some years; as I was going through Nightingale-lane a pot was in the lane, I took it up, being stupified and overcome with liquor; I was stopped by those two men I suppose, whom I do not know; I have served my King and country in the war, and was in America; I look up to the Court, and humbly implore lenity and mercy, and beg for God's sake not to be confined long, as may your Lordships be pleased to consider my family; there were two substantial house-keepers here on Wednesday, and Thursday, but are not here now.</p>

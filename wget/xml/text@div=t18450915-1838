                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are in luck to be a wit<lb></lb>ness here to-day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It looks like it—if I ran away it was to better myself—I was not charged with stealing stones that I know of—I do not know how many were taken up before I ran away—I was in Mr. Pratt'i service—I did not give him notice that I was going away—I did not go in a hurry—I left on Saturday night, the 21st of June—I was ill all the week before—I sent my wife that night for my wages—I went to earn 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day—I do not know the name of the employer I went to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had Master Bull and Kemp gone before you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing at all about them—I know them—I do not know whether they were taken ill—I had been at home ill all the week—I left to better myself if I could—I had been working with Bull and Kemp a fortnight before—I know nothing about any stones being stolen—I heard that there was a complaint hy my master that stones had been stolen—I believe that was the same week that I was taken ill—I never heard from my master that he was before the Magistrate, and applying for postponements from time to time because he could not find me, nor that I was accused with others of stealing these stones—I left on the Saturday morning, about half-past eight—I was watching the stones all night—I went home, and did not come again—I did not tell the foreman, or any person, I was going—I did not steal any old bricks belonging to Mr. Pratt from the road—I was charged with it—Mr. Pratt said he would give me in charge for it the next time, but they were old bricks—I did not steal them—I did not take them off the premises—that happened a fortnight or three weeks before this, to the best of my opinion—I do not know how long Bull had been given in charge before I was taken ill—I had not seen him the day before—I have seen him a good many days since—I saw him a week before he was taken up—I did not see him when he was taken up—I heard some of the men that were at work with him tell it—I could not tell how soon afterwards I was taken ill, nor how soon I was forthcoming after Bull was set at liberty.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before you left, had you pointed out Callow to the'police? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I then went to Gray's Inn-lane, to tell my governor—I then went and had half-a-pint of beer—I left because I got more wages elsewhere—that was the only ground—with respect to the bricks, I ex<lb></lb>plained what I had done to my master, and he made no charge against me—I was never charged with stealing these stones, or any other stones whatever.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it a mistake that you charged him with stealing bricks from the roadside, and threatened to give him in custody the next time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot charge my memory with it—I cannot swear that I did do it—I do not recollect it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. I recollect passing Callow's shed on a Thursday in June—he is a general-dealer, and keeps a coalsbed—he has premises in Mr. Harris's field—I cannot say whether he has any premises building—as I was coming up the gardens that Thursday I saw a load of stones, and Callow and another man were with them—the stones were shot, the horses turned round, and Callow and the man went towards the public-house—I was crossing the road, and I just turned my head and missed them—I do not think there was anywhere they could have gone in to be out of my sight, but in the public-house.</p>

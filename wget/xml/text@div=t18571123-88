                  </hi>. I am a miller, at Halstead, in Essex. On Monday, 16th Nov., I was in Wellington Street, near London Bridge—I met a gentleman, as I thought, and I asked him if he knew where boilers were made—he said he had a brother in that line; we went to a public house—he called for a pint of beer and paid for it—while we were drinking it the prisoner came in—he said he had come up to London to take some money that had been left him—he then produced a padlock which he said nobody could open—he left the padlock with me and the other man, and the prisoner went out—while he was gone the other man and I looked at the lock—we could open it very well—I opened it, and the other man opened it too—the prisoner afterwards came back, and said he would bet 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that nobody could open the lock—I said I would not bet—he said, "You have no money"—I said, "Yes, I have;" he and the other man said, "You have not got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I said I had, and I pulled out three sovereigns and a half in gold, and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—another</p>

               <p>man then came in; there were three of them—the prisoner pro<lb></lb>duced a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and the man who went in with me took it up—I laid my money on the table—the man who went in with me took it up, and my money and the note were given to the third man who came in—I then tried to open the lock and could not, and my money was handed to the prisoner, and he ran away directly, and the other two men stopped me from going after him—I am sure I did not make any bet at all, and I did not consent to my money being given to the prisoner at all—I produced my money because he said I could not do it.</p>

            . On the 13th of August the prisoner came to see me, she had been down to Chesnut to see her children in the poor house; I went up stairs, and when I came down the prisoner and the watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the watch. - A. It hung upon a nail in the shop. About five weeks after that she came and confessed it; she said if I would come with her she would give me the watch again. I found the watch at Mr. Hogg's in Kingsland Road.</p>
               <p>- MILLER. I am a chimney sweeper. When I was at Mr. Hogg's, a person came in and said that there was a person in distress for ten shillings, to relieve a person out of prison; I gave ten shillings for the ticket, as it was to get a person out of prison. The watch was in pledge at Islington.</p>
               <p>MR. HOGG. The prisoner came to my house and asked if I would buy a watch; she said it was for a person in distress. Mr. Miller bought the watch for nine shillings; he shoved the watch ticket across the table; I gave him a shilling for it. The prosecutrix told me she did not mean to hurt the prisoner, if she could get the watch. I got the watch and sent her word.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Hogg heard the prosecutrix say that she would forgive me if I produced the watch.</p>

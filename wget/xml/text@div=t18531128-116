On 26th Aug. twenty six packages arrived there from Dorchester, from Wimberley the carrier; they were to be delivered to Thomas Skinner, of the New Inn, Old Bailey—I have the bill of parcels; the packages were put on the platform at the end of the stage near the window, just by the basket, I have every reason to believe—I saw them last on the Saturday afternoon, and I missed them on the Monday morning—Skinner made application for four baskets, but one was missing, and three only were delivered to him—from information I received on the Monday, I went to a field near the goods station, to some premises belonging to Mr. Godstone, and in a hedge there by the side of the rail, I found this hamper, it had the paper boxes in it, and they were wet; the gloves had been taken out of them—the prisoner was a porter in the Company's service, and was employed specially on the platform—he would know the glove hampers because we have them up daily, sometimes twenty, and sometimes thirty, and particularly by their being directed to Skinner, of the Old Bailey—on Sunday night, 30th Aug., the prisoner applied to me for leave of absence on Tuesday morning, and I gave him leave for from 10 minutes past 9 o'clock in the morning till 6 in the evening, and he was absent the entire time—he would leave on the Saturday, when the work</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 14, Mill-street, South Lambeth About March last I used to work as a carrier, which took me to the South Western Railway—I have not been in regular employment—I know James Wade, who has been convicted at the Surrey Sessions—I had not given information against him—I had known him for some years—soon after Christmas last the prisoner came to lodge with me, and he remained till some time in Aug.—I had not myself any knowledge of the premises of the South Western Railway, or of the goods there; but one Sunday morning in Aug. I was down in the kitchen, and the prisoner told me to come out in the garden to him; and he said there was a good thing which we might do in the evening—I asked him what it was—he told me it was a parcel which he had got <hi rend="italic">all to rights</hi>, on the Company's premises, and might easily be got out at night—I would not go with him, and in the afternoon he came down again about 2 or 3 o'clock, and asked me if I had made up my mind whether I would go—I hesitated about it for some time, not knowing what to do, and at last I arranged that I would go—he remained at the top part of the house, and about 7 o'clock in the evening he came down, and asked about how it should be got, and I inquired if there was a policeman there; he said there was not—I had a carpet bag, and he said that would be the best thing we could take, and we arranged to take it—we left the house at a little after 8 o'clock; we went up the Wandsworth-road, into a field over at the back of Mr. Godstone's house, and crossed the line to the warehouse—(I am married; I saw my wife not a minute before I left home, and she knew we were going out together but I do not know whether she saw us leave the door exactly)—we got to the premises about 20 minutes before 9 o'clock, and the prisoner got under the warehouse door, leading out of the Wandsworth-road—there was just room for him to get under—he then opened the door, and gave me this basket to take away—I have no doubt that this is it—I took it a little distance, and he stopped and fastened up the place, and came away to me—we unpacked the basket in a field very near Mr. Godstone's house about 200 yards from the warehouse; it contained fifty-three dozen pairs of gloves—we put them into this carpet bag; put the boxes back into the hamper, and the prisoner took it away some distance—he was four or five minutes gone, and said he had thrown it in a pond or a ditch, and that it was in the water—I did not see where he threw it—we went down the Wandsworth-road, as far as the Goats public house—Wade had not appeared in the matter at all—I then went away to Mile-street with the bag, and the prisoner went into the public house—I put the bag into a place like a little dust hole at our front door, and then went back to the public house, and found the prisoner and three or four other people in the parlour; there were one or two of the company's servants there, and several men—Header was there—we remained till nearly 11 o'clock, I and then went home, went indoors, and then out into the garden—I fetched the bag, and took it indoors, so that his wife and my wife knew nothing of it—I locked it up in the front room for the night, and in the morning, at half past 5 o'clock, the prisoner came down—I got up—we opened the bag, and counted fifty-three dozen pairs of gloves—we packed them up into the bag, and put them od one side—I arranged with the</p>

               <p>prisoner to go to London, to see if I could find anybody to sell them to—I met Wade at the top of the Old Bailey, and was talking to him about it—he ultimately received the goods from my door, on the Tuesday, at 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner on the Tuesday morning, about 9 o'clock—when I went away in the morning I left the bag in the bedroom, desiring my wife that, if "Wade came, it should be delivered to him—I had seen Wade before—he came, by arrangement, between 8 and 9 o'clock, and the prisoner came down into the kitchen, and the three of us were together—I do not think my wife saw us together; she was in the front kitchen, getting the breakfast for the children, but she heard us—we got nothing for the gloves—Wade said he knew a person who would buy them, but I believe he was stopped trying to get rid of them—I went into the other room, to have some breakfast, and after that we went into the Goats public-house, and Wade went up to the house and fetched the bag.</p>

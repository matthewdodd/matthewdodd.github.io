               <p>I keep a cart to carry goods. As I was coming from Edmonton to London on the 20th of November, at about 3 o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoner, near <placeName id="t17791208-2-crimeloc8">Sadler's-Mill</placeName>

Wood clapped a pistol to my breast and said he would shoot me dead if I did not give them my money; my brother was in the cart, but he was asleep, and knew nothing of the matter. They searched my pockets and asked me for my watch; I told them I had not a watch, and that I had nothing about me but a bad sixpence and sixpenny worth of half-pence; upon which they said poor fellow, then let him go; and they did not take my money.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to discover these persons? - Yes, it was a star-light night; the moon was going down but it was very light. I am sure they are the men. They went away as soon as they had searched me. I saw a watchman about a quarter of an hour afterwards at Edmonton; I described the men to the watchman, and then I went on towards London. I sold the fruit I had in my cart, and as I was returning into the country I met the two prisoners in custody of the constable, who was taking them to Mr. Townsend's; immediately as I saw them I said they were the men who had stopped me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman. Between the Two Bells at Edmonton, the two prisoners passed my box, about five minutes before one o'clock; as they came up to my box. I jumped out like between them, and wished them a good morning, and they wished me a good morning. I took a little notice of them as they passed me. The prosecutor afterwards came and told me he had been stopped by two men, and described them to me. At about four o'clock the prisoners came back again towards London; as they answered the description the prosecutor had given. I stopped them. This pistol (producing it) was found upon Wood. As we were taking them to Mr. Townsend's, Kinsey came along the road; he immediately said, these are the men that stopped me last night; I will swear to them.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM LOOM sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. Coleman gave me charge of the two prisoners. I searched them. Wood said he had nothing but an old pistol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080004"></xptr>which he had brought from on board a ship. He pulled this pistol from out of his breast and gave it to me.</p>

               <p>WOOD's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had just come home from sea. As we were coming back from Edmonton the watchman stopped us, and secured us. The prosecutor, when he saw us in custody, said he believed we were the men that had stopped him, but he would not swear to us till they persuaded him to do so.</p>

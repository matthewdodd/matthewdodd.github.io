                  </hi> I carry on business as a harness maker, in Blackfriars-road. I have employed the prisoner occasionally fro ten years to make out my accounts, and to collect money—in July or Aug. I gave him a list of persons who were in my debt, to the amount of about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—among them was a debt of Mr. Sandeman, of Princes-sqaure, Ratcliff-highway—he brought a little bill from Mr. Sandeman to me, and said Mr. Sandeman would pay part of it, if not the whole at a certain time, if I would give him a written order—he wrote an order and I signed it; this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Sir, —The bearer, Mr. Hughes, is authorized by me to receive the balance of my account, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and will give you a receipt for the same; I am Sir, yours obediently, <hi rend="smallCaps">

               <p>no, he had not received any—on the 2nd of Dec.

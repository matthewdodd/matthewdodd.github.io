             sworn. I am an officer. On the 6th of May I received information that a hide of leather was carried into this alley by the prisoner Blake, into the house where the prisoner Dodson was, I applied to Mr. Sapwell, we went to the house of Dodson the prisoner, Dodson was then sitting at the door with the child in his arms; in going to the back part of the shop I found the hide covered over with two shutters and a basket, I took the hide up; Sapwell instantly secured the prisoner Dodson; at the instant of securing him, Blake made his appearance outside of the door, Sapwell also secured him, we brought the hide and the prisoners away. (The hide identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Blake's Defence. On the 6th of May last, coming from Bilingsgate (I am a porter, and get my bread at various markets, and sometimes at Bilingsgate, I have a wife and three small children), I had left my basket at Bilingsgate; a man at the corner says, porter, do you want a job, I says yes, he agreed to give me a couple of shillings to take it to the Blue-Coat Boy, he said he was not in a hurry, I might take it at my leisure; I goes home to leave what supply I had, my wife was not at home. That man is totally innocent, you may depend upon it; I asked him to let me leave it there till I found my children; I went to the prisoner's house to buy some potatoes after I had found my children.</p>
               <p>Q. Now where is the man that gave you this to carry. - A. I never saw the man from that time to this; frequently as I go along the street I carry things of this sort.</p>
               <p>Dodson's Defence. I can say no more; he came in and asked me liberty to put it there while he looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210011"></xptr>for his children, it remained there during half an hour; during that time Mr. Sapwell came in, I told him Mr. Blake brought it.</p>
               <p>Blake. The officer seems to tell you as how the hide was secreted and covered over; I pitched it in the shop, I assure you.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell the officer you knew nothing at all about it. - A. If I did, my lord, at the time, it was from the agitation of my mind.</p>
               <p>Blake called no witnesses to character.</p>
               <p>Dodson called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

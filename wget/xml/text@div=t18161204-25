            . On the 25th of October, I was going to Town with a load of goods in my waggon; I had my servant with me, and my saddle-horse, which I occasionally rode; being unwell I went into the waggon, and remained there until about three o'clock in the morning, when my man told me he missed the horse. I got out and sent him back to see for the man who had taken it. I saw the horse six days after I had lost it. I saw it pass the Coach and Horses Inn, Holloway. I saw the bridle and saddle the day before. It was in possession of a milkman, who lives in the City-road; I have sold the horse to him since. When I saw the horse, I stopped it. I am sure it was my horse. It had a complaint, which made it constantly shake its head, by which I knew it to be mine.</p>

            . I am servant to the last witness, and was with him that night. He told me to drive the waggon, and to ride the pony. I did not ride it. The prisoner was coming towards London, and so when I knew him, I told him he might ride the horse behind the waggon. I had no authority to lend it to him. He mounted the horse, and took my lanthorn. I told him to call me if any thing fell out of the waggon. He followed me till we came through Kennington; the things appeared safe, and I took the lanthorn from him before we came to Kennington; he asked me for his stick, which had been put in the hinder part of the waggon; I gave it to him; we had then passed through Kennington; when we had got about a mile further I looked back, and missed the prisoner and the horse; it had a saddle and bridle on it. I did not see the prisoner again until the 23d of November; I saw him then at Chichester. I have not seen the horse, nor the saddle or bridle, since. I believe he must have passed me when he went away. When I took the lanthorn from him I told him not to leave the waggon.</p>

            . I live at Holloway. I know the prisoner. I saw him on the 25th of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; he had a brown mare with him; she was saddled and bridled; he stopped at my house and offered the mare for sale to several people. I purchased it of him; I gave him 2l. for it. It was not cheap at that; it was not worth more. I did not buy the saddle; the bridle was given in with the horse; my hostler bought the saddle. I do not remember seeing Mr. Farndell till after the horse was stolen. Mr. Farndell showed me the horse, and I said it was the one which I purchased; she appeared very heavy about the head; I can swear that the mare he showed me is the one that I purchased of the prisoner. Holloway is in the county of Middlesex.</p>

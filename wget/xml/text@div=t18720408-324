               <p>am treasurer to the Very Rev. Canon Oakley, who is priest of the Roman Catholic Church, in Duncan Terrace, Islington—the money of the church was kept under my care in an iron-safe in the sacristy—on 5th March, at half-past 9 o'clock in the evening, I found it quite safe—I did not notice whether the church doors were closed at that time—the safe was in the inner sacristy—from the outer sacristy there is a door opens into a short passage, and opposite that is a door which opens into a school-yard, which leads into a court or mews close by—you can get from the sacristy into the street without any difficulty—the doors are generally bolted inside—the prisoner was employed as organ-blower at the time—I did not see anything of him that evening—next morning about twenty minutes to 7 o'clock, I had occasion to go to the safe—I found the door of it opened, the look torn away from the inside of the door and lying on a bench close by—my books and papers were strewed about, and all the money gone except a few old copper coins which were valueless—there was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of coppers gone, also some foreign coins, and some others things—the lock appeared to have been wrenched open with a large nail, which I found on the bench close by, which would have done it, and there was a mark on the safe where the nail had been driven in—on the bench I found a piece of an old patchwork quilt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), the money belonged to Canon Oakley.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Cumberland Row, Islington—I am em<lb></lb>ployed at the church in Duncan Terrace, I have several duties to perform there—on 5th March, about twenty minutes to 8 o'clock, I saw the prisoner leaning across the bottom railing of the church in company with another man—they were doing nothing—he asked me if Mr. Parry had come, or was he in the sacristy—I told him not; he was not come—there was a third man in the church—he walked about the church examining the side chapels—I asked the prisoner if he knew him—he said not—they remained perhaps 7, 8, or 10 minutes, and then went out at the church door; the gentleman went out by himself, and the prisoner and the other man went out by themselves; soon after I locked up the church, about 9 o'clock, it was all safe then—I locked and bolted the doors—the persons who attended to the church were generally paid on a bench close by the safe—the prisoner would be paid there once a month—the persons who were paid would have the opportunity of seeing where the money was taken from—the organ had not been played on the 4th and 5th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you ask me if I had seen any one go out of the doors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked if you knew the gentleman—I might have said that he looked very suspiciously all about in every nook and corner of the place—I said he examined every side chapel—I said he looked like a gentleman—I believe I once found the doors open after I had locked them—I believe the school boys opened them to go into the school-room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There were no boys in the church on this night when I locked it up, nor anybody at all that I could see; if there was any one there they must have been concealed—no one slept in the sacristy.</p>

               <p>Duncan Street, near the County Court, about 100 yards from the church—there were two men standing talking with him when I came up to them—they passed over to the other side of the street—when I came back from the errand I was sent on in about five minutes, they still remained there talking—I knew the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer N</hi>). On the morning of 6th March, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I received information, and went to the church—I found the safe broken open, the lock broken off—there were marks on it showing that it had been prized up by this nail—Mr. Parry gave me this piece of rag, that might be used to put round the head of the nail to ease the mallet, so as to make no noise—the safe was an old one—in consequence of information, I went and watched the prisoner—I followed him all day long from one public-house to another—I found him first in the Carved Red Lion, at the corner of St. Peter Street, Essex Road, about 11 o'clock in the morning, and I followed him, till 10 o'clock at night, into nearly a dozen public-houses—he paid for nineteen pots of malt liquor—he did not drink it all himself—he had some companions with him—he paid for them—he did not change any gold—he paid generally in silver—the last house he was in was the Blue-coat Boy, in company with five other men—I went in there and told him I should charge him with breaking open an iron safe in St. John's Church, Duncan Terrace, and stealing there from 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, some foreign coins, a gold ring, and a purse—he said "I have got none of the sovereigns. If I am going to be locked up for this, I was there, but you must get the other two with me "—I went and searched a room where he lives in Parsley Court, and there found this piece of old quilt, which corresponds with the piece found in the safe—before the Magistrate the prisoner said "I hope you will settle it here. I plead guilty."—But Mr. Partridge said it was not a case for him to settle; it must go before a Jury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I deny it. The Magistrate cautioned me that anything I said would be taken down. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It was before that he said it—the Magis<lb></lb>trate cautioned him, and then he reserved his defence—I found no marks of violence on the church doors—I did not tell the prisoner there were two other men, and ask him who they were—he was dumb when I took him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have been in search of two other men, one named Michael Kilrose, better known as <hi rend="italic">King Dick</hi>—I have not been able to find them—when anything like this is done, they go tramping—I found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> James Somers says that the place was all safe at 11 o'clock, and I have a witness to prove that I was in bed at 11 o'clock. I went to the church that night thinking there was service. As I was looking at the notice board outside, a man came up to me and said "Is Mr. Parry in the church?" I said "I don't know; I will go and ask for you." I went in and saw the old gentleman who minds the church and asked him, and he said Mr. Parry was not expected that night. I went out and told the man, and went to the corner of Duncan Street with him. I bid him good night, and went straight home, and at 11 o'clock I was in bed. My sister can prove it, and so can Mrs. Randall.</p>

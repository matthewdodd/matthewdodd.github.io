            , No. 33, King-street, Covent-garden; he is a brass founder; I keep a house in Queen-street. On the 28th of January as I was going past St. Paul's, I missed my watch; at first I thought I had left it at home, being Monday, as I frequently had done in my Sunday's cloaths; I know the woman at the bar, she was at my house and did the business of my house; I never made any agreement with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your wife live with you? - Yes, she is related to my wife by her first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200159"></xptr>husband; my wife's first husband was her uncle. I never made any agreement with her as a servant; had she acted as she ought to have done, as far as my ability, I would have rewarded her in the course of time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was she to do? - I considered when she came into the house my wife was but very poorly; I understood there was some difference between her and her husband, and she came into my house and asked my wife to let her be there for a few days; she came then, and when I came home in the evening my wife informed me; this was some time in June last, and the prisoner at the bar asked me whether it would be agreeable for her to sleep there for a few days? I acquiesced in it, understanding she was some relation to my wife by her first husband. On the 28th of January I challenged her with having taken several articles; she acknowledged to some of them; I enquired after the articles, as in searching over my dress I missed my silver buckles; I lost my articles, and consequently I was to enquire after them; I found she had pledged my silver buckles I charged her with, my black coat I also charged her with; she wished God would strike her dead if she knew any thing of my silver buckles or my black coat; I charged her also with several other articles I missed at certain times; some of the articles she owned to having pledged, to the amount of about 1 l. 6 s.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to her to induce her to own to these articles? - I told her if she would give me up the duplicates of the articles that she had pledged, I would not prosecute her, but she did not give me up the duplicates, for this was on Tuesday or Wednesday; after the 28th she told me where the things were, part of them, but she told me they were pledged in Tottenham court-road; she did not give a just account where they were, nor a just account of all the duplicates; there was one duplicate brought to me afterwards by her own husband, sent by her to me. I missed many other articles besides.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the husband come to see her at your house? - Yes, he had been there several times, I cannot tell how often, as I am obliged to be away from home from morning till night, and my wife being ill ever since June last; I missed all the things in the indictment at different times; I cannot tell what is missing, because I was not in the way altogether to know; when I told her I would not prosecute her, I was not sensible of my loss.</p>
               <p>Q. Where these the things you missed before you told her you would not prosecute her, if she would give up the duplicates? - Yes, they were taken at different times; I know no more to my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I suppose you had a good opinion of this woman? - I had a very great opinion of her, or else I should not have trusted her; I placed the greatest confidence in her; I believe all the things in the indictment are present.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say that you will be able to recollect a little more than what you have told us Mr. Heath, it was a long time before we learned that she was so near a relation; now you talk about duplicates and so on, and that you had a very good opinion of this woman; perhaps you had a very good opinion of a woman named Margerett Carr? - I took her up at the same time; I charged her with the constable,

               <p>Q. I see her name is struck out of the back of the bill? - I really cannot find her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her last? - The last time was at the police office in Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200160"></xptr>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - of you please; I don't know to my knowledge that I have seen her since.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know whether or not you have seen a woman that you have charged with a robbery? - I have not seen her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you attend at the police office? - On the 13th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. As it is only thirteen days ago since you see her, you can tell us positively whether you have seen Margerett Carr since? - I have not seen her since</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear that positively? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you say before you had not seen her to your knowledge? - Because I was willing to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not mean to swear positively that you have not seen her? - I have not seen her.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will tell you; do you know a Mr. Broughton? - I don't know the name.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Margerett Carr leave your service? - On the 28th of January or 29th; I will not take on me to say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Whom did she go to live with? - I told her not to let me see her face any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she go to live with? - She is a chairwoman I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you believe she is a chairwoman? - Because I understand she acted as a chairwoman at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she live as a regular servant there? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever recollect saying this, that you would certainly hang that woman there, but you would spare Carr? - I never said any such word.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath do not you know this fact, that every one of these things, which are produced from the pawnbroker's, were pawned by Margerett Carr and in her name? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not seen the duplicates? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these not all in the name of Margerett Carr? - No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have not seen this Margerett Carr at any friend's house? - No, not since she was at the police office.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon before she was at the police office had you seen her at any friend's? - I cannot say, I saw her on the 28th or 29th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. At what friend's house? - At no friend's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that this Margerett Carr has been in Newgate under a charge of felony? - I never heard that she was in Newgate, or any other place of confinement.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, as these things have been going frequently, you have had occasion to complain of other persons who had robbed you? - I have had occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. That person was in your family down to the present time. Have you not had occasion to charge one of your children with robbing you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor ever suspected them? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray who bailed Margerett Carr? - She was bound over, I understand, by Mr.

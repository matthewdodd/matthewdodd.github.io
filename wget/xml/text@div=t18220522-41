The prisoners were strangers; I think I have seen them in the house before. On the 25th of February they came to look at some wedding-rings about ten o'clock in the morning; nobody else was in the shop. I shewed them some on cards; they stopped about ten minutes and bought none. I shewed them three cards, they returned the first two - Bury had the card in her hand last; I told her there was one missing from the third. They had each tried on rings; she said she knew nothing of it - there ought to have been nine rings on it. Mr. Hatton came in and they were both taken into the parlour, and an officer sent for; the ring was not found; they refused to be searched except by a female, but the officer at last searched them; they only had one shilling and a farthing in money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Bury did not ask for the rings - A. No. They said nothing about paying one shilling at a time - the rings were sewed on the cards; there were nine on the third card.</p>

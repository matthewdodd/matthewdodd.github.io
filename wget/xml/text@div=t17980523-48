               <p>Q. Who was this woman? - A. A married woman that I had known some years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she upon the town? - A. No; they pleaded poverty, and said they were out of place; I treated them, the woman left us, and wished us a good night; I sat with them half an hour in the parlour, she went home, and I meant to do the same, it was at the corner of Coventry-street; I went about a quarter of a mile, as soon as the woman had left me, to go home; the prisoner Wild accosted me, he had followed me, he asked me if I had missed of the woman; I said, she was gone home; he said, she was not gone home, he knew where she was gone, if I would permit him, he would shew me where she was; I was guided by him down Princes-street to Coventry-street again, to a court in <placeName id="t17980523-48-crimeloc259">Whitcomb-street</placeName>

             in the same kind of manner, and told him there was a friend of his at the public-house would be glad to speak to him, accordingly he went very calmly; Robinson, as soon as I took him into the public-house, went upon his knees, and begged for forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you sent for a constable, or after? - A. Before; the prisoner, John Wild, said he knew nothing at all of the matter, and went very calm to the public-house, where I found Robinson and the constable; the two prisoners consulted each other, Wild said he was innocent of it, and knew nothing at all of it. Robinson offered me any satisfaction; he said he was going into the cavalry, and was to have thirty guineas bounty, and I should have satisfaction out of that; they were then taken before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Have the notes ever been found? - A. No; I do not know the numbers; nor the person I took them of did not know the numbers.</p>

             I never saw before that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners, are you sure you saw those two men on the night that was mentioned? - A. Yes, I am sure of it; this was on the Friday evening, and on the Saturday evening, I saw both of them in Coventry-street, just upon the spot where I saw Wild the night before Mr. Webley had asked me to go out to see for them.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Webley.) You told me you were knocked down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that had you felt your pocket-book in your pocket? - A. Not five minutes; it was in my inside coat pocket, the right-hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you put the notes into it? - A. The same day I took them in Bond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the same pocket with your handkerchief? - A. No, my handkerchief was outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you at all tell when the pocket-book and the handkerchief went? - A. I cannot say; I am convinced that it went when I was down, for the prisoner, Robinson, laid upon me some time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Wild doing at that time? - A. Wild persuaded him not to hurt me, his friend he called me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Wild help you up? - A. No, he did not; I turned the other over as soon as I could; I felt myself in danger, and thought I must help myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be? - A. I suppose about three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober? - A. Yes; I knew them again as soon as I saw them.</p>
               <p>Larner. He was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Webley.) You hear what the girl says, were you in liquor? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Have you any reason to suppose the prisoners knew of your having the Bank-notes about you? - A. No; on the contrary I said I had no money.</p>
               <p>Larner. He was in liquor; he said he had no money about him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wild. Did not Webley say he had no money, and offered you his watch to have connections with you? - A. He offered me his watch, but I refused it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where was that? - A. At the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he offer you his watch for? - A. To stay out with me all night; but I knew he was a married man, and had a large family, and I was a married woman, and he knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before the two prisoners? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Robinson. Did not Webley tell you he did not miss his pocket-book till he got home? - A. He told me he missed his property when he got home; and that some time before he had the misfortune to think he had lost a note, and some time after he found it in a place where his wife had put it; that she had taken it out of his pocket when he was intoxicated with liquor, and he thought he had lost it by being in bad company.</p>
               <p>Wild's defence. I parted with this man in Sydney's-alley, and then I parted with Robinson; I met the prosecutor again, talking to a woman, I asked him if he was not gone home, he said, no; I said, if he would give me leave, I would see him home, as he was very much intoxicated; we were going through a court I met Robinson, and he run against him, and he fell down, and then he got up, and struck Robinson, and then run away.</p>
               <p>Robinson's defence. The prosecutor was so very much intoxicated, that the landlord of the house would not let him have any more; I happened to meet this gentleman, and I happened to touch him, and he was so very much intoxicated that a very little thing would make him fall; he did fall several times; the next day the woman said that he had been after us; we told her we would go and clear up the point; I went up to see for him; I met with him; he offered to treat me with a pint of beer, and when I went into the house with him, he charged a constable with me; he said if we would give him eight pounds, he would make it up; I told him I was going into the horse cavalry, and I would sooner give him money than he should send me to prison.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Robinson. He wanted eight pounds before I offered him any thing.</p>
               <p>Webley. I did; but it was in order to make him acknowledge the robbery.</p>

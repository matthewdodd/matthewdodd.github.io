            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 42, Shoreditch - I have a coat and pair of boots pawned by the prisoner on the 6th of February; but, as I stated at the Police-office, I thought she had been sent with them by her parents, that they might come and get them for nothing - some time ago this man was living with another wife, who, I believe, was his lawful wife, and he in a very bad way obtained a jacket of me; but I gave it up rather than have any more trouble about it; I never heard any more of him till the morning the prisoner pawned these goods; and soon after she had pawned them, I saw him come and stand opposite my shop; he went away and came and stood there again for some time, and the next morning I heard that these things had been stolen - I said I was sorry I had taken them in, but I would not give them up, for I had given away pounds worth of things sooner than come here - when the prosecutor was at the office, he stated that he had not seen the girl all day, but I feel certain from his coming before my door that he had seen her just after she pawned them.</p>

             re-examined. The jacket that he states I got from him was one he took in unmade - I know not why he states what he has, unless it is because he was forced to give up that jacket - when I got up in the morning, I went out to look for my daughter, and I did this in order that she might be taken from her bad companions - I married my present wife in 1810, there was another woman who passed as my wife.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where is that wife? A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your life how many wives have you had? A. This one and the other I lived with.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that you have not had two wives at once? A. Yes, I have; and they are both alive - I was tried here for bigamy, and fined 1s. - I allow my other wife 1s. 6d. a week for the child.</p>

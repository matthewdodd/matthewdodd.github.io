               <p>What did the prisoner say to that? - He said nothing, I sent for a constable, when the constable came, he said he brought it from Chelsea, he was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>I am sure Alderman Le Mesurier's lamp was lost from his house on Tuesday the 13th of this month, about twelve I went into the country, and the lamp was hanging in the passage, I came home about five in the evening, and the lamp was gone, it was the passage lamp; the other witness Rouviere was in town, I knew the lamp, this burner was broke before, and I broke<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140108"></xptr> off one of these knobs about a fortnight or three weeks before, upon the whole I am very certain this must be the lamp.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a clerk to Mr. Le Mesurier, coming to the compting-house at my usual time, about four o'clock, I saw a man in the passage taking down the lamp, I had no suspicion he was a thief, I did not take particular notice of him, I passed by and went to the compting-house about my business, I did not ask any questions, I know nothing further.</p>
               <p>Do you know the man again? - No, it was rather dark and I could not distinguish the man, I thought it was somebody taking it down to mend or clean it, there was another clerk in the house, and the maid.</p>
               <p>How did the man get in? - The street door which goes to the compting-house is always open.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday evening, about half past three or four, I was coming from Shoreditch, I had been to see an old shopmate of mine, and coming through a passage near Wood-street, a man was running in a white coat, on his seeing me a man laid down the lamp upon some dirt, it is true that I suspected it to be stolen, and that gentleman, the clerk, he declared before the Alderman that it was a man in a white coat genteely dressed that he saw take the lamp, and he said I was not the person.</p>
               <p>Court to Lewis. What time did the prisoner bring the lamp to your house? - At a little after four.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mr. Rouviere the question.</p>
               <p>Rouviere. The man that I saw taking down the lamp had on a light-coloured coat, and appeared to me rather taller than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court to Lewis. What cloaths had the prisoner on when he came to you? - The same he has on now, a dark-coloured cloth coat.</p>
               <p>Court to Rouviere. Can you say with any degree of certainty whether the man you saw was or was not the prisoner? - He was not to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have one more thing to say, with your permission, when Mr. Lewis sent his servant to Mrs. Philips, I followed the servant two or three minutes after, and I left the servant at Mrs. Philips's, and returned to Mr. Lewis, to desire I might have the property since there was no owner to it, and I had not stole it.</p>
               <p>Court to Lewis. If I understand you, your servant and him went together? - He followed my servant, and came back by himself directly, when he came back, he said the lamp was his property, and if I did not pay him the seven shillings and sixpence, he would take it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. How came you to contrive this false story? - I beg your pardon, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Rouviere. You did not see any other person, but the one that was taking down the lamp in the passage? - I did not.</p>
               <p>And you rather think that the person that was taking down the lamp, was not the prisoner? - I do.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the prisoner tells these different stories, none of which are supported by evidence, and they seem to leave little or no doubt whether he came honestly by it, but the question is, whether he has committed the fact mentioned in the indictment, he is charged with stealing it, but yet if he stole it, he must be actually present at the time; for if he received it from the person that stole it afterwards, though guilty, he is not guilty of the crime charged in this indictment; now Mr. Rouviere saw the person take down the lamp, whoever that person was, that was the person that stole it; I am affraid therefore, that you have no evidence that he was the man that committed the fact, though he came dishonestly by this lamp.</p>

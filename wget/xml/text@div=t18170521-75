On the 14th of May, I was at the White Lion public-house, in Field-lane. I had a pint of beer, and stopped there about three quarters of an hour. I was not in company with any body. I observed two or three young men and women there. I had a shawl on; when I went out, two young men, who stood at the door, followed me down <placeName id="t18170521-75-crimeloc376">Field-lane</placeName>

I had seen enough of them to know them again; one of them asked me where I was going. I said I was going home; they stopped me three or four doors down, and one of them put their hands round my neck. I said what do you want of me. The prisoner took my shawl off - He had hold of me, but he is not the one that had hold of my neck; the other man pressed my throat - They both ran towards the White Lion again - I said they had taken my shawl. A man said, "never mind, I will find him for you." I described them to the waiter, and went home. The next morning I returned to inquire for them, and went to Barnett, and described them to him. I am quite sure the prisoner is the man. He was taken up the next day. I have seen my shawl in the possession of Barnett.</p>
               <p>ANN GAVERNOR. I was at the White Lion public-house, and saw Reece there, and some men at the same time-the room was almost full of people-Mrs. Reece was by herself; I was not there ten minutes, but saw her go out, and two or three men followed her; I noticed them before they went out-the prisoner is one of them - He left the house after Mrs. Reece; I met him again in Holborn, about a quarter of an hour after-there were two or three of them - I went to the coffee-shop with them - They treated me; the prisoner gave the man of the house the shawl, and said, "take this: we want coffee for it for four of us." He left it there. I am sure he is the man that gave the shawl. I know that Mrs. Reece had the shawl on when she went out; this was the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you swear, that I left it, or did you do it yourself - A. He left it himself. I knew him before by frequently seeing him. I heard of the robbery, and told Barnett.</p>
               <p>HYAM BARNETT. I am an officer, and have got the shawl. I obtained it from the coffee-shop, in Field-lane, the day after the robbery; the man could not tell his name. The Magistrate said I could not apprehend him.</p>
               <p>JOHN BARNLEY. I am a constable, and got information of the robbery. The next day (after the robbery), I was walking down Field-lane, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and saw two girls fighting. The prisoner was there; and, within hearing, one of them said, "you shan't have the shawl." I took both the prisoner and the girls into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I came out, Gavernor came out with me. I picked the shawl off the ground; the woman was not within 20 yards of it at the time. I gave it to Gavernor, we then went to the coffee-shop, and she pledged the shawl for the coffee.</p>

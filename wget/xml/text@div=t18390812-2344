                  </hi>. I am a dyer, and live in Rathbone-place. The prisoner was my sbopwoman for three months—she left my service on the 15th of July—on the 13th of July I sent a bill to Mrs. Medina by one of my boys—I wrote a receipt on it—my boy brought the bill back—I left it with the prisoner upon the counter, to keep it ready, because the boy said they would call in the evening, and bring the money—this is the bill and receipt I made out—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—in the evening I asked the prisoner if Mrs. Medina had not sent the money—she said, "No"—I have never received the money from her—I inquired again in the morning of her, and she said she had not received it.</p>

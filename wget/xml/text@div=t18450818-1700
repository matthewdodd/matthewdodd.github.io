                  </hi>. I live in Cooper's-row, Wapping. On the 7th of July I went to a public-house in Butler's-buildings, with another woman to have a pint of half-and-half—the prisoner came in and called for some beer—she began to talk—I turned a bit, and she said, "It is you, you old <hi rend="italic">faggot</hi> that I am talking to"—I said, "Mrs. Wall, I am not speaking to you," and with that she threw what beer she had in the jug in my face—I stooped to lift my apron to wipe the beer out of my eyes, and she struck me with the earthen jug, and cut my head open—I was taken to the hospital in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and was there till my head was shaved and dressed.</p>

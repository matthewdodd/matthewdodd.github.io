               <p>Q. Did any other person live in the same room with you. - A. None at all except a young child. I took the prisoner in for her victuals and drink, and a shilling a week to take care of my young child, I go out with a barrow, she came to me at ten o'clock in the morning, on Saturday the 12th of this month, and staid till four in the afternoon, she then returned the child and key to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave your lodgings that day. - A. At one o'clock I took the prisoner with me where I pitched my barrow, because she should know where to bring the child to me in the afternoon to give her the breast, when I had pitched my barrow she went away and took my child with her and the key of the room, she returned to me in the afternoon with the child, and delivered me the key, when I looked about she was gone, I returned home at half after eight in the evening, keeping my child all that time, when I returned I found my room door locked, I unlocked it with the key and went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left any money in your room at the time you went out. - A. Yes, I left ten dollars, a one pound note, a half crown piece, and thirteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this money of yours put. - A. In a locker in my box, I had seen it safe in my box a little before eight o'clock, I left the box under the bed, when I returned the box was near the fire, not where I had left it, the lock of the box was broken, and all my money and note was gone. Between nine and ten the same night I saw the prisoner in a cellar in Bembridge Street, I gave her in charge of the watchman, she was taken to the watchhouse, in the watchhouse she owned to the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it first said to her that it would be better for her to tell. - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must not say what she said, there was none of the money found upon her. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was another person lived in the same room with Mrs. Fitzgerald.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTRIX. There was not.</p>

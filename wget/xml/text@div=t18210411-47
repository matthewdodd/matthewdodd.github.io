On the 12th of March, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, we went out together. I took the key of the door with me; the window was shut down, and the property all safe. My little boy came home between five and six, he then came and alarmed me, I went back, found my bed turned up and the sheets gone, with the rest of the property. On the 14th, I found the prisoner in Jenning's-buildings, Kensington, with my apron on her lap, and the cotton-box just by her, also a waistcoat.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Carradine, a publican. I went on the 12th of March to Burton's house, about twenty minutes after four o'clock, I called for the pots at the door - the door was fastened. I was going round the corner, and saw the prisoner at the window, with the window open, and a child in her arms. I asked if Mrs. Burton was in, as I thought she was talking to Mrs. Burton, she said she did not know, that Mrs. Burton had three gowns of hers to make, and had had them three month, and she had either pawned or sold them - I went away.</p>

I am mate of the vessel <hi rend="italic">Jane and Mary</hi>—on Tuesday, 10th December, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was in bed in the bunk in the cabin—the cabin-boy was lying on the floor—the master and a friend came on board between eleven and twelve with the prisoner, who was the waterman—there was a locker alongside my bed, where the prisoner sal, and there was a purse on the locker containing 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the master told the boy to prepare the supper—in consequence of what the boy said to me I went on deck and asked the prisoner if he had got the purse—he said, "What purse?"—I said, "The purse that laid oh the</p>

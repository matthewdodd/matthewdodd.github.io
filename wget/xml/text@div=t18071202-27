On the 24th of October, about one o'clock, the prisoner came to my house; I had occasion to go into the yard to hand out a quilt, and when I came in the prisoner was gone; the watch and gown was gone; the watch was hanging by the fire place, and the gown was also by her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen them since. - A. No, I found my door open. I did not see the prisoner take them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been out of the room. - A. Two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner before. - A. Yes, she has been in the habit of coming to my house several times, upon account of her husband and my son being in the guards; I have never seen my gown nor watch since; somebody might come in and take them, God knows.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the fact; the occasion that brought me to Mrs. Moore's house that morning, was my husband and her son had been in a French prison for five years; I went to tell her what I heard at the transport office; I came up to Stepney to get my marriage lines; I went out of her house, I intended to return; whether she went in the yard or no I cannot say. I went into the clerk's house, he was not at home; coming along the street, I met with a person that took me in a public house; that detained me. I went into her house no more.</p>

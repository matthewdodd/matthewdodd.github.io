I am coachman to Mr. Praed—I have seen the prisoner in our stable in Seymour News, and have given him money—I thought he was in distress—he was out of a situation—on the 18th of June, he called and left my stable at one o'clock—I had a box in my room—I unlocked it at one o'clock, and saw my money there then—I then left my keys in it by mistake—there were three sovereigns, and one half sovereign, and one half crown in it—I returned in the evening about six or eight—I wanted to go to the box—I missed my keys, and could not find them—I broke the box the next morning, and missed the money—the prisoner was taken on the Saturday evening following—I asked him what he had done with the keys—he said he had not seen them—the next day at the office be acknowledged to me that he had opened the box, and had put the keys behind a box in John's room—I sent a man to look about—they have not been found.</p>

On the 18th of June, the prisoner came to me and asked if he could go up stairs—I followed him up—he asked if I was not going into the house—I said, "Yes "—he asked me to slip the bolt, that he might hear if any one came in—I did so, and returned in ten minutes—I came back—he was sitting on the box</p>

On the Thursday evening, about seven o'clock, he was in the yard, and he told me he had paid his rent, which was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which he owed.—I saw he had some money—on the Saturday following I saw him at the Crown public-house—I told him there was some one after him, and asked him how he was going on—he said miserably, and said he was wretched.</p>

I took the prisoner, and asked if he knew Mr. Praed's coachman—he said, "Yes, very well; I am innocent"—I said, "You must go with me, and see him"—I had not made any charge then against him—I took him into a shop, and found one sovereign, one half sovereign, one shilling, and some copper on him.</p>

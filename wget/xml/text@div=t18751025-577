I am a carman, employed by George Bartholomew &amp; Co., of Finsbury Pavement, upholsterers—about 10 o'clock on the morning of 18th September, I was loading a van at the bank entrance in Little Moorfields, and from what a gentleman said to me I ran round into Short Street, where I saw the prisoner—he had this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under his arm, which contain a tablecover, value 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I stopped him—he gave mo the parcel and asked me to let him go—I sent for a constable and gave him in charge—I had seen the parcel almost immediately before close against the door-step—I had just turned round in the van packing some goods away when the gentleman spoke to me.</p>

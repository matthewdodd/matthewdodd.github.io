            . I am a housekeeper; I live in Camden town; I have some houses in St. Giles's; I was in town this Saturday night; coming past this house I heard watch and murder cry; I saw one of the lodgers at the door of the house; and I saw the prosecutor within; the woman had hold of him by the coat; I asked the man what was the matter; he said he had been robbed; I pushed the door open with my knee; then they wanted to give the man an old gilt watch; I told the man not to take any but his own; there is none else in the house but common women. Mr. Dancer is the owner of the house, he is the clerk of Bedford chapel; he is a fine man to say amen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have washed his clothes for these six months; he came to my house on Saturday evening; I told him I had a duplicate of a watch to sell; he said when he took his money at Somerset house he would pay me for his washing; he was to give me three pounds for the watch; instead of that he only gave me one pound five shillings.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was to give her five shillings and no more; she never washed for me; she robbed me of a shirt the first night.</p>
               <p>Q. She robbed you of a shirt the first night, and you go to her the second night. Did you know this to be a place for common women of the town - A. Afterwards I did; she told me it was her brother's watch that died.</p>

On Friday evening 18th Feb., about a quarter to 8 o'clock, Connelly came to my shop and produced a gold watch in a bag, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—he wanted 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; I asked him if he would not take 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said, "Oh, no"—I asked him where he got it; he said the mate of a ship gave it to him to sell—I asked where the matewas</p>

I have known Phillips some time—on 18th Feb., about 9 o'clock in the evening I saw him near the London Docks, between the Three Crowns and the Blue Anchor in Dock-street—he showed me a watch' which he said was gold, and asked me if I would buy it—I said I had no money that would buy it; he told me to take it if I liked, and try and sell it—I took it—I saw him on the Monday following at my own house, and went out with him (the watch was then at the Three Crowns, I had given it to Mr. George May, the landlord, to keep for me)—I told Phillips to tell me the truth how he got the watch, he told me he bought it of the mate of a ship; I asked him bow much be gave for it; he said, "5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he did not say what ship the mate belonged to—in the course of the day he told me he bad two large chains as thick as my finger, and asked if I would buy them of him, and if I knew the price of them; he did not show them to me—I told him I had lost the watch out of my pocket; that was not true, I told him so because he said he had got more, and I thought I might get the others—he said it was a bad job—Connelly was not present then, but I saw him and Phillips about two days afterwards—Phillips wanted me to give him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for another watch that he had, and I said if I had 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by me I should not be so far back in my stock as I was—they wanted me to give the watch up to them, and I wanted to persuade them that I bad not got it—Connelly said it was a bad job between the lot of us, and asked Phillips where the watches were; Phillips said he did not know where they were—Connelly said he would get fourteen years or fair rations for the watches, and also that he would <hi rend="italic">burst his boiler</hi>, or get fair rations out of it—that means that be would give information to the police or else have a share of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a weigher, in Her Majesty's Customs. On 16th Feb. I examined a box in the presence of Mr. Ryder, in the Queen's warehouse, at the Custom House; it contained five gold watches; I opened one of them, and found no maker's name—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) to be the one—there is some inscription on it, but no name on it—it is very rare that watches are imported without the maker's name—that is the reason that they were brought to the Queen's warehouse—I noticed that the Arabic characters on the face of one were much larger than on the others; this is the one—I did not weigh these chains, they do not go by weight.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are not they Roman characters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I may misapply the term, but these figures are larger than the rest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief officer of the <hi rend="italic">Australian.</hi> I received from Hill a small parcel, containing watches; I locked it up for a short time in the cabin, as I thought it was dangerous for it to lie about—I afterwards opened the iron treasury tank, and put it in—the tank was afterwards fastened with two padlocks—I think it was on Thursday, 17th Feb.—I recognize the prisoners' faces as being at work on board the ship, but I cannot say that they are either of the men to whom I gave the parcel—the vessel was afterwards obliged to put back into Plymouth, and I received a communication from London, in consequence of which I examined the treasury tank at Plymouth, and missed the parcel—we had then been out t week possibly—I made a careful and thorough search, because I am responsible for all the treasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You do not know who you handed the box to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was not examined before the Magistrate; we were on our first trip from Plymouth—we were all busy enough at Plymouth, but I am able to say that the box was not to be found, because when the telegraphic message came down I had all the treasure out, and I recollect the circumstance through losing my dinner in consequence—I do not know how many men were employed on board at the time I handed the box down—there are four officers of the vessel; they were all on board, but none of them stowed away the things in the treasury—I was there as chief officer, superintending the things being put into the tank, and I handed this parcel down myself—when parcels are put in, the treasury is locked immediately, and the keys are handed to me—I trust ordinary workmen with the treasure; they are the persons sent there; I had no one else to hand this box down to; there was none of the ship's crew there at the time—I handed several cases of jewellery down also, but everything was safe except this box.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where is the treasury room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Under the saloon, directly under the cabin table—you get to it from the second deck—a man working in the hold would have no means whatever of getting there—when the treasury is opened, four padlocks have to betaken off the tanks, and then there is only a small hole to put things into—there is nothing but that aperture, w that nobody could have taken anything out, except the person who was the tank—the prisoners had access to the treasury—they were placing ballast down by the sides of the tank, about five feet down—the company is called Australian Royal Mail Steam Navigation Company.</p>

               <p>in the treasury on 17th or 18th Feb.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot be positive, but I believe Connelly was handing <hi rend="italic">Kintz</hi> down—they could not get at the treasury from the hold, as there is a very strong bulk-head—they were employed on board the ship on Thursday and Friday, the 17th and 18th, and on Saturday too.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Connelly's Defence.</hi> I was at work on the vessel; I went to the gentleman's house and got my money, and then went home and had tea with my wife; I went out, and met this man; he said he had three watches; I asked where he got them; he said from the mate of a ship; I asked him what ship; be said, "A ship called the <hi rend="italic">Maria.</hi>" and asked me to go with him, and ascertain the value of them, and said he would pay me; he told me if I could get 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for one, I was to take it; I went in, and offered the watch for sale; the gentleman offered me. 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked me if it belonged to me; I told him no, it belonged to the mate of a ship; he asked me where the mate was; I told him I could not tell him, but my mate could; he said, "Is this your friend, at the door?" I said, yes; he asked him to come in, and he told him the name of the ship; he said, "Supposing I give the watch to a policeman, and give you the money, will you fetch the mate of the ship here?" I said I did not know where he was; he sent out for a policeman, and Phillips walked out; I walked out to see where he went to, I did not know which way he vent, and of course I made my escape myself; he had given me another watch, which I had in my band, with the glass broken; I only knew him by working on the <hi rend="italic">Australian</hi> with him; I was looking for him on Monday morning, and met a young man who worked on board the <hi rend="italic">Australian</hi>; I asked him if he knew where Phillips lived; be told me near the London Docks; I inquired there, and found him; he was not sober; I waited there till he was sober, and we went out; I asked him if he had seen the man who gave him the watches; he said no; and asked me what I had done with the watch; I said 1 had got it at home; we went to a public-house, and I told him I would have nothing more to do with it; I never even worked in the place where the watches were, and never went into the place.</p>

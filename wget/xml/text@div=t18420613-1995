                  </hi>. I am a labourer; I came from Bedfordshire. I met the prisoner at the Crown and Nelson Arms, at Woolwich—he began to talk about soldiering, and wanted me to be a soldier—I said I was not tall enough—I at last agreed to be a soldier—I went with him to the Prince of Wales, then <hi rend="italic">to</hi> another place, which he said was a guardhouse,—I was to sleep there if I did not pay for another place, and I gave bin 3s. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. sooner than remain in the guard-house all night—I thought I m enlisted for a soldier—he told me I had, and said I must pay the half-crown and the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or else go to the guard-house all night, I might do which I liked—I said I would pay him rather than <hi rend="italic">go</hi> there—he told me if I did not he should put me into the guard-house, to stop there till twelve o'clock the next day, and have half a pound of bread, and one print of water—I should not have paid him the money if it had not been fort* threat of going to the guard-house—I thought he would have taken next there—when I enlisted, the prisoner gave me 1$., and I gave him half-a-crown and the shilling back again, in order to keep from the guard-house</p>

               <p>—I have been to inquire at the barracks since, and they said I would not do, I was too short.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> In about ten minutes after I had given him the shilling I asked him to give it back again, if he was sorry for what he had done—he said, "Will you enlist me for a soldier?"—I said, "Yes," and I gave him a shilling—he never gave me the half-crown nor shilling back again—if he pave me the half-crown, why did he not report me to the police that night? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He told me, unless I gave him half-a-crown and a shilling, he would take me into a wood, where there was a guard-house, and let me lie there till twelve o'clock next day, and then he should bring me half-a-pound of bread and a pint of water—I do not know when I was to come out, I am sure—he did not take the money from me—I gave it to him—I told him I would rather pay the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. than sleep in the guard-house—he had a man with him who he said was his father.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at the Prince of Wales, at Woolwich—I saw the prisoner and prosecutor—the prosecutor wanted to stay at my house till nine o'clock—the prisoner told him he should go then to the barracks—he dragged him to the bar—he made a disturbance—I put him out, and told him to go to the barracks, if the man want a soldier.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 228.) I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner on Sunday night, about a quarter to nine o clock, near the rope-yard rails, in a road which leads to a wood, or to the barracks—the prosecutor was following the prisoner, and trying to get something from him, but I did not notice it—on the next day he went to the barracks, and the commanding officer sent the prisoner to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I am in the 73rd Regiment; it is my duty to enlist any man—I never received the half-crown or shilling of him; he refused going to the barracks with me; there was an old man with me, but I did not say he was my father; he gave me a drop of beer; I took it, and said, "Good health, father;" the prosecutor said he could not go till nine o'clock the next day. I said if I waited for him I should get put into the guard-house; that was what I said.</p>

On the 30th of May I lost a pair of blue trousers and a pair of boots - I gave a little boy leave to take a pail of water; I did not watch him out, but when he was gone I missed these things; I do not know who he was, but there had been no other person there after him - the door of the room was not open, he must have opened it; these are my son's boots and trousers - he is thirteen years of age.</p>

            . About half-past nine o'clock I was on the wharf, the prisoner came, knocked at the door, and sat down by the fire with me - he said, "Here is a good pair of stampers;" (meaning shoes) - I saw him take a pair of trousers from under his arm, which appeared to me to be black; he said he went into this lady's house for a pail of water for Cummings - he saw the trousers in the bed-room, went in and took them; I said he had better take them back to save all row about it, as the woman would know them if he wore them - he doubled up the trousers, and asked me if I would go with him down the wharf; I said No, I was going to bed - I saw no more of him till Monday.</p>

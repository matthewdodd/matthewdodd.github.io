Moses' stable in Sussex-mews, with this basket full of corn—he brought it up the yard, went through a public houses, through about three back streets, and round to Huntsworth-mews, where a young man met him—he went to a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> house, went up stairs, I followed him—when he got up he asked where the father was; a man in the next room, in bed, hal<lb></lb>looed out, "Here am I"—the prisoner looked round and saw me standing behind him; he looked confused—there was a woman there; she seemed confused—she asked me what I wanted—I said, "I am a police-officer; I want to know whose property that is"—the prisoner said, "It is my own"—he had then got the basket half-way into the door of the room—I seized it—we had a struggle up to the corner—the prisoner said to the boy, "Take the basket away," but the boy did not—the prisoner said, "I don't know that you are a constable; show your authority"—I took out my staff, and he said, "I will go with you"—in going down he tried to turn the basket over, and said he would give me any money not to take him—I took him to his master.</p>

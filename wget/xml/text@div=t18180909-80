About two o'clock, I saw him in the hold, buttoning up his clothes, which excited my suspicion-the tea chests were there. I asked him, what he had been doing? he said nothing. I observed a chest of tea broken, and a great deal scattered about; I told him, I was sure he had been stealing the tea, and he should not leave without being examined. I called four men. who were discharging the tea, to see him searched, He then unbuttoned his clothes, and took a white handkerchief from his back, which contained the tea - He said nothing. Mr. Maxwell came afterward, the prisoner then said he knew nothing of it.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. I took the prisoner in charge. Brooks, the superintendent, said he was sorry to see a man of his appearance charged with such an offence; he said, I took it for our breakfast, He afterwards said the handkerchief did not belong to him, and he knew nothing of the tea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he never took any tea, except for breakfast - A. He might; the tea was found when he spoke.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BROOKS. I am superintendent of that part of the docks, On the 27th of August the prisoner was brought to me; I told him I was very sorry to see him commit himself for so small a quantity of tea - He made no reply. He said at last he did not mean to hurt me or the Revenue, for it was only a little he took for his breakfast. The chest appeared recently broken.</p>

            , and myself, took some hemp out of a craft lying at Iron-gate, into a lug-boat.</p>
               <p>Q. By what authority did you take it? - A. We stole it out of a lighter; we took it up to Ranelagh gardens; it might be about twelve or one o'clock in the morning when we took it out of the lighter: when we came to Ranelagh-gardens, between three and four in the morning, Brandall went ashore to call Mr. Hardy; when he returned again, Hardy and Ridley were with him; the hemp was put into a summer-house and was weighed; we put it into the summer-house, and Ridley assisted us; Hardy was at the weighing of it; it was a summer house belonging to Ranelagh-gardens; Ridley was the gardener.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the scales? - A. I do not know; there were about fifteen or sixteen hundred weight of it; I cannot say justly to a hundred weight; I left it in the summer house, and Ridley and Hardy with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now state when you applied to Hardy for any money? - A. It might be four or five days after I received a guinea on account of the hemp from Mr. Hardy; I told him that was very little; he said, he was very sorry he could not give us any more, for he had not got the money for that hemp that we had taken him up; in about a week, or rather more, I received another guinea of him; he told me he had sent the hemp to Reading, in Berkshire; he desired us to bring him up a little more hemp,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080098"></xptr>and a little black flax that he wanted, and he could sell that for ready money; he said, as soon as he had got the ready money, he would pay us for what he had had, and likewise for that too; we told him, if he could not pay for what he had had, he could not pay for any more.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Brandall? - A. A shoe-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Allen? - A. A waterman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were taken up for stealing hemp? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the sight of hemp frighten you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. From what motives do you now come here? A. I wished to make it known for justice.</p>
               <p>Q. For the mere love of justice? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Merely that the guilty persons might be punished? - A. And for my own safety.</p>
               <p>Q. Now which of those two motives happened to be the most powerful, the love of justice, or the desire of safety? - A. The desire of safety.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a great many examinations before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you recollect seeing me there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a pretty long examination before I had the pleasure of seeing you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sheets of paper might it fill? - A. It might be two or three sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had a copy of your examination to read and refresh your memory? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had it from the housekeeper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you pay any thing for the copy? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You have been kept in custody at the Marine Police-office ever since? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you look at your examination last? - A. Last night.</p>
               <p>Q. You read it instead of your Bible, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it given you for? - A. To look over.</p>
               <p>Q. With directions to you to look it over? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you carried it about you, in your pocket? - A. No; it laid in the housekeeper's room; I looked at it sometimes to rub up my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. This is not the first time you have been in this Court? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been here? - A. Only once, eight years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. That was as a prisoner-were not you here last session? - A. Yes, as a witness.</p>
               <p>The trial took place on a Monday.</p>

               <p>Q. What were you tried for then? - A. A robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. By land, or by water? - A. By water.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was tried with you? - A. Germaine and Perry.</p>
               <p>Q. Hardy kept a rope walk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you arrested him for the money? - A. Brandall spoke to an attorney to arrest him; we could not get our money from him.</p>

No; one of them, his name was Bob, and the other Brandall, whom I have heard called Shakespeare Hardy, and I went down to them; Brandall came to me, and knocked at the house door of Ranelagh, and told me he had brought some hemp for Mr. Hardy; then I went and fetched Mr. Hardy; he desired to see it weighed, and I got some scales from Ranelagh house, and it was weighed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to give them permission to come into Ranelagh gardens, and Ranelagh house? - A. Hardy told me he had got leave of one of the proprietors.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the hemp put? - A. In the water-gate house, which is a sort of summer-house at the bottom of the garden.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a largish bulk of hemp? - A. Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080099"></xptr>Q. Are you much acquainted with notes? - A. No; I gave that note to Brandall, I believe; the others were by at the time, all three were there.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you know how the tide happened to serve at that time? - A. I believe the tide served about that time.</p>

             in his defence says, that Brandall came to me, about nine months ago, while in the Spilling-grounds, and offered to bring up some stuff, meaning hemp, in three or four days; Brandall, Thompson, and another man, brought it up; I told him to bring it to a bridge near Ranelagh-gardens; he brought it to the gardens about daybreak in the morning, Brandall came to me and forced me out of bed; I went down, and carried scales, to Ranelagh Summer-house, where it was weighed, and I brought it up through the garden upon my back, assisted by a labouring man, about ten or eleven o'clock the same morning, making many turns, there being about sixteen hundred weight of it in all; in a day or two after this, the same men came with another freight, consisting of seventeen hundred weight of hemp; Brandall called me as before, and assisted in carrying the scales, and it was weighed as before, it was between four and five o'clock in the morning, and Ridley in the gardens at Ranelagh, who was then up, assisted in weighing it; I agreed to give twenty-six pounds, I was not asked more; if I could have given the money down they would have taken a guinea a hundred; it was not the prime hemp; it was long rough hemp, and worth about thirty-five shillings per hundred weight, in regular trade; I brought it up upon my back as before, assisted by one of the Chelsea pensioners; Brandall, and his associates would have brought me a great deal more if I could have paid them ready money; I sent some of the hemp to a person in the trade, namely, a man in Kent-street, fourteen hundred weight, I believe his name is Wilson, and the rest of it I worked up; I told the sailors that I had sent it to Reading, but that was not true, it was in consequence of their teazing me so much for money; I made seven or eight partial payments in small sums, for the hemp, and was afterwards prosecuted for the balance, and arrested for eighteen pounds eleven shillings, for which my brother granted a note, and released me from a spunging-house near Oxford-market, where I was confined three days."

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner sign that? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Are you attorney for the prosecution? - A. Mr. Chetham conducts the prosecution.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Is it the practice of your office, in cases of an accomplice, to give them a copy of their examination? - A. I was not aware of any inconvenience.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask what is the practise? - A. The practise is, we read over his deposition to him, he signs it, and subsequently a copy is made for the party.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any sees for that copy? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you do in all cases of accomplices? - A. And in other cases.</p>
               <p>Court. It seems to me to be a novel practice, and I think it my duty to throw out this observation, that it seems to tend much more to injustice than to justice: a man in the light of an accomplice, states facts to you and gets a copy of his deposition, that he may have an opportunity of continuing in the same story; I never heard of such a thing before; I throw it out now, that the Magistrates may know that the Court disapproves of such a practice, and that they may take it into their consideration to prevent it.</p>

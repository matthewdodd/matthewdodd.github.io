                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Plough-alley, St. George's. On the night of the 18th of October, before twelve o'clock, I went to Mr. Denton's public-house, at the end of Plough-alley—I pulled my outer door to, but the spring-lock did not catch—I returned in about three mi<lb></lb>nutes, and found somebody standing in the alley at the corner of my step—he was going to speak to me, but I did not answer him, and went in—I carried what I had got up stairs to my lodger, and fetched some coals afterwards, and returned to the kitchen—I then heard a rattling noise in my passage—I went to see what it was, and found a man leaving my par<lb></lb>lour door, and going to the street door—I had not fastened the door after me—I asked him who he wanted—he said he did not know—I asked what business he had there, and who he wanted?—he said, "A neighbour"—I said, "Do you live her? for I don't know my neighbours"—he said, "No"—I said, "What is the person you want?"—he said, "Betty and Kitty"—I said, "It is not here"—I shut the door after him, and he went away—I am positive the prisoner is the man—as soon as he was gone, I found the parlour door wide open, and missed a counterpane, blanket, sheet, dressing-glass, and tray—I gave the police information, and after<lb></lb>wards went to the station-house and saw the prisoner—I know him again.</p>

I was on duty in Wapping-street about twelve o'clock on the night of the 18th, and saw the prisoner at the door of Denton's public-house, with a basket on his head—some woman came out of the public-house—I went up to Hermitage-bridge, and observed a person come from Plough-alley to the other side of the street with a bundle—a part of it hung down—I fol<lb></lb>lowed him, and he walked till I got near him—he then crossed the street, and ran down a court, down to Wapping High-street, and then back, up Crown-court, to where I saw him run from first—he dropped the bundle containing a sheet and counterpane—I took it up, and after waiting a short time, he came back to the spot, and I seized him—the prisoner is the room I saw with the bundle, I am certain.</p>

                  </hi>. I live next door to the prosecutrix. A little before twelve o'clock on the night of the 18th, my attention was called to a basket which stood outside my door in the alley—I brought it into the yard—after that I heard a knock at the door, opened it, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner—I asked him if the basket was his—he said yes—I have seen him before with fish in a basket—I gave it him, and he thanked me.</p>

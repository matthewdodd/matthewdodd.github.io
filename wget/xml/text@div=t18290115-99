In 1825 I had a brown mare: on the 28th of January, I saw her in the stable, and locked the door, about ten o'clock at night; on the following morning I went to the stables, about half-past six o'clock, and it was gone - the stable-door appeared to have been wrenched open by a bar, about the width of a common chisel.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information from Bow-street, did you afterwards go to Millhill? A. Yes, on the 15th of March, 1825, I went to Mr. Satchell's, and there found my mare - I am quite sure it was the mare I lost from the stables on the 28th of January; I have since sold her to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150042"></xptr>Satchell, for 21l. 5s. - I went before the Magistrate, but did not see the prisoner there.</p>

            . I keep the King's Head public-house, at Millhill, Hendon. In 1825, I saw the prisoner - I cannot say whether it was February or March; I saw him at Millhill - he was riding a brown mare, and offered her to me for sale; I did not purchase her, as she was not big enough - Satchell had previously asked me to look out for a mare; I called him over, as he was standing at his door; it was shown to him - I afterwards saw her in his possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This might have been in March? A. Yes; I knew the prisoner before - he was bred and born near me; he called at my house - it was day-light; there was no concealment.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he put it up at your stable? A. No, it stood at my door - Satchell bought it immediately; he was to have it on two days' trial, and if it suited, then he was to give 14l. for it - but if not, he was to pay 10s, for the use of it; the prisoner used to come backward and forward to see his mother - I do not know what his business was.</p>

            . I live at Millhill, and am a butcher. In January, 1825, I knew the prisoner - I bought a mare of him, about the latter end of February, or the beginning of March; it was the mare I saw when Dossett was there - I gave him 14l. for it; I had her from Saturday till Tuesday, to try her - I was to give 10s. if she did not suit; she was claimed by Mr.

             a week or a fortnight afterwards - I restored her to him; after having restored her, I received the 14l. back again from the prisoner, at different times - I had known the prisoner by sight before, and understood he was a sort of horse-dealer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When it turned out all was not right, he paid you by instalments? A. Yes - he had not desired me to conceal her at all; I did not ask how he came by her - I considered 14l. a fair value, from her appearance, but I found she suited me very well, and afterward gave 20l. for her; she was worth that to any man, who knew her value by trying her.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street horse-patrol. In March, 1825. I apprehended the prisoner, at Dossett's, the King's Head public-house, Millbill, - about the 5th of March; I apprehended him on the day he received the money - I went before the Magistrate, Mr. Clark, of Hendon, who is now dead; I could not produce any owner for the mare, and wished to have the prisoner remanded; he was discharged on his own recognizances, to appear again on the Saturday following, in case he was wanted - he never appeared again; I went all over Highgate, where he lived, to see if I could find him; at the time I discovered the owner, which was near a fortnight afterwards, I could not find the prisoner - he had not himself informed me he lived at Highgate; he told the Magistrate he lived at Highgate; when I apprehended him, I told him he was charged on suspicion of stealing two horses - it was not on this charge at all, and on asking where he lived, he replied at Highgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Finding he had sold Satchell a mare, he was discharged, to appear on Saturday, if called upon? A. Yes, I looked for him at Highgate, for a fortnight after -I did not find him; I have been searching for him from that time to December last - every means have been used to find him; he dealt in horses.</p>

            . I am a constable of Surrey. On the 29th of December last, I assisted Myers in apprehending the prisoner, at the corner of Plumtree-street, St. Giles's; he asked on what charge it was - I said, on suspicion of horse-stealing, and that I had several charges; he asked me the particulars - I told him he was suspected of stealing a black horse, or gelding, from Millhill, which his brother was in custody for; he said his brother would be tried that day, at Kingston, but he had nothing to do with it; his brother was not to be tried that day, for I had to attend the trial myself, on the Tuesday, but I did not contradict him - I told him I suspected him of stealing a mare advertised in the Hue and Cry, from Mr. Duke, of Ratcliff-on-Trent; he said he knew nothing of it - I said there were two horses stolen from Chiswick, about a fortnight back; he said he knew nothing of it - he said, "Huffey White has been saying something about me;" I said he had been hung years ago - he said No, he was in Newgate now; I said there was a man named White there - he was tried yesterday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He used the phrase "Huffey?" A. Yes - I did not mention Coleman's horse to him; I had heard of this charge, but it did not occur to my mind.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Hands Court, Dorset Street, Clapham Road—the deceased, Benjamin Groves, was my husband—on Saturday night, the 8th September, he came home to have his supper, and he heard Morgan and Mrs. Riley quarrelling—we went out to our gate to listen—we heard Morgan make use of some threats—my husband went down to speak to him—he said he would rip up the first one that came near him—Mrs. Morgan brought out a light, and he told her to take it away, and knocked it out of her hand—my husband went towards him and said, "Morgan, what are you at? go in and go to bed; you are going mad"—I could not hear what he said in reply—my husband pushed the gate open and went in to him, and said, "You won't hurt me, it's only old Ben Groves"—Mrs. Riley was then going up the court into Dorset Street after her brother—I went up the court after my husband, and just as I pushed the gate open he said to Morgan, "Don't hit me again, you have stabbed me"—the prisoner made no reply—I pushed my husband out of the gate before me, and took him up the court into our own house—Morgan had something in his hand—by the shadow of it it looked like a knife—his hand was raised to give him a second blow—I put my husband on the bed—he said, "Let me lie down and die, for my belly is all coming out"—he undid his trousers and I saw all his entrals were protruding from a wound in the stomach—information was given to the police and a surgeon, and he was ultimately taken to St. Thomas's Hospital—I left him there at ten o'clock at night to come home, and when I went next morning he was dead—I did not see any blow given by my husband to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>5, Hands Court—on the morning of the 8th September, about half-past twelve, I saw the prisoner in his own garden—he was having words with Mrs. Riley—he called to her and said, "Mary, come here"—she said, "No, I am not that fool"—he again called her "Mary," and she said, "Have not I got a name? why don't you call me Mrs. Riley? put the knife away, you fool, and come out and fight with your fists like a man"—she was in the court, and he was inside his own gate with the gate shut—his wife came out to endeavour to get him to bed—she had a candle in her hand—he told her to take that light away, or he would serve her the same—he again called Mrs. Riley, and said, "Come here, dear, and I will stab you like that," plunging the knife into the gate—she up with her hand and gave him a clout in the eye, saying, "Take that, you fool, and go in and go to bed"—it was a backhander across the eyes—with that the deceased man got vexed and walked down the court, saying, "I will quiet him," and he said, "Morgan, are you mad? do you know what you are doing?"—the prisoner said, "I will stab the first b----that comes in here"—the deceased said, "You won't stab me, will you, poor Ben Groves?"—he said, "I will rip the guts of the first that comes in here"—Groves opened the gate and went in—I turned to my husband to go and help, and while I was doing so Mrs. Groves ran down to bring her husband back—I said, "Is he stabbed?" and she said, "Yes," and she took him into his own house.</p>

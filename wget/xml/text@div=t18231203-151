            . On the 1st of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in a public-house - she followed me out, and stopped me about two hundred yards off, and asked me to go home with her - I refused; she snatched my watch out, and ran away with it; I followed her, calling Stop thief! the officer followed her into the passage of a house, and brought her out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. What young women were you with besides her - A. None at all. I was with a girl an hour before, and went to a house in the neighbourhood with her. I knew what I was about. I saw her in custody in half an hour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not say before the Magistrate, that she accompanied you from the house - A. She followed me out of the house.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was on duty in Wentworth-street, about a quarter past eight o'clock, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I followed and saw the prosecutor, who said, "That woman has robbed me of my watch" - she had run into the first door up the passage; I went in, and caught hold of the prisoner by the arm, and behind the door I found the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prosecutor sober - A. He was not quite sober. It is a house which girls use - the door is always open.</p>

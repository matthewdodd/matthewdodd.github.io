I am a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons—on the morning of 9th June, a child, Alice Irish, was shown to me at Hendon Union, and I examined her very carefully—there was no actual state of disease that one could detect, but it was in an extremely emaciated condition, and extremely feeble in consequence of the emaciation—the actual state of the child was a state of inanition—it was not properly nourished—I use the word inanition in direct opposition to the word nutrition—her state was brought about from the want of nutrition—the organs were quite healthy; there was no disease—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on 15th June—the actual state of the child was emaciation from the want of nutrition—there are several conditions that will bring about a state of inanition, the one is depriving it of food, or the food being of an improper kind—sour milk would be next door to poison to a child.</p>

I am a divisional surgeon of police—on 4th June I was taken to the Kilburn police-station—I saw the last witness there with a baby in a very emaciated condition and in a very filthy state, almost dying—I gave it some food, which it partook of, and after a lapse of about two hours and a half, I ordered its removal to the nearest infirmary, and I believe the last witness carried it there—the state of emaciation must have arisen partly from the disease of the mesenteric glands of the bowels and partly from the want of proper food, together with cleanliness and air, &amp;c.—the child weighed 6 pounds; a child of nine months old ought to weigh more like 16 pounds—the average weight at birth is 7 1/2 to 8 pounds—I visited it subsequently at the Paddington Infirmary—I saw it three times there—it was taken proper care of there.</p>

I am medical officer at Paddington Work-house—on 4th June the child Alice Irish was admitted to the infirmary there—my first visit to it was on Friday morning, the 5th—I found it in a very emaciated condition, and a great deal of tumefaction about the bowels—it was in a very emaciated and reduced condition, and rather small throughout in the limbs—that was caused by want of proper food—I have had another case of the same kind in the same ward at the same time—the child was not so far reduced but what I had hopes of its getting better, but I could not possibly say—we have very many cases that do not get better—its health was impaired by the weak state it was in—the proper food for a child in the absence of mother's milk is cow's milk and sugar—sour milk would certainly prejudice a child's health—it was subsequently removed from my care, and I did not see it afterwards.</p>

               <p>MARY PEMBROOKE. I was attending Mrs. Stafford as nurse. On the 23rd of April, I was up stairs at the time this happened. Mr. Stafford went out a after six o'clock, he was going to church; when he went out, I went into the kitchen; I went up stairs directly after, Mr. Stafford's little daughter went up stairs with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What person were in the house at that time - A. I many persons; there were lodgers: the lodgers had separate rooms. Mr. Stafford had at that time, a shop, parlour, and bed room; it is a shop for ready made clothes. When I went up stairs I had locked the parlour door, and kitchen; the parlour opens into a yard, and it has another door that opens into the passage inside of the house; this inner door of the parlour was broken open; the door that opens into the yard was bolted; the door was locked, and the key was in my pocket. After I had been up stairs a little while, a young son of Mr. Stafford's came in, about seven o'clock; I gave the child some tea; then I looked at the parlour door, and went up again. Some time afterwards, I heard a noise; it was a little after seven o'clock, drawing on for dark; I went up stairs a second time, and then I heard a noise from below, it seemed like the cracking of a piece of deal; it was not quite dark then; I did not go down immediately, it may be nearly a quarter of an hour before I went down, more, or less, I cannot exactly say. When I went down, I saw the door open, and I saw a man with a bed on his back entering the passage, the man went on to the step, and out of the house; I followed him immediately, with a candle and candlestick in my hand, into the street, I called stop thief, and I learned that a young man stopped him of the name of

            ; I could just discern the man before me, he had a bed on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left this bed in the room when you went up stairs - A. Yes; and locked the door, and put the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What was taken out of the room - A. The bed and all the entire bedding belonging to it; there was the bed, the bolster, two pillows, and pillowcases, three blankets, and a pair of sheets; all these things I left when I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the bed worth - A. I cannot say, it is a good bed; I could not buy such a one under five pounds, the bolster about seven shillings or eight shillings, the pillows and cases nine shillings, the blankets are worth a pound, one is a new one, the sheets fifteen shillings; the bed things were with the bed; they are here. When I went into the parlour, I saw the lock of the parlour door had been forced off; that was the noise I heard the time before; the door had been forced open by two crows, two crows and part of the lock were produced before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before, was he a lodger in the house - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. In the first place, when I was taken to the office, the prosecutrix swore it was between seven and eight o'clock; now she says it was between six and seven - A. I saw the place secure at seven o'clock, as I had left it.</p>

            . On the 23rd of April, as near as I can guess, about twenty minutes after eight o'clock, I was going up Tower-street; I met a man running with a bed and bedding on his back; I pursued him; I saw the last witness with a candle, hallooing out stop thief; she went a very little way from the door, and again she hallooed out stop thief. I turned about, and went after the man; there was nobody in the street besides me. I overtook the prisoner, he had the bed on his back, it was tied up in a blanket. I sprang on the bed, and pulled it off his back; the man ran off; I jumped over the bed, and went after him, and catched him in Little St. Martin's-lane, I took him after a deal of difficulty, he struck at me, and said the bed did not belong to me; he got from me again; I went after him a second time, I followed him up some considerable way; he said, I had no business with him, and I took him again, and I took him up to the house where he had taken the bed from: we got him into the passage; then I saw two women, and there was a mob about the door in the street; and I gave him up to the women; the women took the bed and bedding into the house. When I got back with the prisoner, the bed was gone from the place where I left it.</p>

               <p>- GODDARD. I was constable of the night. I took the bed into the watch-house; the prisoner was brought to the watch-house about nine o'clock. The bedding and other articles, were brought by Maloney to the watch-house; they were put into my custody to keep; they have been at my house ever since; they are here now.</p>

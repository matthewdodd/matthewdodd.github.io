I believe Provost to be the man who advanced and took my watch; I know it was the man in a fustion jacket, but do not know his features - they all passed me towards the left, and about nine of them ran off - the others stopped behind on the crown of the bridge; I pursued the nine across the field some way without making any alarm; I then gave up the pursuit - they passed an unfinished house near the foot of the next bridge, which is called Twig-folly - they would pass Marriott's house in their way; I got an officer and shewed him the spot; I have not found my watch; I received no personal injury.</p>

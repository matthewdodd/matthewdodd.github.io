The prisoner was in my service for a year and a half, I cannot tell up to what time, I have the worst memory of any man in England—I am ninety-two years of age—I dare say it is not above two months ago since she left me, but I would not say that exactly—I had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in five notes, and some more money; 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the same box, and 10 sovereigns besides in the same box, in the same bag that she took these out of—they were kept in my box, in my bedroom—the prisoner was the only person in the house—I always kept the box locked, and kept the key in my pocket—I remember the five 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes being missed—the prisoner was out that morning, at Brentford—she went out with my daughter, and before they went out I gave them a glass of gin—my daughter did not live with me—I would not trust my daughter in that room without my being there looking at her—the prisoner did not remain at Brentford that night; she was at home—she did not say a word to me till the morning, when she said, "Daly, what have you been doing with the keys of the boxes?"—I said, "Nothing in the world; I never got out of my bed from the time I went to bed"—I then examined the box, which was on the top of two more boxes, and I found the money was missing—it had been in a little canvas bag—the box had been unlocked—the keys that unlocked it laid on the top of the chair" and the box was still unlocked when I went to it—the keys had been in my small clothes pocket, when I took them off at night—I always did, and I did so that night—I did, indeed—I went to bed between 7 and 8 o'clock—I always laid my small clothes in a chair, alongside of my bed—the prisoner knew very well that I had those notes, because when I had the notes I said to her, "Will you take these to the Nunnery, and ask Mother Mary if she will keep them for me?"—I did not want any interest on them, but the Superior said it was against their rules—that was the answer the prisoner brought to me—that was about a fortnight or three weeks before the notes were missing—nobody knew I had this money but this woman herself—when I sent her to the Nunnery, she brought the notes back, and I put them in the same place that I had them out of—I dare say it was three weeks, or a little better, after I lost them when the prisoner left me—two gentlemen came to my house, Mr. Jackson was one—I sent for them about three weeks after I lost my money—I had given no information before that night to any one living on the face of the earth—I had my health in that three weeks; but I am such a cripple that I cannot go across the room—I sent this woman to fetch Mr. Jackson to make my will, and when he and Dr. McKinlay came, I told them of my loss—the prisoner let them in; I said to them, "Will you give this woman a cottage to live in, rent free, and I give her 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year?"—after the prisoner had let them out, she said, "Dsaly, I am going to leave you; I leave you to-morrow morning"—the next morning, before I was up, she came and said I might come and search her box if I liked—I told her no, I did not wish it—she had not said anything about leaving before that night—I told the gentlemen I had lost the money, but I did not say any more about it—the prisoner heard that—every word of it—they did not say a word in her presence about making inquiry about it—I got these</p>

I went to Mr. Daly's house, at Isleworth, about three months ago, as near as can be; I cannot tell the date nearer than that—I asked Mr. Daly, in the prisoner's presence, to give me an account of what he had been robbed of—he said, "Oh, it is gone; let it go"—I then left, as he would not give me any information—I afterwards, from other information, obtained a warrant for the apprehension of the prisoner, on 10th Aug.—I proceeded to Spithead to a ship, the <hi rend="italic">Hendrick Hudson</hi>, and apprehended the prisoner on board—I told her it was for stealing five 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes from Mr. Daly, of Isleworth—she said she knew nothing about them—I searched her, and her box—I found this ticket in one side of her purse, and 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the other side—she said, "I have given 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a man of the name of Rook for my passage, my daughter's passage, and my brother's passage—she did not say where Rook lived—I knew very well where he lived; he was living, as one may say, next door to Mr. Daly, in the same lane, and he was on board the vessel at the same time, with several more from the same locality—there was a young woman on board; I do not know her name—I found nothing in the prisoner's box but clothes.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to Johnson and Matthews, of Hatton Garden—on 21st June, about 11.30 p.m., I was in Cheapside, the prisoner came up and asked me the way to Cheapside, I told her she was in Cheap<lb></lb>side, she said that that was not the place, she wanted the street that led into Cheapside—I had not said the words a second before a man came across from Milk Street and struck me—he accused me of talking to his wife or to his mother—I struck him back on his neck, he made a second attack, and the prisoner came between us—I took a blackthorn stick from my left hand, and said that I would knock him down—I struck him across the head, he made another rush at me, and I struck him a second time—the prisoner came between us to save him, she then went to Milk Street, and the man ran away, I followed him, but he got away—I missed my watch and gave information—I have never seen it since—I had had it five or ten minutes before—I identified the prisoner with another female in the cells of the Mansion House, and am sure she is the person.</p>

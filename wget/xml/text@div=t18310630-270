I was coming to town, and met the prisoner at Old Brentford - I had 33s. in my pocket; I went to two public-houses with her, and had two pints of cyder and one pint of beer - the second was the Running Horse, - my money was in a brown cloth bag in my pocket; I took it out there, and put it into my left-hand breeches pocket - I then went down a lane there, and while something was happening, I found her hand in my pocket; she then went off, and joined three men - I followed her to the Running Horse again, and accused her of taking my money, which I missed; she said she had not had it- a Policeman came, and took her; I had not given her any thing - my purse was safe in the lane, and I missed it directly she left.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q.What did you drink at the first house? A. A little gin, and a quartern of peppermint; I was about an hour and a half with her drinking - I had made no bargain with her; I felt her drawing my purse out - I did not tell her I had no money, nor that she might search me.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty, and heard something about this - the prosecutor was sober, but much distressed; I saw the prisoner walking down the lane, and heard her tell a man she was accused of taking the money - I went by them, and saw them go to the Running Horse; the prosecutor came up, and went in - he came out, and took me in; I took the prisoner, and found one new shilling on her only - this was about ten minutes after I had seen her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was time to escape then? A. Not after I took her - she came to the door and said she would send for a Policeman to search her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never left him till I returned to the public house - as I came back I met several young men, and told them the charge he made; he said if I would give him 6d. or 1s., he would say no more about it.</p>

On the 29th of March, between five and six o'clock, I was writing in my counting-house, at the back of the ware-house - I went and called the prisoner and boy to lock up- neither of them were in the warehouse; I went and called them from the public-house next door; they came in, and went down to the cellar - I went into the warehouse again in a few minutes, and they came out of the cellar; the boy (Crew) came up first, and I observed something under his arm; I asked what it was - he said a towel which he was taking home to be washed; the prisoner was coming up the steps after him, and heard what passed - I observed the towel rather bulky, but said nothing; Crew went into the public-house next door; the prisoner then said, "Sir, will you be kind enough to let me have a bottle of wine, and I will pay for it with the 7s. I borrowed on Monday;" I then went to a case at the back of the ware-house - he and I opened it, and I took a bottle out and gave him; he assisted to close the case, and put the bottle of wine behind him: I then told him to come and lock up- the keys were missing, and have never been found; I had given them to Crew a few minutes before; I said,"Very likely they are wrapped in that towel Edward has taken out, I'll go and see;" Smith said, "There is nothing in the towel but the bottle of wine I have bought of you;" I said, "How can that be? there is that bottle of wine;" I went to the public-house with Crew, and asked for the towel he had left there - I found in it a bottle of wine, with my seal on it; I returned to the warehouse, and asked the prisoner how he could act so - he went on his knees, and begged forgiveness; I gave him in charge, and next morning Crew's father and mother brought him to me, and he gave me information respecting another bottle of wine which I also found at the public-house; the seal was broken off that - they were two quart bottles - it was Steyne wine, and all taken out of one case.</p>

            . I am nearly seventeen years old, and was in Mr. Webb's employ. On the evening in question the prisoner told me he was going to buy a bottle of wine of Mr. Webb, and after he had asked master leave to buy a bottle, he gave me one bottle wrapped up on the case, told me to take it into the Bull's Head, and just as I was going out he came and gave me another, and said they were both paid for; they both had master's seal on, but next morning master found one at the public-house with a piece of the cork broken off; I know nothing about a third bottle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not your master tell you to take the towel home to be washed? A. Yes; it had nothing in it then; I am certain you gave me a second bottle, and said both were paid for; I was brought up in Whitechapel charity-school - I did not tell master that the prisoner gave me the wine till next morning; I then told him of my own accord - I had seen him at night, but had no conversation with him; I did not suppose it was stolen, but when I found the prisoner was taken up I told; I took the two bottles from the cellar; the prisoner gave them to me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050023"></xptr>about half-past five o'clock - master asked in the morning if I knew about the wine, and then I told him; the towel hung in the counting-house when he told me to get it washed; Smith afterwards wrapped the wine in it - I am sure both bottles had the seal on them when he gave them to me; the neck was out of the towel.</p>

            . I am ward-beadle. The prisoner was given in my charge; Mr. Webb said, into his hearing, that the bottle he had sold Smith laid in the warehouse - that while he was in the counting-house he saw Crew and Smith together; that Smith gave him something, then Crew went to the public-house, and Smith followed him; the prisoner said he had given him the wine he had purchased - Webb said, "No, there is the wine I sold you;" and as soon as the bottle was found next door he fell on his knees, and begged forgiveness.</p>

            . I am a baker. I lodge at the Bull's Head; Crew brought in a bottle of wine, and left it on the settle opposite me, and before he could turn out, Mr. Webb came in to inquire about the keys, and took Crew out: there were two bottles, one on the settle and one in the room; the prisoner came in presently, and had one bottle of wine away, and the next morning I delivered the other to Webb.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I acknowledge to one bottle - I thought I had a right to take it, because I had to pay for it; I have had three bottles at a time - I fell on my knees, fearing I should be locked up from my motherless child; Mr. Webb's son, who is a stock-broker, has given me 1000l. at a time to pay into his banker's - his son was a fellow-servant of mine.</p>
               <p>MR. WEBB. He has been nearly two years in my employ; I placed confidence in him - I believe he has carried money to my son's banker.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you ever sell him wine before? A. Now and then a bottle - I used to stop it out of his wages.</p>

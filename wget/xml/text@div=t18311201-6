On the 17th of November, about ten o'clock, I went to bed; I had secured my house and shop myself; the shop door is the street door - it was locked and bolted; the window shutters were secured with an iron bar: about three o'clock next morning I was awoke by a knocking at the door - I jumped out of bed, and opened the bed-room window; somebody said, "Make haste, and come down, for here are thieves, and we have got one:" it was not day-light - I went down to the stair-foot door, and saw the pannel of the street door was out; there was a man laying on his face on the outside, with his shoes off, and another person across his back, holding him down; I asked who it was; the person on him said, "My name is Biddle' - I asked if he knew who the prisoner was; he said, No, and the prisoner said, "You will soon know who it is" - I begged Biddle to keep him in that situation till I put on my clothes - he did so; the street door had been unlocked, and the bottom bolt lifted up - I had left the key inside the door; the top bolt was not down, therefore the door could not have been opened; the pannel was large enough for him to get through - two chisels were left on the premises; I found part of a partition in the shop between two doors was taken down, by which means a person could get into the shop, and take the till out of its place to the opposite side of the shop, and put it into the window, close to where the person entered - it was two or three yards from its place; there was 7s. 5d. in pence and halfpence, which I had left there on the previous night- about sixty pence and thirty-four halfpence and they were in the till in the morning: I took the prisoner to an officer - when I got a light I knew him - he had been employed by me, and should have been at work for me that very day - he had been binding hay for me with his father that week; his brother and father have been in my employ some years at different times, and he has been occasionally employed by me about two years.</p>

            . On the morning of the 18th of November, about three o'clock, I was near Beaton's house with Cline; we saw two men standing at the corner of Mr. Beaton's house - when they saw us they immediately went away; I then saw a light through Beaton's shop door, and on going up to it I found the pannel of the door was out - on looking through the hole in the door I saw a man stand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010009"></xptr>ing in the shop - werang the bell, and desired Beaton to come down, as there were thieves in the house; the prisoner then attempted to make his escape through the opening of the door - when he was about three parts through the opening I fell upon him, and held him down till Mr. Beaton arrived; we then took him to Camp, the officer - he was not one of the two I had seen at the corner.</p>

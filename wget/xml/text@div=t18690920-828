                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger of West Brompton—on 14th August, I served the prisoner with some bacon, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. she gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I put them into the copper till, where there was no silver, gave her the change, and she left—shortly afterwards Mary Moore came in with a bad shilling in her hand, and from what she said, I found that one of the shillings I had put into the till was bad. I found the prisoner fifty yards from the house, and said, "You are the woman who has just been into my shop and bought some bacon, and paid me a bad shilling."—she said that she was not aware of it, she was a pretty good judge of money—she went back with me to the shop, where Mary Moore was—she said, "You passed a bad shilling at our shop"—the prisoner said, "Give me the shil<lb></lb>lings, and I will give you good ones for them"—I said, "No; keep the shillings till the policeman comes—the prisoner took a shilling out of Mary Moore's hand, and put it into her mouth, taking out another shilling and giving it to Mary Moore—I saw it afterwards, and it was good—the prisoner made a motion with her mouth, and swallowed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Sinfield—on 14th August, between 12.30 and 12.45, the prisoner came and asked me for two twopenny cherry tarts—I said I had no twopenny ones, and she had two penny ones, and something else, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a shilling—I gave her the change, and as she went out I looked at the shilling—I did not like the look of it, and sent Mary Moore, the servant, with it to Mr. Chinnock's—I was sent for there, and saw Mr. Taylor, a greengrocer, Mr. Wilson, a publican, Mary Moore, and Mr. Chinnock, who accused the prisoner, and I said, "You passed a bad shilling at my shop, too"—she said that she was not aware of it; she was a very good judge of coin—I went back to my shop, and Mary Moore afterwards gave me a good shilling, not the one which I had given her—the first one was slightly bent—the prisoner has it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you received the shilling did you submit it to any test? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I bit it—I think the date was 1864—I have not seen it since I gave it to Mary Moore—it was slightly bent, and marked in two places—The prisoner said, in Mr. Chinnock's presence, that she was not aware it was bad—she had not got her spectacles on when she Said that she was a pretty good judge—I did not notice that she was eating cherries—she had a cherry tart in the shop, but she did not eat it.</p>

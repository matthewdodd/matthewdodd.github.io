                  </hi>. I reside at No. 21, Little Penton-street, Islington, and am a bricklayer's labourer. I was with the prisoner on Saturday last, between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, near the New River Head, Thornhill-place—I had 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my tobacco box; it was inside my old jacket—the prisoner saw where I had the money—he said, "Give me your money, you don't want it?"—he caught bold of me, telling me one tale or another, and took the money out of my pocket—I caught hold of him, and accused him of stealing it—I asked him for it back—he up with his fist and knocked me down, and when I was down he kicked me—I did not get up until he was gone—not a soul was passing by, except a woman, while I was on the ground—we had both been drinking together; neither of us was drunk; we both knew what we were at as well as I do now—I did not see him till Monday night, from half-past 8 to 9 o'clock, when I gave him in charge to a police constable—he offered me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the policeman's presence, when he was taken—I have not seen the tobacco box since—I last saw it not five minutes before he took it out of my possession—he held me with the hand the tobacco box was in.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, G</hi> 90). Last Monday week, between 8 and 9 o'clock at night, the prisoner was given into my charge by the prosecutor for stealing 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a tobacco box—I told him the charge—he said he knew nothing about it, and if the prosecutor would not press the charge he would give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the next Saturday.</p>

I was innocent of the money; I was drunk, and so was he; on Saturday night, 4th June, at half past 9 o'clock, I went into the Angel Inn, High-street, Islington, to have a pint of beer; the prosecutor stood against the counter, and there were more there; he asked me where I had been all night, he could not see me nowhere; he asked me to drink out of a pot, and I did, and his mates that were with him called for another pot, and left it to us to drink; he went out, and asked me if I would go to Gray's-inn-lane with him, that we might have some more beer, and I told him I did not wish him to go, it was better to go home, and give the money to his wife; but he persuaded me to go; we had nothing to drink till we got to Gray's-inn-lane; we then went into a friend's house, and sent for beer, and then we got drunk, and left the house to come home, and coming on the way we went into another house, and had some more beer, and after we left there we had some words of difference, but I do not know what caused it; he struck me, and I him; that is all I remember about it; I don't know about his money no more than the child unborn; 1 have known him for the last four years, and he knows me; I am a hardworking man, and have not means enough to employ counsel.</p>

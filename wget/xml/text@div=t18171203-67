I am clerk to Mr. Beetham, who is an attorney, and lives in Cornhill; in April last the the prisoner applied to me to have a power of attorney to transfer some stock in the Bank of England; she said she came from Mr. Twelvetree, of Aldersgate-street, whom I knew to be a client of Mr. Beetham's; she produced two stock receipts - I told her she must apply to a stockbroker, and recommended her to my father.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no more of her for sometime - A. Not in particular. When the stock was sold out my father gave me the money that it was sold for; I paid it to the prisoner, at Mr. Beetham's, it was more than 100l. I paid her the same money that my father gave me. She told me it was given to her by a relation, who she named to be Mrs. Thomas, and said she was going to be married.</p>

             continuing. The two receipts made up 115l. together, Navy 5 per Cents - They corresponded with the description she gave me, except there being no residence mentioned in them. I applied at the Bank and got the forms of the power of attorney (looking at it), this is it. When I got it from the Bank it was all filled up, except the signature, witnesses, and the date; I handed it over to the prisoner, and explained to her the instructions given - She had to send it into the country. Three or four days after I saw her, she returned the power of attorney to me, executed in the form in which it now appears, she gave it to me at my own house, which is in Watling-street, in the City of London; she gave it to me to carry into effect; I went with it to the Bank myself, and acting on it, I sold the stock, transferred it, and obtained themoney. I sold it to John Toyne, of the Stock Exchange. I received the money, made a statement of the transaction, and gave the money to my son to give the prisoner, with the statement which I had made out on a piece of paper. After that I wrote a letter addressed to myself, and delivered it the prisoner - this was a day or two after; she acknowledged receiving the money. I put the paper into her hands, desiring her to carry it to Mrs. Thomas, and tell her to send it to me by post; I supposed she was going to where Mrs. Thomas lived, which she said was at Chard, in Somersetshire. I soon after received the letter by post, in the regular course.</p>

I told her I apprehended her on suspicion of forging some instrument, and selling some stock out of the funds - She appeared very much alarmed, and said, "I know what you mean-you mean Mrs. Thomas; I did, do it. I was persuaded to do it by a man named Goddard. After I received the money, I took it down to Chard, in Somersetsbire, and gave him the whole of it, except a small sum."</p>

             re-examined. I never had any other sum of 115l. in the Bank except this. I have bought no stock since April. If any was bought in my name in November last it was not bought with my money. I have received the October dividend on my stock-(looks at a receipt)-this is my receipt for it-(looks at the acceptance of the stock, dated 7th November), it is my hand-writing. I signed it the day that I gave the receipt.</p>

               <p>MR. CHILD. There is no other transaction of that day, to which the 115l. can refer, except to the order of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the country in great distress, and was recommended to a person near Chard, to a situation; after that, I was recommended to a situation of 25l. per annum. The person told me had got an aunt in London, who had got money, and asked me to go to London with him-my father gave me leave to go with him. He went with me to Mr. Twelvetree's, in Aldersgate-street - he asked Mr. Twelvetree to recommend him to a broker, which he did. He told me there would be no harm, and if I would do it he would give me 25l. - I did it. He went back with me to the country with the power of attorney. I received the money of the young man, and went back to the country the same day, and delivered the money to him. In a few days, he pretended that he had his house broken open, and left me. I had no part of the money. His name is Phillip Goddard, of Chard.</p>
               <p>H.B. SHILLIBUR. I know that there is a farmer at Chard of the name of Goddard. I do not know whether the prisoner lived with him, or not.</p>

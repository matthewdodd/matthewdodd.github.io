I saw it about a quarter of an hour before it was gone, between four and five in the afternoon. It stood upon a writing-desk, about four yards within the door.</p>
               <p>Wil. Richardson. I shall be sixteen years old in June; I am apprentice to Mr. Rose. The prisoner used to black shoes for my master by the quarter, and would come in two or three times a day to ask how he did since he has been ill. She came in on that day, and went into a little room and lighted her pipe. She knocked with the heel of her shoe; nobody came: then she came a little farther: then she knocked again with her foot against the ground, to see if any body would come. She looked about, and saw nobody there. She took a looking-glass, and put it under her apron. I was behind a post, where I had used to hide myself, to jump out on a sudden to make her start when she has come in. She could not see me, but I could her. She went out with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you let her go out with it?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I was rather frightened; and I thought I had better go back and call my fellow apprentice to be in the shop, before I went out: after he came, I went out to look for her, and, in about an hour after, I found her in Chick-lane, by Blackboy-alley, just come out of a public house where her daughter was. I said to her, my mistress wanted her: then she came a little farther. I asked her if she had not been in our shop; she said, Yes. I asked her if she had not taken a glass away; she said, No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rose is a quarterly customer to me. I went into the shop to ask how he did; nobody made answer: then I came out again, and went directly to Hatton garden, to deliver a pair of shoes. Then I went down and asked my daughter if she knew how Mr. Rose did: I met this lad at the door: he said, Mistress wants you; I said, I'll come directly; then they charged me with a constable. I don't know no more of the thing than this bit of green leaf that lies here.</p>

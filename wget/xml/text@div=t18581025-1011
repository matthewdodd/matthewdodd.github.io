                  </hi>. I live at Leicester, and am engineer on board one of Her Majesty's vessels at Portsmouth. On 20th August, I took a steam-boat from Westminster to Woolwich—a stranger addressed me; I had some conversation with him—when we arrived at Woolwich, I went with him, at his suggestion; to the Pier tavern—we went upstairs and had a glass of ale—after we had been there some time, the prisoner came in, and another person with him—the man that I met went down—the man that came with the prisoner left altogether, and then another came up with some rings—the prisoner said that he did not mind purchasing a ring, and would give him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—he said that he could not take so little, and introduced some cards; the prisoner said that he did not mind having a cut at the cards—cutting then went on, and the prisoner was betting for a ring—three cards were then taken out of the pack, and the prisoner and the other man began to bet—both the prisoner and the one I met on the steam-boat asked me to bet, and I did for a game or two: the person I met on the steam-boat pres<lb></lb>sed me to take his halves, but I never had a chance of winning—the prisoner pressed me to bet with him, and I did—5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the first, then 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. up to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lost 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never won at all—when I had lost the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I said, "I shall go down and fetch a policeman"—he said, "I will go down ith you and look for one;" he did so—we went towards the pier—I could not see a policeman at first—I looked to the left, and then saw one, and the prisoner saw him too, and said, "I will go this way," and ran away—I told the policeman, and saw him apprehend him—I was present when he was searched: a watch and a lock were taken from him, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd in money, and two or three other articles—I went back to the public-house, and the others were gone—I had only been away about five minutes.</p>

I went with her to the sign of the Black-horse; there she desired me to go out of the house with her, I did, and after that she desired me to go in again, and she would follow me. She did not come in, then I felt, and missed my watch; I ran out and inquired which way she was gone, and I found her with the watch.</p>

            . I am a watchman, this man came to me and inquired after a woman, and described her, by which description I knew it to be the prisoner. I went with him, and found her in a house in King-street. I took her out, then the man of the house came and called after me, and said here is the watch, I'll have nothing to do with it, and put it in my right-hand, saying he had it of the prisoner. I asked the prosecutor to describe the watch which he had lost. He did, and it appeared to be the same.</p>

               <p>I was going to a day's work, I met this man, and an honest woman with him, as I took her to be. They asked me if there was any body up, where they could get some purl. I went with them into a house, they had two pots of purl. I came out again, and he came out and wanted to use me very rudely. I got from him, and hid myself in a gate-way, and he ran by me, and after he was gone by I picked up this watch, and I gave it to Mr. Barnet, at the same house where I was, to see whether it was advertised or not.</p>

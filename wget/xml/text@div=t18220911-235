I awoke between six and seven o'clock; he and the woman were both gone, and all my money also. I was not quite sober when I went to bed, but knew I had the money. I gave the woman 3 s., the prisoner took my new hat away, and left his in the room; the woman was taken up and discharged; the prisoner was taken the next day after the robbery, with my hat on his head, and 15 s. was found in his bosom tied in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did you come from that day - A. Chatham; I drank about a pint of beer before I saw the prisoner, which was about nine o'clock; I had a pot with him, then went to another public-house, and had two pots among us three; it was a public-house we slept at, and we had a pot of beer there; I was a little tipsy when I went to bed; so was the prisoner, and the woman was not very sober; I spent about 3 s. 8 d. We were not in the public-house where he was apprehended.</p>

I awoke him, and said, I wanted him for robbing the prosecutor of eight sovereigns and 16 s. and a hat; he denied it; I asked for his hat, he made no answer; but the landlady said in the presence of the prisoner and his mother,</p>

               <p>"Here is his hat; his mother left it in the bar as he was tipsy;" the prosecutor claimed it. I took him to the watch-house; he said he had no money at all. I found 16 s. in silver in his neckcloth, and he said the hat claimed by the prosecutor was his; I told him the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110106"></xptr>had his hat on; he then said it must be a mistake, the hats are quite different; one is straw, and the other is beaver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He appeared as if he had been drunk - A. Yes; he talked very collected. The woman was taken up and discharged; the prosecutor told the Magistrate she slept in the same room, and I believe in the same bed.

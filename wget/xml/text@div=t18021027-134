Yes; (sworn); the prisoner and I were at work, pulling up turnips, the sun was very hot, and I went to this gentleman's house to get some water, and when I came back, I saw the prisoner and this other boy, coming from the hedge, and saw him putting something up in a black handkerchief; he hid it under some cooch grass, and when the cart was loaded, he put it in the cart, and then he told the other boy to go and pawn it, and he would give him three shillings, or else he would give him a good licking; he went away, and brought the prisoner a seven-shilling-piece, and a pocket full of halfpence, and then we stopped, and had some bread and cheese and porter.</p>

             sworn. - I work amongst the cows; on the 16th of September, the prisoner asked me to take a bundle, I told him I would not take it; he hid it under the cooch-grass, and when the cart was loaded, he threw it up in the cart; he wanted me to pawn it, and said, if I did not, he would cut my liver out; I asked him what would become of me, if I got into Newgate, and he said d - n Newgate, there is no danger of getting to Newgate for that, and then I went and pawned it.(A pawnbroker, at Chelsea, produced the gown, which was identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing of it, I never was across the hedge, or near it; the boy went to the house to get something to drink, and while he was gone, I never left the piece of turnips that I was on.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his corporal and one other witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

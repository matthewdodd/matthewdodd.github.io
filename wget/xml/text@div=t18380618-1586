                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Last Wednesday week, in consequence of information, I went in search of the prisoner, and found him in a few minutes, coming round the corner of a street into High-street—I stopped him, from the description I had received from the sergeant, of his—dress and appearance, and asked where he was going—he said he was waiting for a coach; he was going to London—he said he had done a good deal of business down here, and had got a deal more to do in London—at that time Sladden, another constable, came up—I told him my suspicion and we questioned the prisoner as to having a knife—he said, "No, me no knife"—I said he had better <hi rend="italic">go</hi> with us to see the man—he said, "Me no stab man, me no hurt man"—he did not refuse <hi rend="italic">to</hi> go—at that moment he was fumbling in his inside jacket pocket, and Sladden seized his arm, and there was an open knife in his hand—I perceived some blood on bis hand-Sladden took the knife out of his hand—I saw at the station-house that the handle was covered with blood—the prisoner put his hand into the same pocket again, took something out, tore it into three or four pieces, and was throwing it away, but I seized it—it was a piece of brown paper, co. Tenil with blood—I took him to the station-house—the prosecutor was there, and the moment he went in he said, "That is the man"—they spoke a word or two in some foreign language—I have the piece of paper here, and have had it ever since.</p>

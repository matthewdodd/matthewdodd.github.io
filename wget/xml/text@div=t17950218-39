On the 28th of January, the prisoner came in and called for a pint of beer, which he paid for, and in going out of the house a person called to me and said, that man has got something; I followed him to Lincoln's Inn, and I said, my friend, what have you got? he says, I have paid for the beer, what do you want? I said, I did not agree for you to take the pot. I took him back to my house and took the pot from him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The pot was put in my pocket. They asked me if I would go for a soldier? I told them I was not fit for it.</p>

            You did not give the constable the tin pot? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in this public house and had a pint of beer; there were some men in the room, they asked me if I had any money in my pocket? I said I had as much as I wanted. I staid there some time on account of the weather; they asked me if I would go for a soldier? I said, no I was lame. They must have put the pot in my pocket, I know nothing about the pot.</p>
               <p>Constable. I asked him how such an old man as he should do such a thing? he said he was guilty of it, and was sorry for it.</p>

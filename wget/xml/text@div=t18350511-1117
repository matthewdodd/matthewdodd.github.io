I am a jeweller and watchmaker, and live at No. 11, Holywell-street, in the Straud, in the parish of St. Clement Danes—the prisoner worked with a tailor, who rents part of my house—he has worked for him two years and a half—this property was stolen from my shop on the 27th of April—I fastened the shop about a quarter past nine o'clock in the evening—I put a padlock on the door, locked it, and went away—the clock and watches were perfectly secure then—I do not know whether the pri<lb></lb>soner was in the house then or not—I returned at ten minutes after eleven o'clock, went to the shop door, and found it secure, as I had left it—I went up stairs to bed, without going into the shop; and in about half an hour I received information—I went down, found the shop door open, and the padlock taken away—there are two lodgers, besides the landlord and my<lb></lb>self—the padlock was taken away altogether; the staple remained, it was not disturbed at all—I missed the time-piece and two watches—I saw the time-piece again on the Friday following—I have not found the watches—the value of the whole was about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

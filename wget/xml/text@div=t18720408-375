I live at 14, Leyton Grove, Borough, and keep a coffee-stall—on Wednesday morning, 21st February, I was at my stall in the Dover Road, and the prisoner asked me to serve him with some coffee and a slice of bread and butter, which came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was my first customer—I took the shilling to Aldridge, a costermonger, five or six feet from me, and asked him to change it—he bent it with his teeth, and said "This is a bad shilling, old man"—it had not gone out of my sight—I returned it to the prisoner, and said that it was bad; he said he was not aware of it, and gave me a good one, for which Aldridge gave me twelve pence, and I gave the prisoner 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was too much—he went to Mint Street.</p>

I am a costermonger—on 21st February, about 12.15, I saw a man at Meehan's stall, and Meehan came across to me and asked me for change for a shilling—I tried it with my teeth and doubled it—in my judgment it was bad—I gave it back to Meehan—he returned to his stall, and brought me another shilling, which I tried in the same way, and it did not bend—I gave him the change in copper—I saw a man walk away from the stall—I did not see two other men there—I cannot say whether the prisoner is the man.</p>

I am going to tell you how I came into the other two prisoners' company. I was drinking at the Prince of Wales, but had not spoken to them. When they ran down the London Road, I asked them what was the matter, and these two policemen came up; and if I had known there was any bad coin in their pockets I should have run away.</p>

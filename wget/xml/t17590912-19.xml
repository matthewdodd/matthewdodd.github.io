               <p>Booth. When they went out of my house, they said, let us drive the cart towards the brook; I at first thought they intended to play some tricks with the butter; the prisoner own'd, that when the other man was in the cart he said there was money, and took it out and deliver'd it to him; which he said was three half guineas, a guinea, sixteen shillings and six-pence, and a 36 s. piece, which was all he saw; and they afterwards divided it between them.</p>

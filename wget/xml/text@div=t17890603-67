               <p>Prisoner. By an English Jury, my lord.</p>
               <p>The witnesses examined separate.</p>
               <p>The indictment opened by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>The case by Mr. Garrow, as follows:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, you have collected from my learned friend the charge against the prisoner, which is, that he has forged, or uttered knowing it to be forged, a draught dated on the 22d of September, 1788, being an order for the payment of money to the amount of 700 l. Gentlemen, when I have the honour of addressing myself to a London Jury in this place, I feel it to be quite unnececessary for me, to make any general observation, on the subject of the crime of forgery, or at any length to call for the attention of a Jury in this commercial city, to a subject in which the interest of the Public are so deeply involved: we know you will not let slip any circumstance which may tend to induce a fair and honest, and conscientious conviction of the guilt of the prisoner; on the other hand, if from any circumstance, more satisfaction might be derived from his acquittal, we know, that however small that circumstance may be, tending to acquit one of your fellow citizens, it will have its full weight, and make a due impression on your minds. Gentlemen, I proceeed to state, as shortly as I am able, the circumstances from which, we, on the part of the prosecution, expect that you may fairly infer the guilt of the prisoner at the bar. Gentlemen, it will be very necessary that you should attend to make some memorandums of the dates of the particular transactions, because you will have but too much reason to observe, that this which constitutes but one of the many depredations on the property of the banking-houses of this great city, is the result of great deliberation, of much caution, and of a settled system. Gentlemen, the prisoner on the 3d of September, applied at the house of Mr. Moore, whose draught this purports to be, and sold him some light gold, the amount of it was forty-two pounds; and the person who bought it of him, was about to pay him by bank notes, but the prisoner desired to have the checque of Mr. Moore, instead of bank-notes; the inference appears to be but too clear; it is not an ordinary thing for a man to prefer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030091"></xptr>to have the private cheque of any body to a bank-note, for which he has the security of the public, and the whole security of the Bank of England: on the 4th of September the prisoner went to the house of Mess. Grotes and Co. Mr. Moore drew on printed checques, which it is only necessary to fill up the name of the banker to whom it is addressed, and several other particulars of the cheque are already printed; having possessed himself on the 3d of September, with Mr. Moore's character of hand-writing, and with one of the cheques of his banker, on the 4th he went to the banking-house to open an account with them; you know by that, that he becomes possessed of a certain number of those cheques; he has them to make an honest use of; if a bad man, and wants them for any other purpose, he still is provided with the means of drawing on that house. When the prisoner opened an account there, by the name of

            , and paid in 100 l. the manner in which he paid it in, the sums of which it was constituted, will be fit for your attention; the draft he received of Mr.

             the preceding day, was part of the sum; there was a bank-note for 50 l. and 8 l. in cash, making together 100 l. He entered his name as usual in the banker's book, and had some cheques; the clerk in the house, for reasons he will explain to you, if material, from an account opened by a stranger, without any recommendation, an account of 100 l. an account opened by a foreigner, induced him to suspect him; therefore he will tell you he gave him but a very small quantity of cheques; on the 15th of the same month he went again to Mr. Moore, where he sold more gold, to the amount of 45 l. 15 s. 3 d. he there again was offered cash or bank notes for the amount; he again declined, and desired a draft; he had a draft for 40 l. and the rest in cash. I have now stated to you three days, the 3d, the 4th, and the 15th of September; but there is an intermediate day well worthy your attention; that is the 8th of September, upon which 8th the prisoner drew on the house of Mess. Prescotts, and Co. for 55 l. and on the 9th for 40 payable to himself; and on the 16th, the day after he made his second sale to Mr. Moore, and procured his second draft, he drew out the 5 l. remaining: by the 16th he had no longer any money remaining in their hand. It will be for you to judge what induced him to open an account for 100 l. on the 4th, and on the 16th to draw it out. Gentlemen, on the 23d of September, about a week after, a man of the name of Morris, presented to that house a draft, purporting to be Mr. Moore's draft for 700 l. The character of the hand-writing was extremely well imitated; but it occurred to the clerk to whom it was presented, first that Mr. Moore had not cash for so much; next, that he had never in the course of his dealings drawn for so large a sum, upon which Morris was applied to, to know from whom he had received it; he said from a foreign gentleman, at Grays-Inn Coffee-house; for whom he had done several things of the same sort, and for whom he had already been to the banking house of Mr. Prescott; and if they would go with him, he would show him to them; if Morris is believed, there is no possibility of doubt, there is no chance, by which the most humane, the most incredulous Jury men, the most disposed to acquit, can for one moment hesitate about the guilt of the prisoner; therefore it is for you to attend to the character of Morris, and to the manner in which he will give his evidence; it is with that view, I shall be particular in stating what he did on the occasion; one of the partners in Mr. Prescott's house, agrees to go to Mr. Moore, and to be informed by him, whether this was a genuine draft; another person, either a clerk or a partner, was to go with Morris, when they came there, the prisoner was not there; on enquiring of the master of the coffee-house and the waiter, it was found that he had been there, that

             the witness had been employed; in short Morris was, as he will be to day, most<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030092"></xptr>compleatly confirmed; it appeared then that there was an additional reason for the prisoner having procured) supposing him to be this bad man) that there was an additional reason for his procuring one or more of those drafts; for it will appear he sent them by Morris, so that Morris became known at the banking-house; Morris became stripped of every doubt as to the employment he was engaging in; he sends the genuine draft of Mr. Moore by Morris, he sends his own draft by Morris, therefore Morris becomes known at the banking-house, and had a reason to believe the man was acting fairly and honestly; and it will appear that whenever a genuine draft was presented at the banking-house, the prisoner waited in the coffee-room to receive it; there he took the money; but upon other occasions, where possibly there might be reasons to suspect that Morris did not come back alone, upon any other occasion upon which Morris had been successful, which does not turn out to be a true one, he did not continue in the coffee-room, but at a little distance; where perhaps the fair inference is, that he might have an opportunity of seeing whether he came alone or had some unpleasant companion with him: information was given at Bow-street, advertisements were immediately published, and every attempt that could be thought of to apprehend him; it was not however, till a considerable time afterwards the prisoner was taken into custody; when he was taken, Morris was applied to; he was taken in disguise, he was taken under circumstances, that the witnesses will tell you the moment that Morris saw him in company with a great many other persons, he said, that is the man that gave me the draft, but he is not in the same dress; he described with great particularity the dress that the prisoner wore, and I shall shew you that was his dress when he first opened his account, that it is precisely the same dress that Morris has uniformly described; I shall prove that the prisoner lived in Gravel-street, in the neighbourhood of Grays-Inn Coffee-house; I shall prove by the master of that coffee-house, I shall prove by the waiter, that at the first time the prisoner desired to have a porter (the house generally have a porter of their own), he expressly desired that it might not be the porter of the house, but a ticket porter, upon which Morris was called from his stand in Grays-Inn, and was applied to by the prisoner; I shall prove that the prisoner, who lived in Gravel-street, and who had agreed for the lodging for a time considerably longer than the time at which he left it; left it on a sudden, left it at the precise time in which it was important that the man who had delivered to

             this forged draft should abscond; I shall prove he never was seen there again; I shall prove whilst he was there, a great number of persons resorted to him, many of them Jews; I shall produce porters belonging to different inns of Court; I shall after prove his absconding from those lodgings; that very coat described by Morris, I shall prove, was left by the prisoner, together with some other unimportant articles, at the lodgings in Gravel-street; then I shall prove to you beyond all question, that on the 3d of September, the prisoner possessed himself of the genuine draft of Mr. Moore, that on the 4th of September, he opened an account, possessed himself of the cheques, therefore was enabled to draw upon them correctly; that upon the 8th, 9th, and 16th, he exhausted all the money he had at Prescott's; that on the 15th he obtained a new draft; that on the 23d he presented that forged draft in question; the remaining enquiry is only this; whether you sitting there as conscientious men, can safely say you can trust to the story that Morris tells; Morris himself has never been charged or suspected to have been an accomplice in the guilt; Morris was never in custody, Morris comes here to transfer no guilt from himself to another; but merely to state that in his usual occupation of a ticket porter, he had been employed by the prisoner at the bar; if his character should be impeached, I have witnesses of character and credit to that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030093"></xptr>point; but I shall shew you by the master and waiter of the house, that he was sent for by the prisoner at the bar, on several occasions to this coffee-room, they will likewise recollect the circumstance of his sometimes waiting till Morris came back, and I am afraid you will have no doubt about the guilt of the prisoner; I mean by that only, that I feel in common, with you and every body, great anxiety and great reluctance that any man should be found guilty of an offence, the consequence of which I am afraid must be the loss of his life; but you owe a great duty to the publick, and if you believe him guilty on the evidence, it is your bounden duty to pronounce him so, if on the contrary, you have any fair reason to doubt about his guilt, or if you have any fair suspicion of the story that Morris will tell you; God forbid you should pronounce him guilty; and I am sure that great body of persons the bankers, for whom I am concerned, have not a wish for his conviction, if any circumstance appears, on which any reasonable, thinking, sober man can for one moment entertain a serious doubt.</p>

               <p>Was there any other draft that you recollect? - That finished the whole transaction.</p>
               <p>Have you a draft for 700 l.? - Yes, (produces it.) I received this on the 23d of December, I received this from one Morris; I did not pay it, I asked him in what manner he chose to have it, he said 500 l. in bank-notes, and 200 l. in money, which is a larger sum than we usually paid money; I hesitated to pay it, I went to Grays-Inn Coffee-house with Morris and waited there some time.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner there? - No.</p>
               <p>At this time had Mr. Moore in your books to the amount of 700 l. - No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Are you perfectly satisfied that the prisoner is the man that opened the account? - I am perfectly satisfied of that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. What sort of a hand did the prisoner write? - Not a very good one, I can shew you one cheque; I never see the prisoner before, nor till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you pay these three drafts? - I paid this 55 l.</p>
               <p>Who did you pay it to? - I cannot recollect that it was Morris, but from a collateral circumstance, of which I was reminded by Morris after, I do recollect that when the 55 l. was paid, I referred to the book and examined the hand writing, and seeing it agreed I paid the draft.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you recollect that that circumstance happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then that recollection leads you to believe what Morris told you to be so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you now, independent of what Morris told you, have you a personal recollection who you paid that to? - No, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I believe you always do when it is a new customer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You remembered it as soon as it was told you by Morris? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You took Morris into custody immediately? - I went with Morris and held him.</p>
               <p>Then Morris knew that you had hold of him on a suspicion that it was forged? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did you do with Morris? - I went with him to Grays Inn Coffee-house, not in custody of any officer, I waited there for some time; after I had waited best part of an hour, we called this Morris in, Morris staid at the door to watch for the person that sent him.</p>
               <p>Was Morris left in any custody at the door? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>He might have gone away if he chose it? - We had no guard upon him; then we called Morris in, then I returned home.</p>
               <p>Did Morris go with you? - No, he did not, he was left at large; in the evening I saw Morris at Sir Sampsom Wright's, he was appointed to come there, and he came voluntarily, there was an examination of Morris.</p>
               <p>Was he kept that night, or did he go about his business? - I believe he went about his business.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030096"></xptr>When did you see him again? - I believe it was the following day.</p>
               <p>In short, was he at any time in custody at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he continue in his occupation as a porter, till the prisoner was taken into custody? - That I believe he did.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What are you? - A ticket-porter, plying in Gray's-inn; I have been a ticket-porter about two years and a half, I know the prisoner, I first became acquainted with him (looking at a memorandum) I made this memorandum at the time I did the business.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to make the memorandum? - I generally do.</p>
               <p>Do you put down every business you do? - No, I do not in particular.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to put them down? - On account of this forgery, I cannot say I put them down that minute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you put them down before you went to receive the 700 l.? - Yes, I never put down no money business.</p>
               <p>Then this is a particular instance in which you did put it down.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to tell me just now that you generally did put down those things? - I do sometimes, and this I did.</p>
               <p>Did you ever put down any other message that you was sent on? - I cannot say particular.</p>
               <p>I ask you on your oath? - I have made a memorandum, but not in particular to be positive of it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever put down any memorandum of any other message that you was sent on? - No, I cannot say I did, I only put this down.</p>
               <p>When did you put that down? - I put it down, it may be a day or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>Before you took the 700 l. draft? - I had been several times for that person.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after you took the 700 l. draft? - After I carried the 700 l. draft.</p>
               <p>Why did you say this moment before? - I did not say before.</p>
               <p>Yes, you did; who desired you to put it down? - Nobody desired me ever to put it down.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath nobody ever desired you to put it down? - Upon my oath nobody ever did.</p>
               <p>Court. Then go on, and put the paper in your pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When did you first see the prisoner? - I believe it was the 8th of September, I think it was, I am not sure; the first time that I saw him I was sent for by one of the waiters at the coffee-house, I was in Gray's-inn, a shoe-black woman called me, it was about nine I believe in the morning.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner? - He was sitting in a box in the coffee-room.</p>
               <p>Were there other persons in the coffee-room? - There were.</p>
               <p>What passed between you and the prisoner the first time you went to him? - Only he gave me a draft for 55 l. upon Mess. Prescotts, and told me to make haste, and he would wait for me till I came back; I made all the haste I could, I received the cash, and delivered it to the prisoner, he was there sitting in the same box, he asked me what I was to have; I said what he pleased, he gave me two shillings; I do not know who that draft was drawn by; I think I saw him again the 17th, I was sent for to the same coffee-house as before, I believe it was the fore part of the day, I am sure it was.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner the person you was sent for to? - Yes, he was, it was for 44 l. 0 s. 10 d. on Mess. Ladbrooks; he gave me a draft for that sum; nothing passed, he waited till I returned, and he paid me eighteen pence, I gave him the money, I did not see him again till the 22 d; then I met him the bottom of Southampton-building, Chancery-lane; the prisoner says to me, Morris; (he had my name in writing in his book.)</p>
               <p>When had he taken it down in writing? - I think it was the 17th, but I am not sure whether it was the 8th, because he took it off from the badge; he said, Morris, where have you been, I wanted to see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030097"></xptr>you? he returned back again to the gate, and to a porter that he had engaged for the next morning job, says he, I shall not want you as I have found Morris; then he told me to meet him at nine at the coffee-house the next morning; if he was not there, to wait till he came, and he would pay me for my time; nothing more passed on the 22d; on the 23d I went up at nine, the prisoner was not there, I waited till he came, he was there about twenty minutes or half an hour after nine, and the waiter came out and called another porter in; he went in and came out, and he sent me in; the prisoner tapped at the window for me, I went in, and he gave me a draft of 554 l. 8 d. upon Mess. Bidulph and Cox; I received that in notes and cash, I brought it back again, and went into the coffee-house, he was not there, I saw him in about three quarters of an hour at the gate of Gray's-inn; I went to my stand not finding him there; nothing further passed; then I delivered him the notes and the money, between the folding doors of the coffee-room.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose draft that was on Cox? - I do not; then he gave me a letter to Mr. Brooks, at Mr. Hughes's riding-school, I could not find him; when I came back again I could not find the prisoner, I did not see him then for I suppose two hours, much about two hours I saw him again at the same place, Gray's-inn-gate, about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass between you at that time? - No further than I gave him this letter, he took it, and said stop here; and he walked half way over Holborn, and returned back to me, and gave me a 700 l. draft to go to Mr. Prescott's, I judge it was about two o'clock; he gave me that draft in the street, the corner of the gateway, and ordered me to have 500 l. in banknotes, and 200 l. in cash; I carried it to Mr. Prescott's, they did not pay it, and I returned to the Gray's-inn coffee-house; two of the gentlemen of the house went with me; the prisoner was not at the coffee-house, nor I never saw him after, till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did he desire you to bring that money to? - To Gray's-inn coffee-house, we waited there for an half hour, but he did not come; I never saw him again till I saw him at Bow-street; I never was taken into custody about it, I have been in my business of a porter ever since; I have not been from the inn.</p>
               <p>Have you seen a coat at Bow-street that was produced by an officer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you believe that was the coat the prisoner wore? - I am sure it is.</p>
               <p>Are you quite certain the prisoner is the man that gave you the 700 l. draft? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again at Bow-street? - Yes, I did, when he had his beard on.</p>
               <p>Who paid you the 55 l. draft? - This is the Gentleman.</p>
               <p>(Pointing to Mr. Woodhouse.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Woodhouse be so good as to step out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What passed between you and the banker's clerk when you presented the 55 l. draft? - There was a little scruple, but on account of my badge they paid it; they asked me if I knew the person that the draft belonged to; I said I really did not know, but I had done other business for him; they paid me the money.</p>
               <p>Did they refer to any books or papers that you recollect, before they paid you? - No, I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Well, Mr. Morris, you are a porter living in Gray's-inn, in the passage there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not know the prisoner before? - Never saw him in my life.</p>
               <p>You knew a person of the name of Laurence Jones, Jonas, or Lazarus Jones? - What, Captain Jones? Yes, I knew him very well.</p>
               <p>Your wife knew him very well? - She knew him so far as that she washed for the family once.</p>
               <p>For these dozen years? - No, nor half a dozen.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030098"></xptr>She washed for the Captain? - I do not know whether he is a Captain or what he is.</p>
               <p>You know the Captain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him lately? - No, Sir, I have not seen him these four years; I do not know that I have seen him since I helped to move his things from Dean-street to the Minories.</p>
               <p>Does your wife wash for him up to this time? - No, not for these four years.</p>
               <p>He knew where you lived? - No, I do not know that he did.</p>
               <p>They did not tell you that the captain, knowing you to be a trusly man, recommended you to this job? - No.</p>
               <p>And you was sent for particularly? - I was the first that was found, the waiter came to get a porter; I was walking as we do.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - I live in Fullwood's Rents, but I was not at home, I was in the court where my business is.</p>
               <p>You were immediately desired, I suppose, to give a description of the person who had given this note to you? - No.</p>
               <p>When you carried this 700 l. note, just describe to me, without looking at the man, the description you gave of him then? - Why I gave a description of a man as I supposed him to be then, about forty-five or fifty, tall, thin, cheeks dented in, with a widish mouth, and black countenance.</p>
               <p>Any teeth? - Black teeth, very black; I believed by that he smoaked a good deal; but he had a wig on.</p>
               <p>Now you know this man is about fifty or sixty, and he has no teeth? - Yes, he has some teeth.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. He had teeth at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Now you never enquired what he was, or who he was? - What should I enquire for? I never enquired any thing at all about him, he paid me for what I did; I gave myself no trouble.</p>
               <p>What time was this draft paid? - I think it was about two, when this last draft was paid, or some minutes over or under.</p>
               <p>What day? - The 23d of September; they told me to go back again, and they would attend me, and if I met him on the road I was to take care of him; they were on the one side of the road, and I was on the other.</p>
               <p>When he crossed Holborn and turned back, did he meet any body? - Nobody, I never saw any body with him.</p>
               <p>You know the Israels, the brothers-in-law of Jones? - I know them all very well, I never saw one with him.</p>
               <p>You did not see them come up to him as soon as you had put the papers into his hand, come up and take them out again? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to be positive that you did not see one of the Israels? - I am positive, I never saw either man, woman or child with the prisoner in my life, either join him or come up to him, or give him any thing, or be about there.</p>
               <p>The draft that you took, you gave no memorandum of it? - No; I have seen one of the Israels.</p>
               <p>What did he tell you? - He never said a word to me.</p>
               <p>He did not advise you to make memorandums? - No, that I am positive of, I never saw the prisoner before in my life.</p>
               <p>Yet you mean to say you knew him again perfectly? - I had been of four or five different messages for him; he had a white coat on in the morning, but not in the afternoon, and there was star buttons and large lappels.</p>
               <p>Had he it on at two in the afternoon? - No.</p>
               <p>What coat had he on then? - I cannot say; it was a loose coat, a brown one, I believe, but I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>How came you to describe him in your hand-bill, in a whitish coat? - He had a whitish coat on, but he had a brown great coat on at the time he gave me this draft; he had a light coloured drab with star buttons; when he gave me the 700 l. draft, he had a brown coat, and another under it, I believe that was a light-coloured one, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030099"></xptr>under one; he had not that coat on with the buttons, particularly with a star, he had it on when he gave me Bidulph's draft; but he had not it on when he gave me the draft for 700 l. I took notice of the button, because it was a pretty button, it was a new button; I am positive of the man, God forgive me if I should say any thing wrong.</p>
               <p>And you was not advised by Jones, or the Israels, or any of them to do this, to make memorandums, to take notice of the buttons, or to be concerned in this business? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. These Eastwells, of whom you have been speaking, kept a pawnbroker's shop, the corner of Dean-street; Captain Jones lodged there? - He did so, I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I see a good many faces here that are connected with him, who would be just as decently and as well employed elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know Captain Jones's lady? - Yes, I knew her before he married her name was Miss Betsy Jones, she was in partnership with Eastwell; I have not seen her for several years; nobody advised me to set down this paper of memorandums, I will be upon my oath it is entirely my own doing.</p>
               <p>Who lives at Brooks-well, near Gun-dock, Wapping, No. 27? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Whose hand-writing is that? - Oh! that is some parcels that I took to the wharf out of our inn to go on board ship.</p>
               <p>Whose hand-writing is that? - This is my hand-writing, the other is not.</p>
               <p>Is not the entries that you made of the memorandum your hand-writing? - No, Sir, it is not.</p>
               <p>Then whose hand-writing is it? - It is one Metcalf that I got to write it down for me, because I do not understand figuring, and I could not figure down the sums of money.</p>
               <p>Who is Metcalf? - He is a porter belonging to the inn; I had put it down, I will shew it to you, and that is it, I gave it him to copy it, I will shew it you in my own hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not tear it out, give us your book.</p>
               <p>(The pocket-book handed to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Had you wrote this before ever I examined you at Bow-street? - Yes, I produced it there; in one of the pockets of the book you will find the case that the draft was put in to go to Mr. Cox's; there are private memorandums, in this book.</p>
               <p>Was the draft which you received from the prisoner for 700 l. the same you presented to Mr. Woodhouse? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Have you a good opinion of him? - A<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030100"></xptr>very good opinion of him, I always took him to be a very honest fellow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I suppose he took his turn as other porters do; does he ply any where else? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Therefore if I was to send for a person to your coffee-house, I should find Morris? - Yes.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WINTER sworn.</p>

               <p>I am waiter at the Gray's-inn Coffee-house; I know Morris perfectly well, I know the prisoner perfectly well; I saw him at our coffee-house, he came into the Gray's-inn coffee-house on Monday morning, the beginning of September; he pulled out a pocket-book, and called for a pen and ink, and a dish of coffee, he then asked me for a porter.</p>
               <p>Did he ask for paper also? - No, he then asked for a porter, I was going to call one of our porters belonging to our house; he then said he wished to have a ticket-porter, as his business was money matters, and he should want him again; I went to the back-door and called out porter; I was informed there was not one there, but they would send one, and Morris came in two or three minutes; I said there is a gentleman in the coffee-room that wants a ticket-porter, and I conducted Morris to the prisoner; I saw the prisoner speak to Morris, and give him a paper, the contents of which I do not know; Morris upon that went away; I did not see the prisoner some days, the prisoner did not stay in the coffee-room till Morris came back; he went out, I did not see Morris return, I did not see the prisoner again for some days; then I saw the prisoner and Morris together in a box; at that time I saw Morris speak to the prisoner, and a paper went from the prisoner to Morris; Morris went away upon that, the prisoner went just after; after that I used to see the prisoner different times; but as I had seen him many times before, I did not take any particular notice of him as I did at first; I never took any account of the days of the month, I remember the time that the forged draft was said to be presented, but I cannot say I saw the prisoner that day, but I saw the prisoner several times at the gateway, sometimes underneath the gateway, and sometimes in the coffee-room, that was after the second message; I have known Morris nearly two years, he has been employed occasionally at our house; I am quite positive to the prisoner, I knew him again at Bow-street; as my master and me were going along, we were determined to be very particular with respect to the person of the prisoner, and waited some minutes in the office, and immediately I saw the prisoner come in with many others, and I immediately tapped my master on the shoulder, and said, Sir, I am sorry to say it, but that is the man, I have not the least doubt in the world about it; the man is as clear to me as ever a man was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. On the day when this bustle was, and Morris and the gentleman came from the banking-house, you do not recollect seeing him that day at all? - No, on the Monday night I saw the prisoner, that day before he absconded.</p>
               <p>Court. You remember the day that the gentleman came back with Morris? - Yes, that day I did not see the prisoner at all, I saw him on the Monday, the day before, at Grays-Inn Coffee-house, he sat down and called for a dish of coffee; he threw down six-pence, drank the dish of coffee, and went out; I did not hear him enquire for anybody then.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Is not it like it? - It is like it.</p>

               <p>Is that like his hand writing at all? - It is like it, but I am sure it is not his.</p>
               <p>How does it differ? - The hand on the whole, I cannot immediately say.</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose it had been a draft for 70 l. instead of 700 l. and you had seen it at his banker's, should you have known it? - I should have known it was not his.</p>
               <p>Now how should you have known it? - It is wrote stiffer, Mr. Moore very seldom paid attention, he wrote generally with a very bad pen, the first that came in his way.</p>
               <p>It is like it? - Rather like it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If instead of that being an order to pay money; if it had been an order to deliver goods, should you have delivered upon it? - I think I should not, I am sure it is not his hand writing; I swear positively this is not the writing of either himself, his son, or me.</p>

               <p>Winter. The time I saw him, he had a pig-tailed wig, laced waistcoat with gold spots, and a coat like this.</p>

               <p>Morris. This is the coat I saw the prisoner with; I am looking at the stars on the buttons, it was a new coat and very pretty buttons; at that time I am positive it is the coat he wore.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. On account of the button: a taylor may make a coat like this, and a button-maker make buttons like them.</p>
               <p>Woodhouse. I do not recollect the coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel to Woodhouse. Is that draft like the hand writing of Mr. Moore?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030104"></xptr>- It is not very unlike it, it is more stiff, Mr. Moore generally writes with a pen that is more furzy at the end.</p>
               <p>Supposing that had been a draft for 70 l. should you have paid it? - I cannot tell, it is impossible for me to say, perhaps under them circumstances I might.</p>
               <p>Court. That might very naturally be, because they might be led to examine it, being so large a sum.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Looking at it now do you believe it to be Mr. Moore's writing? - No.</p>

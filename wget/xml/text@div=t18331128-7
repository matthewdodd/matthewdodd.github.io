               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. Your house is in the parish of St. Pancras. A. Yes; I know that by paying rates; the parochial rates are headed with the name of the parish, and the notices too - I went to bed about eleven o'clock; I left nobody up; the two servants followed me up the stairs - they are not both my servants; there are three servants in the house; my maid was gone to bed - Mrs. Weston's two servants followed me up-stairs - I did not go into my servant's bed-room; but I know every body was gone up-stairs - I have no means of knowing it except that the house was quiet; I did not go into the rooms of any of the servants to see that they were there - the door at which the entry was made had been locked for three weeks preceding, and the key hung up in the back parlour - I had not tried that door, to see if it was locked, for perhaps three weeks - I had not gone to the door that evening, to see if it was locked - the key hung up in the back parlour; six members of my family had access to that key - every person in the house had not access to it; my servant had access to it, not the others - my parlour door was not always locked - the servant as well as I might have got to that key - that door was the only part of the house that was opened; the other part was safe - I said the back door was a-jar; it appeared to have been opened by skeleton keys; that was the officers opinion; in my own opinion it must have been a key; I do not know what sort of a key - it was certainly not opened by a common key - when I said it had been opened by a skeleton key, I spoke from my own observations, as well as from others, it being more probable than any other kind of key to open a locked door; the common key belonging to the door was again in the parlour in the morning - I saw no marks of violence; I did not examine the door particularly - I have a lodger in my house of the name of Weston; she is a widow - neither of my servants are married women - a pack of cards were taken from Bennett, and I instantly recognized them to be mine - I said to him immediately, "I am glad to see these, as I know we are on the right scent" - I searched Bennett's lodgings with the officer; they are at Grote's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280016"></xptr>house, in St. Giles's - I cannot say he has no other place of residence - I do not know whether he had any boxes anywhere else.</p>

I am in the service of Mr. Brimmer; on the morning of the 15th of November, when I went down stairs, I found the back door a-jar; it was about seven o'clock; I observed that door overnight, it was shut and locked then - I had bolted the doors about eleven o'clock, and I saw this door was locked then; I observed that it was locked; when I found the door open, I directly went up stairs and told master; I had some things in the back kitchen overnight; there was one pair of black stockings, and one pair of white, and a pair of gloves; a pair of stays, and a shawl; I saw them there overnight - they were gone in the morning; I have since seen the shawl, the gloves, and a pair of stockings; the pawnbroker has my shawl, the policeman has my gloves and stockings; I missed from the other kitchen, some plate of Mrs. Weston's - a silver tea-pot and stand, a silver milk jug, and silver forks and spoons; I had seen the plate in the kitchen overnight - I did not see the footmarks in the garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whose servant did you say you are? A. Mr. Brimmer's; I am not married; in the morning I found the back door a-jar - I know it was locked overnight; I tried it before I went to bed; the door they got in at has bolts to it, but I did not bolt it; I only locked it - it had been locked for three weeks; during the whole three weeks, it had not been unlocked, I am quite sure; I did not say I locked the door that night - I said I tried it; I took particular notice of it next morning, it had the appearance of having been opened with a key.</p>

            10). I lodge at No. 19, Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury; on the 16th of November, I was at Grote's lodging-house, at the corner of Lawrence-lane, St Giles'. about half-past two or three o'clock in the afternoon, and apprehended Bennett and Dickinson - I found two stockings on the shelf which Dickinson said was her own, and one pack of cards, and four keys on Bennett's person, and three sovereigns and 16s. 1 1/2d. on his person; I asked Dickinson who the stockings belonged to, she said, they are mine, I said, "then you must go with me" - she did not at that time say where she got them - I took the cards from Bennett and four keys, three sovereigns and 16s. 1 1/2d. - Dickinson had nothing in her possession, but claimed the stockings.</p>

             (police-constable S. 206). I lodge at No. 10, Gloster-terrace; Regents-park. I apprehended Dybell and Baker at another of Grote's lodging-houses, at the corner of Church-street, St. Giles' - Grote has several lodging-houses - it was not far from the other - just round the corner - I apprehended them about a quarter before eight o'clock, on Saturday evening the 16th of November - they were both in one room - I found on Baker a pair of stockings which have since been claimed by Mr. Brimmer - I found in the room where the prisoner's were, two brushes and a quantity of stockings; they were in different parts of the same room, also, two keys hid among some coals in the corner of the room - this key opens the back room door on Mr. Brimmer's parlour floor; I found three knives in the same room, a pair of scizzors, a metal spoon, two cloths which are claimed by Mrs. Weston, a pack of cards which are not claimed - in the back room on the same floor which was occupied by Dybell; Baker told me it was Dybell's room, and Dybell said it was his room as well - they were both present - Baker said, "the room where I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280017"></xptr>this property was his room, and that the next room was Dybell's; Dybell said nothing at that moment, but afterwards he said, "Yes; I live there" - I found in that room this cloth several pairs of stockings, and this knife and fork - Baker said the room I apprehended him in was his room - Dybell had this pair of stockings on - I found five keys there one of which will open Mr. Brimmer's front street door - this latch key found in Dybell's room was claimed, and the knife and fork and some of the stockings.</p>

            . I live at No. 18, Brighton-street, St. Pancras. On Friday, the 15th of November, I was at the Tottenham-street theatre, and sat next but one to Dybell and Baker, in the gallery; I heard Dybell say to a person who sat next to him, "We had a rare pull last night;" the other person said to him, "What was it; Dybell said, "a silver tea-pot and stand;" they said "What else," and he mentioned several other things, I did not understand what; but among other things, he said, a boy's great coat; the boy they were talking to asked them where it was; they said, "In Mornington-place," Baker sat next to Dybell and could hear what he said; they were both joining in the conversation - in consequence of hearing that, I went the next morning and gave information to Mr. Brimmer.</p>

               <p>Dybell. Q. Did you hear me say so or was it Bennett? A. I heard you say so; you were talking to another boy.</p>
               <p>Dybell. My Lord, he is a noted pickpocket about Tottenham-court-road; he brought Baker a pair of boots to sell for him once, which he had stolen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you ever apprehended on a charge of stealing? A. No, my Lord; I have never been in the House of Correction - I was never charged with any theft - I was never charged with picking a pocket - I am a ladies' shoemaker, and work for Mr. Smith, of Perry-terrace.</p>
               <p>JOHN JEALLOUS BRIMMER. Parsons called on me and gave me information, and I sent for the police, and communicated to them what I heard from Parsons - the prisoners were apprehended in the course of that day, but I had other information besides from Parsons about Bennett; I know this pack of cards from old acquaintance; I have had them twenty years; I suppose my children had them to play with, and I have the remainder of the pack in my hands, they complete the pack; they have been used by my children for fortune-telling, and the remaining cards were kept away from them, and those I have here; the stockings found on the mantel-piece, I identify by their being odd, and I have the fellows; seven of the keys are mine, the four small keys found on Bennett, the latch key found in Dybell's room; this key is my parlour-door key; it was found in Baker's room; the stockings found on the feet of Dybell and Baker I claim (looking at those found on Dybell); I know them and have my daughter here who mended them; one of those found on Baker is mine, and my daughter can identify it - the other I believe to be mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not the two odd stockings claimed by Dickinson? A. Yes, those found on the mantel-piece; I have seen these cards in my house twenty years; I have not played with them for perhaps twenty years; my children have played with them - I cannot speak positively to twenty years; I should say I have had them from ten to twenty years; I cannot undertake to say I have played with them myself; I dare say I have never played with them, they are children's cards; I never played a round game which requires the whole pack; I don't say they are a full pack, because I have never counted them; there are fifty-two in a full pack; here are forty-one; it is not a full pack; I have printed too many cards not to know how many there are in a pack; I must be in error when I said there was a full pack; I had not counted them; I never meant to say the smaller quantity completed the pack; I will not say I did not say so.</p>

            . I am the daughter of the prosecutor - I have looked over the cards; I have been in the habit of seeing them at my father's house as long as I can recollect; in my judgment these are the same; I know them from the number there are in them - the twos, threes, fours, and fives were withdrawn, except the three of clubs; the servants had done it to play a game called fortune's, that requires those cards to be taken out; the pack then was not full, but what was not among<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280018"></xptr>them were up-stairs in the bed-room - I know the cards perfectly well from frequently using them and seeing them about; I am quite positive to them - I rather think the King of clubs is deficient; the Queen of hearts is not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You see all kinds of cards at your father's house? A. No; my father is a card printer, but his business is not done at the house, but at No. 10, Frith-street, Soho; I go there perhaps once in three or six months, or not so often - I have not been in the office to see cards - I never saw such cards as these before in the course of my life; they are children's cards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at this card; had you observed whether any of them were cut? A. Yes; this Queen of hearts was notched in this way.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. It is cut with scizzors? A. Yes, and the young woman that did it is here - after the robbery, the few cards that have been produced, (the twos and threes) were left in my father's house; I never counted them - all the twos, threes, fours and fives were taken out, but the pack was not perfect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you remembered the cards belonged to the others, because the twos, threes, fours and fives had been taken out for fortune-telling? A. Yes, I did, all except the three of clubs - I cannot say how many of each there are; I cannot tell how many of the twos I took out - I took out all that was in but the pack was imperfect.</p>
               <p>JOHN JEALLOUS BRIMMER. The four keys found on Bennett are mine, and were taken out of my writing-desk- they belonged, one to a drawer under a large box, and another to another drawer; they were tried, and fitted the places; I am certain they are mine, and I lost them that night - they were tied together.</p>
               <p>Bennett's Defence. I bought the cards - I picked up the keys.</p>
               <p>Dybell's Defence. I was coming home from work between twelve and one o'clock, and met an Irish woman; she asked me to buy some articles - I said I would - in the mean time, Baker came up; I said, "We will buy them between us" - he said, "Very well" - we gave her 2s. 6d. for them; they are the things found at the lodging - I know nothing of the keys found in my room.</p>
               <p>Baker's Defence. I was coming home from work on Friday, between twelve and one o'clock - Dybell stood talking to an Irish woman; he asked me if I wanted to buy the things - I said we would have them between us - we talked to the Irish woman about five minutes, and gave her 2s. 6d. for them; there were four or five pairs of stockings, and knives and brushes.</p>
               <p>Dickinson's Defence (written). I most humbly and respectfully beg leave to state, that I am a pauper in the parish of St. Ann, Soho, and was farmed out at Islington; on the day mentioned in the indictment I was out, and called at George Bennett's, to see a person named Susan Miller, who lodges in the house. Bennett had a pair of white stockings in his hand, and my stockings being quite worn out, I requested him to give them to me, which he did. A short time after, the prosecutor and a policeman came in to search the house, and on their taking them I said they were mine, as I considered they were, after Bennett had given them to me. The order will prove I was not out at the time of the robbery, and I can with truth assure your lordship of my perfect innocence.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LINDERGREEN re-examined. I found on Turner this apron; she wore it at the time I took her into custody - it was sworn to as part of the brown holland - I apprehended her in the New-road, and this volume of Cowper's Poems was found on her; it was about nine o'clock on Saturday evening; she was in company with another girl - I took her the same day as I took the other two.</p>
               <p>MRS. WESTON. I cannot recognise the apron; one piece of holland is so much like another I cannot swear to it - this volume of Cowper's Poems is mine; here is the fellow volume.</p>
               <p>Turner's Defence. Previous to the night named in the indictment, I met Susan Miller, who said she had bought a piece of brown holland to make aprons, and that if I would accept of a piece to make an apron, I might have it, which I did - I soon after met a lad in deep distress, and asked him if this book was his; he had it in his hand; he said, if I gave him a penny I should have it - I had no penny, but had a handkerchief in my hand; he said I should have it for that, and I gave it to him - I was in the road, and met a policeman, who asked my name, and took me in charge; I went without resistance - I was searched, and nothing was found on me, but the policeman found 7d.</p>

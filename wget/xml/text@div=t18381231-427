                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Nathan, and live in Little Chapel-street, Westminster. We have coals from Messrs. Pope—on the 25th of October a ton was brought by the carter, and the prisoner assisted in delivering them—they amounted to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my husband offered to pay it—the carter replied, "The clerk will call to-morrow for the money," and went away—next day the prisoner came with a very respectable looking young man who said he was the clerk—the prisoner said they were both sent from the office to receive the money for the coals—I understood him to mean Mr. Pope's office—as I knew him I thought it was correct, and paid him a sovereign and 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the other one produced this receipt, and signed it—the prisoner said he could not write—I put the money down on the counter—the prisoner snatched the silver up, and held it tight in his hand—the other one took it from him, and put it into his pocket, and also took the sovereign from the counter—they then both went out of the shop together—I gave the money, believing they were sent by Messrs. Pope, and that what they stated was true—the other one has not been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I was carman to Messrs. Pope at the time in question. I had a few words with the under clerks concerning this business, and left on my own account—I thought they suspected I had received this money—my master told me I might go on again if I liked, but I would not—I have been at work for the firm since at different times—I took, these coals—the prisoner went with me to assist—he is not in Messrs. Pope's employ, but is in the habit of going with us for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or any trifle he can get—Mr. Nathan offered to pay for the coals—I had no bill, and could not take it, and said the clerk would call—if the prisoner went for the money it was unknown to me—he heard Mr. Nathan offer to pay me for the coals, and knew the amount.</p>

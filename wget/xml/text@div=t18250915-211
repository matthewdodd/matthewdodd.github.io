            . I am a riding-master. In July last I was employed by my father, who lives in Mary-le-bone Place, Burton Crescent; his riding-school is in <placeName id="t18250915-211-crimeloc1121">Bidborough-street, Burton-street</placeName>

On the 14th of July, about the middle of the day, the prisoner came there to hire a horse; he said he wanted it for a few hours ride, to go to Poplar, for which he paid me 8 s. 9 d. It was a grey gelding, with a bridle and saddle, and worth twenty or thirty guineas - he took it away. I did not observe which way he rode, he said he should be back in a few hours, but he did not return. I saw the horse again on the 2d or 3d of August, and had seen him at his mother's a day or two before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. His mother is a lady living at Camden-town? A. Yes; he is eighteen or nineteen years old; his sister had been a pupil of ours - she met with an accident; he came to the school afterwards, and got acquainted with my father; he took the remainder of her lessons. I went with my father on the 2d of August to his mother's, but I remained outside on horseback; my father sent me for an officer. I then went in and saw the prisoner; I believe he had told my father that he had rode the horse to Windsor.</p>

            . I am a coach-master at Windsor. On the 15th of July, I saw the prisoner at Windsor, riding up and down the town on a grey pony. I told my porter if that gentleman should pass, and should like to sell his pony, I should like to buy it. I went to my farm, which is a little way out of Windsor, and when I returned next night my porter spoke to me, and in a few minutes the prisoner came into my office; the porter said, that was the gentleman who wished to sell his pony. I accompanied him down to the Swan Inn, had it out of the stable; the bridle and saddle were put on. I rode it up the town, and on returning asked him the price of it; he said his father had given 20 l. for it, but as it was not able to carry him, it was for sale, he asked 14 l. or 15 l. for it; it had two broken knees, and was rather lame - I offered 10 l.; he said he could not think of taking that; we went on to the Swan, he at last said he wanted money, and I should have it. I rode it home, and said I should send the money down to Lillywhite, the landlord, who would pay him, as he owed them a bill. I asked his address, he gave his father's address, Mr. Charles Stirling. I have lost the direction; I sent it up by one of our coachmen, and have not seen it since. I sent the money about nine o'clock that evening (Saturday), sent to town next morning, and found the address correct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. You are a coach-master? A. Yes, I am in partnership with Mr. Lillywhite,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150078"></xptr>who keeps the Swan; the prisoner did not apply to me to sell it; I did not hear of his having been robbed by some women - I think his bill was about 2 l.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Thumwood - he told me, if the prisoner wished to sell the pony, he should like to buy it - this was on Friday - I said nothing to the prisoner about it, but on Saturday he came to the office, and asked me at what time the coaches went to London - I said, at six o'clock, nine, three, and five, and that the fare was, 4 s. outside, and 7 s. in - to the best of my recollection, he said, "I was very tipsy last night." I said, "Yes, Sir, I saw you were, the back of your coat was very dusty, and I thought you had had a fall;" he said, yes, he had a violent fall; I said, "I thought you were out of your mind" - he then said, the pony did not exactly suit him, it was not big enough, he thought he should sell it, and have a bigger, which would suit him better. I said, "If you wish to sell it, I have no doubt my master will buy it;" I do not recollect that I had said a word about my master buying it before - he offered it for sale first; I asked the price, he said, about 14 l. for the saddle, bridle, and pony, and that he gave 20 l. for it - he did not say he would call again in the evening, but he did come, and my master that evening gave me ten sovereigns to take to the Swan, to pay for it - I understood my master was to pay the prisoner, which I did, and got a receipt signed C. Sterling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you swear, whether you was the first person to offer to buy the horse, or he to sell it? A. I never mentioned a word about buying it, till he said he would sell it - our coach office is at the Swan - I did not know that the horse was detained, but I thought the young man was short of money - I had seen him just before dusk, riding to and fro in the town - many people thought him mad - he did not tell me he had been robbed.</p>
               <p>JAMES MARTIN, SEN. I have seen the horse in the possession of Thumwood it is mine - I did not see the prisoner from the 14th of July to the 2d of August, when I saw him at his mother's house, No. 47, Park-street, Camden-town - I myself did not know him before - his sister had been a pupil of mine in July, 1824; I did not know where she lived: after the horse was lost, I received two letters, I believe both came from the prisoner - I have lost one, the officer has the other, it is signed, "Anonymous." I went to his mother's house on the 2d of August, and saw Miss Sterling; I told her the purport of my visit, and she fainted away - I called the landlady of the house to her, she recovered a little, and went up stairs, and fainted again on the stairs - the prisoner came down, and I asked if his name was Charles Sterling, he said, Yes - he then walked into the parlour, and sat down - I asked if he hired a horse at my school on the 14th of July last; he said he did; I asked what he had done with it - he said, he had sold it to Mr. Thumwood, coach proprietor of Windsor - I produced the letter, and asked if he had written it - he said, he did - I inquired how I could receive the horse back; he said, he could not tell, but he would remunerate me for the loss at some future period - he would not state exactly what period, but said he should be in possession of money at some other time - I asked if he had any friend who would come forward to guarantee the payment - he said not - I then said, I could not suffer myself to be robbed with impunity, and must give him in charge; my son fetched an officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you never attend the prisoner at the school? A. No. The letter has the Camden-town post-mark upon it. I went to the post-office, and they told me where they lived. My impression is, that he did not intend to steal it, from the penitence and reflection he seemed to have - I really think that to be the case.</p>
               <p>The letter was here read, as follows: -</p>
               <p>SIR - Your generosity and forbearance towards an unfortunate young man, shall ever be remembered with veneration and gratitude by me. - He has entrusted me with a secret, on which his life depends. Think me not presumptions when I address you a few words on his behalf; he has a mother and a sister, both of them are so honourable, and so fond of him, that were they acquainted with the capital deed he has been guilty of, they would not survive it, I am sure, at the utmost, more than a month - the rest of his family are of the most respectable; and of high rank, both in the Army and Navy, I urge this not in palliation of the crime he has been guilty of, but that you may be induced to spare the feelings of his poor family, by whose exposure and ultimate consequences of the law, they would be involved in misery and despair. He has been driven headlong to commit a crime, at which he now shudders, and recoils back with horror; his conscience gives him such true agony, that I am fearful he will soon labour under an abjuration of intellect - As you are a good man, and a charitable man, forbear the prosecution and exposure for a season. Though I am poor at present, still I hope it will soon be in my power to make you ample compensation for the loss you have sustained by him. Although I am urging a powerful request, yet the case is of such a momentous nature - the fate of three persons are involved in it - the mother, sister, and brother; if the latter were exposed, the two former would certainly fall victims; and, it is for their sakes more than for his own that he now appeals for your clemency and charity, by the practice of which virtues in this instance you will hereafter meet with an equivocal reward. For God's sake treat not this supplication lightly, but exercise your goodness; and as to the loss, if money can cancel it, although, as I said before, I am poor at present, and not able to remunerate you according to your deserts, yet, as soon as it is in my power to do you justice, depend on it I will not fail in the full achievement of my promise.</p>
               <p>ANONYMOUS.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, you have heard the testimony, and are best able to judge of the case. I can say with a clear conscience I never intended to steal it; I did not say I was going to Poplar - it is a mistake. I had not the slightest idea of committing a crime at the time; when at Windsor I was unfortunately deprived of what money I had; fell into the company of women of a low description, and was robbed of my money. I had none to defray my bill, and did not know what to do. I should have returned to London immediately if I had had a few shillings. I inquired the fare to town, and should have gone to town and told Mr. Martin immediately, but having no money I could not; and as the offer was made me I sold it, without thinking of the criminality. I returned to town directly, and told a friend of it; he said I had been guilty of a felony, and after a fortnight elapsed, I wrote a letter, as if from a friend.</p>

On the afternoon of the 7th of May, the prisoner came to my father's shop - he was then dressed in a blue frock-coat, and light trousers; I was behind the counter, and he asked to look at a gold watch which he pointed out - I took it out of the window, showed it him, and told him the price was seventeen guineas; he then asked to look at a gold chain, and a gold cross, which were in the other window; he then said, if he left the money, would we allow him to take the things to show to his lady, who was confined to her bed - I said certainly; he then said he was going a little further, and he would call as he came back - he returned in about five or ten minutes, told me to put up the things, and said he had a coach waiting at the door, and if I would go with him, the lady could see the things, and settle the business at once; while I was packing up the things, he asked to look at a gentleman's gold chain which was in the window, which I told Davies (our lad) to reach - I showed it to the prisoner; he asked the price, I said 8l. 10s. - he told me to put that up with the rest, which I did; before I had finished putting them up, he got into the coach - told me to follow him, which I did; the coach then drove to Jermyn-street - while we were in the coach he said his lady was confined with a little boy, and he wished to make her a present on the occasion; the coach stopped at the door of No. 103 - the servant opened the door; he went into the passage, and went up stairs - I asked if I should follow him; he said, "Yes, come up;" we went up, and he asked me for the things - I said should I show them to the lady; he said he would step in and see - he then went into an adjoining room, came to me, and said the lady was in bed, it would not be prudent for me to go in; I thought I heard him talking in the small room where he said the lady was in bed - I sat down and waited some time, till the servant came up and said there was a young man waiting for me; I went down, and found our young man, who had come after the coach, and had been waiting outside - he then knocked at the door, and the servant let him into the passage; he asked me if the gentleman had settled, as he was gone - I ran up stairs, and opened the door of the room the prisoner had gone into - I saw a bed, which appeared not to have been touched, but a little cane which the prisoner had had in his hand was laying on it, and I saw there was another door in the room, leading to the landing-place; I then went down, and asked the servant if that gentleman lodged there, or if there was any lady there - she said No, the gentleman had only come a little before to look at the lodgings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He says I was dressed in a blue frock-coat - it was just the contrary; he says again that I asked for a gentleman's chain - this is contrary to the statement he made before. Did you feel satisfied that I was speaking to a person inside? Witness. Yes.</p>

            . I live in Conventry-street. I was not in the shop the first time the prisoner came, but I came down while the articles were packing up. I said to my son, "I suppose I need not give you any caution, be careful;" and I afterwards said to the lad, "Do go after them and keep watch, for I am not satisfied that this is right;" the property was worth full 50l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Can you tell what dress the person had on? A.You had a blue coat and a black stock; I have no kind of doubt you are the person - I know you from your general appearance; I said before Sir Richard Birnie that I was quite certain of you - I had a description of the mark over your right eye, from the lady to whose house you went to look at the lodging.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. I am quite certain the prisoner is the person I saw at my master's shop; I remember the things being taken in the coach by my young master - I happened to be in the Temple on the 9th of June, and saw the prisoner there; I knew him the instant I saw him, and followed him to Fleet-street, where I met Jenkins, the Police-constable - the instant the prisoner saw me speak to Jenkins, he turned and ran into the Temple; Jenkins and I followed him - I called Stop thief! and he was taken in one of the squares in the Temple; he was dressed as a gentleman, in a blue coat, when he was at my master's, and when I saw him in the Temple, he was dressed as he is now, except that he had a black stock on - I have not the least doubt he is the man who came to my master's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it a frock coat, or a dress coat I had on at your master's? A. I believe it was a dress coat, but I am not exactly confident - I recognized you in the Temple before I spoke to the officer; there was no one with you then - I saw you give a letter to a man; I believe you took the same course to go back again - you did not stop at all; you ran as fast as you could till you got to a place which was no thoroughfare - I knew him in a minute.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow and live at 2, Jerusalem Court, Clerken<lb></lb>well—the prisoner resided there till his apprehension—he came there in April last—he is a widower and had two children, the deceased, aged seven, and a girl about thirteen—the deceased was taken ill three or four weeks before its death—he had a cold and cough—he was confined to his bed the last fortnight, and got very much worse the last week—he would take no food; it was offered to him by the. prisoner, but he seemed quite unable to take it—no medical man was called in until the day of his death; the prisoner then sent me for one—I ought to have fetched him some hours before, but I was not very well—the prisoner knocked at my door about 8 in the morning and wished me to do so, but I did not until half-past—I then fetched Mr. Hunter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was very fond of the child—he is a cabinet-maker, and went out to work about 8 every morning, after having breakfast with his children—he came back to dinner at 1, then went to work again, and came home about 8—the children were very well fed—they used to come and play with my children during the day, and some<lb></lb>times brought their food and ate it with them—I have three at home—the prisoner gave the child two doses of castor-oil and a little magnesia and rhubarb—he asked my advice about it—a mustard-poultice was applied to the child twice—he gave it some fried sole, mutton broth, stewed eels, eggs and rice, sherry, and a little weak brandy and water—I told him the best thing was to keep the child up with plenty of food, and he did so—he gave the children too much rather than too little—on the day of its death it had two or three spoonfuls of weak brandy and water and a sponge-cake—he asked me while he was at work to look after the child, and frequently consulted me about it—it seemed to be getting better at one time shortly before its death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licentiate of the faculty of physicians and surgeons—on 26th November, about 2 o'clock, I was called to the prisoner's house where I saw Mrs. Taylor, the deceased child, and a little girl—the child was then in a dying state, and it died within a few—, minutes—it was lying on a bed with hardly any clothing on it, simply a sheet and a very thin coverlet, and an old piece of coarse sacking—there was no fire—on a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination I found the body very badly nourished and very dirty—the internal organs were generally healthy, except the right lung, that was quite broken up, disorganised, a mass of corruption; the entire lung was in a state of gangrene—there was no trace of fat in the body—the cause of death was exhaustion from the gangrene—the gangrene was caused by inflammation of the lung which had not been attended to—it is impossible to say how long the child had been suffering from gangrene; I should say three or four days possibly;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100050"></xptr>
               <p>it might have set in very quickly—I think there is a very strong proba<lb></lb>bility if the inflammation of the lung had been treated the life would have been saved; it is a disease which is amenable to treatment—I should say the child must have suffered very much to have been in the state it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Gangrene is usually very rapid as a rule with children; a good deal would depend upon the weather, and the degree of comfort of the sufferer—a generous diet is a right thing in such a case—the brain was quite healthy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licentiate of the College of Physicians, and am senior churchwarden of Clerkenwell—I was present with Mr. Hunter at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I should say death had been accelerated by improper nourishment and want of food—the whole of the organs were emaciated, the right lung was broken down, the body was emaciated from cough and sputa—I should say the symptoms were such as would decidedly call for medical assistance—I consider that medical assistance would have saved the life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> By "improper nourishment" I mean not sufficient nourishment, not administered in a proper way under judicious advice—gangrene involves loss of appetite, languor, and inability to move—it is very rapid in its effects.</p>

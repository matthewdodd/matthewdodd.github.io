             pretended to be Master, and Elizabeth Distance said she was his Wife: I sat down with him, we drank<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173401160009"></xptr> and had an Hour's Discourse. Both the Prisoners endeavour'd to sit by me several times; I desir'd him, as he was Master of the House, to keep them off, for I did not like their Familiarity. Then both the Prisoners, at times, endeavour'd to get at my Pocket; I told him it had an ill look, and let him know my Name, and where I liv'd, that he might not think I would bear with ill Usage, for fear of being expos'd. As I was near the Door, I went to go out, but found the Door was fast: I had reason to think I was in bad Hands, and feeling for my Gold-watch, I miss'd it. I told him I was afraid he was a great Villain, and if he did not restore the Watch, I would raise the Neighbourhood, which might be of ill Consequence to them all. Says he, I'll try what I can do for you; but if I get it, what will you give? I ask'd him, What he requir'd? He said, he would not meddle with it under 5 Guineas. I reply'd it was very unreasonable in him, to insist upon any thing for helping me to my Watch when he knew how it was lost; but however, I shew'd him 2 Guineas. Well, says he, I'll consult about it; and so he and the two Prisoners went aside into a Box, and order'd me not to come near. In about 10 Minutes he call'd me in, bid me lay down the two Guineas, and look in the Window: I desir'd to see the Watch first, upon which he drew the Curtain, and I saw it. I clapp'd the two Guineas on the Table, sprung to the Window, and got the Watch, intending to take up my Money again, but he took it up before me; I re- proach'd him with his Usage, and insisted on his returning the two Guineas; upon which he and the two Women laid Hands on me, and drag'd me to the farther End of the Room; I thought my self in imminent Danger, and dragg'd them towards the Door, and they dragg'd me back again. Says Distance, He'll be too hard for us, let us throw him into the Cellar. This added to my Surprize, and I told them, I hop'd they had no design upon my Life, and again threaten'd to alarm the Neighbourhood. And indeed, at last I found a Necessity to cry out, Murder! and Thieves! when by God's Mercy, the Watchman being upon his Rounds, came to my Assistance, and they were all carry'd to the Compter, but Stanley made his Escape from them.</p>

On Friday, the 8th of December, between 12 and 1 o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop, alone, and asked to look at some black silk handkerchiefs - Miss Lambert showed him some; I should not hesitate to swear to his person out of five hundred men. I stood on the right of Lambert - she took down a parcel of handkerchiefs - they were not the shade he liked; he wished a blue-black; she took down another parcel, and immediately on her opening that he selected a piece, from which he wished one to be cut - she cut it off; he immediately said, "Cut another off the same piece," and while that was being done he took the first piece, which he had objected to, and took his own handkerchief off his neck, and measured the width with it, covering the first parcel with his handkerchief; my back was turned, to hold the handkerchiefs for Lambert to cut, and, I suppose, at that time this piece was taken; after the handkerchief was cut off he saw another coloured one on the counter, which he bought, and said, "Now, I have bought more than I intended - lay them by, and I will come back with the money in a few minutes, and while I am gone cut me off some shoe strings;" he left the shop - he was the only customer there, and in two minutes after he was gone Miss Lambert missed this piece of handkerchiefs; he never returned for what he had bought. This was on Friday, and on Monday, in consequence of information, I went out, and saw him in Paternoster-row - I have every reason to believe his eye caught me, for he altered the direction he was going; he was coming straight, as if to come into Cheapside, by my house, but he turned round, by Mr. Dunnet's, towards Newgate-street - finding no officer, I got before him, and came in contact with him at the corner of Newgate-street; I laid my hand on him, and said, "My good man, you forgot to call for those handkerchiefs;" he trembled like a child, and said,"Handkerchiefs; Sir - I don't know what you mean;" I took him into my shop, and he said I was quite mistaken in his person, that he was as respectable a tradesman as me, and lived in Ratcliff-highway - but before he left the shop he gave four different names and addresses. I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. At what hour was he at your shop? A. I think as near half-past twelve o'clock as could be - I was standing still in the shop, waiting for customers. My errand-boy came in on Monday, and said he was in Parternoster-row - I went, and found him about thirty yards down the row, and when he came to the end he turned towards Newgate-street; I believe he did not see me then; he made no resistance: Lambert was in the shop, and said she was sure he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110019"></xptr>the man; she said he had been shaved since, but not that he had shaved his whiskers; I said the person had a long beard, and she said the same; we neither of us said any thing about his whiskers being shaved; his beard wanted shaving when he came for the handkerchiefs. I had his hat put on once, for Lambert to be sure about it - she had no doubt of him before, but when he was in the officer's hands he took his hat off, and I asked him to put it on - he did not say his name was Evans, nor that he was a potatoe-dealer, living in Back-lane, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he did not say that? A. He said a great many things before he said that - he said he was a potatoe-dealer, but when I delivered him over to the officer he said, "No, I am not a potatoe-dealer, my wife's mother is one;" he did not say he was a potatoe-dealer, living in Whitechapel, in my hearing; I heard nothing of his mother-in-law, living in South-street, Spitalfields - I declare I never heard it. I did not hear him give his address to the officer - he had a pair of garters with him, which he said he had bought at Mr. Fisher's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What names did he give you? A. I was so agitated I do not recollect, but the first he gave was John Davis.</p>

            . I was behind Mr. Bunn's counter; the prisoner came in about one o'clock, and inquired for black silk handkerchiefs - I am certain of him. I showed him a parcel of handkerchiefs; he did not approve of them - they were a blue-black, and he wished them without a fringe; I left that piece on the counter, and showed him another parcel - each piece contains six; I then showed him some bandanas, and cut him off one; he said he would take another, which I also cut off - he then asked the price of a coloured bandana, which had been cut off before, and said he would have one - he then said he would go and fetch some more money, and we were to keep them till he returned; I had seen him take his own handkerchief off, but did not observe what he did with it - he was a few minutes in the shop, and had not been gone two minutes before I missed the piece of handkerchiefs I had first shown him; no other customer had been in the shop - he never returned. On the Monday Mr. Bunn brought him into the shop - I was then quite certain of him; he is a very tall man - he said he was never in the shop before; he gave his name as Davis, and said he lived in Ratcliff-highway, and then in Whitechapel; I do not recollect his giving any other name - I never had the least doubt of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When he was brought into the shop did you not remark about his beard and whiskers? A. I said he had a longer beard on the Friday, but not that it was black, and I thought his whiskers were rather longer - I said that was all the difference I saw, but never expressed a doubt about him. I did not perceive that Mr. Bunn was agitated. The prisoner said he lived at some place in Whitechapel, which I do not recollect - as he went out of the shop he said he meant to say his wife's mother kept a potatoe-warehouse; I did not hear him say where she lived - he was in the shop about five minutes before the officer came; Mr. Bunn, the boy, and Mr. Wilkinson, who lives next door, were in the shop. When I was told to look at him he immediately took his hat off; Mr. Bunn told him to put it on, as I had never seen him without his hat. I never expressed the least doubt of him- I have talked this over with Mr. Bunn once or twice, and have heard him mention it to others.</p>

            . I am twelve years old, and live with Mr. Bunn, who is my second cousin. I was in the shop when the prisoner came in; I am certain he is the man - I staid all the time he was there; he asked for black-silk handkerchiefs, which were shown him - he then wanted them without fringe; he was shown some, and bargained for one first, and then for another - they were cut off - he then bought a bandana; he desired they might be put by, saying he would return for them directly with the money - I did not see him again that day; but on the Monday I saw him in Paternoster-row - I recollected his person, and ran back to master - he came out with me; before master took him, he turned round to go to Newgate-street; when Mr. Bunn brought him back, I heard him say he kept a potatoe-shop, but I forget in what street - as he was going out of the door, he said he meant to say his wife's mother kept a potatoe-warehouse; I have never doubted about him; he took his neck-handkerchief off in the shop, and measured it across a piece, which has not been found since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you serve in the shop? A. No; I take out parcels - I saw him close by the Chapter coffee-house, coming towards Cheapside - I do not know whether he saw me - when I returned with master he had got out of Paternoster-row, and was crossing over to Newgate-street - when he was brought into the shop, Lambert said something about his whiskers - I think he said he lived in Back-lane, St. George in the East; it was between 11 and 12 o'clock that the handkerchiefs were stolen.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old, and was in the prisoner's employ last December - I mind the child - he keeps a potatoe-warehouse in Back-lane, which is in St. George in the East; but they give it two or three names. On the Friday, before the Monday on which he was taken, he was at home washing potatoes all day; he got up between nine and ten o'clock on Friday, for my mistress sent me up between nine and ten o'clock to ask if he was coming down to take the shop-gate off; he then had his breakfast, and was washing potatoes all day, and putting them into binns and baskets - he was working in the back part of the shop - he had pork-sausages for dinner, and after dinner he went to the potatoes again and was washing them till eight o'clock that night - he was not out of the house all day; his wife was with him; Mr. and Mrs. Baker called there between five and six o'clock, just as we were going to tea; they stopped about an hour, and I was sent for a quartern of gin; I dined with his wife between twelve and one o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did Baker live? A. In Market-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110020"></xptr>street, St. George in the East; I do not know Mr. Lane; on Friday I always help him to wash the potatoes, as there are so many, and fill the baskets - the children play about in front of the shop; I am in the shop from morning till night - I know master shaved himself, for he sent me out of the room while he did it, that was about twelve o'clock on the Wednesday; he went out, and came home on Wednesday night very tipsy; I do not know that he shaved afterwards; he shaves when he is going out on particular business - he did not shave on Sunday nor on Monday - I did not notice that he had a long beard; I have heard mistress say that her mother lived somewhere in Spitalfield-market; she does not deal in any thing; master always washes the potatoes on Friday, and could not have gone out without my knowing it - I went to Guildhall two or three days after he was taken up, and was examined before the Magistrate, and said the same as I have now - my master had small whiskers, but no beard; he used to shaved all his face, but did not shave from Wednesday until he was taken up - I told this story in a room at Guildhall, where the clerk took it down - I am not certain it was at Guildhall, or whether it was to an attorney I mentioned it.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you see Mr. Baker go out with your master? A. Yes, after he had shaved, and it was on that day he came home tipsy; it was the day before master washed the potatoes; I do not know how the days of the week go, but I know on Friday he washes the potatoes that they may be ready for Saturday.</p>

            . I live in Market-street, St. George in the East; the prisoner took the shop, in Back-lane, of me about the middle of November; it is called Shadwell, or St. George's - it is in Shadwell parish - I never heard it called Whitechapel; I heard of the prisoner being taken on the Monday, and went before the Magistrate with the last witness on the Thursday following - on the Thursday, before the Monday that he was taken, he called on me respecting making an appeal against the taxes of the shop he took of me - we went to the British Union school-room - he was in his working dress, but was certainly decent; he was clean about the face - I did not notice whether he was shaved; I should not suppose he ever had a very strong beard. We went from the school-room to the Ship public-house, in Shakespeare-walk, kept by Mr. Scott - I left him there about eight o'clock, rather fresh, and am told he went home in liquor. On the Friday, the day of the robbery, I and my wife were passing his shop, and called in about six o'clock in the evening - his binns and baskets were full of potatoes, which were fresh washed - I staid about one hour with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you kept the shop, did you wash your potatoes? A. Almost always; the general day for washing them was on Friday - Back-lane cannot be called Ratcliff-highway; his mother is a potatoe saleswoman, and lives in South-street, Spitalfields; that is about one mile from Back-lane; Shadwell, and Ratcliff-highway is all in one street - Back-lane runs parallel with them northward.</p>
               <p> - BAKER. I am wife of the last witness. I remember the prisoner being taken - I had called at his shop about tea time, on the Friday evening before he was taken - we staid there about an hour; there was a quantity of potatoes in the shop washed; the baskets and binns were full, and a great deal of Christmas holly about the place - we generally washed our potatoes on a Friday when we lived there, as there is a great demand on Saturday; I never observed that the prisoner had any beard at all; I should suppose he never had occasion to shave.</p>

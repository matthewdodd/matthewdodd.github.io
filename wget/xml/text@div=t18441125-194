A gentleman I was at work for put me into this house; the prosecutor came and asked the rent of the house; I told him; he said he should want it, that he should sow the ground with grass, and would give me the job, and that he would give me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, and coals and candles; I said I was obliged, and would stay; he then brought a horse, and said might he be put into the stable; I said I did not know, he must ask Mr. Hudson, the proprietor; he then brought these things, and soon after went into the country; Mr. Hudson came, and said what busi<lb></lb>ness had I to let Mr. Skinner have possession of the house; then Mr. Skinner came, and said what should he give me to take care of the horse; I said 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; I worked all day, till twelve o'clock at night, and got no recompense; he then came and found fault with the things; he asked my wife for a screw-driver, got her into the shed, fastened the door, and would not let her pass; he said, "You had better leave, I am going to leave." I said, "When do you move?" he said, "This week." I said, "You had better take these things." My wife gave him a bill, but he did not pay it; he came and said, "I want you to go and seize on a shoe-maker;" I refused; I came back in the evening, and he said, "Your wife has given me another bill, when are you going to move?" I went and found all my things packed up, and he said he would lend me a horse and cart to take them in; we put the things in one comer of the room, and when I opened them I found I had got these things; I thought he might have put them in for the money he owed me; I did not see them packed up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant—on Friday, 24th August last I was engaged by the prisoner as a clerk, at a weekly salary, at Portsmouth Chambers—he professed to be the Secretary of a society for the abolition of imprisonment for debt—the business was purported to be carried on at those chambers—he said that Sir Richard Bethell was the promoter of it, and also Mr. Edwin James—on 28th August I had been to the Queen's Bench to see if any subscription had been paid in by Captain Hudson, and, immediately on my return, the prisoner produced this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and asked me to get it cashed—this is his endorsement, written in my presence—I believe the body of it to be his writing also, inasmuch as the E in Howell is the same in each—it is a sort of Greek E—he told me to endeavour to get it cashed—that it came by post, too late, from Sir Richard Bethell, and he could not pay it into the bankers—I took it to my friend Mr. knight, a publican in Vere-street, who said he could not conveniently spare the money as it was Saturday night—I said, "If you cannot get it cashed all I require is to borrow 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon it, which will serve the purpose for this evening—I got 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Knight, and gave it to the prisoner—I saw him again on the Sunday evening, and he made an appointment to meet me at half-past 9 on Monday morning, requesting me to come to the office half an hour earlier, as he had to go to the City to get some money from his bankers—he re<lb></lb>quested me to go to Mr. Knight, and ask him to retain the cheque till 11 o'clock, when he would return the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and take Sir Richard Bethell's cheque and pay it into his bankers—he never came to the office, and I never saw him again till he was in custody a fortnight afterwards—I have never seen this envelope before, except in the hands of another gentleman—I have no doubt it is the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">Cheque read</hi>: 25th August, 1860, Messrs.

JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where have you carried on the business of an accountant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At 115, Cheapside, and in King-street, in partnership with Mr. Sandyman—I have been an accountant eighteen years at that place—I had an office in Essex-street, Strand—I was with Mr. Sandyman two years and a half, but left because he was going to manage a bank; after that I subsisted for two years, with the assistance of my friends; my wife has an income of her own, but I have been separated from her for nine years—she allowed me something during the two years that I was out of employ<lb></lb>ment, perhaps to the extent of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—it must have been more than 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have a large family, and my sons have given me occasional assistance—there is really a society for the abolition of imprisonment for debt, for I saw about 5,000 circulars which I was instructed to fold up and address, and</p>

               <p>the last thing that Mr. Howell said was that when he came up he would afford me the names of the Committee—this cheque is endorsed, "Richard D. Dyson," that is my writing—I endorsed it when I gave it to Mr. Knight, whose house is scarcely two minutes' walk from the office—it did not strike me that the cheque was a forgery—I was so confident in Mr. Howell, that I did not think of opening the cheque—I believe that both these H's are Mr. Howell's writing—I do not know how the envelope became torn—there was some stationery there, 5,000 circulars, some ink-stands, a table, and two or three chairs which belonged to Mr. Tempany—I wrote several letters at the prisoner's direction to ask persons to allow their names to be placed on the list of the general committee—I do not recollect writing a letter to that effect to Sir Richard Bethell—the prisoner mentioned to me his intention of taking fresh offices—there was some desultory conversation passing between the prisoner and Tempany on Friday afternoon about it, but I paid little atten<lb></lb>tion to it—I do not recollect what the cause of disagreement was—I do not know that there was a cause of disagreement—in consequence of some conversation, the prisoner expressed his intention of taking fresh offices—he requested me to call on the Monday morning, as I came to the office, to look at some offices, and give him my opinion of them—there was a clerk engaged I believe, as well as myself, in the office—there was a lad in the office for the two days I was there—I do not know his name—I supplied a bill sticker, named Fowler, with addresses—I did not see the envelope—I have been in a great deal of trouble—I have never been charged with any offence—I am quite positive as to that—I borrowed 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Knight on that cheque—I did not get the cheque cashed—I did not first go to a Mr. Sickers'—I swear that I did not tell the prisoner that I got the money advanced at Mr. Sickers', or that I got it cashed by Mr. Sickers' foreman—I don't know Sickers' foreman.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>August—on Saturday, 25th August, he brought this cheque to me and asked me if I would cash it for him, and then if I could get it done for him—I looked at it and felt convinced that it was his own writing, and I think so still, to the best of my belief—he said that he had received it from Sir Richard Bethell—he had an envelope in his other hand which I paid no attention to; but my impression is that this is it—this stamp appears to have had a blot of ink on it, but not to have passed through the post—there is no post mark on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you make that observation to the prisoner at the time, that it was his own writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I shrugged up my shoulders and said, No, it was no business of mine—I had not seen the prisoner for two or three years, till the Sunday evening previous—he came to my house on the Saturday and brought a gentleman with him, and on the Sunday evening he made an appointment with me to go to this gentle<lb></lb>man's, Mr. Buddin's, house—he then said that Mr. Edwin James would find 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and I should have half of it—the prisoner was to pay me rent for this office weekly—that was not contingent on the success of the association—I was not to give credit for the rent—I did not propose to the prisoner to go into partnership with him in a law agency—the address of the society was submitted to me in manuscript, and I objected to the form of it and suggested alterations—the prisoner did not advance me any small sums of money; but I paid some small sums for him, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not ask him for letters—I took some of the letters to the Queen's Bench prison—I did not propose to act as the prisoner's clerk—I never entered his employment—I was repairing the chambers and fitting them up—I some<lb></lb>times do something as an accountant; but I have been a'paper-hanger and have done painting and graining—I am only the occupier of the chambers; I rent the entire premises and let them out; the landlady is Mrs. White—I do not pay the rent of the houses—I have only possession of two of the houses at present, and my payments do not commence till I get the four—I have had them two years—I brought an action once against the Strand Board of Works for false imprisonment—I did not carry it—I abandoned it because I was a day too late, by accident; that was purely an accident—that imprisonment was for some work done at a house which had been out of my possession for twelve months—I will swear the body of this cheque is not in my writing—(<hi rend="italic">The witness here wrote the words, "The Queen on the Prosecution of Sir Richard Bethell, Knt., and signed his name</hi>)—I could perhaps write a little better than that if I were to sit by your side—I do not know Mr. Corbatt—I know the Castle public-house in Portugal-street—I saw the prisoner there a fortnight or a month before he took the offices—I said that I had not been intimate with him for two years; it was in<lb></lb>correct if I told you I had not seen him for two years.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

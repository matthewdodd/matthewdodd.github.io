                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, and live in Windmill-street. The prisoner was in my employ for three years and a half, or rather longer—I missed some sugar; some has been brought to me by the officers—I found it precisely the same as the prisoner had been using for some time past—I have it here, and a sample from the bulk; I believe them to be the same.</p>

On 19th April, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I went to 63, Wardour-street—after some time the prisoner came in—I called his attention to a bundle of sugar I had found in his cupboard, tied in a handkerchief—I asked him how he came by it—he said a young man gave it him—he refused to tell me who—he then said, "I brought it from my master's place, but it was the sweepings of the boards"—I took him to the station—I found two of his pockets had sugar in them, and they appeared to have been much used for carrying sugar away—I produce one of the pockets; it has a quantity of sugar in it. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> The prosecutor never found a bit of sugar on me. <hi rend="smallCaps">

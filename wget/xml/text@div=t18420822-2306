                  </hi>. I keep an ironmonger's shop in Russell-street, Blooms<lb></lb>bury. On the 22nd of July I was in Museum-street, returning home—about two hundred yards from my own house, I met the prisoner who was my servant, coming in a direction from my house, without his hat or coat, and with something heavy in his apron—he saw me, turned, and walked back again—I went on to the corner of the street, and there lost sight of him—I stood at the corner, and in about ten minutes he came out of a public-house—I asked him what he had in his apron—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Yes, you had"—he then said he had a mat—the landlady of the house then came out and said he had left a parcel in the tap-room—I found it was this lead in a mat—I believe the lead is mine—it is the ordinary kind of cuttings that we have.</p>

               <p>On Monday the 11th of March, we were going to spend the evening at Islington, five of us, three went to a house in Featherstone-street, I and Mr. Bull to the Red-Lion, while we staid there, the three men that stopped us came out of the Red-Lion, and walked up towards the Green-gate, we followed them, when they came to the green gate they were under the Shepherd and Shepherdesses wall, we went across the road, they went on, we followed, when we came between the ditches they slackened their pace, and the last of them stopped behind, we all passed him, and one of our party had passed the two first.</p>
               <p>How many were you? - Five together, when he was passed they catched hold of his breast, and said, damn your eyes, where are you going, I went to the man that was attacking him, and caught him fast by the arms, and went into the ditch with him, we tumbled into it; he kept jobbing at Mr. Bull, who said he was wounded, I looked, and saw he had a sort of a dagger in his hand, while they were stopping Mr. Bull, he ordered the man with him to fetch the other back, while I lay in the ditch, this man came and cut me over the back, a hole through my coat and waistcoat, and my hair almost all off my head, my stock-buckle was bent double.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Five of us were going to Islington to spend the evening, we were at the Red-Lion, the corner of Old-street-road, just by the pound, we stood by the house about ten minutes before eight, when we were at the corner of Old-street we saw three men come out of the Red-Lion, when we were by it, I observed to the gentlemen along with me, it looked as if they were going on no good.</p>
               <p>Where is the Green-gate? - It is close by the City-road; Brightwell is at Hicks's-hall getting a bill, he was foremost, they told us we must have separate bills, he passed unmolested at first, he was about five or six yards before Mr. Bull, Mr. Wilkinson next to him, Brightwell was suffered to pass; when Mr. Bull was attacked I went to his assistance, and threw Lake into the ditch, and fell in with him, Mr. Bull jumped into the ditch immediately to assist me, I observed he made short pushes with something in his hand at Mr. Bull, as I had hold of him behind, I could feel his arm jerk, I did not know he had any thing in his hand at that time, Mr. Bull called out he was wounded, then I looked and saw the dagger.</p>
               <p>There were three of these men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was engaged with Burrell? - Yes; he knocked the hanger out of the handle,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100062"></xptr> he has got the hanger or cutlass here, the man who dropped behind was engaged with one of our people; after I perceived the dagger I swung him round and threw him on his face, then the man that was before came back, while I lay at top of him, and cut me over my back, and cut my hair almost all off my head, I was obliged to let him go, and he got over the ditch immediately.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoners, do you know any of them? - Yes; the middle one in black is the man that I had in the ditch, (James Lake) he is the man I threw into the ditch, I cannot swear to either of the others, I had seen these three men come out of the Red-Lion.</p>

               <p>It was pretty dark at this time? - It was pretty dark, Mr. Bull was the first person they spoke to, we fell in side-ways into the ditch.</p>
               <p>I suppose you did not keep your feet, either of you? - Yes; both were on our feet when we got into the ditch, I can safely swear to Lake that he was the man I had in the ditch, nothing more passed than damn you stop, where are you going.</p>

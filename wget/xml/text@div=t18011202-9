               <p>WILLIAM SMITH sworn. - The prisoner was in company with me at the Unicorn, in New Gravel-lane; I wanted a place to sleep, and he said I should sleep with him; I went to the house with him and gave him a shilling to get a pot of beer, which he brought, but no change; we went out to get some supper and I heard a bad character of the house; going up the lane, he wanted to borrow a shilling of me, but I would not lend it; he had seen my money, and he followed me, and knocked me down; I got up again, and he knocked me down again, and put his foot on my bowels, and I felt him put his hand in my jacket pocket; I holloaed; murder, after he had taken a glove with a guinea and a half in it, and the women came out and holloaed, murder and robbery, for the prisoner kept kicking and jumping on me all the time; the watchman came up, and just as he turned the corner, the prisoner jumped on my loins, and ran away; he was apprehended soon after; I was not in liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you change any gold at the public-house? - A. Yes, a seven-shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money might you have in the morning? - A. I had ten shillings in the morning, and in the evening I had two guineas; I had a guinea and a half in gold, and a seven-shilling piece, which I changed; I cannot say what the reckoning came to, we had a good deal to drink, but I was quite sober; I paid half-a-crown where I slept after, for I had half-a-crown and some halfpence left; I had sold my watch, made me have the money; I had bought a pair of second-hand shoes out of it, but never said I had bought two pair of new shoes; I know Mr. Anthony, but I never said to him that I had no more than two shillings in my pocket, and was angry because I accused him of robbing me, but I had done it for the reward; I never said so to any body.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman, at St. Paul's, Shadwell: Going my rounds between twelve and one, I heard the cry of murder, and a person say, for God's sake, watchman, come and relieve me, or else I shall be murdered; I found the prosecutor on his elbows and knees, and as soon as the prisoner saw me, he jumped on the prosecutor's loins, and ran away; I followed him half down the lane, and overtook him, with a stick in his hand, (produces it), which he knocked me down with; when I recovered myself, I followed him again, but he got into a house, and bolted the door against me, and made his escape out of the back door into the fields; the officer of the night apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you came up, the prosecutor was on his knees? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he jumped on his loins; I should think he might jump upon his legs very well, but not his loins? - A. The prosecutor, when he jumped, was then flat; it was quite moonlight; there were two or three girls, but I cannot say whether they were in company of the prisoner: I have had no conversation with the prosecutor about this trial or the reward, or do I know of a reward.</p>

             sworn. - I am the beadle, and about the hour of twelve, on the 17th of November, I took a walk, and heard there was a disturbance; when I got there, they described the prisoner; I searched a house there, but could not find him; I was informed he had a stick in his hand, without a hat; long hair, and jacket and trowsers: returning to the watch-house again, I met him in Shadwell High-street, with this stick in his hand, down by his side, (produces it); I took him by the collar, and asked him what he had got there; I took it from him, and took him to the watch-house, where I searched him, and found five penny pieces and some halfpence, but no purse, or other money.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prosecutor about the robbery? - A. Yes; he said he was to have board and lodging from the watchman till the trial came on, if he would prosecute the prisoner; the prosecutor came with James Naill to my house to look for a lodging; they were both much in liquor; Smith wanted to go out again, Naill advised him not, and said, he wanted to go among the girls, but that he himself wanted to go to bed.</p>
               <p>JAMES HENRY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a sailor; I had some conversation with the prosecutor; he told me he had pledged his watch in the morning for a guinea and a half; he said he had lent the boatswain of the ship that he came over in half a guinea, and bought two pair of shoes; he paid the reckoning 1s. 6d. for which he changed half a guinea in my company.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was a half-guinea? - A. Yes; he had a seven-shilling-piece in change; the boatswain asked him to lend him half-a-guinea more; he said, no, I lent you two shillings, I have nine shillings left, and you may have that.</p>

On the 10th of November last, the prisoner at the bar came into my house, between eleven and twelve o'clock; he asked for change of sixpence; I gave it to him. He said I will have a glass of gin now, as you have been so good as to change me the sixpence; he gave me two-pence out of the halfpence, and went out. In a minute a man came in, and tendered a shilling, and I offered him this sixpence in change; he told me it was a bad one. I gave him another, and laid it on the counter I then went down to my coal-merchant, at his coal-wharf, and on my return, between two and three o'clock, the prisoner was in the shop, getting a glass of gin. She shewed me a sixpence he had tendered; I compared it with the one I had in my pocket, that he had given me before, and I perceived they were both bad. I then put them both into his hand, and collared him, and told him he was a smasher. A person named Loveday, who was in the tap-room, came to my assistance, and went for an officer, who on searching the prisoner, found eighty-five pieces of bad money about him, resembling sixpenny pieces.</p>

            . I am street-keeper belonging to Christ Church Hospital, and the prisoner was delivered into my custody. I asked him if he had any money about him; he told me, no. Upon that, I told him it would save himself and me a great deal of trouble if he had any, to count it out on the table. He then counted out eight penny-pieces, and thirteen pence halfpenny. I then proceeded to search him, and found eighty-seven sixpenny-pieces on him. (Producing them.) They are in the same state in which I found them, with paper between them.</p>

I was tired, and when I went up to bed, I missed the tankard. I asked the maid where it was, and she knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Slade. About half an hour after eleven, and the tankard was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there in the house besides?</p>
               <p>Slade. There were two young men that lodge in the house, but they were fast asleep, and after the Prisoner was gone, I waked them, and bid them go up to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a poor man there?</p>
               <p>Slade. Yes, but he went away; the Prisoner was left in the house by himself, except the two young men that lodge there.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were two women there?</p>
               <p>Slade. Yes, but they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say you saw the tankard in your house after the two women were gone?</p>
               <p>Slade. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of it?</p>
               <p>Slade. Yes, I am sure of it, for the tankard was behind the Prisoner's arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen it since?</p>
               <p>Slade. No, the Prisoner's wife has mobbed me and my wife about it, and said I had found it since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take it out of the house?</p>
               <p>Slade. I did not see him take it out of the house to be sure, I only took him up on suspicion.</p>

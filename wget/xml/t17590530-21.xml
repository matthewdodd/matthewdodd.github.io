            . I was sent for to justice Fielding; there the woman was, and she acknowledged she had sold the tankard to Mr Cook. The justice order'd me to fetch him, knowing he lived in credit. I went, and he came, and said he had bought it, but had melted it down. The justice sent me to search, and Mr Cook's wife deliver'd it to me cut to pieces. He admitted them pieces was the tankard he had bought of the woman at the bar.</p>

               <p>One Mr White was with me at Mrs Andrews's and he took the tankard from the table in the tap-room. I desir'd him to carry it back again. He said no. The next morning I carried it, and sold it to Mr Cook.</p>
               <p>Cook's Defence.</p>
               <p>This woman, meaning Goldsmith, has been backwards and forwards at my house for this year and half past. She went by the name of Mrs Phillips. She used to say her husband had an income of 200 a year. She frequently used to pretend she was going to market, and would come in, and sit sometimes a quarter of an hour. One time, I remember, she told me, her husband belong'd to the War-Office. At that time she appear'd to be big-bellied: that was about a year and half ago. She came on the 1st of May in the morning. I was busy with a customer in the shop. I desir'd her to walk into the parlour. She sell a telling my wife she had a relation died in the country about 15 miles off, and she had left her a two-quart tankard, a pint mug, a half pint mug, and other things; and she had left a nephew of her's a thousand pounds; but he was extravagant, and she was afraid he would run through it. She told me, her aunt's name was Bennet. She said, that tankard was not altogether so useful for her, she would depose of it; and that her husband bid her to lay the money out in what manner she pleased. She said she could do no less than have a mourning-ring for her aunt; and gave me the letters that were upon the tankard to put upon it. She bought a plain gold ring, and half a dozen tea-spoons. On the Wednesday morning came a Warning from Goldsmith's-Hall; it surpriz'd me, describing a 2 quart tankard; but when I found the letters did not answer with the letters in the Warning, I concluded that could not be the tankard mentioned in the Warning. And one thing is very remarkable on the tankard, all 3 large capital ***, not mentioned in the Warning. Besides, the Warning says, the handle bent, the lid crack'd, the bottom much bruised. The bottom of this was very smooth, as a new tankard. I had it in my house about a fortnight before I broke it to pieces. I gave 5 s. per ounce for it. It is the usual way all silversmiths do before they melt, they cut the silver into small pieces.</p>
               <p>He had many witnesses to his character; but the jury said, they were well satisfied as to his innocency, without calling any.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On Thursday evening, the 31st of March, I was in Chiswell-street; I saw the prisoner about twenty minutes after eight o'clock in the evening, with something bulky in his jacket - I followed him a few paces, and asked what he had there; he said Nothing, but I opened his jacket and found the property - I was taking him to the prosecutor, on suspicion, and he said, "If you will let me go this time I will never do the like again."</p>

On Thursday night, the 31st of March, between eight and nine o'clock, I was in my father's shop and saw the prisoner and another boy come in- the other boy asked me the price of some pearl buttons, which were in the window - I sent my sister to ask my father; she came back and said they were 1s. a dozen - the boy looked at them, and said they were flat, not round, and he would tell his mother the price - they then went out, and in ten minutes the officer came - I looked into the window and missed the parcel of pearl buttons - I did not miss the garters - the buttons had been safe till they came in, and the officer brought them back.</p>

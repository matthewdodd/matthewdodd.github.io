                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Thursday, about half-past two o'clock, I received information of the copper having been stolen—from that information, and from my own suspicions, I came to town, and in the Borough I overtook the prisoner Towers' carriers-cart—it was standing still when I first saw it, and a young man named Cole was in it—in about a quarter of an hour Towers came to the cart, got into it, and drove over London-bridge—he stopped at a public-house, and got down, but took nothing out—he then got up again, and drove direct to White-street, Cutler-street, Hounds-ditch, to a marine store-shop—he got down from the cart there, and went in—he returned in four or five minutes, and said something which I did not hear to Cole, who was in the cart, upon which Cole handed him a hamper, which Towers took on his shoulder, and carried into the marine store-shop—I directly went into the shop, and found Towers in the act of taking the copper out of a sack out of the hamper, and the marine store-dealer was preparing the scales to weigh it—I said, "This is what I was look<lb></lb>ing after"—I stopped it, and took Towers in custody to Bishopsgate-street station—he there said he had bought the copper of two boys, named Barnes and Cole, for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took him to Greenwich station, and when the Inspector was booking the charge there, he said he had had the copper of the two boys, Barnes and Cole, and he had given them 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account, and he was to give them half what the copper fetched, after he had taken it to London and sold it—my brother constable apprehended Barnes, and on the following morning as I was taking him from Lee to Greenwich, he asked if Cole was come home with the cart—I said, "I don't know, why?"—he said, "I shall tell the truth about it"—I said, "Mind, whatever you may say to me will appear, and be said again in a court of justice"—he said, "I don't care, I shall tell the truth"—he said that Towers had sent for him to his father's, saying he wanted to speak to him, and when he went, he asked him to assist in lifting a heavy tub, and afterwards asked him to go and get Mr. Williams' copper, as he was going to town, and he wanted a little money, and that Towers gave him some warm beer—he afterwards said he went into the place, got the copper, put it into a sack, and carried it into Towers' stable, where it was packed in a hamper, and taken off to London—he said that another party, named Cole, was with him; that Towers asked him and Cole to go.</p>

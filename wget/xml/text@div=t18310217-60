            . I am a linen-draper, and live at No. 103, Bishopsgate-street-without. On the 29th of January the prisoner called at my house, and offered me six China crape and imitation handkerchiefs, six Thibet shawls, and two silk shawls - I purchased four China crape handkerchiefs, all the shawls, but not the two imitation crape handkerchiefs; I first purchased the china crape handkerchiefs, for which he asked 3s. 6d. each, observing that he had never sold any of that description under 4s. before -I offered 3s. for them, which he took; he offered me the eight shawls for 4l. 16s. - I offered 4l. 10s., and he agreed to take 4l. 13s., which I gave him; after offering him 4l. 10s. for them, I said one description of the shawls were to be bought at Bradley and Greatorex's, the prosecutors, for 14s. - I named that to ascertain the price, as they were of various values; they were the lowest in value - when I made that observation, he put the shawls into a brown paper parcel, which he had taken them from, put them into a blue bag, and put them under his arm; I said I would take them, and called to my cash-keeper to hand over 4l. 13s. to him for them - he did so, and they were given up to me; I had observed a mark on one of the handkerchiefs, but said nothing to him about that - I went to the prosecutor's within half an hour of the transaction, and he saw the goods at my house that day (Saturday); on the Monday, I accompanied the prosecutor to the prisoner's house, in <placeName id="t18310217-60-crimeloc376">Fore-street, Cripplegate</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know him before that Saturday? A. Yes - I think since August or September last; he is a housekeeper, and was represented to me as a respectable man, by the person who introduced him - I am a haberdasher, and live about three quarters of a mile from him; I had made two purchases of haberdashery of him - he has several times offered me goods; I have been thirteen years in business - it is very common for manufacturers to go about to sell goods.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man had bought goods, and had to meet an acceptance, he would sell them for what he could get? A. Yes, and very frequently at a very low price, but from the condition these were in, they appeared to have come fresh from a parcel, not exposed at all - the only thing I suspected was seeing four shawls of one pattern, which few retail dealers would purchase, as they like a variety, and there were two of each of the other pattern; a man might dispose of any thing to raise money - I had purchased each of the patterns of the prosecutor, and two of them certainly within a month; they were in the daily practice of selling such things - I bought them at their warehouse; I knew where the prisoner came from - dur<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170052"></xptr>ing our conversation about the shawls, he said he could do twine for me better than hawkers, and begged me to come and deal with him; job goods are goods under the regular price - it is not uncommon to find such goods; the prosecutor had a shawl and all the crape handkerchiefs in his pocket - one crape handkerchief was all he could swear to; the ticket with his private-mark was left on that - the prisoner could have had the goods in his hand if he chose, and I think he did; there is a glass-door between the parlour and shop, and a curtain to it - it was after Hawkins insisted on searching, that the prisoner took down the bag: the two handkerchiefs I had refused to buy were in it - I believe the other bag was empty; I do not know what was found up stairs.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say the lowest value of the shawls was 14s.? A. The Thibet shawls were 14s. - there were two silk ones, which I value at the lowest at 12s. 6d. each.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You are now describing the warehouse price? A. Yes; people sometimes sell 12 1/2 per cent. lower, and sometimes more - part of them were summer stock.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were any of the Thibet shawls worth more than 12s. 6d.? A. Yes - the eight shawls were worth about 8l.; I paid 4l. 13s. for them - the handkerchiefs 29s., I paid 12s. - the warehouse price is 29s.</p>

On the Saturday Mr. Hall showed me some shawls and handkerchiefs, which are here; I went to the prisoner's house on Monday, showed him the property, and asked where he got it; he said he could not tell, he did not know - I told him it was very strange, (as he dealt in cord and twine,) these goods being so different to his general business, that he could not tell me where he bought them: he said he could not - I said, "Don't you know whether it was of man, woman, or child - have you no idea;" he said he knew nothing about it - he would not tell me; when the officer came in he asked if he had any more such property - he said he did not know, but when the officer was going to search, he produced two handkerchiefs from a blue bag, saying they were all he had of that description; I said, "Let me know where you have purchased these goods, and I shall be satisfied - I keep a large quantity of young men, among whom I must suspect some as thieves, till we find out the individual, and it is of great consequence for me to know who the persons are who have been robbing me:" he said he did not know, he could not tell who he bought them of, and I called in the officer; there is one crape handkerchief has my privatemark on it, and which I can identify - the others I have not the least doubt of, but will not swear to them, because my marks have been taken off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were the patterns very uncommon? A. Some of them - I have them here; I do not mean to say these are the only patterns of this description in the trade - other houses may have them - I do not recollect who I bought the uncommon pattern of; I now recollect it was Buchanan - the clerk who manages that department has just reminded me of it, and I recollect it now perfectly, and can swear it from my own recollection; it is a particular style of shawl, not made by any other individual - here it is; I have no private-mark on it; we have not had many of that description - we have fifteen or sixteen shopmen, who sell, but only four in the shawl department; one of them is here, who manages that whole concern - his name is Martin; the others have liberty to sell, but he superintends - he marks the goods, and sees all that comes in and goes out; in times of difficulty persons go about to sell to dealers - we never buy in that way; there was twine, cord, and mats in the prisoner's shop.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Martin has the control of the shawl department? A. He has: we never send any goods about to be sold - no respectable house would; Buchanan lives at Glasgow.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Do you know whether any of your people ever sold a shawl of that pattern exactly? A. Yes, many,</p>

I am a baker, living at Wandsworth—last autumn I remember a boat race on the river, I believe it was the 22nd of November, but I could not be positive—about half-past twelve that day my attention was attracted to a horse and cart; I first saw it in North Street, Wands<lb></lb>worth—it was a black horse, or a very dark one, and a narrow green cart; there were two persons in it, Sheen was one of them; he was driving; the other had a white slop on, and they had both got Fenian hats; I did not tee Dundas then—about half an hour afterwards I saw the horse and cart again in the Kingston Road with Sheen and Dundas in it, and the man in the white slop was on the left-hand side of the road, looking up at the gentlemen's houses; I went past them up the road to serve a customer—I looked back, and watched them up the road, and I saw Dundas and the one with the smock get up into the cart, ride some distance, then get out again—Dundas went up to several gates, and the other went up the Kingston Road, Sheen remained in the cart—it was going at a walking pace then—he saw me looking at them, and he put up his whip as though</p>

I have known Shirley ten or twelve years—I know him well—I know both the prisoners—I saw them in Shirley's company a few nighfs before I apprehended them, on 11th January (I had seen the three together two or three times before—I could not state when)—they were in High Street, Kensington, in a cart drawn by a dark bay horse—the cart is now in the green yard—it is the one that Bloomfield and Tyler have seen—I had not heard of this rob<lb></lb>bery at that time—I took the prisoners into custody afterwards—I have got here the things I found at Dundas's in a drawer in the room where I took him into custody—here are two pistols loaded with ball and powder, a knife which is used to push back the catches of windows—it has been made by some experienced person; it is not sold like this—I also found two life-preservers, two jemmies, some silent matches, a candle, powder, three picklocks, some ball, and percussion caps.</p>

On the last examination but one I think the Magistrate told Sheen that he should commit him on the one case and remand him on the other; and Sheen said if he would remand him he could bring witnesses, but he did not; ho said he should bring witnesses on the trial—he did not say there was any witness in Ireland—he did not say where—he said he could bring a number of witnesses to prove that he arrived from America on the 22nd.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of William House, who lives in Kent-street, Southwark. I live with my master at his shop, No. 3, opposite, another shop of his—on the night of 4th Aug. I secured the house; I put up the shutters and fastened them with an iron bar as usual—I was the last person up—the window was not broken then—I was called up about 12 o'clock that night by the policeman—the shutters were then down, the win<lb></lb>dow was broken, and the shoes displaced, which had been standing in rotation as I had placed them a few days before, and one or two were moved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The officer called him, and he was asked if the things were secure; he said, "Yes," and the policeman put his hand through the window and found one shoe. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No; I said the number was there, but they were displaced.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 210). I was on duty in Kent-street. My attention was called to a house in Hemming-street—I heard the breaking of glass—I crossed the road, and saw the prisoner with two other persons, who ran off—I saw the prisoner with a shutter in his hand—I asked him what he was doing—he said he was passing by, and the shutter fell on him—the three were all together when I first saw them—I examined the window, and found this shoe with a portion of it outside the window—I called the last witness, and detained the prisoner till he came—the house is in the parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was that shoe outside the window? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Partly so; I was the first officer that took you—I found you with the shutter in your hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was going home about half past 11 o'clock; a man asked me to show him the Bricklayers' Arms; I showed him; I was then coming along, and these shutters were down and the bar too; I took it up, and the constable came and took me; he took the shoe, and I told him to put it back again.</p>

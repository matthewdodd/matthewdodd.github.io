            : On the 27th of last month, a Mr. Green, who is a constable on the quays, came to inform me a chest of tea was found on a soldier, who was carrying it from the wharf; we sent the goods down to the Custom-house quay on Tuesday the 26th of April, this was on the 27th; in the morning I went about eleven or twelve o'clock and saw it in the King's warehouse in the Custom-house; the person is here who gave me an account of it; I knew it to be Mr. Fry's property by a private mark on the chest, put on by our warehousemen; it contained black and green tea; I can positively say the chest was sent from our house; there was likewise another mark I could know it by; it was going to Westley and Co. at Hull; it was marked with chalk 1. 19. signifying the tare of the chest and things in it; it has never been in our possession since.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the value of it be? - A. About twelve pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you give that for it? - A. If we were to take it again, we should credit Westley and company twelve pounds for it.</p>

Not two hundred yards; as he came in at the gate, out of the Tower at the draw-bridge, the end gate were shut, he walked along, and I followed him along the wharf, till I heard something pass between him and the sentry; he asked him what he had got, he said it was nothing to him, it was something to make him eat and drink; he went on to another sentry, he refused to let him out, and he came back again; when he came to the corporal's guard, who was the last witness, he helped it off his back, and put it in the guard-house; I saw it in the guard-house that night, and in the morning I went and acquainted one of the Commissioners with it; it was matted up and boarded, but the direction was torn off; the Commissioner went to the Custom-house, and endeavoured to find out whose property it was; he then ordered it to be carried to the Custom-house till the owner of it was found; I saw it carried to the Custom-house; it was left in the King's lock-up house; it remained there till now that it is brought here; I know it is the same.</p>

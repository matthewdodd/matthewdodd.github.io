                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>, 55 <hi rend="italic">C</hi>). On Monday evening, 31st July last, I was at the house 83, Dean-street, Soho—there was a meeting of persons there—I had been there previously—I know it is a place of resort for Chartists—I was in plain clothes—I was sent there for the purpose of watching what passed—the meeting was held in the first floor front room—I got there about eight o'clock—there were about 150 persons present, I should imagine—they appeared to be mechanics, and the lower order of Irish—I heard a person read something from a newspaper to the meeting.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Refresh your memory by that, and tell me what you can recollect the defendant said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "The late insurrection in Paris had shown how easily a Crown could be crumbled; the time had now come for them to be brave, and the game was their own. He did not care for those persons present who wore other people's clothes"—he said, "I do not care if what I say is criminal, he would speak his own mind; and he stated, for his own part, during next week he should do all in his power to put a stop to trade, and urge the Irishmen in London to rebellion"—the word "I," was of course substituted for "he," he spoke in the first person, and I wrote it in the third—I do not know whether the prisoner was the chairman—I am not aware that they had a chairman, I did not see one—I did not see any other persons on the platform or table at the time he was speaking—there were many persons there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner called upon to make the speech, or did he make it spontaneously? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The announcement was that Mr. Crowe would deliver a speech—I did not hear his name at the time, but great applause followed it, and the prisoner then rose on the table—I did not observe who it was that said he would make a speech.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did vou gain admission? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I walked into the room the same as others had done—being in plain clothes I was not suspected—I walked in without saying anything.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210082"></xptr>
               <p>I might hear said—there were a great many persons present, but still there was room for more—it was inconveiently crowded at that portion where the persons were assembled together, still there was room sufficient for other persons—I cannot tell the exact time the defendant spoke—it might have been half an hour—I would not undertake to swear that he did not speak for nearer three-quarters of an hour—I do not think his speech extended to an hour—my impression is, it was about half an hour—I took this down in pencil and signed it in ink—I am sure it is signed in ink—the signature was put not a great while ago—I have had these notes in my possession without the signature—they have never left my possession since the evening of 31st July—I signed it about an hour ago, because I was requested to sign it by a superior officer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose you took down what you would call the inflamrmtory Parts of the speech that you heard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I took down certain sentences which I paid particular attention to, and which I had an opportunity of listening to—I was some distance from the speaker, and consequently I did not hear the whole of his speech, and I could not retain it in my memory—I only heard parts of the speech—I was examined at Bow-street Police-office—I would not undertake to say that I took down all that I heard, because I heard other portions, but I put down as much as I could retain in my memory—I did not hear the whole of the speech, I probably heard half of it—I have not put half of it down—I have selected certain passages which I considered the strongest, and put them down—in this paper it is written consecutively, one sentence after another—I mean to represent that they were so spoken—they were interspersed with other sentences—this sentence was consecutive, "The late insurrection in Paris has shown how easily a Crown can be crumbled, and the time has now come for you to be brave, and the game is your own"—other matter followed that—the next sentence was, I do not care for those persons present who wear other people's clothes, I do not cart if what I say is criminal"—then another space intervened between that and what I have told you beside—the next is, "I for my own part will do all in my power during the next week, to put a stop to trade, and urge the Irishmen in London to rebellion"—I was examined at the Police-office—my deposition was taken down in writing, I signed it—this signature, "Reuben Brothers." in two places, is mine—the clerk did not ask me whether it was correct before I signed it—I am not aware that he did—it was read over to me—I was asked if it was correct after it was read over, and I answered that it was—it was then handed to me, and I signed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you not say so at first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I took the question to be, whether the person who handed me the paper asked me if it was correct—I do not remember that I was asked whether I had anything to add to it—the defendant said, with a very little exception, the charge was an entire fabrica<lb></lb>tion—he asked me whether I had taken notes at the time—I answered that he had not an opportunity without being observed—(<hi rend="italic">the Witness's deposition being read, was as follows</hi>)—"On Monday evening, 31st July last, I attended a meeting held at the house 83, Dean-street, Soho—I had attended meetings there before, and know it is used for meetings of the Chartists—I was in plain clothes on the occasion in question—the meeting was held in a large room capable of holding 200 persons, on the first floor—there were from 100 to 150 who appeared to be principally mechanic, some women, and children—I heard a young man read some extracts from a newspaper—one of the expressions used as an extract from the paper was, 'To hell with the Queen'</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210083"></xptr>
               <p>—that expression met with general applause—I heard the defendant speak. about five or ten minutes after that extract had been so read—I paid strict attention to certain portions of his speech, with a view to carry them in my memory—he stated as follows, 'The late insurrection in Paris has shown how easy a Crown can be crumbled; now is the time to be ready, now is the time to be resolute, and the game your own—I do not care for those persons present who wear other people's clothes—I do not care if what I say is criminal—I for my own part shall do all in my power during the next week to put a stop to trade, and urge the Irishmen in London to rebellion '—there was general applause at the conclusion of the last sentence—I was about six yards from the prisoner. Cross-examined by the prisoner—I did not make any notes at the time in writing."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As regards that expression, "To hell with the Queen," did not the defendant say before the Magistrate that he did not hear that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did—I did not hear him say he believed there must be a mistake—I swear he did not say to me, "Have you any writing against me, or any document against me?"—I swear positively no such question was ever asked me—I got to the meeting about eight o'clock—I left between nine and ten—I cannot say the exact time, I did not pay any attention—I will not swear it was not between ten and eleven when I left—I believe it was between nine and ten—I swear it was not after eleven—these notes were written between twelve and one, at Hyde-park-corner, at the Police-section-house, under the arch of the Wellington statue—it is not an ordinary station-house—it was written in a room under the arch—they have never been out of my sight since—I had them at Bow-street, but I did not make use of them—I stated at the Police-office that I paid strict attention to certain portions of his speech, with a view to cary them in my memory—I did not tell the Magistrate I had the notes, because I thought it I could give a verbal statement correctly, without refer-ring to the notes, it would be sufficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the defendant asked you whether you took any notes at the time why did not you say to him, "No, but three hours after the meeting I took down what you said, and here it is;" and why did you not produce the paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I merely answered the defendant the question he put to me—I did not think it necessary to say that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On our oath, have you not written this paper since, and copied it from your depositions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not—I swear that, nor did I copy it from a copy of my depositions—I have been in the police force about six weeks from the present time—I am engaged as a regular officer—I believe I attended about five meetings previous to 31st July—meetings generally take place every night except Saturday, including the Sunday—the first meeting I attended I think was about the 25th or 26th July—I had been in the police about a week when I began to attend these meetings—I had never been at these meetings before I was made a police-officer—I was a druggist before that—I did not keep a shop—I was an assistant—I was in the shop serving medicines, and making up prescriptions occasionally—my salary was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and I was boarded as well—I get 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week as a policeman—I was last employed with Mr. Tracy, of 54, New Church-street, Paddington—I left him about twelve months ago—I resigned—I have been living at Notting-hill since I left Mr. Tracy—I was expecting to obtain a situation on a rail<lb></lb>way but I have been disappointed—I left Mr. Tracy because I wished to better myself—I expected to obtain the situation every week—I was living with my father at Notting-hill—he was supporting me—he is a yeoman of the guard—I do not know what his income is—I resided with my family</p>

               <p>during the whole of that twelve months—I have a mother, sisters, and a brother—I was in the country a fortnight, at my brother-in-law's, with whom I had previously lived as an assistant—I was only a fortnight away from my father's during the whole twelve months, not to sleep out, not for a week or fortnight together—I went into the country soon after I left Mr. Tracy—I did earn money, through my father, as an undertaker—my father is an undertaker—I had no other employment—I am twenty-three years of age—I was with Mr. Tracy about six months—before I was with him I was with Mr. Wray, a druggist—I left him two or three weeks before I was with Mr. Tracy—I re<lb></lb>mained with Mr. Wray about six weeks, and left because he was insolvent, and I could not obtain my money—previous to that I was engaged rather better than twelve months with Mr. Griffiths, a surgeon, of the Bethnal-green-road—I was originally about to be apprenticed to a jeweller, but I never served my appren<lb></lb>ticeship—I have followed no other occupation—I made application for as appointment in the police—the Commissioners did not seek me out—I applied a fortnight previous to my entering the force—I have not attended Chartist meetings before I was a policeman—those at Dean-street were the first that I attended either as a policeman or in any other way.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">WELSBY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> To whom did you make your application for an appoint<lb></lb>ment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To Mr. Williamson, superintendent of the T division at Hammer<lb></lb>smith—inquiry was made about me, and testimonials obtained—I was about sixteen years old when I was first employed as a druggist's assistant—I was then employed by my brother-in-law—I made the note of what I heard at the request of Mr. Beresford, the superintendent of the C division—I did not make the note in his presence, but I was supplied with paper by him; and he told me not to leave it till the morning, but to make it that night, before I went to bed—I did so—I produced it next morning, not to Mr. Beresford in the first instance, but I believe it was afterwards shown to him—that was before I was examined at Bow-street—I was originally directed to go to these meetings by Sergeant Coombs, of the C division.</p>

In this condition, my brothers, as a portion of the people, it is befitting us to resolve what course to pursue, whether to return in seclusion within the precincts of selfishness and despair, and with open your mouth and shut your eyes, policy, wait and see what these Lords of the soil will send you; or whether, obeying the instinctive spirit of freedom which in youth swells our souls with passions and our hearts with firmness and resolution, we disregard the timid injunctions of Conservatism, and dare to climb the hill of life, regardless of the dangers attending, that we may one day realize the promise of a beautiful prospect from the top, the prospect of a nation lifted from the slough of moral, social, and political despond, in which we find her, to a state of contentment and happiness. To aid in the accomplishment of this task we offer to devote ourselves, and now let us consider in the first place its true extent and nature, and in the second place the means of accomplishment within our reach, &amp; c.

Ireland is in arms, oh! at last, amid doubtings and eclipses, the Sun of Ireland peeps through the murky clouds—the heat is diffusing alike its brilliant light and its genial warmth to bless her rugged surface! Oh, yes, Ireland, in spite of all the machinations which tyranny could invent, ruthless and blood-gorged tyranny could do, Heaven's pure light stalks; pierced thy dungeons, and those felons' chains, that with Lilliputian ingenuity strove to enthrall the slumbering giant of Irish discontent, falls to the earth! When God's greatest blessing, liberty, had breathed upon them, yes, our pledged faith partook of the invocation, which falling from a Grattan's tongue, dashed the blood-stained sceptre from the quivering grasp of British despotism: yes, the invocation when Britons trembled as the voice of united millions taught to know their strength, proclaimed it; yes, the invocation which when Freedom's draught was quaffed but inflamed the canker of past misrule and scenes of blood, and we followed to behold her once more in arms against her gaoler—yes, the invocation which, when a victor of Waterloo and a bantling of Tamworth dared to crush a nation's voice, hurled its thunder<lb></lb>shaft of defiance from Mallow, making the puny intruders shrink again; yes, the invocation which, when a storm of desires had wrecked our bark of pride, our cherished-one, the lowly of Glasneven, gave life and action to slumber<lb></lb>ing thought, baptizing the young Phalanx in the name of liberty; yes, the invocation, which, when a partizan judge, a packed jury, and a juggling sheriff transported our dearest one to a foreign island, did instantly throw off the foibles which made our country infantile, and assumed, and at this moment does assume, a manly and different attitude. Too long, oh God! has out country bent in abject slavishness, supplicating for leave to live at the hands of those whose interests it is to make us starve. How long, oh God! shall thy throne be insulted by the piteous prayers of the crouching slave, sustained by the niggard crumbs of British charity: how long oh God! before this cringing herd becomes a dauntless band, lifting before thee their prostrate forms, erect and manly, and ring through the confused brain of Britain, the thrilling shout for justice, which though long delayed she must accord. Oh! the hour of retributive hope mounts sentinel in our hearts, and already in perspective we see----"—(<hi rend="italic">The paper here terminated abruptly.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the C division of police On Monday, 31st July, I was at the Vine-street Station, Piccadilly—between eleven and twelve o'clock, as nearly as I can judge, Brothers came there and made a statement to me of what a man had said—I gave him paper, and told him to go home immediately to the Arch section-house, where he lived, and make notes as soon as possible in writing—I afterwards saw this paper—</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is peculiar paper which we have for our purposes—this is the description of paper which I gave him—I saw this the next morning—I think it was at the Commissioner's—I think Brothers was sent for there—I will not swear whether he produced it at the station, but I saw it most decidedly—he was sent for to the Commissioner's that morning, and I am not sure whether I saw the paper before he got there, or at the station—I am certain I saw it at the Commissioner's—my impression is that he brought it to the station next morning, and produced it to me, because I had a report to make on the subject—I made my report next morning to the Commissioners—Brothers was sent for in consequence of that report—I will not swear whether that was the same morning or not—he was sent for in consequence of the report—I believe I saw this report the same morning, to make my report to the Commissioners upon—I would not undertake to say the exact evening upon which I gave him instructions to write down what he had heard, because he was sent several evenings, but it was on the evening that he made the report respecting the prisoner most decidedly, and I believe it was Monday evening—I will undertake to say that it was before the Saturday in that week that I saw it—I swear three days did not elapse before I saw it—I am quite certain he was sent for to the Commissioners—my only difficulty is whether it was the same morning or not.</p>

You seem not to have a very clear recollection of it; was it on the evening he returned and made a report to you that you gave him this piece of paper, or a piece like it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave him more than one sheet, I believe—I think I gave him two sheets—he made his report to me after the meeting—he went to some meetings prior to 31st July, but nothing important occurred—he made reports to me of those meetings—I did not give him paper then—there was nothing that I considered important—I think he had made three or four reports before this, I am not certain—I am not aware whether there is pen, ink, and paper at the section—it is a place where they lodge, at one side of the triumphal arch—he may have pen, ink, and paper there; we do not find it—I have just arrived here, I was fetched from Vine-street station by a policeman of the A division—he is out<lb></lb>side—I have not been examined before by the clerk to the Treasury, or by any one—I came here with the policeman in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he tell you anything about this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He only said that he thought I was wanted as to sending Brothers to the meeting, but as to any detail of anything not one word occurred—he did not say anything about a paper that had been produced on the trial.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic"> Q.</hi> Why did you not desire him to write it at Vine-street, that you might see what he wrote at the time, instead of letting him go home to the other place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might have written it at Vine-street—there are plenty of tables at the section—I dare say the men have writing conveniences there among themselves, but none are supplied by me—he was anxious probably to get home—I know of no other reason why he did not make it at Vine-street—I merely gave him the paper, and told him to make memoran<lb></lb>dums of the remarks he had heard at the meeting—there is no rule in the force to prevent his writing there—he might have written there if he had Pleased, or if I had desired him—there is great confusion there generally</p>

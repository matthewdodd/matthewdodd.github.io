                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I received instructions from the Prosecu<lb></lb>tors to watch their premises, and commenced to watch on the 22nd or 23rd of February, and continued on duty till the 5th of March—on 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th of March I traced the prisoner from the prosecutor's premises, in Cannon Street, by railway, to Roberts' shop, at 13, Bear Street, Leicester Square, on each occasion he went right through the shop into the back parlour—he left the warehouse at six, and got to the shop at twenty minutes past—it is a trimming shop—on the 5th March I followed him in—Roberts was there—I told him I was an officer, and had reason to suppose he had stolen property in his possession—he said, "I have nothing about me"—I said, "I must search you"—I found a pound packet of thread, and asked him where he got it from—he said he bought it at Edmund's, Gutter Lane—(the police constable, Frederick Brett was with me)—I unbuttoned his waistcoat and found underneath his braces some cloth—thinking I might have to go further in my search, I requested Mrs. Roberts to go into the front shop, leaving him in the custody of Frederick Brett in the parlour—I went into the shop and said to Mrs. Roberts, "I am a police officer, this man has been robbing his employers, and bringing the property to you; and it will depend on the property you produce to me, and as to the satisfaction you give for your possession of it, whether I lock you up as a receiver, or treat you as a witness"—she said, "I bought nothing of him; I know him as a dealer"—I then said, "Well, once for all, I shall give you another opportunity, and if I search and find property belonging to his employer, I shall then treat you as a receiver"—she then produced two pieces of cloth, and said, "I bought these of him"—I asked what else—she said, "I do not recollect anything else"—I said, "You have bought silk, twist, velvet, and thread of him "—I then commenced to search the shop, and found seven pieces of cloth, from two to three yards in length, five pieces of velvet, one piece of velveteen, four reels of twist, three pound packets of thread, four pounds of sewing silk, all of which she admitted she had bought of Tyler—I also asked her the prices she gave, and the time she bought them—the two yards of velvet she said she bought on Monday, and gave 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them; two and five-eighths yards of cloth on 3rd March, for 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the sewing silk was at the rate of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a reel for twist—I then asked if she had any invoices showing that she had bought goods, and she produced her file—I was then about to remove the property, when Tyler was brought in, who said, "What is all this?"—Robers</p>

               <p>said, "This is what I bought of you, Tyler"—he made no reply—I then directed Mrs. Roberts to attend at the Mansion House on the following day, 6th March, at twelve o'clock, and Tyler was taken into custody—on the following day he was brought up at the Mansion House—she appeared in Court, and was ordered into custody before the case had gone far on—she was remanded, and I arranged to meet her at her shop, to make further search—I went accordingly with Mr. Hart, a witness in the employ of Mr. Bousneld—Mr. Hart then identified thirty-three balls of buttons and ten reels of twist, which were taken from the shop—Mrs. Roberts said she had bought these of a man two years ago, who had gone to America—I asked her if she had invoices for these goods—she produced one of Mr. Edmunds' invoices only.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">James Tyler (the Prisoner)</hi>. I was a warehouseman, in the service of Messrs.

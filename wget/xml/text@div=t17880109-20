               <p>Was he purchasing for himself or another? - He said they were for himself, that he was going out in the civil establishment in the East India Company's service to Bengal.</p>
               <p>Did you see some cash in his hand? - I saw some cash, it was gold, but what I cannot say; he then said, here is a good bill, will you chuse to take it; I looked at the bill, took it and read it, and made several trifling excuses, and avoided parting either with the bill or the goods; at last I put the bill in my pocket, and knocked the goods back with my elbow, which were ready packed up; and I told the prisoner, as he was a stranger to me, before I parted with the bill or goods, I must make a proper enquiry about the bill; he said he was going to dine at the Bull Inn, in Bishopsgate-street; he said he lived No. 3, Dover-place, Newington Butts, and would call again in about an hour; I told him I would send to Dover-place the goods and the difference, after I had enquired about the bill; I told him I should do that first; he said that was needless, as he would call again for the goods and the difference; as soon as he went away, which was in a hackney-coach, I went directly to Mr. Pybus; I did not offer it for payment, but I asked them whether it was a good one; they replied it was not.</p>
               <p>To what Pybus did you go? - To Mess. Pybus and Co. in New Bond-street, where the bill is addressed; Mr. Pybus junior informed me it was a forgery; I came back as soon as possible, and found he never had called; he did not call again; a week elapsed before I gave myself any trouble to enquire about him, and I never saw him after, till I saw him in custody before the Lord Mayor; after he was in custody I went to enquire for No. 3, Dover-place, to ask if a person of the name of Watkins resided there; there is no number to the house in Dover-place; I took the third house from the beginning, as you go to the Elephant and Castle, and there was no such person; I went to the third house from the other end, which is a lady's boarding school, kept by a person I have known some time, and no such person resided there; I know nothing of the bill further than I was told at Mr. Pybus's; the bill is in the same state I received it, except my name at the bottom, and a bit of paper pasted at the back.</p>

               <p>Court. Mr. Ludlam, what have you to say to this? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, it might happen to an honest man to have a bad bill; but if he conducts himself as an honest man, if he utters the bill, and gives a true account of himself, it may be a reason, though a bill is forged, not to charge the person who utters it with knowing it to be forged; the question here is, whether he knew it to be a forged bill; and most unhappily the circumstances are very strong against the prisoner; he represented himself to be a man of the name of Watkins, his name being Ludlam; representing himself to be a person, going on the civil establishment to Bengal, and using that pretence to get this bill negotiated, and never returning; instead of which there is no such person living in Dover-place, he never comes back again at all, but abandons both bill and goods; these are circumstances that do manifest a consciousness that that bill was not negotiated in a fair and regular course; therefore what can we infer, but that the prisoner must have known what sort of a bill? this poor unhappy man has no answer to give to it at all, and I am afraid it is a case too clear to admit of any answer.</p>

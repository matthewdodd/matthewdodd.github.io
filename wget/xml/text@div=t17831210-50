               <p>Going along Tower-hill, I met with a gentleman at a public-house there, he came from the Island of Germany, he asked me to drink, he said he would buy a pair of pistols; and he said, as I was in the army I might be a judge. We went into this woman's shop, there was no body else in the shop, she asked two guineas; I told her to go along with me, and she went between thirty and forty yards; says she, young man I can go no further, then I came back with her and laid the pistols on the counter; and there was another young fellow in the shop dressed in sailors clothes, she searched me, and found nothing.</p>

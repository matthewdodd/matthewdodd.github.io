We went thither, and he and I fought for six or seven Minutes, and then I gave out. Then he said, I will fight any one that takes your Part. - Will you? (said the Deceased,) Then I am your Man: Whereupon the Prisoner struck him in the Face, and so they stript and fell to it ding dong. They took two or three Knocks together: The Deceased was thrown twice, and appeared not at all to be hurt; but as soon as he got up again, the Prisoner kick'd up his Heels, and threw him in the Grass, and there he lay stretch'd out like a dead Man. He complain'd of his Back and Neck. We were for fetching a Coach to carry him Home; but the Prisoner made his Game, and said, What are you dead already? - Ill carry you Home upon my Back; but at last we got a Chair, and he died the next day.</p>

             the Surgeon thus deposed: I saw the Deceased after he was put to Bed: I could perceive no Fracture, no Wound, no Dislocation, nor even any Discolouring, but he had lost the Use of all his Limbs, and had no more Strength than a New-born Child. I suspected indeed that his Skull was fractured; but I found it otherwise by putting something in his Mouth, which he held fast with his Teeth. I can't think what could be the Cause of his Death, except it was a Distortion of the Spinal Marrow, which, I believe, took away the Use of his Limbs.</p>

             thus deposed: The Deceased and the Prisoner were such great Cronies before this Boxing Bout, that if the Deceased had but a Piece of Bread, and his Wife wanted it, he would give it to the Prisoner, and let his Wife go without. - The Court demanded, if the Deceased was known to be any way distemper'd before this Misfortune happened? To which this Evidence thus answer'd, I am not a confident Judge of such Matters; but if he had any disease, I believe some that are left behind are the worse for him.</p>

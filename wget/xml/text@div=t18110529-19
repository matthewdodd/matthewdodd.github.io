               <p>Q. Was he employed in the dividend office under any department, and under what letter - A. He was called in to assist in our office, that is, the Imperial office, in July, 1810, about the 9th or 10th, the first day of the payment of dividends.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he remain there until the month of August - A. Until this was discovered he did; he did remain till August.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the letter under which he paid - A. No particular letter; he had the whole of the books of the Imperial Annuity, there being but a small number of dividend warrants in that stock to be paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the charge over the books for the purpose of paying - A. He had access to the books, and to the dividend warrants.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoners duty to pay dividend warrants - A. It was, and in the letter F among all the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the care of the drawer containing the warrants - A. Not particularly; he had access to the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the dividend book - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn to the dividend book, and look at the signature of A. Fraser, from 1806, to May 1810 inclusive - A. Here they all are.</p>
               <p>Q. Now looking at the different enteries of A. Fraser tell me whose hand-writing you believe it to be - A. I believe it to be the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that in all - A. I mean that in all.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said before that you had seen the prisoner write often - A. Yes, often; he came to our office to assist us.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were in the same office with him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Take these dividend warrants in your hand, and looking at the signature. A. Fraser, tell me whose hand-writing you believe it to be - A. I believe them to be the prisoner's.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe it is the practice of the bank to have the books locked up - A. Yes, very often.</p>
               <p>Q. And are the dividend warrants also locked up after the business of the day - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. So they remain locked up and secured till the next day - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You are permanently stationed in the Imperial office - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You are one of the stated clerks of that office - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You are one of the established clerks of that office - A. I am,</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner was, as it were, lent to your office, during the increase of business for a time - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in your office - A. Six or seven weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. During these times how many clerks were there in the office during the whole time - A. Six in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Each of them I take it for granted, had access to the books, and to the drawer for delivering warrants - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. When was your attention first called to these warrants - A. In January last.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said, Mr. Marston, the signature of A. Fraser, is the prisoner's hand-writing; I beg leave to ask you whether you made up that belief from the inspection of the writing, or from something that you have heard from other persons, or both together - A. I have made up my opinion from the whole examination of the warrants, and of the books and bank notes, and an odd letter or two that I have seen; from a comparison of all these things I have made up my mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing, before you had heard of this business, I had come to you and presented to you that; supposing you had not heard anything on the subject, could you have said that A. Fraser is Mr. Thomas's hand-writing - A. I dare say not.</p>
               <p>Q. These warrants were shewn to you in January last - A. I saw some one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon their being suspected that there was a forgery committed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was then, in January, a clerk in the bank - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. And he continued so until April - A. He continued so until he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in last month that he was apprehended - A. Thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he continued a clerk in the bank for four months after this was shewn to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Take this into your hand, attend to what I say to you. I put into your hand the dividend warrant, looking at the signature of this, and refering to nothing but your memory of the prisoner's handwriting, referring to that, and that alone, do you believe it to be his figures, disregarding all the circumstances which combining lead to an opinion, does the characters alone impress a belief that it is Mr. Thomas's hand-writing - A. My belief is that it is his hand-writing, and that belief is founded on these two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290024"></xptr>things - the general character of his hand-writing, and on the resemblance of one letter to other letters; comparing one letter with another I believe it is his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. If I was to cut off the signature A. Fraser, and give you this piece of paper, does your memory of his characters enable you to say it is his hand-writing - A. I can speak to one letter in particular, the letter F in Fraser, and the letter T in Thomas, his own name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the capital F in Fraser, and the capital T in Thomas bears such a resemblance that you believe it is his - A. I do.</p>

               <p>Q. I take it for granted that the most thing that you saw him write was his own signature - A. I have seen him write his own name more than any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. His duty principally in your office was to witness the proprietor's stock in the dividend warrants with his own name - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the characters, C. Thomas, were the characters that you were most used to - A.Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore looking at C. Thomas, it strikes you so that you believe it to be his writing - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look in the dividend book, and look in August 1810, now considering nothing but that which is under you eye; A. Fraser, whose writing do you believe that to be - A. I believe it to be the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe so from your former acquaintance with his characters of writing - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And from the impression that the character's have made upon your mind - A. Exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have the same impression upon all the others that you have looked at - A. Exactly.</p>

               <p>Q. Looking at that, and it being your course of writing the name of the person of whom you received it, can you say from whom you received it - A. I can say that I received it of some person belonging to Mr. Rogers's family; I put such memorandums on the notes for my own security; I can say no further than that I received that note of some person in Mr. Rogers's family.</p>

             to change is one of those that Mr. Tatam paid in satisfaction of the forged receipt, the number of that bank is 5475, that is one of the eight ten pounds, dated 23d of July, 1810; I now produce twenty bank notes of five pound each, dated 25th of July, 1810, which will be found to be part of that sum that Mr. Tatam issued in part of that payment; upon which there is writing to as to prove that they passed through the prisoner's hands, 6994, I will give you this number first, a five pound note, dated 25th of July, 1810.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Rogers. Look at that, is there any writing were you believe to be the writing of the prisoner's - A. Yes, there is the name of Mrs. Edwards.</p>
               <p>Q. The next 6995, look and see whether there is any writing of the prisoner's upon that - A. There is an initial, I; I believe that to be the prisoner's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. No 6995 - A. That is the same, and 6994, that is the same; another letter I; they have all the same I in the same place in the note, in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290026"></xptr>face of the note towards the right-hand corner, at the top.</p>
               <p>COURT. If some of these will not do nothing will turn upon the number.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They are twenty of the twenty-four, between 6977 and 7000.

I am positive to one of them; the word Bishopsgate, is the prisoner's hand-writing, and I believe the others very much resembles the prisoner's writing; I believe they are the prisoner's writing, they are the three that were issued to Mr. Rogers.</p>

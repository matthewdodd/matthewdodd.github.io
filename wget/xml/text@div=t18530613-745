                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Coulson, a labourer, we live at Deptfbrd. On Wednesday evening last, about half past 11 o'clock at night, I had a piece of stuff safe in a drawer in the sitting room down stairs—it belonged to Mrs. Paget, my mother-in-law—her husband's name it Thomas Paget; he is my father-in-law—I did not see the stuff afterwards—I missed it soon after 6 o'clock the next morning, and I missed a cotton dress which has not been found—it was not finished—they both belonged to my mother-in-law—I was working at them for her—I saw the cotton dress safe at 6 o'clock in the morning on the Thursday, the 9th, and I missed them about ten minutes afterwards—I had in the mean time gone up stairs again—I have seen the stuff since—this is it—it is cut crooked at one end—here is a notch in it by which I know it—the cotton dress has not been found again—I know the prisoner Bowles, she lived with me nearly two years, and was very just and honest while she lived with me—she had been in the habit of visiting me—it is about five or six weeks since she was at my house; 1 do not know the other prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 364). I met the two prisoners last Thursday morning, about half past 7 o'clock, in Greenwich-road—I observed Bowles had a bulk, I had known her before—I asked what she had got—she said she had got a piece of cloth—I asked her to let me look at it—she pulled this cloth out of her bosom—I said, "Where have you got this from?"—she said she had been to fetch it from a dressmaker's—the had bought it of a tally man and taken it to a dressmaker's to be made, and she had been to fetch it away to pawn to get something to drink—I asked her where the tally man's shop was; she could not tell me—Shepherd then said, "What is the good of telling that lie, you know I bought it at Mr. Townsend's a week ago?"—Bowles said nothing to that—I took the dress—this is it—both the prisoners were a little in liquor.</p>

After he passed that there was a truck, drawn by two men, about four yards before him; the fore wheel caught hold of the truck, and threw the man down who was next the waggon, and the hind wheel went over him; I think the prisoner must have seen the cart and truck; the man called out very loud, and the waggon stopped when the wheel was on the man's legs; it was backed, and the man got out from under the wheel - he was taken to the hospital - I believe he was a pauper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he appear an infirm man? A. He was fifty-nine years old I believe - the other man was not hurt. The waggon went at a fair pace, and stopped instantly it occurred; it drew in to pass the flour waggon, but there was not room; it would make a noise going along - the road is paved.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where was the <rs id="t18260914-26-viclabel144" type="occupation">waggoner</rs>

On his right side, about the second horse; the flour waggon was rather further from my house; he had not passed it when the accident happened; his horses were drawn in, and going by the waggon, before his waggon had passed my house. The street is five yards and three quarters wide; his horses were between me and him; the donkey-cart and truck were next to me.</p>

               <p>MR. SPARKS. I live at Chelsea. On Tuesday between two and three o'clock, I was in the fair, I followed the prisoner and another man behind Mr. Crofton, suspecting what they were at, I kept close to them, finding they had a difficult job, they changed sides, so that each of them had an attempt to get it out, the prisoner was on the left side of the gentleman, and the other man on the right hand, with their arms closed in together, they instantly separated from each other, and I saw the pocket-book in the prisoner's hand, I told the prosecutor that he had lost his pocket-book, he immediately collared the prisoner, the other man got off. I did not see him drop it, I saw it on the ground, Mr. Crofton picked it up.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going through the fair in the mob, they came and took hold of me, they took me to a public house, and found 1 s. 6 d. on me, my own.</p>

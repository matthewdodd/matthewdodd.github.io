               <p>the evening of 7th March, with the deceased, Robert Foster, and others—about 7.45 Foster left the house—he was not sober, or drunk; he was three-parts—he had half-a-pint of beer at the bar, and bade me good night—the prisoner was then standing outside the door—Foster had called him a few names; he had not called Foster names—as Foster went out, he shoved Lee in the chest; it was not by accident—he pushed him on one side, and went on—I afterwards saw him lying on the ground—I went and picked him up—he was insensible, and blood was oozing from a wound in the right temple—the prisoner assisted to pick him up—he might have struck his head against a stone step in falling—I afterwards saw him, dead, at Guy's Hospital—before I went to pick him up, Elizabeth Rocket came in, and said to me or the prisoner, "If you had pushed the man a-top of me, I would have had you locked up"—he made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine cooper, in Bar ham Street—on Saturday, 7th March, between 7.30 and 8, I was at my door, and heard someone say, inside the Waterman's Arms, "I want to have nothing to do with you"—I could not tell who said it—within two minutes of hearing that, I saw the deceased lying on the pavement, and the prisoner going into the Waterman's Arms—he came out again within a second, and I said to him, "You have done a nice thing"—he said nothing—I said, "I shall not let you go till I see you safe."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Rocket, of 7, Bar ham Street—he is an officer on the railway—on Saturday, 7th March, between 7.30 and 8, I saw the prisoner coming out of the Waterman's Arms—he appeared to attempt to pull off his coat—at that time, I saw Foster come out quickly and pass him—I did not notice him do anything as he passed—he came towards me, followed by the prisoner, who ran behind him and gave him a blow on his shoulders or head, and Foster fell on his face—the prisoner then returned into the public-house—I followed him, and made some remark to the landlord—the prisoner was there—I believe he is the man that gave the blow.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you not say, at the inquest, that you could not swear to me exactly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say now, positively; I believe you to be the man—when I went into the public house, I said a man had been shoved down outside, and if I had not stepped back very quickly he must have been shoved upon me—I was so dreadfully frightened that I hardly know what I said—I did not see the deceased fall against anything—I had a dog walking by my side, not in my arms.</p>

I then left the house, and he followed me out, and pushed me, at the door, in my breast. He was in the act of walking away, and I</p>

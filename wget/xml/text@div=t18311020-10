On the 20th of September, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner - he had a woman with him; he asked for coffee: I gave him a cup - he gave me a sixpence, and I gave him 5d. change; in about ten minutes they both returned - they had another cup; the prisoner gave me a shilling: I gave him a sixpence and 5d.; I put the shilling into my waistcoat pocket - I had no other money there; they returned a third time in about eight minutes - the prisoner asked for more coffee; I gave him a cup, and he gave me a shilling; I had it in my hand; my suspicions were awakened, and I told him it was a bad one; he said it was a new one, and a good one, and he could find me twenty-five more if I wanted them - I said it was bad; he said he would take it back; I gave it to him, and he put it into his pocket, keeping the good change which I had given him for it - he did not give me any other shilling: he then went away with the woman - I had looked at the shilling I had in my waistcoat pocket before he left me, and told him that was also bad; I described his person to Clarkson, the Policeman, about ten minutes afterwards, and saw him in custody in about twenty minutes - I saw Clarkson search him at my stall; he resisted violently - a shilling was found on him; I went to the station-house, marked the shilling he first gave me, and gave it to Clarkson; I received no payment for the last cup of coffee.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did the woman give you the shilling, or did I? A. He gave it me; nobody else was standing by the first time - I gave the shilling to a woman the third time, and told her to go over the way, and ask if it was bad.</p>

               <p>JOHN CLARKSON. I am a Policeman. In consequence of information from Ewart I apprehended the prisoner in Golden-lane, about four o'clock in the morning; I took him to Goswell-street, to Ewart - I searched one of his hands, which he clasped very tight - I suspected he had something in it; he resisted very much: I at last got it open, with great force, and there was a shilling in it, which I produce; I took him to the station-house, searched him again there, and found one shilling, one sixpence, and 7d. in copper, all good money, on him - I took the woman, and found 9d. on her; I received a counterfeit shilling from Ewart, which I have had ever since - he marked it before he gave it to me.</p>

            , brought another Letter to the same Purpose, dated July 11. 1732, and sign'd T. M. The Boy was stopt. He said, he had it from a Man in his own Hair, a brown Frock or Coat, with a speckled Handkerchief about his Neck, who met him in Queen-street, and promis'd to give him a Penny to carry it to my House. By this Description we found the Prisoner in less than half an Hour, at a Brandy-shop hard by. We took up 3 or 4 0other suspicious Fellows, but the Boy immediately fix'd upon the Prisoner.</p>

            . On the 13th of July, about 2 in the Afternoon, as I was going along on one Side of Queen-street, the Prisoner was walking on the other. He cross'd the Way towards me, and said, C me hither my Lad; Carry this Letter over the Way, and I'll give you a Penny. I bid him give me the Money first. No, says he, I'll wait here for you, and you shall have it as soon as ever you come back. So I carried it; and as soon as I came from the Door I look'd for him, but he was gone from the Place where I left him. Mr. Fairchild call'd me back, and ask'd me from whom I had the Letter ? I describ'd the Prisoner to him, and they found him in less than half an Hour, and brought him to me at Mr. Fairchild's House, and I knew him again as soon as ever I saw him. This is the same Letter that he gave to me.</p>

            , Constable. Mr. Fairchild told me, that he had receiv'd another threat ening Letter, and had stopt the Boy that brought it. The Boy described the Prisoner to wear his own Hair, a brown Coat, and a speckled Handkerchief. We found the Prisoner sitting between 2 Women at the Brandy-show; he had a white Wig on then. I took up 3 or 4 other loose Fellows, and carried 'em to the Boy; he said, none of those was the Man; but as soon as I shew'd him the Prisoner, he cry'd, This is he, this is the right. Are not you a cheating Rogue? You promised me a Penny for carrying the Letter, but you run away, and never paid me: You had your own dark Hair on then, tho' now you have got a Wig. I took off the Prisoner's Wig, and found that he had a shock dark Head of Hair. After the Prisoner was committed to Newgate, the Brandyman, whose House he had frequented, sent me Word, that the Prisoner wanted to speak with me. I went to him in the Prison, and he said, I own I gave the Boy the Letter, but I had it from one

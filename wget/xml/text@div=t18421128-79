               <p>Monday, the 7th of November, I went on board the brig <hi rend="italic">Newberry,</hi> which was lying alongside the <hi rend="italic">Dummy</hi> at Nicholson's wharf—there were nine chests of tea in the cabin—I unlocked the hatchway, and went through it into the cabin—I came out of the cabin door by unfastening the inner fastening—I then got on the top, fastened the hatchway door, then returned to the cabin, and made myself fast below—in about a quarter of an hour I heard some<lb></lb>thing, on opening the door I saw Riley there—it was then about half-past eight o'clock in the evening—I made a communication to the foreman.</p>

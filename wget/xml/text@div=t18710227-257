The prisoner is my father—I now live at 133, Drury Lane—I formerly lived with my father and mother, at 8, Polygon, Clapham—on the 6th November, I was sleeping with my mother and sister, in the same bed—my father came home between 12 and 1 o'clock—he had had a little drop, but he was not so tipsy—he had been in the room before, and asked my mother for some halfpence, and she gave some to him—he afterwards asked her for a penny, and she gave him a penny—she then got into bed, and he went out—my mother went to sleep—the prisoner came back in five or ten minutes—there was a candle alight in the room—I saw him fetch the hammer and strike the blow, but I did not see the hammer strike the head—I saw blood on my mother afterwards—my father threw the hammer down after he struck the blow; I picked it up, and hid it under</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live at 8, The Polygon, Clapham—on this evening in November, I went to bed about 12.30—the prisoner was in the room when I went to bed—he was not undressed—during the evening he had asked me for a few halfpence, and just as I was going to bed he asked me to give him a penny, which I did—I then went to bed—I went to sleep, and remember no more till I was awoke in the morning by my children crying—the prisoner was by my side—I was covered with blood, and they had a lot of rags over my head—I asked my children what they were crying for, and they said that father struck me on the head with a hammer—the prisoner was there—I did not know at that time I was hurt at all—he has threatened me before, but he has never hurt me—I was taken to the hospital on the Friday following.</p>

I am assistant house-surgeon at King's College Hospital—the last witness was brought there—she made a statement to me, and I examined her head—there was a wound, and her skull was fractured—she was ill about ten weeks, and was in danger for some length of time—a weapon of this sort (<hi rend="italic">the hammer produced</hi>) would have caused such a fracture as I saw—she is well now, but under excitement she would be injured.</p>

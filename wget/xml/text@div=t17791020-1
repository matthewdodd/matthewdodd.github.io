I told her I could not, I was going home. She attempted to lay hold of me, and took hold of my breeches, and wanted to unbutton them. I prevented<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177910200003"></xptr> her. She then attempted to catch hold of the chain of my watch. I prevented her. I took my watch out of my fob myself, and put it into my right-hand coat-pocket, under my handkerchief, to prevent her from taking it. She clasped me round; and insisted upon my going down the court to drink. I gave her a push, upon which she bid me a good night, and went down the court. I immediately put my hand in my pocket and missed my watch. I ran after her as fast as I could, She ran into a house. I overtook her on the landing-place up one pair of stairs, before she got into the room; we were in the dark. I got her down, and attempted to search her for my watch. The prisoner, King, opened the door; he had a light; he saw me upon her, and knocked me down, and hauled the woman into the room; there were five or six others in the room. I went in with her, shut the door, and set my back against it, and said they should not go out till they gave me my watch. The two prisoners got hold of my neckcloth, one on one end, and the other on the other, and pulled me down, and almost choaked me. She let go the neckcloth, and he pulled it off. King threatened to kill me if I did not go out of the room; he threatened me several times, and so did the women who were in the room: When my neckcloth was clear I got up to the door, and he stripped to fight me. When I had my clothes off they tore my shirt all to pieces; they beat me, and the women bit my arms, and hurt me very much. I offered them a guinea to return me my watch. When I offered them the guinea, one of the women said she knew me, and asked me if I did not live at such a place. I said I did. She then said she knew that King had the watch, and had put it in the coffin, under the dead woman's head; there was a corpse lay in the room. They knocked her down when she told me.</p>
               <p>What did King say to that? - He was knocking me about at the time, and trying to get the door open to get out himself, or push me down stairs.</p>
               <p>Do you know who the woman was that said King had the watch? - She was before the justice, and said there that King had the watch, but she was in liquor, and was not punctual to any thing she said.</p>
               <p>How did you got away? - Some women heard me cry out, and went and called the watchmen. When the woman said the watch was in the coffin, one of the other women struck her, and said what business had she with that, and they ran a candle in her face, and burnt her nose. I went to the coffin, and felt on both sides, but could not find the watch, and I never have found it: upon that two of the women went out. When the watchmen came, the prisoner, Burrington, went down on her knees and desired King to give me the watch back again, and said that he took it from her when I had her down at the door. King said he never saw the watch. The watchman searched King, and searched the coffin, but the watch was not found, it cost me three guineas.</p>
               <p>Was Burrington searched? - No; nor none of the other women. I gave charge of the woman, and she gave charge of the man.</p>
               <p>Burrington. He knows well enough I had not the property.</p>
               <p>Smalley. I believe she had not. I believe she would willingly have given it me, but she could not get it from him again.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. I was fetched to assist the prosecutor. I went up stairs; the door was kept close at first; I could not get it open. I shoved against it, and at last got it open, and went in. I saw in the room five or six women; the prisoner Burrington, who he said had robbed him of his watch, was one of them.</p>
               <p>Who was in the room besides the women? - King and Smalley; he gave me charge of the woman for stealing this, watch; she made answer that King had got it; that he took it from her upon the stairs. Burrington gave me charge of him. I searched him all over, but could not find it. I searched the coffin.</p>
               <p>Did King say any thing? - He said he never had it, nor never saw it. I did not find it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177910200004"></xptr>Did you search the women? - No; I took them to the watch house, and delivered them to the constable of the night. I have known King for five years; I never knew him to be guilty of any such thing.</p>

               <p>I had been at the Magpye, on Holborn-bridge, the prisoner and several others with me; they asked me to go to a wake with them. I said I would with all my heart. I came out and met the prosecutor; he clapped me on the shoulder, and asked me if I would go along with him. I said I had rather not, I was engaged. He insisted upon my going with him, and with great persuasion I did. I asked him for a compliment; he said he had no money. I said I did not choose to oblige him without a compliment; upon that I came out of the court again. He called me back again, and said he had no money, but he would leave me the watch till he got change. After I had obliged him he wanted the watch again. I would not give it him without a compliment; he pulled me down, and charged a watchman with me for stealing his watch.</p>

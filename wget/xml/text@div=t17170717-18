A Midwife likewise deposed, the Child was at its full Time; That examining her as to the Manner of its Birth, she told them that she was delivered in the Chamber, and that she got out of the Bed early in the Morning, spread a Gown and Petticoat on the Floor, lean'd upon a Chest of Drawers, and the Child came from her upon them; That there was a young Woman in the Room in Bed, with whom she lay, who was asleep ( she being a Quaker would not swear, and so could be no Evidence) and that she being very ill, went again to Bed, lay about 3 Hours, and then getting up, was carrying it down Stairs in the Gown and Petticoat, and was met by the Man. The Evidence deposed likewise that the Child was dead, and that there did not appear any Marks upon the Child of its having been hurt any where, except that there was a sort of a blackishCircle about the Child's Mouth (which a Midwife likewise deposed was usual to such Infants, tho'dying by a natural Death.) They likewise deposed that the Child was opened by a Surgeon, and that there did not appear to be any Water in the Body of the Child. In order to the better Information of the Jury in this Case, the Statute was read in Court, which was made to prevent the clandestine Births and concealing the Death of Bastard-Children, which enacted, That the concealing the Birth and Death of Bastard-Children should make the Mothers deem'd the Murtherers of them. The Prisoner, to put her self out of the Reach of this Act, alledged, that she was a married Woman at the time of her Conception, having been married to one

             , who died same time before last Christmas. To prove this she had a Sister in Court, who deposed that she saw her married to the said Edward Wingate at Enfield Church. And others depos'd, they liv'd together for some time at Clerkenwell , and that the said Edward Wingate upon his Death-bed expressed his Concern in leaving her six Weeks gone with Child. Tho'in Contradiction to this, the Deceased's Sister deposed, that she examining the Prisoner since the Commission of this Fact, whether she ever had been married to her Brother, she answered her, she had not. But the other's Evidence prevailing, she was deemed not to be affected by that Statute. The Matter then turning on another Hinge, it being the Prosecutor's Business to prove the Child was born alive and that she murthered it. She said it was Still-born, and that she neither perceived it to stir nor heard it to cry, and produc'd a considerable Quantity of Child-bed Linnen in Court, which was sworn she provided for her Delivery; and her Sister deposed she spoke to her three Months since to be her Nurse; and likewise a Midwife deposed, that two Months since, she spoke to her desiring her to come to her when she sent for her, telling her she look'd the latter End of July or beginning of August. And the chief Stress of the Matter then being whether the Child was murthered by her before putting into the Copper, or alive when she put it in: As to the first , the Evidences generally agreed there were no visible Tokens of any Violence offered to the Infant; and as to the latter, the Judge being of Opinion it was not alive when it was put in, because of what had been before testified, that at its being opened there was no Water found in the Body of it. A Surgeon being call'd to give his Opinion on the Matter, confirm'd his Lordship's Opinion, deposing upon Oath he was of Opinion that no human Body could be drowned without receiving some Quantity of Water into the Body, and consequently the Child could not be alive when put into the Copper. The Matter being thus, that there was no sufficient Proof that she had either murthered the Infant, or that it was born alive, tho' the Action was so unaccountably inhuman, for which she gave but little Satisfaction, the Jury <rs id="t17170717-18-verdict86" type="verdictDescription">

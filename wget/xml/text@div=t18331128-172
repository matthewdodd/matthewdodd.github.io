            . I am a bricklayer; I was employed by the prosecutor on the 30th of October - I was on the premises before six o'clock in the morning; I knew the prisoner, he worked for Mr. Gee on the evening before; I saw him and a man named Sanford, crossing between the saw-pit and the long-pit; with some quartering and weather-boarding in their arms - they had, I should think,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280124"></xptr>sixty feet, and they threw it against the wall; there is some garden ground on the other side of the wall - they threw it over, and then got over themselves; I knew the quartering and the weather-boarding; they had pulled it down the night before, but had no business with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you certain the prisoner was one of the men? A. Yes; I could not make a mistake about him; it was dark; I had two other men with me, we did not speak to them, we went to work; I never had any quarrel with the prisoner.</p>

I am a carpenter; I was with Keatch about six o'clock; I saw the prisoner and Sanford, they had quartering in their arms, and crossed before us to the wall which parts Mr. Gee's premises from where they live; they put down the quartering, and went and got some weather-boarding, and put that down; they then commenced throwing it over; I did not stop to see it all thrown over, I went to work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near were you to them? A. Not more than five or six yards; it was darkish - I never was accused of a highway robbery; a person took me into custody, and said, I had taken money from his boy, but I was immediately discharged as innocent.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was there any foundation for the charge? A. No - I have been ever since in Mr. Gee's employ.</p>

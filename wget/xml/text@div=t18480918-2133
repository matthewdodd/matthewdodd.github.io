                  </hi>. I am groom to Mr. Isaac Jacobson of 315, Oxford-street. I have known the prisoner about three weeks—he has been employed at an exhibition next door to us—he spoke to me about a pistol that was in a glass-case, and said if I got it for him he would give me half-a-crown down, and sixpence a week afterwards—I told the shopman of it, and he acquainted Mr. Jacobson—in consequence of Mr. Jacobson and the shopman's permission, I took the pistol and put it on a box in the yard—I told the prisoner there was the pistol, and he took it—he gave me a shilling, and he was taken in custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, C</hi> 126). I took the prisoner in custody as he was leaving the gate-way, for inciting Cox to commit felony—he pointed to Cos and said he gave him the pistol—I found on the prisoner three pieces of old metal, a life-preserver, and three dressing-case fittings.</p>

She began to abuse me very much with her tongue, and I went to Bow-street, in the time that I was gone to Bow-street, she took the things off herself, except the flannel petticoat, and the woman that see her do it would not come here, and I could not afford to bring her. When she was taken to Bow-street I told them my marks of my under petticoat, and my saying that, she told me to take that, that was mine; they are the things that I found at her lodgings.</p>

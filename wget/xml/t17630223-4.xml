There might be a 100 or 200 weight of them; it was boarded over some little way to prevent accidents, and the fire began on the farther side, and the wainscot, and some cloaths horses, that were laid up there out of the way, were on fire, the ceiling and other parts were on fire.</p>

               <p>Watkins. That I do not know, she had offended my mistress, this was about 12 at night: I went up afterwards to warm my mistress's bed, there I found the prisoner upon the stairs, I went down again with the pan, and came up with

She took the candle and went down, and came up again and said, there was a fire in the parlour; she brought it up lighted. I was in bed, and in about 10 minutes I heard a violent snapping,

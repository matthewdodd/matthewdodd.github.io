                  </hi>. I am a stable-keeper, and live at Greenford, on the Uxbridge-road. About six weeks before I went to the Magistrate I placed a quantity of beans in a barn at Northall to be threshed—I have examined them since—a policeman named Smith produced some beans to me which were mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. I cannot tell the day of the month that I threshed the beans for Mr. Wilson, they were of the quality he has described—on Thursday I finished threshing, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon—my son left along with me—I locked the door—I returned to the barn about eight o'clock on Friday morning—I found the lock damaged—I looked at the beans, they were scattered about, and some gone, it might be about a sack—it was snowy, and there were foot-marks about the door—we traced them up to Down's barn, about a mile from Mr. Beck's—I found a sack there, with two bushels of beans in it—a sack holds four bushels.</p>

               <p>five nails in one heel and six in the other—I have no doubt they were made by these boots.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you certain that all the nails tallied in the holes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They did, they corresponded in a great many footsteps—there were the footsteps of two other persons—I saw the first of these footsteps about five feet from the barn-door, and traced them to within a yard of where the beans were found—the prisoner lives about one hundred and fifty yards from Mr. Curacy's barn, and about half a mile from Mr. Beck's—aperson at Wilson's would not have to pass Beck's bam to get to the prisoner's house.</p>

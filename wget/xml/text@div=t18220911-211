            . I keep a mangle. On the 8th of November, in the morning, the prisoner came and told me to go over to Mrs. Fontaine's for a basket of mangling things in half an hour; she said she was charing there; I said,</p>
               <p>"Very well;" but in less than half an hour she brought them in a basket; it contained the articles stated in the indictment; she asked what time I could do them, saying she wanted them in a hurry. I said I would do them as quick as I could, and in the afternoon she came again, and waited till I had done them, paid me, and took them away. I am sure of her person - I met her in Tottenham Court-road on the 24th of August, and asked her what she had done with the things she took from me - she said she never saw me in her life, and if I would go with her she would show me where she lived;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110097"></xptr>she uttered several oaths and ran away - I followed and had her stopped.</p>

               <p>"No, I never saw you before, and you should not accost people in the street, without being certain of them;" and said, **** she had never seen her in her life. Cox told her not to use bad expressions, and said,</p>
               <p>"If you are guilty confess it, and you will not be hurt." She wanted us to go to her lodgings. Cox proposed her going to Fontaine's, she said she would not, and went away, but was secured.</p>

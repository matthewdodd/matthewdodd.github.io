                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Thomas coleman, a cheese-monger, in Castle-street. The prisoner came on the 11th of December—he bought some butter, and paid for it—he then asked for some bacon—I sent him to my father, who weighed a piece for him, and I saw the prisoner take up another piece, and put it under the sling that his arm is in—I spoke to my father who sent for an officer, and he was taken.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I asked the price of the bacon—it was not out of my hand. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. You concealed it inside the sling—you put it down amongst the other pieces when you heard me tell of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the shop. The prisoner selected a piece of bacon, and my daughter said, "He has got a piece of bacon"—the moment the prisoner heard that, he pulled this piece from under his arm, and threw it down—I saw him draw it from under his arm under his sling, and throw it down.</p>

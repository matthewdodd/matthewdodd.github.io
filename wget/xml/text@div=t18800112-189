                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 4, Chatham Road, Walworth—about five years ago I was office boy to Mr. Hartz, a builder in the Dover Road; the prisoner was in his employ, and I left two or three weeks before him—I met him again 1st December, at the Elephant and Castle, and we</p>

On Saturday evening, 6th December, I was with Reed about 5.15, and saw the prisoner come out of 93, Trafalgar Street—I followed him into the Walworth Road, and saw Howes with him—we both stopped him—I said "We are police officers, and we shall take you on suspicion"—he put both his hands in his trousers pocket, and outside the station door he handed me these two shillings separately, wrapped in brown paper, and five sixpences loose, saying "That is all I have got"—I searched him in the station, and found two shillings in hit trousers pocket separately wrapped up, and a piece of paper with some lamp-black on it and a long knife—I asked how he got the counterfeit coin—he said "Some strange man gave it me at the Elephant and Castle last night"—I went the same evening with Sergeant Reed and Inspector Hunt to 93, Trafalgar Street, and saw Hunt find Some stuff in the grate—I took away a portion of the cocoa-nut matting, which has splashes of white metal on it—I did not see the mould found, but I saw Reed find a piece of a broken mould on the hearth.</p>

I was with Puttick, and saw the prisoner and Howes come out of 93, Trafalgar Street—I have heard Puttich's evidence and agree with it—I was on the other side of the prisoner, who was on the kerb, and he took out a coin and looked at it—I said "What bare you got there?"—he said "Nothing," and put it in his pocket again—I said "Oh, that won't do for me"—that was before he gave the coins to Puttick—I went to the house the same night with Puttick and Hunt, and saw all these articles found, four moulds and a quantity of broken moulds.</p>

I went with Puttick and Reed to 93, Trafalgar Street—the landlady pointed out the back kitchen and a small room upatairs as occupied by the prisoner and his wife and children—I found nothing upstairs, but in the kitchen I found a small packet, what I believe to be plaster-of-Paris, that is used in coining; also some small pieces of white metal, which appeared to be the chippings or overflow of moulds—there were splashes of white metal on the fender, and also on the cocoa-nut matting in front of the fire—this piece of an old mould defaced was lying near the fire—I found a large quantity of broken moulds in the dust-hole—they were scattered throughout the dust-bin—the frac<lb></lb>tures were old—they must have been accumulating several weeks by the quantity of dust—here is one bearing the impression of a shilling, and lour others and half-crowns—I also found four moulds in the yard about a foot below the surface of the ground in a piece of dirty rag and quite warm—here are two for shillings and a doable mould for sixpences—next morning I found a considerable quantity of white metal on the front of the prisoner's trousers and a small portion on his boots—he said "I am working at Blackfriars Bridge; a man gave me this money yesterday, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I showed them to a lad who called for me to-night, and he must have put the police on to me"—after the charge was read over to him he said "The lad and another man brought them to me yesterday; they were both together" but when he became aware that we had found the moulds he said "Yes, I know they were there; they gave them to me last night at the Elephant and Castle and asked me to take care of them, and I put them in the dust-hole."</p>

                  </hi> I am foreman to Thomas Henry Maudsley and others, engineers—Brian was in their employ. In consequence of suspicion I watched him on Thursday, at dinner time, to Taylor's, a marine-store dealer's shop in the Upper Marsh, Lambeth—I saw him take something from his person, which was put into a scale, weighed, and then thrown under the counter by Mrs. Taylor—next day, at twelve o'clock, I watched him there again, and between twelve and half-past five, I got a constable to go with me—he went into the shop, and took possession of something—I immediately followed, and when I got in, Taylor said to the constable, "Do you call that lead?"—he said, "I do"—Taylor said, "It is zinc"—he was asked if he had bought any other articles of the man before—he said, no; he did not know that he had ever seen him in his shop before—Brian had taken the lead from his person—the policeman asked him where he got it—he made no reply—I believe it to be Mr. Thomas Henry Maudsley's and Joseph Field's.</p>

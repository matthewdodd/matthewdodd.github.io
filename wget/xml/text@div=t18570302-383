                  </hi>. I am assistant to Thomas and William Ayres, of Hill-street, Hammersmith. In the afternoon of 4th Feb. I was standing at the shop, by our front window—I heard a smash of the glass, immediately ran out, and saw the prisoner running at full speed towards the Broadway—at the same time he was pointed out to me by a lad—I followed him for about a quarter of a mile—I did not lose sight of him—I cried out, "Stop thief!"—he stopped when I got within about two yards of him, and asked what I wanted of him—I told him he had broken my employers' window, and I suspected he had stolen something—he said he had not stolen anything, and if he had broken the window he would pay for it—I gave him into custody—I went to the station, and afterwards returned to the shop, and found that a diamond ring, marked twenty guineas, was missing—it had been in the front window, directly opposite where the pane of glass was broken—the ring has not been found; here is the box in which it was; that was left in the window, with the card—I did not see anybody else near there at the time; I did not see anybody to whom the ring could have been handed—I rushed out immediately, the window having been smashed on a previous occasion, and the prisoner was not above a yard from the window.</p>

On Wednesday afternoon, 4th Feb., I was standing at the door of Mr. Ayres's shop—I saw a man push his hand against the window, and then run away—I heard the window break—I did not see the man's face; I pointed out to Mr. Poole the person I saw push against the window—he did not fall against it.</p>

I saw the prisoner walking up and down for about three quarters of an hour, and at Mr. Ayres's window—he turned round several times, and looked up at my window—I heard the glass smash, but did not see the window broken—I had seen the prisoner speaking to a woman; I cannot remember how long that was before I heard the glass smash.</p>

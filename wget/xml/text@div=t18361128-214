                  </hi>. I am foreman to George Baker, of New-row, Lam<lb></lb>beth—Mr. Samuel Baker has been dead about three weeks—he was a builder. On the 19th of November, we had some lead at Palace New-row, and at a variety of places—I cannot say where this was taken from—the lead is similar to some that was in our store-house a month since—that would be the 28th or 29th of October, and at that time Mr. Samuel Ba<lb></lb>ker was alive, and he and his son then had the business—it was Samuel Baker and Son—the prisoner worked on the premises—he was working there on the 19th—we had lead similar to this, and it was missing—he has had a very good character.</p>

On the 19th of November, at half-past seven o'clock, I was on duty in York-road, Lambeth—I saw the prisoner carrying this basket, and the lead in it—I asked what he had got—he said "Lead;" that he brought it from home, and that a boy sold it him for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—from the quantity I thought it was not likely he would get it for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and took into custody.</p>

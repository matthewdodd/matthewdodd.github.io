The deceased was at my house on a Monday soon after Christmas (I don't recollect the day) between eleven and twelve o'clock at night he came in, and several with him. The prisoner and one Greenland sat down in a box by themselves. The deceased was a very quarrelsome man, but was very quiet, and, I believe, sober that night. He was in a box that was very full, and left he should quarrel with the people in it, I desired him to come out, and sit in the box where the prisoner and Greenland were, which he did very quietly. The prisoner said something to Greenland; what it was I don't know, but I thought it was to shove him out of the box. Greenland did not take notice of what he said; they were sitting on the same side; the prisoner came by Greenland to try to shove him out himself; I told him to let him alone, for he had not offended him. The prisoner then came out of the box, and struck the deceased in the face, without any provocation on the side of the deceased or moving off his seat; the deceased did not strike him again. I interfered, and shoved the prisoner, and desired him to sit on the other side from Brown, which he did; I then went about my business. I did not hear what words passed between them, but I heard Brown say, keep off, I am rather afraid; if you come nearer to me I will strike you. I was in my bar or room, I cannot say which. I came out and saw them both fighting; I took Spikes under the chin, and pulled him back, to prevent their fighting, and as I thought him the aggressor, I was for putting him out of doors. The company desired I would not, and said there should be no more of it. The prisoner went out some time after, and the deceased stayed in the house for some minutes. The deceased said to my wife, give your Billy (meaning himself) a glass of gin, and I will go home. She served him with a glass; after that the deceased went out, and some of the company told me that the prisoner was stripped, waiting at the door against he came out, and that the prisoner struck him as soon as he got out. I did not see the beginning of it; I saw several blows on both sides afterwards. While they were in the house, I did not hear any appointment or challenge to fight; I did not care to leave the house, so I did not see the end of it. Brown was not stripped while I was out. The deceased called three or four days afterwards, and said he was much hurt, and was afraid he should not get over it; he said he had two cuts in his head, but he did not mind that so much as a pain he had in his side.</p>



               <p>[On his cross-examination he said the prisoner poured some beer on Greenland, who was asleep; that the witness said he would suffer no such usage in his house, but that he did not see the deceased interfere, but that afterwards the prisoner said Brown had struck him over the nose.]</p>

               <p>I am a stone polisher. I lived in the same house with the deceased; I was with him about an hour and an half on the Thursday evening before he went into the hospital, which was the Thursday se'nnight after the fray happened. He told me, that as he was coming home, he called in at Powell's to have a pint of beer; that the prisoner came in, and attempted to quarrel with him; that he did not know why he wanted to quarrel with him; for he had not given him any provocation, unless some words which passed at some place where they had met before. He said that the prisoner after he had aggravated him some time with words, struck him, but still he refrained from quarrelling with him; that some time after this, the prisoner, and two men that were with him, went out of doors, and that he supposed them to be quite gone; that he stayed some little time in the house after the prisoner went out, and then went up to the bar, and had a glass of gin; that he then wished<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290049"></xptr> them a good night, and then went out of doors, where he found the prisoner stripped; that as soon as he came out, the prisoner struck him and knocked him down; that before he could recover his feet, the prisoner struck him again, and knocked him down a second time; that he was so much stunned with the fall, that he could not recollect any thing afterwards. I asked him, whether the stunning was by the blow or fall? He said he believed it was by the fall; that he thought his head hit against an iron bar or scraper. I did not see the wounds, because I was afraid to undo the bandage which was done up by the surgeon of the hospital. He complained that when he coughed he had a pain in his side. The next day he was very bad, and the day after he went into the hospital, and then I saw no more of him.</p>

               <p>[On his cross-examination he said that the prisoner did not tell him any thing of his taking up the quarrel of another man, not that he struck the prisoner; that the deceased was rather chearful that night, and that he believed the deceased was rather in hopes of recovery.]</p>

             came to the hospital on the 14th of January, and continued as an out-patient about ten days. He had a contused wound on the left side of the fore part of his head; the wound did not appear to be dangerous; it got better the first four or five days, and after that got worse till the 24th, when he was taken into the Middlesex hospital, and made an in-patient. He continued there till the 20th, when he died. I opened his head after he was dead, and there was a great quantity of matter on the left side of the brain, spread all over the surface, between the membranes; the inflamation that came on the brain in consequence of the blow, was the occasion of the man's death; it was entirely from the blow. He was trapanned on the 26th or 27th, and a great quantity of matter came from the apperture that was made in his skull. I asked him how he came by the wound? He told me, he fell against the scraper of a door. He did not say any thing more.</p>

               <p>I had been to a meeting of Plaisterers, where they meet every Monday night, at the Black Horse in Oxford Road; I got pretty forward in liquor. When we broke up, we called at the Plaisterers' Arms, intending to have a pot of beer, this Greenland, and I, and several more. Greenland fell asleep, and in order to wake him, I poured a little drop of beer down his neck. Powell said, I will be d - n'd if I will have any such usage in my house. Brown made answer, d - n the bloody dog, kick him out of doors. Upon that words arose between us, and he struck me on the nose, and made my nose bleed; a scuffle ensued between us. Mr. Powell came and laid hold of me by the back part of my neck, and pulled me down; he cut my head, and dragged me along the floor. His wife said he was wrong, for that Brown struck first; then he let me go. The company told him it was not my fault. I said to Brown, if you are a man, come out and fight like a man; I went out, and some men with me, and we went to fighting.</p>

               <p>I was at Powell's house on the 12th of January. The prisoner and the deceased were in the house when I went in; they were all in peace; Greenland fell asleep; the prisoner was in company with him; there was no other in company but them. The prisoner threw some beer over Greenland to wake him; Powell on that said that he should not use a dog of his so. The deceased took it up, and had them turn him out of the house. The prisoner called him a dog, and said he could not turn him out. The deceased said, if he was to hit him he should kill him; the prisoner said he could hit as hard as he; the deceased said he could swell his head as big as a pumpkin, and hit him on the nose, and made it bleed; then the prisoner hit him again, and a skirmish began. Powell came and pulled the prisoner away; I told Powell it was not the prisoner, but the deceased that was the aggressor. The prisoner then said to the deceased, if you are a man, come out and fight like a man. Brown buttoned up his coat, and said, d - n the dog, I will go out and link him. Jonas lles made answer, calling him by his name. Billy, if you will go out, I will go out and second you, and do all I can. Accordingly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290050"></xptr> he did, and there were two seconds on both sides, and they went out and fought till the watchman came and parted them.</p>

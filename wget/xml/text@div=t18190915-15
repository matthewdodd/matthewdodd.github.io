            . I am shopman to Mr. Maynard. The prisoner came to the shop, and looked out articles to the amount of 10 l. While she was looking at them two ladies came in a carriage; I had to attend them, being the only person in the shop; she must have taken these things during that time. Miss Maynard sent me a note, and I detained her as long as I could. She went out, I followed, and charged her with having a shawl in her pocket; she went into the shop followed by the beadle, whom I had sent for. He searched her, and found all the articles stated in the indictment, except the square silk shawl - the silk stockings she dropped in the shop. She was then taken to the Compter where the shawl was found on her.</p>

               <p>Q. How many did you deposit in the warehouse?</p>
               <p>Cotton. There were delivered in about thirtyfive thousand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wagg. On the 4th of this instant, one of the porters told me this warehouse was broke open. The two overseers belonging to the company's private trade sent to me, to go down to see how it was: I went, and saw the staples were drawn, and put in again; one was fast, and the other loose in the holes. I examined 400 of the fine walking-canes, which I marked with my own mark, and found about fifteen of them were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your mark?</p>
               <p>Wagg. It is the letter G. on the top joint of the cane; there were eight others taken out of another parcel, not marked. The next day, I went to 'Change, and went to Mr. Forset, that keeps a cane-shop, in Leadenhall-street; I acquainted his journeyman of what was lost, and desired, if any were brought, to stop them. In about an hour after, a young man came to our house, and told me there had been a man there with two canes, in order to sell them; and that he said he had twenty more, and upwards, and had left word, if they would come to the Horshoe and Magpye, a public-house, in Fetter-lane, he would go with them to a house in that neighbourhood, where they were. I went to that public-house, and the prisoner was there, and had the two canes in his hand: I examined the two canes, and found my mark upon one of them. I desired the young man to go with him, and buy the canes at any rate, in order to bring them to the public-house where I was, to pay for them: the young man went, and bought them at half a guinea a cane: I had a constable and a friend of mine ready; the young man brought the canes and prisoner; I looked at the canes; he seemed very uneasy, and said, if I did not like them. he would take them back again I said, neither he nor the canes should go back: there were 24 canes: he said, his sister kept one. where they were lodged: (produced in court.) Here are fifteen of them have my mark upon them. I asked him where he got them? he said, he had some of the lumpers, and some he bought of the Blacks: he told me he was a labourer at Mr. Perry's wharf. Some of these canes are Captain

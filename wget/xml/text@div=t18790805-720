I am a widow, at 24, Dudley Street, St. Martin's Lass, I had known prisoner about a fortnight prior to 21st June—I was at a house in Turner's Court, St. Martin's Lane, waiting on a friend who was ill, when some<lb></lb>one knocked at the door twice—I went downstairs and saw the prisoner—he asked me to go and have something to drink and I refused, and went to go down the court away from him—he followed and asked me again, and on my re<lb></lb>fusing he struck me in the forehead—I put my hand up to save my face and he plunged a knife in my side—I saw the knife in his hand, but did not see it before the blow—I staggered and screamed, and a person ran to my assistance and I was conveyed to the hospital—I saw the policeman come up—I was in the hospital a fortnight, attended by the surgeon—the prisoner saw me the previous day, the 20th, and said "I have been to your father, and he refuses to let me work there"—my father is a boot and shoe maker,</p>

I am house-surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital—the prosecutrix was brought in on Saturday afternoon, 21st June, and 1 attended her—I found an incised wound between the ninth and tenth ribs on the right side, about three inches from the middle line of the back, and directed outwards and downwards about 1 1/2 inches long and nearly an inch deep—she appeared to have lost a great deal of blood and was very much collapsed when brought in—she was kept in the hospital a fortnight—the wound was</p>

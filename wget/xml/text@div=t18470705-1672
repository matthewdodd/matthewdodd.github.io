                  </hi> I am housekeeper to Mr. Wright, of the Clarendom Hotel. The prisoner was in his service—she left on the 19th of Jan., 1846—she had been in his service between five and six years—she has lived with Mr. Greville since that, I gave her a character to go there—I have charge of the linen—I have seen some linen produced by Baker—I identify it as belonging to Mr. Wright—I identify this sheet by my own work upon it—the initials have been picked out—I have other to correspond with it; my work is on all of them—no one has any business with linen of this sort of the premises—they are never taken off the premises—they are washed at home—I believe this plate and these cups and saucers to be Mr. Wright's—they are the same pattern as his—we take stock twice a-year—we missed linen of this description in Jan., just after the prisoner left—I had no idea the prisoner was the guilty party—I cannot say when we took stock last; but it is twice a-year—there is generally a little missing, as it is a large house—articles of this description were missing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook in the establishment of Messrs. Bevington—I have been there 91/2; years—Mrs. Milson had been there about the same time—after the premises were closed in the evening, I and Mrs. Milson were the only persons usually left on the premises—we both slept on the premises in the upper part of the house—the ground floor was used entirely for warehouses and counting-houses, also the first floor and part of the second—it is a very large building, sufficient to prevent me hearing what is going on below—on the 11th of April, after the place was closed, I heard a ring at the bell—Mrs. Milson was in the dining-room at the time, and I was in the bed-room—when the bell rang she passed out of the dining room and went downstairs—the bed-room is close by, on the same floor—the door was open—I did not see her, but she spoke to me; she said it was for her and she would go down—that was as near ten minutes past 9 as I can recollect—I believe I went out of my room myself a minute or two after she went down, and when I got into the dining-room it was ten minutes past 9—when she went down she seemed to be in perfect health; she had a bad leg—I never saw her alive again—at a quarter-past ten I thought I would go down and see if she was ready to go to bed—I took the candle, and when I got down to the bottom of the stairs I found her lying dead—my first impression was that she was in a fit—I took bold of her hand and called her; finding I could get no answer I went to the door—I saw a woman at</p>

               <p>the door, as I supposed, standing there for shelter—she did not come in—I waited for a few minutes until I saw a police-constable—he came in, and saw Mrs. Milson lying, and then he asked me to wait while he went to the station and got assistance—when I went back with the constable I saw that she was really dead—after the house was closed in the evening persons very frequently came—very frequently there would be two or three rings of an evening—Mrs. Milson generally went down—when she did go down to answer the bell she frequently stopped down all the evening—she borrowed money from me on two occasions, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each time—that was, as near as I can recollect, about two or three months from the time of the murder; the first time was on the Friday and the other on the Saturday—after I had lent her the sovereign on the Saturday I looked out of window and saw a man get in a cab at the corner of Budge-row by the lamp; I could not tell the time; I think it was between eight and nine; I am not certain—the bell had rung, and her sister had come in before I lent her that sovereign, but I do not recollect whether it rang afterwards or not—I think the man that got in the cab came out of the house—I did not see him directly he came out of the door, because there is a reflector over the door; but he went close from the door at any rate, and Mrs. Milson was looking out at the door after him—she had gone down not many minutes before he went out—I should think she had borrowed the sovereigns of me not more than five or ten minutes before she went down—she had been down before that, and she came straight upstairs to me and asked me for the sovereigns, and went down again directly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far in the doorway was the body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A good distance; close to the stairs, some yards within the doorway—the feet were towards the stairs; she was lying in rather a slanting direction, against some bales—I don't think that the policeman ascertained that she was dead before he went for assistance; he did not touch her, he merely came and looked at her—I don't know that he saw that she was injured; it was obvious that she was injured—there was a great deal of blood—he went for assistance, leaving me alone with her—I had known the deceased 91/2; years; we both went to Cannon-street together—we were always on perfectly friendly terms—she was a widow; her husband died while we were there, 6 years ago; I know that—I knew very few of her friends or associates, two or three—her late husband's sister, the two Misses Cox, and the Misses Strugnell, were the principal—they used to come sometimes of an evening and sometimes in the day; they always came upstairs when they came—she used frequently to go downstairs after business hours, and sometimes remain down the whole evening, very often it would be from eight to nine before I would see her, or from that till ten; then she would turn the gas out and come up—she would sometimes be away as much as two hours—an hour and a half was very usual—since her leg had been bad she stopped downstairs more on account of its being a trouble to her to get up and down stairs—she would say, "I am going down; I have got some letters to write, and I shall go in the counting house"—she had frequently sat down a good deal since her leg had been bad, that was quite two months—she had always been in the habit of answering the bell and receiving visitors—I never learnt from her who they were—she never used to tell me who they were unless I saw them—I never saw them, she always went herself, and when she was out nobody came—I rather gathered from that that the persons came by appoint<lb></lb>ment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186606110045"></xptr>
               <p>—she had always been in the habit of having visitors ever since she had been there, visitors whom I did not see—while her husband was alive, people came then that she did not have upstairs—she was of a very cheerful disposition—she used to receive a good many letters and write a good many—I never saw the addresses of the letters that she wrote—she never asked me to post them, she used to give them out to be posted, sometimes to some of the boys when they were going to the post, sometimes to the tradespeople when they came—I think it was between two and three months before her death that she borrowed the sovereigns of me on the Friday and Saturday—I saw a man on the Friday go into the dining-room, just the back of him, and on the Saturday I saw the man get into a cab—I could not tell exactly what time it was on the Friday; it was in the afternoon during business hours—on Saturday it was after business hours, I think between eight and nine, after the business was closed—that was the time I saw him get into the cab—I was up on the second storey—it was quite dark at that time—the cab was waiting for him—I can't tell whether it was a Hansom or a close cab.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were asked whether you ever heard from Mrs. Milson who the persons were that called? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She said the man that called for this money was named Denton, and gave his address in the Old-change, and called himself a solicitor—she told me that, when she borrowed the money of me—I saw the cab leave—I waited till it drove off—it went towards London-bridge—when I first came down on this night the gas was all out but one burner, and that was over where the body lay—the burner over the door was turned off.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whose duty was it to put the burners out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We always put them out the last thing when we locked up; Mrs. Milson generally did it when she was down—we always put all three out, and turned it off at the meter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Great Trinity-lane, Cannon-street—on the night of 11th April, about half-past 10, I was called to Messrs. Bevingtons' premises, and there saw the body of Mrs. Milson lying—I found many very extensive wounds over the head and face—there was one causing an extensive fracture of the skull; two others on the left side of the head—death was caused by effusion of blood on the opposite side of the head—one of the wounds had ruptured a large vessel, and that was the immediate cause of death—there was much blood—the light was very bad—the light of the gas was shaded from the body as it lay by some cases of goods, but there was a large quantity of blood on the ground, which in<lb></lb>creased in quantity while I was there—it flowed while I was there—it had considerably increased when I left—the body was still warm when I got there—there was a small quantity of blood on the legs of the packing stool, which was opposite—there was no track of blood—it appeared to be one pool undisturbed, flowing from her head as she lay—some such instrument as this might have caused the wounds—I don't undertake to swear that it did—the wounds were of two classes—one class, which would be produced by a blunt, heavy instrument, and the other class, by a sharper instrument; such as one end of a weapon like this might produce—they were deep wounds; one of them in particular, extending from the outer orbit of the eye to the nose bone; a deep, penetrating wound—another went down deep into the flesh, and cut through a small bone—in my opinion it is possible for the sharp part of the instrument to have made one class of wounds, and this blunt part the other—there was no blood on the instrument that I could see—I looked—I should certainly have expected to find blood upon it, if it had been used—I certainly think there must have been blood on it as a consequence of wounds inflicted with that weapon; unless, of course, it had been very carefully cleaned afterwards—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> ex<lb></lb>amination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I take it for granted that several of the arteries were separated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; many vessels were divided—the effect of the division of an artery is necessarily a spirting of blood—the blood from an artery would spirt out in jets—that is so invariably—it cannot be otherwise if a person is alive—the blood continued to flow during the time I was there—the blood continued to ooze—after the action of the heart had ceased from death, the jetting from the arteries would cease—I should say she had been dead an exceedingly short time—I should think not as much as an hour—I think I might with safety say under half an hour—I did not see any jets of blood; that might be accounted for by this theory, it may be that one serious wound was inflicted, that the blood from that did not fly to any very great distance; that then she fell, and after that the other wounds were inflicted; and the blood from those would not go to any great extent; that is my idea—I could not say, with any great certainty, which was the wound that felled her, supposing that was the case, but there was one wound which appeared to be the most formidable wound, inflicting the most damage on the soft parts, although I would speak with very great caution on the subject; if I was compelled to gay that one wound did it, I would</p>

I am an inspector of the city-police at Bow-lane station—on the day after the death of Mrs. Milson, Mrs. Robins came to the station and gave me some information respecting a man leaving the premises on the night of the murder—some days after that the prisoner was brought to the station—it was necessary to take him from Bow-lane to the Mansion-house—he was taken along St. Thomas Apostle to Queen-street, along Cannon-street and Walbrook to the Mansion-house—that is the way all prisoners are taken from Bow-lane-station—he walked with two other officers near him, but he was not handcuffed—there was nothing to indicate that he was a prisoner—there was no policeman manacled—the policeman was taken away in a cab previous to that—that was done in consequence of there being an immense crowd at the station, we could not get in or out, and we put a policeman in a cab, and the mob went away thinking he was the prisoner, and the prisoner walked as other people through the street—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186606110051"></xptr>
               <p>there was no indication that he was a prisoner—he was not touched, or handled, or handcuffed—I had made a communication previously to that to Mrs. Robins—I told her to be at the door, and watch all persons that went through the street for the next quarter of an hour, and see if she saw any person like the man she had described to me—I did not go and walk by the prisoner's side—I was on some distance in front—after I had passed, Mrs. Robins, I believe, went in, and did not see the prisoner go by—as far as I could see nothing was done, or intended to be done, to point out the man in any way—everything was done to prevent his being pointed out by any person—no one knew who he was—in fact he walked to the Mansion-house without the notice of any one—I afterwards saw Mrs. Robins; in conse<lb></lb>quence of what she then told me, I asked her to come up to the Mansion-house—before she was allowed to see the prisoner, a number of persons, several of them strangers that I never saw before, were brought in and placed with the prisoner—they were in one room, Mrs. Robins was in a centre room, and they passed through that room into another, walked by and back again—I was standing a short distance from Mrs. Robins, and after they had passed the second time she said, "The third man was the man I saw"—that was the prisoner—nothing was done to indicate to her who the man was—not a word was spoken to her.</p>

I am a single woman, and live at 7, Rose-street, Smithfield—I knew Mrs. Milson—I did washing for her—I sometimes carried the washing home myself—on one occasion, when I carried the washing home there was a person at the door—that was between 6 and 7 in the evening—I do not remember what month it was in—I believe it was about Christmas time, in December—I went to the door and rang the bell, and this person was there, making his way to the door—Mrs. Milson came to the door, and she started back; drew herself back—she went back and made an exclamation—she appeared very much alarmed at the man that came up to the door—she asked me if I would follow him, and I did so—I went as far as Walbrook—he turned round and went up Walbrook—I saw him again that same evening—I could not swear to his features—I could not say who that man was—the man that I saw at Newgate by his walk seemed like the man at the bar—the prisoner is the man—I only go by his walk—I don't go by his features—he had a peculiar walk—I noticed it that night, and also when I saw him afterwards—Mrs. Milson borrowed some money of me in January—she told me what she wanted it for.</p>

Q.</hi> What do you mean by a high hat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> An ordi<lb></lb>nary hat—I had gone out that evening to do a little shopping, and I had gone into a friend's in Watling-street—they kept me talking or I should not have been out so long—the friend did not come home with me—it was a married lady and gentleman—it was a wet and dark night, but it was not raining when I went home—it had been—I was out from eight till nine, when I went into my friends', and they kept me talking, and it was past ten when I left their house, and I think about ten minutes past ten when I entered my own house—the man I saw seemed not to walk so fast at the moment he got to our door, but then he went on in a hurried manner after<lb></lb>wards—I first heard the slam of the door, and then I saw him leave the steps, and I turned my back and turned sideways, and he passed me on the right—I never saw him standing still, only as he passed—he hastened his pace as he passed—he did not walk as fast when he got to me, but when he got past me he went fast—he slackened his pace at the moment at our door just under the lamp—it seemed to me that he did not go so fast then—my lamp was alight—I am positive of that—I have not seen any photo<lb></lb>graph of the prisoner—I have never been shown any—I did not see him pass the corner of Budge-row—I saw him under the lamp at the corner—I did not see him go beyond Budge-row—he had just got to the pavement where there is a turning to go up Budge-row—he appeared to be going straight—I did not see him turn the corner—if he had gone straight on, he would have gone towards London-bridge, but he could have turned—he appeared to me to be going towards London-bridge—No. 1, Cannon-street, stands at the edge of Budge-row—the back of our house is in Budge-row, and the office entrance is in Cannon-street—we have two entrances—Budge-row is a continuation of Watling-street—a person going up Budge-row could go up Watling-street, and get into St. Paul's-churchyard—it appeared to me that the man was going towards London-bridge—he went that way—I could not tell whether he turned or not—our front door, I should think, is ten yards from Budge-row—at the time the man passed me, I thought he had been in business very late, and from his hurried manner I thought he wanted a cab—he was on the left side when I first saw him, and then he passed me on the right, about five yards off—he might have turned in the other direction without passing me if he had liked—if he had wanted to go towards St. Paul's, he would not have passed me.</p>

               <p>among them—he might or might not—I was told to be there, and to see if I could see any one like the man I saw—I had seen Mr. Foulger pass our street—I had seen him before many times, and of course I knew his face again—I was not on terms of acquaintanceship with him—I never spoke to him until this affair, until I told him what I had seen—he asked me to be at the door and look at the persons that passed up and down the street, and see if I could see any one—I was at the window when the cab passed—it passed with such a confusion that it flurried me—I did not go down to the door directly—I did very soon after—I waited to recover my nerves—we were standing inside of our door—my girl was standing on my right side, and I was standing just inside—I saw Foulger, but I took no notice, and then, when a lot had passed by, my girl said to me, "Did you see any one like the man I saw?"—I said, "Kate, I saw nobody "—I never noticed anybody behind Foulger—I was in a state of very great confusion—I do not know what there was to make me so, only the mob of people that went by with the cab—I waited some minutes after that before I went down—I did not get quite right, I was not quite right when I went to the Mansion-house—I was not in quite so much confusion then, because more than two hours had elapsed, and I had sat down quietly for two hours in my own place—Inspector Foulger came back to know if we had seen any one, and Kate said what she saw, and he said, "Well, Mrs. Robins, I should like you to see if you can see the man, without going to the Old Bailey "—I was told to go to the Mansion-house, and downstairs there I was told to see if I could see anybody—I went with Foulger to the Mansion-house—I told him that I had been in such confusion that I had not seen the man as he passed—I do not know whether my nerves were in good order when I heard the door slam and he hurriedly passed me—I merely said, when I went indoors, that some one had left Messrs. Bevington's—I was frightened at the door banging, certainly—it was a regular loud slam—I looked round and saw what it was—I was not in so much fright then—I was in a little alarm when the door slammed—the confusion when the cab passed was a great deal more than when the door slammed—of course I was frightened, I was startled, I was not actually frightened—I took particular notice of the man's legs, and why I did so was because the reflection of the lamp caused me to notice it—that was in front—I mean the street lamp, not our lamp—his trousers were dark, I could not see whether they were black or not—I could not swear his trousers were dark—I believe his clothes were all dark, they looked so—I could not see nothing about the trousers—I say I believe the clothes he wore were dark—his trousers appeared to me dark—I do not feel any doubt about it—the whole of the clothes seemed dark—that is all I can say—it had been raining during the day, but it was not raining then,—it was wet under foot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am at present an inmate of St. Olave's workhouse, Southwark—I knew Mrs. Milson for some years before her death—during her husband's life-time she was living next door to me—she was friendly with my wife at that time—some years ago I got a Mrs. Webber to lend Mrs. Milson some money—I don't think it was so much as 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some time after that I got into difficulties, and ultimately got into the workhouse—at the end of last year I was lodging in Dancer-street, near the Mint—I knew the prisoner then, by sight, that was all—he was living at the same lodging-house—I don't know how long he had been there—I was there four or five</p>

Bevington's place, and he went in—I cannot recollect when this was: it was last year, somewhere close upon Christmas—it was cold weather—I know it was dark very early, about half-past 3 or 4 o'clock—when he came out, he said they had told him he could not see Mrs. Milson then; he was to come about 3 o'clock—he went back that same afternoon after 3—I saw him go in again—I should say he remained more than half an hour, or full half an hour—when he came out I was waiting outside the public-house—he came to me, and we both went in the public-house—he said, "How much do you think I have got?"—I said, "2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "No, I have not"—to the best of my recol<lb></lb>lection he said he had about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or he might have had more—he handed me 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said Mrs. Milson had to borrow some of the cook, or of the other servant, to make it up—she only had, I think he said, half a sovereign—he gave it to me, and I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of it for his trouble—I never sent him there again—I did not know that he had received two sums of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I knew that he had been once since, but I did not believe in him—he did not tell me he had been—I heard it—I did not tax him with it, I never saw him—the only time I said anything to him about it was when I heard he had received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Sunday—I did say a few words to him about it, and he denied it—the next morning, Monday, he got up early, about 7 o'clock, and went out, and he never came back to the lodging—I did not know that he was going—I never saw him again till I saw him at Windsor, when I was taken there by the police.</p>

Q.</hi> How often did you go to Wheeler's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not very often—I went twice that week—that was on the Wednesday and Saturday—I had been there about a week before that—I could not tell on what day—when I went on the Saturday, I met the same party there, all of them—I did not meet the same party the previous week—I can't remember who was there, or whether any of them were there—I am often with Matthews—I work with him—I played one game of cards, at a game called Don—there was me, Matthews, Dobner, and Holderness—two of four can play at it—Smith did not play—he was sitting down by the side of Harris-Harris played, and Smith looked over his hand, and showed him how to play—there was some drinking going on—the landlord was there, not all the time—I think he went down once; he was there the greater part of the time—I did not see the landlady come in—I saw her down at the bar—I don't know whether she saw me—it was only when I passed in at the door—I did not speak to her—the landlord waited upon us; there is no potboy—I can't remember whether the landlord's daughter waited on us or not—I don't recollect whether I saw her that evening—I recollected that Smith was with me on this evening, the day he was taken—I first told Inspector Pearman, not on that day; I don't remember what day it was—we went down at night and told him—I don't remember which night it was—I should think it was about two days after the prisoner was taken—I heard that he was taken, but I did not know why, till a little while after—I knew that he was taken for murder, a little while after, the same day—I did not keep this to myself for two days—I told the others—I told Henry Harris the next day after he was taken; that would be on the Wed<lb></lb>nesday—I told him that he was in our company on the night of the murder—I also told Dobner, Starling, and Holderness—they remembered it as well, but they would not be certain, not for a moment, till we brought it to our minds—we soon brought it to our recollection—Dobner, at first thought it was the week before; Harris thought it was that night; Starliag thought so too, and so did Holderness, that that was the night Smith was with us—I mentioned it first—Henry Harris was not with us at first, not when we came out of Brockhurst—I, Stirling, Holderness, and Dobner, were at</p>

               <p>Brockhurst—I mentioned it first to them—I told them it was the night Smith was with us; the night we were at Wheeler's—they said that was right—I saw Harris afterwards—Dobner said, at first, he thought it was the previous week; but then he brought it to his recollection that that was the night—we were talking about it—none of them said they thought it was on the Tuesday—I saw Harris afterwards, that same evening, and told him, and he agreed with me that it was on the Wednesday—we went to Wheeler's while we were talking about it, and asked whether it was on the Wednesday or not—I, Dobner, Starling, and Holderness went, not Harris; we met him outside of the door—we went to Wheeler's before we saw him—we asked Wheeler whether Smith was not in the house on Wednesday, 11th April—we were discussing it on Windsor-hill—we went from Brock-hurst to Wheeler's, discussing it among ourselves—the discussion was not whether it was on the Tuesday or Wednesday, because we said it was on the Wednesday, and we went up to see if Mr. Wheeler could recollect whether that was the night that Smith was there—we were talking about it, and saying that that was the night; not whether it was that night, but that it was that night—we went straight up into Wheeler's room, and we spoke to Mr. Wheeler, not to Mrs. Wheeler.</p>

Q.</hi> When you went to Goddard's, was Mr. Goddard there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I went in there after I had done my work he was there—that was at a quarter after 10, or a little more—he was there when I came away—he is the keeper of the house—I went there after I had done my work, at a quarter after 10—it is close to my house—I was not there twice that night—Goddard was at the bar the greater part of the time I was there—he is not here to-day, Mrs. Goddard is—I did not see her after I saw her going to the performance—that was over about a quarter to 11—I did not see her after that—Goddard was at the bar—I was in the parlour on the opposite side—there might be seven or eight there beside me and the prisoner—a Mr. Hodges was there and Mr. Hammond—they are neighbours, and a person named Woods came in just before the prisoner came in—he remained there after the prisoner left—neither of those persons are here—I first went and gave information to the prisoner's mother respecting his being with me on this Wednesday night—I did that the day he was taken—I did not go to the police, they met me as I was coming from his mother's house—No. 11 and 72, I think, of the Bucks police met me—I told them what I have stated to-day—I did not tell them about Goddard being there—I told them that Mr. Hodges heard the conversation—I go to Goddard's every n got when I am in good health—that is not very often—I might have missed one night that week, but not more, I think.</p>

SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you or are you not sure that this was on the night of the theatricals? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am quite sure—there were—theatricals on the Wednesday, and again on the Friday—on the Friday night I was at home—the prisoner came in and said he should like to go to the performance that night, and he went—I told the policeman what I had told the prisoner's mother, about my having been in company with her son at a quarter past 11—the other policeman said to me, "You know this is a very serious thing for a young man in our neighbourhood to take place; we must try and get him out of it if we can," or something to that effect—I said, "It was a quarter past 11 when we were going down the town"—he said "Don't you think it was later than a quarter past 11?"—I said, "No; I could be on my oath it was not five minutes either way from the quarter"—we went to the shop where I work, and he went in and got a bit of paper; and as he was writing, he said, "Don't you think it was later than the time you have stated?"—I said, "No; what I have stated I am sure of."</p>

               <p>masters of Eton College, as butler—I know the prisoner—I am well aware of the night of the private theatricals—they took place on a Wednesday—there were two days, one was on a Wednesday, and the other on a Friday—I went on the Wednesday—they were held at the Mathematical School—I was going home after my work—I don't sleep in the house—I go home—I have a shop also at Eton—I met the prisoner that evening within a few doors of my own house, as near 8 o'clock as I can judge—I knew him well—he had been in the habit of coming to the house once or twice a week with errands—his mother is laundress to a great portion of Eton, and for the house that I am at—she has part of the work, a certain part of the work, not the whole—he has been in the habit of bringing the things home, fetching them on a Monday, and bringing them home on a Friday—I am perfectly certain I saw him that night, and at the time I mentioned as near as possible—I will not swear to five minutes.</p>

Q.</hi> Where was it you met him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the High-street, within a few doors of my house—my house is in the High-street—he was alone—I did not say I went to the private theatricals that night—I said that was the night: I did not go—I did not leave my house after I once entered that night—I did not go that night—I was walking home from my situation—I leave at all times—there is no particular time—I know what time it was on this night, because at ten minutes past 7 a fellow-servant came into the pantry—I was then at work—she said, "Are you at work till this time of night"—I said, "Yes, I am endeavouring to finish this job if I can to-night"—she said she was going, she looked at the clock and saw it was ten minutes past 7, and it would have taken me from half to three quarters of an hour to close the house, change my clothes, and go up to where I saw the prisoner—I am certain I could not have got away from the house in less than half an hour, even if I had left work at the time—the place I speak of is about three quarters of a mile from the Windsor and Eton Bridge—it is not towards the barracks—it is towards Slough, the house I am in—it is the last house in Eton—Smith was coming towards his own residence—he was on my right hand when I saw him, and he crossed towards his own home on my left—it would be considerably above a mile from the turnpike—it is not because there was a theatrical performance that night that I fix that night—the reason why I can fix it more particularly is that I had promised to take my children for a long walk, Wednesday being a half-holiday, and they were to meet me after their dinner in the college—the rain came on and prevented their coming, but later in the afternoon they sent to know if I would take them if it gave over raining, and I said "No," as I should continue my work that day, and the first dry day they should come out of school earlier, which they did on the following Thursday—I first mentioned this some weeks ago, in fact, immediately after the prisoner's apprehension—I believe I called it to mind the same day—I went straight home after seeing him—I did not come out again—I am not the person who has been spoken of as being at Goddard's—I believe I first mentioned this to some workpeople in the house who told me of the apprehension—I did not go to the police or mention it to them—I had no evidence to give, I considered—I read the case in the paper afterwards, but I saw that there was no defence taken—I feel confident that I am not mistaken in the day.</p>

               <p>prisoner is nearer where I live—half-an-hour would be enough for a person to go from that place to the turnpike, and come back to where I saw the prisoner—they might walk it leisurely in that time—I should think it would be under four miles an hour.</p>

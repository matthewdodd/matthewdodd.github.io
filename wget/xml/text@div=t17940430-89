               <p>I am watchman of Broad-street Ward; on the 20th of February, in the morning, hearing that many houses in the court had been robbed of their knockers and bells, I shut my box up to see if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300145"></xptr>could see any lurking people about; about a quarter before seven, I saw the two prisoners at the bar lurking; I went past them, and went up into a corner, Burkitt he went on, and Brame stopped, I hid myself in a corner, and see them return to Mr. Porter's door, and then he wrung the knocker off, he broke it short; I followed him and I sprung the rattle, and called out, stop thief! he then dropped that knocker and two more, and Mr. Sparkes, that is here, stopped him in Trogmorton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him? - Only at the turn of the corner, I see him drop all the knockers, I am certain he is the man; Burkitt after he turned the corner, I never saw any more after that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Burkitt, in conversation with Brame at the time? - He was with him in the court, but not by him when he wrung the knocker off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them converse together? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took up these knockers? - this man took up one, and I took up one; the officer has got them.</p>
               <p>- SPARKES sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 20th of of February I saw the prisoner running at the same time as Mr. Buck speaks of, I saw him running in Throgmorton-street very speedily towards me, Brame was the man. When I seized hold of him, he dropped the knocker down by the side of him; I saw him, I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any more about him? - No, he had a screw-driver, a small rule, and some little pieces of brass.</p>
               <p>Court to Buck. I thought you said he dropped three? - He dropped one first, and one after, and one by Mr. Sparkes's feet, he dropped three in all; all the three were delivered to the officer, I picked up that that belonged to Mr. Porter.</p>
               <p>Sparkes. The knocker I picked up was carried to the officer, and delivered to the officer in the watch-house.</p>

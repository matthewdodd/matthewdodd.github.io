               <p>I went to the prosecutor's house to drink a pint of beer and eat a bit of bread and cheese; this girl came to me and desired me to carry her bundle for her, and said she would give me a shilling, for she had a mind to leave her place. I asked her to bring I down; she said her Mistress was not willing for her to go away, so she would put it out at the window, which she did, and I carried it as far as Somerset house; she persuaded me to go over the water and lay with her all night.

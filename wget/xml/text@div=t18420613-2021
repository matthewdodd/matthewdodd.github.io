                  </hi>. I am a lamp-lighter, and live in Spring-grove, Lambeth. At half-past three o'clock in the morning of the 2nd of June I saw the two prisoners at the end of Devonshire-road, Larkhall-lane, lurking about with two others—presently I saw Scott get over a fence, close by Mr. Ward's house—I gave information to the police—they went round one way, and I the other—the policeman got there first—I saw him take Scott, and I took Hayes, who had a bundle with him—he threw it down, I picked it up, and gave it to the policeman—Hayes was taken a quarter of a mile from where he threw down the bundle—I chased him, and lost sight of him about half a minute, in turning round a wall—there was no one else there, except the other two—I saw Scott throw a parcel over Mr. Field's garden.</p>

Q.</hi> How far might I be from the house, when you saw me get over the fence, as you say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might be about 150 yards-there were four of you together when at the end of Devonshire-road, when I put out my last lamp—you did not speak to me—I am sure I saw you throw a parcel over Mr. Field's garden—there are houses on both sides of the way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. From information I received I saw Hayes getting over a fence close by Mr. Ward's house, with this' bundle in his hand—there were four of them together—I saw Scott close under the fence—he had the bundle, which he took from his pocket, and flung away into the garden—Martin picked up the bundle, and gave it to me—it contained bacon, bread, and butter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. William John Ward. There was a loaf of bread, some butter, and some bacon in the safe in the yard the last thing at night, and the next morning they were gone—the brad and other tiling produced are like my master's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Scott. Q.</hi> Are you positive that the bread and bacon belongs to your master? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It resembles it—the safe was unlocked—the key was in the key-hole—all that was in the safe was taken out.</p>

I am positive it is 400 yards from where Ratcliff says he saw me; I have lived in Clapham nearly six years; he said, "If you offer to take any thing from your pockets I will knock the teeth down your throat;" I never threw any thing from my pockets; there was no place for me to throw any thing away; there are houses on each side</p>

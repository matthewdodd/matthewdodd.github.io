                  </hi> I am a hosier, at 21, Royal Exchange. On Saturday evening, 18th Dec., the prisoner called to purchase hosiery—he had two me<lb></lb>rino waistcoats, two pairs of drawers, four pairs of half-hose, three shirts, a scarf, two handkerchiefs, a pair of gloves, a pair of braces, and two collars, amounting to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he tendered me a check for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had some hesitation about taking it, and he said, "I will give you a check for the exact amount"—I eventually took the check for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change—my boy took the parcel to the omnibus, and I sent another boy to go outside the omnibus, and to follow the prisoner—that boy is not here—this is the check—the alteration of the date caused my suspicion—I presented it on the Monday morning—I got nothing for it—I was told there were no assets—the prisoner mentioned a customer's name to me in the first instance, which put me off my guard, pre<lb></lb>suming he was a respectable man—he also stated he had been in the habit of using the Gordon and the Tavistock Hotel.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk in the London Joint Stock Bank, Pall-Mall. I cannot say that I know the prisoner personally—a person named George William Rowley had an account at the bank—it was closed on 31st Dec.—except from the books, I have no knowledge about it; and by the paid checks which I have here—the account was opened on 1st March, 1847, by a cash payment of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was the only cash payment we received—I have here an extract from the ledger, which is partly kept by me—I have paid checks of the prisoner's across the counter—I cannot say that I recollect seeing him at the bank—some of those checks have been paid by myself—the first entry is in the writing of a clerk who is no longer in our employ—when the account was closed on the 31st Dec., there was a balance of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we closed it by charging 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. commission—the last check we paid was on 30th April—I believe he never had a pass-book—we wanted to get back our check-book from him, and wrote for it, but were unable to get it—we never made any charge for the check-book—it is usual at the close of the account to request the check-book to be returned.</p>

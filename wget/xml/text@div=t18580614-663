                  </hi>. I am a stableman in James Mews, Berkeley Square. There was a mare there, at stable, belonging to Mr. Lillycrap—on 10th Feb., the prisoner came, and asked if I had a mare belonging to Mr. Lillycrap, I said, "Yes;" he told me to let him look at it—he came the next day with Mr. Redding, a horse dealer—the prisoner showed it him; they went away, and the prisoner said he should come the next morning for the mare—he came and said, "I have come for the mare;" I said, "Have you seen Mr. Lillycrap?" he said, "Yes; and he said, I might have her;" I said he should not have her without a written order—he went away, and came with this order, "Let the bearer have my pony;" I let him have it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furrier. I had a mare for sale in Feb. last—I knew the prisoner, I had seen him before—he came two nights before to my door, and asked for a job—he had clipped a horse for me before that—he said he was very hard up, and asked if I could give him relief—I told him I bad a mare for sale, and if he could sell it, and bring the person to me, I would give him something for himself, but I never authorized him to take away the mare—this card was not written by me, nor by my authority, it was written by a young lady in my employ, she gave him this in conse<lb></lb>quence of what he stated—I have seen the mare since, and have sold her.</p>

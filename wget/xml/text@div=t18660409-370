                  </hi>. I am the wife of Abraham Lloyd, of 4, Bentham-place, Bentham-road, South Hackney, a general shop<lb></lb>keeper—on the night of 28th Feb. we all went to bed together, at 11—I barred the kitchen door—it was safe when I went to bed—at 2, I was disturbed by a dog walking about, and the footsteps of a human being in the garden—I listened, and heard a very strange noise in the kitchen, as if some body was getting in the house—the window was opened and a bolt was moved, and then the kitchen door was opened—I awoke my husband—he called out, "Who's there?"—there was no answer—he dressed and went down—we thought it was a lodger—on going down stairs, we found a piece cut out of the panel—there was a piece of carpet laid, and one spoon put in it ready to take away—it had been on the table the night before—we went into the shop, and found Bray with the prisoner—I found a pane of glass broken in the kitchen, that was sound when I went to bed—I found a piece of wood down by the door; it had come out of the panel of the door, looking from the kitchen to the passage—my husband is not here—he is ill—when I opened the door, the prisoner was in custody of the constable.</p>

I was on duty in Union-road, Hackney, about half-past 2 on 1st March—I heard a dog over the gates of No. 4—Mrs. Lloyd lives there—I heard the prisoner's steps coming from the gate at the back of the house, into the road—I was not ten yards from</p>

               <p>him when I heard him—the garden behind Lloyd's house is inclosed by a wall—I asked him his business, and while I did so, I heard noises in the house, and they came out—I searched the prisoner, and found a screwdriver in his pocket—I went into the back yard and found a large black dog, which the prisoner said was his—I examined the garden by daylight, and found footmarks which exactly corresponded with the prisoner's boots—besides the screwdriver, the prisoner had a tobacco-box, a shirt, and this bag—on the door and through the panel, I found marks exactly corresponding with the screwdriver—I was close to the house when I first saw him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was coming from Lea-bridge, and was walking past the gates of the premises, when the constable caught hold of me; there was somebody breaking in the house, and he took me for it; I had nothing to do with it; they took my shirt off, and I have been under the doctor's hands ever since; the dog followed me about the street, and it went over the wall after a cat; I was remanded for a week, and was then brought up for another affair; I was two or three houses past the house when he first saw me.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Winter. On the 15th of August, I was coming down stairs - I looked into the warehouse, and saw the prisoner put some ham and a Dutch cheese in a flat; he brought down the flat, and put it into the cart, and took it to the stable - I came down and asked the prisoner if the meat was bad; he said, "What do you mean" - I said, "Never mind," and I stood there till he took it off</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you a fellow-servant named Betsey? A. Yes, she had a sweetheart, but he could not take the prisoner's place - he is not allowed to come to the house; I saw this on the 15th of August - I did not go and tell my master instantly; I did not mention it till the money was gone from the till - some weeks had passed - my master was at home at the time.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Winter to the prisoner's lodging, on the 9th of September- I found this butter tub and four cloths; I found no ham or cheese.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take the poor man into custody? A. No, he was at the watch-house; I did not hear his wife say she had taken away some dirty things in the tub.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you swear to the tub? A. Yes, and to these cloths; one of these have a mark on - the prisoner is married; the witness did not say a word to me for some weeks - the prisoner never left my service.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought a lot of clothes of the shopman, and took them to the stable, the shopman went with me with some corn; on the Monday I told my wife there was a lot of things I had bought of the shopman - she came to fetch them, but she had no apron on; I said,"Here is a tub, you may take them in that."</p>
               <p>JOHN GREEN WINTER re-examined. Q. Did the prisoner say this at the time? A. No; he was in custody; the tub was filled with cut up flats at the time I found it; he has been five or six months in my service as carman.</p>

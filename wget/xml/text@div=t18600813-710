MONTAGUE CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been a warehouseman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four or five years—the name of the firm is Wyllie and Co.—I was formerly a traveller or servant in that firm—I should say that is nine or ten years ago—Mr. James Thompson carried on business then—he gave it up four or five years ago and I took it—I carried it on for his brother perhaps twelve months—I took a partner named McNarr—the property was in the estate—he did not bring in 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he took the trade along with me as partner—I gave Mr. Thompson security in bills; I could not say how much—my capital was in the firm—I had 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it—Mr. McNarr had two-thirds of the profit—the prisoner came as servant to both of us—I could not say when that was; it was about six months afterwards—after Mr. McNarr left the business I made this new agreement with the prisoner—Mr. McNarr used to look at the books from time to time when he was partner with me, but I was mostly travelling; I very seldom looked at the books—the other partner was more at home than I was—there was a little book called the private ledger—Mr. McNaff kept the key of it—I did not keep the key after he was gone—the prisoner gave it up to me the night before he left—I had the key occasionally when I wanted to look in it—the prisoner made the entries in it—I can hardly tell you what entries he made in it; he made all that were necessary—all cash credit was entered by him where I had borrowed money—the sums that were borrowed ought to be entered in the private ledger—the debts that I owed were in the public ledger, they were not in the private ledger—you would learn what I owed from the ledger and stock-taking—I don't carry the ledger in my head—I can't tell—what I owed for money borrowed was</p>

               <p>in my private ledger, 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that was in the estate; I have not borrowed it—the interest was paid on that every year—I received this paper from the prisoner at the latter end of December—I was in a negociation to sell my business in February—it was in the latter end of December I took stock—in the general way, we took an account of all the stock at the valuation, and all the book debts—we had a book to enter the stock we took in—Mr. Fletcher, Mr. Clements, and the prisoner were engaged in taking the stock; I looked at it occasionally—we put a valuation on the stock in hand and it was entered in the book—that was done in December, 1859—Mr. Clements and Mr. Fletcher are here to-day—they gave the account to the prisoner and he wrote it down—they took the cost price—at the beginning of that book there was an entry made on the debtor and creditor side; here it is—it is not torn out; it is in the state in which it originally was—it is the stock-taking book; it purports to describe all that was due to me, as well as all that I owed—this paper gives book debts 7,729<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and dividends 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that means dividends on the insolvent estates—I can't tell you on what estates dividends were due—there is the bdok, that will tell you—I received an old dividend the other day that was not in the book at all—it was from Oaks, of Croydon—this 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. dividend means that I was entitled to them myself—I had to receive them myself—on the other side here is bills, 5,326<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; open accounts 1,010<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and dividends 457<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that I had to pay—my bankers were Currie and Co.—I have been banking with them ever since I have been in business and before—here is my banker's pass-book—I very seldom looked in my banker's pass-book; in feet, I did not look in it for months together—from December, 1859, till 4th June, 1860, I don't think I looked in my banker's pass-book—the pass-book used to be at the bank for a month together, and I used to say to the prisoner, "Why do you keep it there?"—I did not look at it myself, but I wanted him to tell me whether it was correct—I think I could say that for six months I did not look at my banker's pass-book—I might just turn it over with the prisoner—I can't answer whether I several times looked at it—I left the whole business to the prisoner to manage—I did not go over the books frequently with him—I have looked at the cash-book occasionally and asked him what was the occasion of these balances, and why he did not send the money to the bank—the private ledger was not private to him; he had the key of it—I seldom had it in my possession—if there was occasion to look into it, I looked into it—I won't say that I did not take the key away, but the last time I got it was when he left—I won't deny that I took it home with me, but he had the key for a month together—I sometimes returned to town once a week, sometimes in a fortnight; but I have been out for a month together on a journey—I had two old cash-books, one was of 1858, one 1859, and a portion of 1860; the other began about May 12th—I wanted a new one, the previous one was in the safe, but it was used up—the last time I saw the two cash-books that I now miss, was about four or five days before he went away—I will swear I did not see them in the counting-house on the 4th of June, the same day that the prisoner left—I have never said that I saw them in my counting-house on the day the prisoner left—I swear I have not—I saw the duplicate pass-book within an hour of his leaving the counting-house—he left about 8 o'clock; I and he were together up to the very time that I left—he slammed the books into the iron safe which is fixed in the wall—it is not very small; it is pretty large—it could hold all the books that we were working with, and the old cash-book—I had a porter named Ellis—when the old books were out of use they were placed</p>

               <p>in a corner of the counting-house—all the books since 1858 were in the counting-house, and all those that were in use were put in the safe—I missed those three books the very moment I entered the counting-house and opened the safe; that was. on 5th June—I then missed the three books and a duplicate bill-book, where we entered all the bills that were sent out for acceptance; that was four books—I missed that book on the morning of the 5th when I came there—I discovered the loss of three books the instant I opened the safe—the prisoner did not complain to me of illness when he went away—he complained of a sore throat about Christmas, that was all—he said he was quite well again, and that he never had a doctor in his life—when I missed these books I did not know where the prisoner was gone—I sent a party to his house to get his address—I wrote a letter to him about the 10th or 11th June—I think I had not received a letter from him before I wrote that letter—I received only one letter from him; I can't tell whether it was before the 11th—a friend of mine wrote a letter to him at my dictation—I received from him a sort of rambling statement—after that I went down to Dumfries, but I went to different Magistrates to get a search warrant—I went to the Lord Mayor's Court and they told me it was not in their district, I had better go to Guildhall—I went to Guild<lb></lb>hall and they told me I had better go to Clerkenwell—I can't tell how many Magistrates I went before, before I went to Dumfries—I had not called mj creditors together in the meanwhile; I have not called them at all—a friend of mine told me to put my affairs in the hand of an accountant—I have never proposed to make a composition with my creditors; a friend of mine did—I had not been to Dumfries before that—I went to Norwich on a journey, and I telegraphed to know where he was; I sent a friend to nil house to know where he was gone to—I then went to Dumfries—the prisoner said he was ill—I sent a friend, Mr. McGowan, to go on and ask if he knew anything about these goods—I did not say to Mr. McGowan that all I complained of was the loss of one cash-book, I said all my cash-boob—I am sure I said that—I lost all but the one we were working with—whether I told him "book" or "books" I don't know—I think I told him I lost more than one cash-book, but I was so bothered about I don't know—I first complained that I had lost two cash-books at Guildhall—I was only at Dumfries one day; I left in the evening—I left Mr. McGowan to communicate with the prisoner—I asked him to make more inquiries—Mr. McGowan is not here—the last time I saw him was about the middle of the day, when I was at Dumfries—after I came to town I went to get a warrant, and the Alderman told roe I had better go and consult my solicitor—Mr. Catlin is my solicitor—I went to Guildhall; I got a warrant and read a statement, Mr. Catlin prepared it for me—Thomas Ellis, my porter, went up before I got that warrant—I telegraphed to Dumfries, and the prisoner left—I found he had gone to Edinburgh—I sent an officer down; I can't exactly say when, about the 22d, perhaps—I found the prisoner's brother was in a high position, he was the minister there—when the prisoner came into the employ of myself and Mr. McNarr, he did not bring any testimonials; he was recommended by a customer of mine—I employed him at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-week—there was a Mr. Bell who became security for him to the extent of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but that was some considerable time after—Mr. Forbes was treating for my business, but he did not buy it—he came to my counting-house—I recollect referring him to Mr. Johnstone to look at the books—I can't say whether Mr. Johnstone said anything that pleased or displeased Mr. Forbes—he did not make any remark—Johnstone was in the counting-house; I</p>

Q.</hi> How often did Mr. Wyllie come to town? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is impossible for me to say—he might be away a week, a fortnight, or a month, or five weeks—I have seen him look over the books, but I did not look over the books—I was occasionally sent to fetch the bank-book by Mr. Johnstone, sometimes when Mr. Wyllie was in town—I used to take it to the counting-house—it was a small book—when Mr. Wyllie was in town it was generally in the counting-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am not now in Mr. Wyllie's employ; I was his warehouseman and traveller—I and Mr. Johnstone were employed in taking stock in December—I really can't say whether Mr. Wyllie was there; he might be there, perhaps, in and out—Mr. Clements was not; he was not engaged at that time—I dare say we might have been a week about it—I had nothing to do with the entries; I had only to take the stock down as I wanted it, and give it to Mr. Johustone—I believe this is the book it was entered in—I don't know anything at all about this—I only gave the stock.</p>

               <p>Which would leave deficiency. £2,260 7 9 this is supposing the accounts of the prisoner to be correct—I then referred to the stock book, the bought ledger, what had been sold, and what was left in the warehouse, and I made the deficiency 2,261<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I am not able to account for the present defalcation—the prosecutor ought to have been perfectly solvent, and to have had a surplus of about 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if the missing cash-books had been there they would, if they had been properly kept, have assisted me in finding out how this deficiency arose.</p>

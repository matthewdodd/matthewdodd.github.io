Soon after I past by the Prisoner's Door, he came out with three or four People, and pursued Rich with a drawn Sword, and fluced the Link in his Face, and prick'd him in the Arm, and then prick'd the Deceas'd. After the Deceas'd was prick'd, Tom. Johnson tript up the Prisoner's Heels.</p>
               <p>John Rich. The Prisoner's Maid being within the Hatch, I flurried the Link over her Head, but did not thrust it into her Face, nor under her Coats. Then I went along about one hundred and fifty Yards, and the Prisoner came after me, but I was so surprised at his Sword that I cannot tell what was done, only that I was upon the Ground, and he was down after me. I received two Wounds in my Arm, and one of them as the Surgeon told me was three Inches deep; but I did not so much as know I was wounded at all, till half an Hour after I had been before the Justice.</p>

            . I was fifty Yards behind when Rich went by the Prisoner's Door. I saw no Maid, nor heard any Noise. But I saw Rich on the Ground and the Prisoner upon him, and striking at him with something. I went and kick'd up the Prisoner's Heels, and I pull'd up Jack Rich, and saw the Prisoner had got a Sword. The Deceas'd was then gone off. The Prisoner getting up again, prick'd me in the Thigh, and pushed me over a Ditch. Some of the Prisoner's Men came up, and I went round by the Bridge to the Deceas'd, and he told me the Prisoner had stabb'd him in the Breast.</p>

Neither he nor she said any thing, but he went along, and then the Prisoner with a drawn Sword ran by me to Rich, and up came Johnson. The Prisoner and Rich both tumbled. I was then ten or fifteen Yards from them, and the Deceas'd was behind me, and I am sure that Johnson did nothing to the Prisoner. And when Rich was taken away, the Deceas'd came to me, and said, the Prisoner had prick'd him.</p>

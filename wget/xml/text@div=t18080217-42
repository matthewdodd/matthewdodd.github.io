On the 15th instant, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was serving a customer in the warehouse; when our porter brought the prisoner up to me, he had the sugar in his apron; he denied having the sugar, and said the had not been in the warehouse. I asked him if the apron was his; he said it was; he said he met a man in the street whom he did not know who gave him the sugar; he had been to some other grocer he said.</p>

            . I am a porter to the prosecutor; the prisoner came in first and asked for a hogshead; I told him there was one outside of the house; then he went away; in about five minutes afterwards he came again, I was up stairs and at the time, I heard somebody come in the warehouse, I went down stairs to see who it was, I saw the prisoner standing at the hogshead.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing in the hogshead. - A. Yes, it was full of sugar. He held up his apron with one hand, and with the other he took the sugar and put it into his apron; I called to him and asked him what he was doing there, he made no answer, and went out of the warehouse; I followed him and collared him, he would not stop; I put my hand in his apron, I found a large lump of sugar; I asked him to bring the sugar back again to where he took it from, he said, no, I wont; I asked him three or four times, he would not; I went to see for one of my masters, then he got away; I went round the other way to meet him. When I came to the Red Lion coal wharf, I saw him go in the coal wharf with the sugar, then I stepped back a little and saw what he was doing, he untied his apron and hid the sugar in his apron in a dark corner of the coal wharf; I stopped till he came back, then I laid hold of him; I asked him where he put the sugar that he took out of the hogshead; he said he had no sugar; I said, came back with me, I will show you where you put it; I took him with me, and showed him the sugar, and then I brought him up to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BLUNT. I am a constable; I produce the sugar; it is moist sugar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lambert. That sugar is the same as we have in our warehouse; I compared it with the hogshead, it corresponded; there was the hole in the hogshead where it was taken from.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not get the sugar there, I got it from the hogsheads that I took from the sugar houses; the master where I live allows us the sugar for our perquisite.</p>

            . I have no interest in it now, I now attend the business of the shop as a servant, and I am allowed so much per week.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner at the bar do you know his person. - A. Very well, he came into the shop on Saturday the 25th of May, a quarter past eight in the evening, it was very light, he came in by himself, he asked me to look at some watches, I shewed him some silver watches, he objected to them, he asked me to shew him some gold ones which I did, he asked me the price, I told him the watch was marked twenty three pound, then he asked me to shew him a chain and a gold seal he said he would bargin with me for them altogether, I told him the price of them altogether was twenty-five pounds, he said he would give me twenty-three pounds for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the shop. - A. Not at that time no one besides himself. I said I would put it down on paper and if we did not lose by them he should have them as the stock was selling off under prime cost, he told me to put them together, I put them together the chain on the watch and the seal and key on the watch chain, I was inside of the counter and he outside, I came round the counter I was coming towards the door where he stood, I then gave him the watch into his hand, he put the watch up to his ear and said it did not go, I was then on the same side of the counter that he was, he moved back towards the door as near as he could and immediately bolted out of the door as hard as he could run, I ran after him crying stop thief, he had the watch and chain in his hand, he ran off immediately he got out of the door down in the middle of the street, I ran after him a fast as I could crying stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose there were a great many people in the street. - A. A great number, the pavement was so full he could not well run down the pavement, he ran as far as Craigs-court, about an hundred yards from our house he ran down there he was over taken and stopped, I saw him taken, he was knocked down by somebody and taken, I was not five yards from him the whole time; when he fell the outside case by this fall flew off, I saw the watch taken out of his hand when he was on the ground, a person laid hold of him by the collar and with the other hand he took the watch from him as he lay on the ground, I had hold of him at the time and the man that took the watch out of his hand gave it into mine, I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>

            . On the 25th of this month I saw the prisoner just after he got out of Mr. Yardley's shop, I believe it was about a quarter past eight, I heard the cry of stop thief, I perceived the prisoner at the bar was running, Mr. Hill and a young man was running after him, he was about ten yards from them, I saw the prisoner was gaining ground of Mr. Hill and that young man, I ran after him, he turned up Craigs-court, I and this young man followed him as he was turning about to the right I took him by the collar, I perceived the watch in his right hand, I took hold of the watch chain and seal from him all except the case which had fell, I asked the prosecutor what he had lost, he said a watch, I gave the watch to him, saying, this is it I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Mr. Yardley look at that watch. - A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290058"></xptr>have examined it, I know it by the mark, the cost price, and it has got my name on it, it is my property.</p>

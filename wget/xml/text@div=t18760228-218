                  <hi rend="italic">to quash the inquisition on the ground that it did not contain the true finding of the Coroner's Jury. What they had found was that the parties guilty of the alleged manslaughter were the "owner or owners" of certain property by whose negligence the deceased was said to have met her death. The Coroner, from subsequent inquiries, had inserted the name of the defendant in the inquisition as the supposed owner of the said property, and upon that state of facts he contended that the inquisition was bad in the substance of the charge and ought to be quashed.</hi> Mr. Baron Cleasby <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that he could not dispose of the matter in the preliminary mode suggested. The inquisition on the face of it was regular, and there was nothing to show that it was not properly and intentionally signed by the Coroner and the Jury whose names were appended to it.</hi>

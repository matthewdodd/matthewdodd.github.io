               <p>Court. Did they say any thing when they were apprehended? - No, only they were very angry with the others when they run away, they said d - n their eyes, if it was not too far, I should have had them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe they told you they picked up those things in the park? - I heard them tell Sir Sampson that they found them, but not where.</p>
               <p>Whether these things were taken from any body by robbery, or whether the persons that had them, had been put to the scout, you cannot tell? - No.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 440). On 19th Dec. I was on duty in Upton Road, West Ham—I heard a noise in a cattle shed, and saw two men on the roof, and a third man standing close by who struck me with a stick, I think, and escaped—the prisoner was one of the two on the roof, he came to me with his fist raised to strike me and I drew my cutlass—they then ran away—I followed closely behind the prisoner till he came to the fence, when I took him—I found on him this broken bladed knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it appears to be used for ripping up lead, this corner is very sharp—I went back to the shed and discovered about 1cwt. of lead removed, and about 1/2 cwt. doubled up—the lead had covered the roof, but it was all removed—it is now laid down again in the same position, but here is a little piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the value of the whole which was removed was 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutors employ. I was awoke by the policeman's rattle, at about half past 3 o'clock in the morning; I got up and found a lot of lead, two large sheets removed from the cattle shed—this is part of it, and is my master's property—none was carried away—I had seen it safe the day before.</p>

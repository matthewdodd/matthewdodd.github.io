               <p>JOSEPH PUNTER. On the 21st of April I left my horse and gig at the door of the <placeName id="t18280529-109-crimeloc598">Queen's Head and Artichoke public-house, Albany-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did you see the prisoner meddle with the coat at all? A. He had hold of part of it while it was on the other man's shoulder; I am certain he is the person who was with the other.</p>

            . I am the publican. The prosecutor said, he had lost his coat - I followed him out, and ran in another direction; and found the prisoner in a cellar of a house, in Osnaburg-street, about a quarter of a mile from the place where I first saw the person running.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he was not running when you took him? A. No; I cannot say he is the man who took the coat - I did not see his face; but from his stature and clothes, I judge him to be the man I first saw running; I told him I wanted him to come back to the public-house where he had taken the coat - he said, he had not.</p>

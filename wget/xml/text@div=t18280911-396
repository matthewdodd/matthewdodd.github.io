On Monday, the 8th of September, I saw the prisoner come to my house, where he had slept for a week with the prosecutor - he came that morning about half-past eight - he had a large bundle with him; I asked him for my rent - he said he had no money, but would come in the afternoon and pay it, but I never saw him again; he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110181"></xptr>no property there, except a shirt - Wilkins missed the property the next morning.</p>

               <p>MRS. HANNAH WRIGHT re-examined. Q. Was there anybody there but the prisoner on Monday? A. No, there are other persons who live up stairs, but they never come into my place - they could have got in; the parlour door is sometimes open, but the street-door has always been shut.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Monday morning, I got up at half-past eight o'clock, and when I came out of my room I brought away my dirty things; I had put my clean ones on - I had a black waistcoat, one pair of Angola stockings and one pair of clean white ones, and two handkerchiefs; they were tied up in a loose red shawl; my landlady had pressed me for the rent; I did not return; when this man came up to me, I said I would go anywhere, and I went to the Crown and Sceptre, and staid there an hour and a half; I then came out, and met the constable.</p>

            . The prisoner came into a house where I was, about two hundred yards from Mrs. Young's house, about ten minutes after she had lost her money; he bid me 5 s. for my wig I have now on, and wanted me to give him 3 d. out of a quarter guinea, which he had in his hand.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. He was looking over some stockings and a hat belonging to a woman; she did say he offered her that money, but that was after I had lost mine. He denied having any money when he was taken, but he was searched before Sir

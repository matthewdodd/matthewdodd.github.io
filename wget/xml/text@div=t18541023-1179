                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in High-street, Lewisham On 14th Oct. I was in my back parlour—I had been in my shop two or three minutes before—I had seen my till safe the moment before I passed into my back parlour—there was about 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my till, a half sovereign, and some shillings and sixpences—there is a glazed door between the parlour and the shop—I looked through and saw the prisoner lying across the counter—I went out and caught him with a sixpence in each hand, and his right hand was near my till—he asked for some tobacco—I said, "You are after my till"—he said, "No I am not"—I said, "What have you got in your hand? he said, "A sixpence, the only one I have got"—I said, "What have you in the other hand?"—he said, "Nothing"—I took his hand, and there was another sixpence in that—I went round to my till and he ran away—I ran and caught him—he said, "If you will let me go, I will show you where I threw the half sovereign"—he took me to a place where he said he threw it, but it appears there was a man and woman who had been seen to pick up some money.</p>

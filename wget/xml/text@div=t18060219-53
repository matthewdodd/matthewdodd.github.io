               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes; he was in the employ of Messrs. Quinton and Co. he was a <rs id="t18060219-53-deflabel294" type="occupation">plate-glass polisher</rs>

I reported it to the foreman, and kept the glass in my possession; these are the squares of glass, they are the property of Messrs. Quinton and Co. they are a peculiar species of glass, made for the royal navy.</p>

               <p>Q.(to Stamford) When you took this glass from the prisoner, did he say he took it up by mistake. - A. No, he said he had nothing, when I said what have you got.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that was not the glass that was given him. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did they lay near where these lay. - A. No, quite in another place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">stated, that he would put in evidence any part of the days proceedings which the Court thought just, but at present would confine himself to the Defend<lb></lb>ant's evidence.) The witness then read the evidence, as follows:</hi> "Mr. Jere<lb></lb>miah Smith having been sworn, was examined by Mr. Merewether, as follows: I believe you live either in Rye or its neighbourhood? In the parish of Rye—I believe you interest yourself in elections at Rye? Cer<lb></lb>tainly.—Possibly you may have shared in the general regret at Mr. Cur<lb></lb>teis's resignation? I did at the time.—That regret was mitigated possibly at finding you were to have an admirable substitute, Mr. Mackinnon? Exactly.—I must venture to ask you, was there a period before you were quite off with the old love at Rye and on with the new? I beg your pardon.—Was there a period when you were hardly off with the old love and quite on with the new? Yes, there was.—Before Mr. Curteis had quite retired, and before Mr. Mackinnon was quite a candidate? Yes, there was some time between.—Let me bring your recollection to the 2nd of July; were you present at a dinner? Yes.—Given by Mr. Curteis; it was very kind of Mr. Curteis giving a dinner? Very.—You attended? I did.—Possibly you may have heard of it before it took place? I did.—Were you surprised to see Mr. Mackinnon present at it? Not at all—A dinner does not get into a booth of itself; may I venture to ask you if you know who ordered the dinner? I did.—Mr. Lancaster has told us that he helped eat it, and Mr. Davie also, and others; so that we have now the orderer of the dinner and the eaters, and then there is the important part, the reckoning; do you happen to know who paid for it? I did.—Was it supplied by one person? By one; I made my contract with one person.—Your principal contract was with one; do you happen to know whether there were sub-Contractors? I am satisfied he called in three others to his assistance; he stated at the time he should not be able to supply it, he thought, wholly himself.—Therefore, you are pretty con<lb></lb>fident that he called in three sub-contractors; did they happen also to be publicans? Yes, of course.—That seems to be a phrase at Rye, "of course;" you took your bill to whom? I beg your pardon.—With reference to the ultimate payment, you ordered it for Mr. Curteis? Yes.—You took the bill to whom? To myself, and paid myself.—What did you say to yourself, if I may venture to say so, when you took the bill to yourself? I had an authority from Mr. Curteis to pay the bill—And you told yourself all about the authority, and paid it? I exercised myself upon that Authority.—In any further communication which you have had with yourself has Mr. Curteis paid the bill to you? I beg your pardon.—Has Mr. Curteis repaid you? He has not.—He has retired from the representation, we know? Yes.—And another gentleman at the close of the election reigned in his stead? Exactly so.—Mr. Curteis has not paid that bill; may I venture to ask you, as by the list handed in, you act as agent for Mr. Mackinnon, are Mr. Mackinnon's bills paid? I do not know; I had nothing to do with the paying of any of the bills.—Then, as far as you know, those things are unpaid; but you.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270077"></xptr>
               <p>know, as a fact, that this, though paid by you, is not repaid la you? I do. <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COMMITTEE</hi>. Not repaid to you by any one? By Mr. curteis, nor anybody.—It has not been repaid to you by anybody? No, it has not been repaid. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MEREWETHER</hi>. We have been told by Mr. Davie, that Mr. curteis invitations were in Mr. Mackinnon's Committee-room? They might have been.—He says he is quite sure they were? I think they were sent there to me; I ordered them to be printed, and they were sent there to me; I had the authority from Mr. Curteis; he wrote his own note, and from that note I had it printed, and they were sent to me in a bundle in the Committee-room; at least in the room where we assembled to carry on the election.—To carry on whose election? Mr. Mackinnon's.—They were directed to parties from that room? I think they were, some of them; but the principal part were taken away to the George, and directed there under my superintendence.—And there were some that were directed from the Committee-room? I think some of the friends took some few of the notes, and directed them from there; I think they did to the best of my recollection.—Some of your friends took upon themselves to direct the notes there? To invite some of their own friends.—Then the invitations did not proceed direct from Mr. Curteis? They did; they proceeded direct from Mr. Curteis to me, and then he begged me to take the list of his friends to carry out, and some of our friends who were in the room begged to invite some of their friends to come, and I gave them permission.—Then it was a blank warrant for a dinner from Mr. Curteis, with liberty to yourself and other gentlemen to fill them up? No; Mr. Curteis gave me the full authority to give the general invite, and therefore, what I did there was done by my own act and deed.—That is in point of fact the case, is it not, that Mr. Curteis gave you authority to have the dinner, and to act according to your own act and deed with the dinner? I No; he did not; he did not say I was to do so, or not to do so, but he gave me authority to send out the invitations.—That is what I mean? Yes.—There are two views of things at Bye, I suppose, like other places? Upon what points?—Upon points of politics? Decidedly.—Were the invitations directed to both sides of politics, or did they hap<lb></lb>pen to take one? Quite indiscriminately; many without any votes at all—no distinction as to party at all.—Of those that accepted, which party do you think predominated? That I can scarcely answer you.—Try. I should suppose that the liberal party predominated; that is merely a sup<lb></lb>position—For instance, we will test the sentiments of the majority; the meat and those things were discussed, and then there was, as Mr. Lan<lb></lb>caster tells us, port and sherry afterwards: Did Mr. Mackinnon address the meeting? He did.—Did he indicate liberal opinions? He did—Was that indication favourably received by the majority? It was; by the whole party.—You would possibly deduce from that, that the large majority of the party agreed with Mr. Mackinnon in opinion? I have nothing else to guide me but that.—However, there was that unanimous assent to Mr. Mackinnon's views which makes you think that the attendants were chiefly liberal? Yes.—You say that these invitations were at the Red Lion; were there other gentlemen at the Bed lion, as Mr. Davie has told us, besides yourself? Yes; many.—The gentlemen who managed Mr. Mackin<lb></lb>non's election? Yes.—You say that some friends of yours directed some of these letters; were those persons to whom I am referring the managers of Mr. Mackinnon's election? They begged to be allowed to invite some of their friends.—Those friends probably were of the liberal view? I do not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270078"></xptr>
               <p>know at all; I do not know to whom they sent them either.—Were you safe as to the senders' views, the gentlemen who directed them? They were our friends; they were our liberal friends; I do not think we should send them to the enemy's camp.—Then I think the probabity is, that if Mr. Mackinnon's Committee directed the letters, they were most of them sent to Mr. Mackinnon's friends? I did not think it necessary to question them; there was no mistake about that. <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COMMITTEE</hi>. Do you consider Mr. Mackinnon responsible to you in respect of that dinner? Certainly not.—Either on employment or in any other way? None; I have never received a shilling.—You have not received a shilling from anybody, I understand? I No; and I have not even seen Mr. Mackinnon's money, nor has he ever pro<lb></lb>mised me a farthing.—Whom do you look to, to be remunerated for that dinner? Mr. Curteis.—During the period that Mr. Curteis was the member for Rye, did you act as his agent? Yes, I did.—Did his election expenses pass though your hands? Yes, they did.—Have you been in the habit of making payments for Mr. Curteis? Yes, many years; all the time this young man has sat in the House, and his father before him.—Have you applied to Mr. Curteis for payment of the expenses of this dinner? No; Mr. Curteis and I have an open, unsettled account.—When do you expect to receive payment? Whenever it is convenient to him; I am not particular myself; it is not an object to myself—Of what nature is that open account with Mr. Curteis? is it an account for expenses, or an account for private transactions? I am a tenant; and private transactions; both; his rent is credited on the one side, and there are debits on the other.—Are you his private agent, as well as his election agent? No, I am not.—How often do you come to a settling with Mr. Curteis? Once in one, two, or three years, according to his convenience.—Are you now referring to the expenses of preceding elections? His expenses have been nothing; not the present young man; he has been returned twice, and a petition was lodged against him, which was declared as vexatious, and the expenses were thrown all upon the petitioners to pay; and I should think his whole expenses (I am speaking now from memory) were something less than. 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till he was petitioned against, as I have already stated.—Were you speaking of the young Mr. Curteis when you mentioned the open account? Yes.—Then if you are not Mr. Curteis's private agent, and Mr. Curteis has had no election expenses, of what nature is this open account? Kent and charities, and things of that sort, which he subscribes to.—That is one side, and what on the other? Rent on the one, and subscriptions of a variety of kinds on the other; rates and one thing and the other, which I pay for land which he has in the parish very many times, and many charities to which he subscribes, which I pay for him.—If you are in the habit of paying his local rates and his local charities, what do you mean by telling the Committee that you are no private agent for him? If you term that a private agent, I have an open account with him of that nature.—If an agent pays for his principal his local rates, do you consider that in the nature of an election account? Certainly not.—Do you consider it in the nature, in any degree, of a public account? No; it is a private running account between him and me, as landlord and tenant.—Then why did you tell the Committee that you had no private account with him? I have already stated I am a tenant; I give credit for the rent on the one side, and the different payments on the other: it is a private account between him and me, most assuredly, as land-lord and tenant.—For what land are these rates paid? For lands in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270079"></xptr>
               <p>parish of Rye, principally.—Whose lands? His: in his own occupation, some.—Why do you pay them? Because it is more convenient to get it from me than it is from him.—Are you a solicitor? No; I am a former.—Then what do you mean by saying you are not an agent, if you pay all his local rates? Not all; only a very small portion.—Them if it is a very small portion, to what extent is this open account? I cannot tell at all what my account may be; I cannot speak off-hand; perhaps 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have no desire to inquire into Mr. Curteis's private affairs, excepting" as they are connected with this public inquiry; but after what you have said, I must ask you how does that account now stand? He is in my debt—To what extent? It may be 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I will not say; something less than that—How much did the dinner cost? 226<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—And Mr. Curteis now only owes you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? Something less than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should think it was—Then how was it that you stated that you had not been paid for the dinner? I have not been paid; only my running account: I have an open account with Mr. Curteis.—What is the amount of each of the two sides of that account at this time? I should say about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I am speaking now entirely from memory.—On which side would the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. be? The 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be on the credit side, and the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be on the debit side: I am speaking now entirely from memory.—How long have you been in the habit of paying these charities and rates for Mr. Curteis? Ever since he has paid them, and for his father before him.—How long is it that Mr. Cur<lb></lb>teis has paid? This young gentleman?—Yes. Ever since the death of the father.—How long is that? I do not know how many years he has been dead; five or six, I should think: I really do not know when he died.—Was not Mr. Curteis returned in 1847 at the general election? Yes, he was.—The young man? No, the old gentleman; the father. I think, if I am not mistaken, that Mr. Curteis, the late member, was returned in 1848 first; I really can<lb></lb>not be positive.—What is the amount of these charities which you pay annually for Mr. Curteis? I really cannot tell you.—Have you no idea from memory what the amount is? They may be 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; I really cannot tell you off hand.—You think 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year? I should think 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year might be something like the amount but I really cannot say, because they vary according to his instructions.—Did you say that Mr. Mackinnon's bills had been paid 1 I do not know anything about them.—Do you know who paid them? I think Mr. Butler, but I am not sure as to that; a portion of them; I think he paid the printing, and so on; but that I cannot speak to of my own knowledge.—You have no knowledge of it? No. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MEREWETHER</hi> (<hi rend="italic">through the Committee</hi>), As a fact, was this 2nd of July after the teste of the writ? The writ arrived in Rye on the 3rd of July. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WELSBY</hi> stated that the teste of the writ was the 30th of June. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SMITH</hi>. We have always been given to understand that the teste of the writ was when the Mayor had received it and signed it, and whatever occurred we were in total ignorance but what that was the law."</p>

I received a bundle of money from Mr. Reeves, which I learned afterwards was from Mr. Mackinnon. I had no idea of saying what I did, till I made one false step; that compelled me to make a second, which I have been very much grieved about ever since; it has very much relieved my mind to have an opportunity of contradicting what I originally stated. I regret exceedingly that I should have said what I did: it was from a great desire to screen Mr. Mackinnon from the trans<lb></lb>actions; I do not know any other reason why I should do it. I feel exceedingly sorry that I did it. I should have made the same statement last Thursday which I have now made, had the subject been referred to.

I keep the George, at Bye, and did so on 3rd July, 1852, the time of the election—I do not know anything of a bundle of notes, but I was paid, by Mr. Smith, something between 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bank notes, a day or two after the dinner—you see it is some time ago now, and I never kept an account—Mr. Smith ordered the dinner.</p>

He farther urged, that the first Count of the indictment stated that the Chairman of the Committee was appointed by the General Committee. Now, that was not the regular mode of appointment: he ought to have been appointed from the Chairman's panel, the General Committee of Elections having nothing to do with selecting the Chairman; therefore the tribunal was improperly constituted; and the second Count, being more general, contained no proof of it; that there was no proof that fourteen days 'notice of the time and place of choosing the Com<lb></lb>mittee had been given, as required by the</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th and</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">th Vic, c</hi> 98, <hi rend="italic">sec</hi>, 51; <hi rend="italic">and, lastly, that the allegation in the indictment that the defendant said that he never received the amount of a shilling on account of the dinner, was not proved; because his words must be taken, in connection with the mode in which the questions were put, to mean that he never received a shilling in any other way, or in any other employment, than for the dinner; therefore, it was quite clear that he was not paying with his own money (referring to Rex, v.

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of the Midland Railway Company—in consequence of directions I received I watched the trains upon the railway between Camden Road and Kentish Road Stations, and on the 29th June, in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come from the direction of Camden Town to the Kentish Town Station—there is a bridge over the railway at Cavendish Street, and there is a tunnel in sight of that bridge—as soon as the prisoner saw the smoke from the engine pass the tunnel he picked up a stone and threw it at the train—the stone was about the size of a hen's egg—he was about fifteen yards from me—I caught him, and told him I should take him for throwing the stone—he said he was very sorry, and would not do it again if I would let him go—I told him I could not do so, and I gave him into custody—many of the trains have been struck by stones thrown in that way—I saw a window broken—I did not see it actually broken, but after it was broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, of No. 38, Fleet-street. On the evening of 30th Jan., about 6 o'clock, I was in Fleet-street—I stood for a few seconds at a window, looking at a placard—it was nearly opposite the police station, a little further up than St. Bride's Church—while I was there I felt something move at my left hand waistcoat pocket; there were several other persons apparently looking in at the window at the same time—immediately I felt the movement in my pocket I turned to my left, and the prisoner was right in front of me, and I saw his hand go from my waistcoat pocket, and the chain was hanging down—it was his left hand, it was clenched—he put it behind him—when I felt something pass from my pocket I immediately heard a click, as though a pair of pincers had clipped my chain through—I immediately seized him by the throat, a gentleman undertook to go for a policeman, and I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the prisoner into a passage close by until the policeman came—I charged him at once with stealing my watch—he said, "I have not got your watch, you may search me if you like"—the policeman came, and took him away—this is the chain I wore</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185602040002"></xptr>
               <p>on that occasion, it was not cut; the bore of the watch was twisted off—I have never got the watch again—this ring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) belongs to it—the policeman produced it to me next morning—I had felt my watch safe a few minutes before; I am quite sure that I felt it go at that moment.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 344). I took the prisoner into custody—there were a few people round the door, not a great many—I searched him, but found nothing on him but a knife—about ten minutes afterwards I went back to the place where I had taken him, searched the place, and picked up this ring in front of the shop, by the pavement—I asked the pri<lb></lb>soner where he lived; he gave no address—he said he lived at a coffee shop in the Westminster-road, but he did not know the name of the party, nor the number—he offered to be searched.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was read, as follows</hi>: "I was standing at the shop, and the gentleman looked round and said he had lost his watch, and he accused me of stealing it, I being the nearest to him, and I voluntarily went into the shop to be searched."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was standing alongside the gentleman, and he turned round and said he had lost his watch; I said I had no watch, and had nothing to do with it; I voluntarily went into the shop to be searched; the gentleman said I had no chance to pass it to anybody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. I did not observe the prisoner until I turned round—I did not see any person go away, I was too busily engaged—there was one or two persons behind him, but I did not observe who they were, nor what became of them—I am certain I distinctly felt the watch go out of my pocket, and I distinctly heard the click as I saw his two hands go from my waistcoat pocket—I saw both his hands quite close to my waistcoat pocket, his left hand was closed.</p>

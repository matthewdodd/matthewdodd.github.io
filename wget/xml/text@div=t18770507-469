                  </hi> Clifford. I am manager to Alfred May, corn merchant, of Greenwich—On Saturday, 7th April, I sent Barber who is the carman to take forty—five trusses of hay and trefoil to Mr. Musgrave's, at East Green<lb></lb>wich—I gave him a delivery—note; I wrote it myself—I counted the trusses and could see he had forty—six but was not certain that he had forty—seven—I asked him how many he had—he said forty—five—I followed the van—I then went to Turner's place in Roan Street, and asked for the money for some trusses he had taken away on the Thursday, previous to Good Friday—he said that he had not any <hi rend="italic">pieces</hi>, meaning money, but would call and pay me—on coming away I noticed some loose trefoil on the pavement—I made enquiries and then went back to Turner's and said "My man has been here has he not?"—he said "Yes"—I said "And delivered you two trusses of stuff"—he said that he had—I said "Where are they?"—he pointed and said "Here"—I said "How came you to take these trusses knowing there is nothing ordered, and you know I have refused to deliver you any trusses, or to trust you, you pay for the trusses you had on the Thursday, and I shall lock the man up for stealing these"—he said "I hope you will think nothing more about it"—I then left—he had not mentioned the trusses when I called on him first—the trusses of trefoil are mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Barber</hi>. I am sure I asked you how many trusses you had, and you said forty—five—I was standing outside when you came out with the load—I did not tell you to take some to make up weight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATHEWS</hi>. I did not trust Turner, he took the trusses away—I cannot tell the exact date without my books—what I said before the Magistrate is correct—Turner had formerly dealt with Mr. May and paid him—what he had fetched on the Thursday he had not paid for—I will swear he did not meet me and ask if I would let him have a couple of trusses—he owed us 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—goods have been sent without a ticket, but the ticket has been sent afterwards—when I saw the trusses I asked Turner if he had paid for them—he said he had not—he did not say that that was not the stuff he ordered and that he had ordered clover, till afterwards.</p>

On Saturday, April 7th, I accom<lb></lb>panied Clifford to Turner's house, at Greenwich—I told him he would be charged with receiving two trusses of trefoil, knowing it to have been stolen—he turned to Mr. Clifford and said "I thought you sent it to me"—Mr. Clifford said "You could not think that; you know I refused to trust you, and I never send small orders out; if you thought I sent it where is the ticket?"—Turner said "Your man had a ticket in his hand at the time"—I then took him to the station.</p>

There was a further conversation about some stuff Turner had taken on a previous day, and had not paid for and Mr. Clifford said "You never inentiened a word to me when I came previously, about these two trusses of trefoil being left here; you know you; never ordered any"—I think I mentioned before the Magistrate what was said about small orders—I also said "I saw you yesterday"—I remember the word "straw" being mentioned, but not "clover."</p>

I have been in his ser<lb></lb>vice two years, and this is the first charge against me.

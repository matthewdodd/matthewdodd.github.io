On the 23d of October, at half-past six o'clock, I left this property safe in my drawer - my sister came to me about half-past eleven o'clock, and gave me information; I came home, and missed my property - I found it in eight or ten days; this property is mine - the waistcoat had a mark of S. M. on the back, but it is not here now. After the prisoner was in custody somebody brought the coat to my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were your trousers lined? A. No, but they are new. I have no private mark on them, but am certain of them.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's mother. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070057"></xptr>The prisoner looked at some lodgings which we had to let, on the 20th, and came on Tuesday, the 24th, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning; he left, and returned in half an hour, with a bundle, went up-stairs, and I heard him go out in about ten minutes. I then went up-stairs, and found some straw in the front room, into which I had taken him: there was none there then. In about an hour I missed these articles - my son wore them the night before; he did not return to the lodging, but I found him at Hatton-garden on the Thursday week - I believe him to the same man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen him on the 20th? A. No; I will not swear to him.</p>

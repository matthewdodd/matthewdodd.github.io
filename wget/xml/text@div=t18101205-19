               <p>Q. Had you any considerable sum of money in your house before the 6th of November - A. I had received an hundred pound on the over night of Mr. Buckley one fifty pound, a forty pound, and a ten; I put them in my pocket to the best of my knowledge, and went out that evening to meet a person, I staid till about half past ten o'clock; after I came home I went to bed, and they remained in my pocket till the next morning as usual, since I have been in business; I took the money out of my pocket, and put them in a drawer without looking at them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not look to see whether the forty pound was there - A. No. On the 25th, in consequence of something that I heard, I went to my drawer, I refered to my cash account, I could not find I had paid away a forty pound note to my creditors; then I looked at my drawer, I could not find the forty pound note that I had received on the 5th; I had not taken the number of the forty pound note, nor any particular mark. They were all clean notes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mears. You had received exactly as hundred pound - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And I think you told us that you went out on that evening - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore as you supposed that you took all this money out you might have dropped the forty pound note for what you know - A. It might be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to recollect whether you had more forty pound notes than one - A. I do not recollect that I had.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear positively that you had no other forty pound note - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you kept no number nor any particulars of the note - A. No.</p>

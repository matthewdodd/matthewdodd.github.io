                  </hi> I am a merchant, and used to can on business in Hunter Street, but have now removed to Regent Square—I know Mr. De Partu, of Union Court, Old Broad Street, and Mr. Woods, of Shepton Mallett—in the month of February last I undertook to provide some foreign bills for the accommodation of Mr. Woods to the amount of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner is a commission agent, and resided in the Tredegar Road, Bow—I saw him on the subject in the City—I said to him, "A gentleman of a very good firm wants about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his accommodation, and I am sure they will be paid if you can procure them"—he said yes, he could—I did not tell him the name of the firm, but I said I believed a member of Parliament was a partner in it—some days after I met the prisoner at the corner of New Broad Street, opposite Union Court—I think it was the 15th or 16th February—he gave me some bills—I do not remember whether there were five or six—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are two of them—I had to pay him 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as commission for getting the bills—I gave him a cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and 1 took the bills—I have known the prisoner ten or eleven years, and I thought they were all right—I went to Mr. Woods, who was waiting in Mr. De Partu's office in Union Court, and gave them to him—he gave me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you did not mention the name of the firm; can you tell mo how the prisoner filled in "Pay to the order of Messrs. J. E. Woods and Co.? "<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know how he got that—I told him he should make them out payable to the order of Messrs. Woods—the prisoner did not tell me where ho got the bills from at that time, but he did after he was in custody—in consequence of something I heard, I gave the prisoner into custody, and at the police-station in Bow Lane he said he had not written the bills, but. that he had got them from a Mr. Stevens, or Stovens—I did not ask him what Mr. Stoves was—I signed the charge-sheet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have been asked as to whether you heard any<lb></lb>thing; you heard that you would be given into custody, did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard that Mr. Woods was making inquiries about the bills, and I went to Messrs. Lewis and Lewis, and under their advice I gave the' prisoner into custody—if the prisoner got them from somebody else he would have to pay commission also—he told me he had to pay so much commission for getting them—I do not know how much he said—the bill is accepted by Parker and Co.—I knew Parker byname before I saw him—he has been a merchant—he was known as being in the habit of accepting bills for accommodation—I stated before the Magistrate that he had been known to accept bills for half a crown. (<hi rend="italic">The Court here directed the Jury to acquit the prisoner, as this witness's evidence was not reliable.</hi>)</p>

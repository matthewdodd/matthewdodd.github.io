On Tuesday, the 8th of April, I searched Sale's house at Chingford, in Essex, and there found the articles stated—the greater portion were in a box in a bed-room—it was not locked—no person was in the house—I know it to be Sales—I have known her five years—I afterwards went to Woodford, and found Sales at the house of a Mrs. Witherby, washing—I took her into custody, took her to Chingford, took the articles out of the box, showed them to her, and asked if that was the property I had alluded to on the road—she said that was the property, but it was not hers, it was her brother's, and he had sent them to her to take care of—I asked where her brother lived—she said she did not know, he had gone travelling—I asked his name—she said, "Perkiss"—she afterwards said his name was Turner Perkiss, and that he lived at No. 15, Cold-harbour, Blackwall—I went to Blackwall that evening, and from inquiries, went to the West India Dock tavern, saw Mr. Lovegrove, and showed him some of the things—he called Perkiss in—I showed him the portion of the property I had brought with me, and</p>

               <p>asked if he knew it, and if he had at any time sent any portion of that property to a Mrs. Sales, at Chingford to be taken care of—he said he hid not—I asked him about Mrs. Sales being his sister—he said she was—I searched the house in Cold-harbour next morning, but found nothing.</p>

I have the management of the West India Dock tavern, for Samuel Lovegrove and others, the trustees of the late Samuel Lovegrove—Perkiss frtfs been a servant there for about three years, and in the family a number of years—I have examined all these articles in the box—they are the property, of, Samuel Lovegrove and others—I know them well—the china has our private mark on it, "W. I. D. T.," for West India Dock Tavern—Perkiss had no authority to take them away—the knives and forks are such as we had in use.</p>

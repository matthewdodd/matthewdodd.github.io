                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Muggeridge, and live at Plumstead—on the afternoon of 19th May, I was at my sister's house—the last witness was just leaving the door and I saw the prisoner and another man, with a black coat, pass me, I looked after them and saw the roll of black cloth project from the bottom of the other man's coat—the prisoner was on his left hand, and kept looking over his shoulder—they were exchanging words, but I could not hear what—the prisoner assisted the other to raise the cloth up, to hide the part that was projecting—as I walked towards my home I saw them at the Hollows; that is a place where there is no thoroughfare, except into people's yards, they were just leaving the Hollows, and came out again to the opening where I was, there is a hedge there with an old paling—they came down, and the prisoner asked the other to come a little further this way—the other said, "No, let us go back"—I heard that—as they were arguing the prosecutor, Mrs. Hyder, and my sister came up—my sister picked the cloth up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have not told us that the cloth was thrown down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As soon as they saw them come up they dropped the cloth and exchanged some words which I could not hear—the words I have told you occurred before the others got to them—I mentioned those words to the Magistrate—after they had passed me I went behind them, within half a minute—I lost sight of them just half a minute while I was turning round to ask my brother for the key of the door—the Hollows is about one minute's walk, I should think, from my sister's house—I saw my sister run to the left to tell the prosecutor, and I went to the right, immediately, up to the Hollows—I saw no other person about the Hollows, except some boys at a distance—I noticed no one standing at the corner—I did not take particular notice when my sister picked the bundle up; I walked with her to see it taken home, not to her own home—one of the witnesses minded the cloth till they brought the prisoner back—my sister carried the cloth, the prosecutor's wife and the last witness followed—I am quite sure that one man that passed, had a black coat on, and the other a light one.</p>

               <p>—it stuck about eighteen inches below his coat; when he got about half-way down the street, I saw the prisoner assist him by giving the cloth a push up, as it seemed to be slipping down, and too gnat a weight for him—I went with Mrs. Alsford to the prosecutor's house, and went in pursuit of the men—we took a different direction to that which they had taken—we went round the house and met them in, what we call, the Hollows—the other man dropped the cloth and ran with all his might the way he had come—the prisoner turned and came towards us, and said, "The b—ought to be locked up."</p>

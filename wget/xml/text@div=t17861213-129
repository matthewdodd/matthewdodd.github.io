               <p>I am footman to Mrs. Nesbitt; these are the property of Mrs. Nesbitt; I know them well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Is that the old livery? - This is his proper livery at this time.</p>
               <p>Then this was the newest? - It was.</p>
               <p>How long had he been in the family? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How long have you been there? - Nine months this last time, but I have been in the family fourteen years; he had been a year and half next month; he is paid up to that time.</p>
               <p>When was this livery to become his property according to custom? - We have no regular custom.</p>
               <p>When would he have had a new livery? - When my mistress thought proper to give us one.</p>
               <p>When do you think that would have been? - I cannot say for my mistress's disposition.</p>
               <p>How long had it been worn? - I cannot say how often he wore it.</p>
               <p>How long had it been made? - About fourteen months.</p>
               <p>How long have you wore your last livery? - I wear my own clothes.</p>
               <p>Does Mrs. Nesbitt give her livery once a year, or in two years, or in seven years? - It is at her pleasure.</p>
               <p>Does a man wear his livery coat and box coat, two years in her service? - Most familie do.</p>
               <p>Does Mrs. Nesbitt do so? - I dare say she does.</p>
               <p>Were these clothes in wear when you came into her service last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And for some time before? - I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any instance of which this man's honesty was tried, besides that of shooting a man? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect a circumstance of a gentleman's coming there and sleeping at Norwood, and leaving any bank notes in his chariot? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who found them? - Them that had no business to look for them.</p>
               <p>Who found them? - The coachman.</p>
               <p>Was it not the prisoner at the bar, says he, Mr. Moore, here are some bank notes I found in the chariot? - The chariot was on a journey; he did not clean it; I suppose he looked into the chariot through curiosity.</p>
               <p>Do you know the amount of these? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Were there several hundred pounds? - Not several, two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Were there some hundred pounds? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard there was some hundred pounds worth? - I did not hear what the sum was.</p>
               <p>Did not he deliver them to you for the benefit of the owner of the carriage? - He did.</p>
               <p>Where had that carriage stood all night? - Opposite to our coach-house door in the common yard.</p>
               <p>Was that after your stables were once robbed after the man was shot? - It was; the gentleman had been brought there by post-boys.</p>
               <p>Did your mistress esteem him as a very honest fellow? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If he had been disposed to have robbed Mrs. Nesbitt, could he not have done it? - Yes, he certainly might.</p>
               <p>Such a livery as that you get very little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130164"></xptr> for? - I suppose the whole lot would not fetch more than twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Where did he say that he got the bank notes from? - From the inside of the carriage.</p>
               <p>Did you see the gentleman to whom the Bank notes were restored? - I delivered them myself.</p>
               <p>Was the coachman there? - No, he was in the house.</p>

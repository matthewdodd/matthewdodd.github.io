                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110073"></xptr>in the Strand; do you remember seeing the prisoner Howes in the month of November? - A. It was the last week in November; he came to buy some goods he said for a friend of his at Portsmouth that was going to the West-Indies; he desired me to be quick, for the ship was going off.</p>
               <p>Q. What direction did he give you? - A. He gave me this kind of a card. (Shews the card.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send the things? - A. I did in the course of three days.</p>
               <p>Q. When he called upon you what then passed? - A. He gave me a draft of thirty guineas; I gave him four pounds one shilling; the goods came to more when they were packed up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to get your goods back in consequence of an information? - A. Yes, a porter brought them back the morning after, and in half an hour after that a person brought another bill, in the name of W. Williams: in about an hour and an half the prisoner Thodey came; that was the first time I saw him; he said he was come to accept a bill; I said, what bill; he said, Mr. Howes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew him this bill? - A. I did, and I asked him about Mr. Howes; he spoke very highly of Mr. Howes as a professional man; he said that he had got him a cause a twelvemonth ago; he accepted this bill in my presence, in my house; I saw him write it, and he promised to give me the four pounds one shilling that I had given to Howes; Mr. Howes wrote upon the back of it, and Mr. Thodey signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this indorsement signed? - A. At the same time; it might be a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Howes present when Thodey accepted it? - A. He was; I told him I wanted my four pounds one shilling; upon this Mr. Howes wrote this memorandum at the back of the bill, and Thodey: signed it; and Thodey told me he would call in the evening, and give me the balance; and while Howes and Thodey were present, my neighbour, Mr. Bird, came in; I shewed him the bill; he asked them several questions; I began to be alarmed, I was very ill; Mr. Bird began to question them who drew it; they were agitated and confused, and I began to suspect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had been for some time acquainted with the prisoner Howes? - A. No, never before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never employ Howes as a lawyer? - A. Only a week before; I believe he was employed to recover eighteen pounds; Mr. Simpson brought him to me, and Howes said he had got a good order for me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he recover that money for you? - A. No, I had no money; he deceived me very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was Simpson? - A. He belonged to one of the play-houses; the eighteen pounds I never had; I had been plundered very much; he was a Jew that accepted that bill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You gave this Howes an order to get your debt, and in about a week after they were taken up? - A. I never expected to get it.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew where Simpson lived, therefore you had an opportunity of enquiring about Howes? - A. I knew at that time, then he lived at No. 12, London Road.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had some conversation with Howes concerning an order for a person at Portsmouth, Mrs. Williams called upon you; previous to that you had sent the goods; they were in the possession of Howes, at his lodgings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not approve of the security he had given you; he returned the goods? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. After a whole night he had them in his possession? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Williams after tendered you the bill, neither of them came at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The bill was then unaccepted; where does Mrs. Williams live? - A. No. 4, Temple-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after Mrs. Williams called did the prisoner Thodey call; the bill was drawn upon Mrs. Williams and directed to

            ; when she called again you shewed her the bill, and after some conversation with Howes, you said he should have the goods? - A. I said I have a friend, I shall consult my friend; I wanted to keep them; they were in my possession, the cut glass was, when Thodey came to accept the bill.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The goods that Howes had were returned again? - A. Yes, all but some plate-frames.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Thodey write that acceptance of the bill before Howes made his appearance at your house? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I believe you were somewhat uneasy about the four pounds, and you sent for Mr. Howes by Thodey? - A. No, I sent for Mr. Bird; he came before Mr. Bird was there; I am certain that he came without being sent for: Thodey said, when he came, he had called to accept the bill drawn by W. Williams; he wrote

               <p>Q. Had you any means of knowing that her husband was dead at Portsmouth, at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mr. Howes came in, he went up stairs with you? - A. Yes.</p>

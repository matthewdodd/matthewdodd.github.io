                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of William White, Greenwell, and Co., Blackfriars-road. The prisoner was in our service from the 3rd of Oct. to the 9th of Dec. last year—he was in the velvet depart<lb></lb>ment, and had access to any of the velvets—it was his duty to put them straight of a night—here is a piece of velvet which I know to be ours—I pro<lb></lb>duce a piece from our stock which matches it—it is a figured article, and the two ends exactly match in pattern—this handkerchief has our pencil private mark on it—this other handkerchief is without our mark—here are some new waistcoats, one of which just matches with some velvet which we have now in our stock—also this satin waistcoat—they were not in waistcoats when taken—I know this scarf to be a pattern we had, but it has no private mark—there is no mark on any article but this black handkerchief—the prisoner was in the habit of making purchases while with us—I am sure none of these things were purchased by the prisoner—our system is, if a young man pur<lb></lb>chases goods, the bill must be brought to me or to Mr. Greenwell to sign, and every article purchased must be entered—the policeman has the bill of the goods which he did buy of us, and it does not include any of these.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 174). On 17th June I was on duty in Evelyn-street, Deptford, about 1 o'clock in the morning—I saw Hennessey, he had a hamper on his shoulder, and a bundle tied on the top of it—I said, "What have you got there?"—he said, "Some old clothes"—I asked where he brought them from—he said, "From my brother"—I asked him where his brother lived—he said, "In the Borough"—I asked him in what street—he said he did not know—I asked him if he could point out the street if I went back with him—he said he did not know—I looked in the bundle that was tied on the top of the hamper, and found this coat and waistcoat in it—I took him to the station—I found in the hamper four bars of soap at the top of it, and two at the bottom of it; some black lead, black lead brushes, packets of starch, six pounds of mould candles, and about two pounds of uncooked ham—I then asked him a third time where he got them—he said, "From a young woman"—I asked him where she lived—he said he did not know—I asked who she was, he denied knowing who she was—I found in his pockets a key of a box—he told me he lived in Tinderbox-alley—I went to a house there, and found in it a box which the key opened—it contained three shirt fronts, two packets of starch, nine towels, and several linen articles—I found on the soap this direction, "The Rev. Mr. Bakewell, Clarendon-road, Notting-hill"—I went to Mr. Bakewell, and he has identified part, of the property—I took Coleman into custody there.</p>

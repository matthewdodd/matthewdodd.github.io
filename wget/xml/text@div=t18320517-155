               <p>JAMES TAGUS SHOUT. I am shopman to a pawnbroker. On the 21st of April I took in these articles of the prisoner- I advanced 1s. 6d. on them.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MICHAEL. I live in <placeName id="t18320517-155-crimeloc909">Fetter-lane</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I worked for him six weeks - one of these shifts is mine; I said to him, on the Saturday night, "Mr. Michael, I will be obliged to you to let me have the price of a pair of shoes;" he said he had no change, and I took one of my own shifts, and the other one which might belong to him, but I found it in the room -I did not mean to defraud him of it; I told him I must have something to pawn.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MICHAEL. She did not tell me so, nor ask for any money; I owed her nothing - she had drawn more than was due to her; she did not tell me she had pawned any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He is single - the girl he keeps is an English girl. Witness. I was married at Hull, about three years ago; I do not know at what church, nor who was present - I had known my wife before; I travel with goods as a furrier.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did the prisoner do for you? A. She cleaned the room and lighted the fire; she lives in the kitchen with another woman, and I live on the first floor.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170088"></xptr>DIANA LEVY. I live at Hackney, and am a furrier. -The prosecutor employed me - on the day he charged the prisoner with this I was there, and she desired I would search her; I found three duplicates in her pocket - I read them to him; one was for a shirt, one for a cloak, and one for these two shifts - she told me that she had her victuals and drink, and 1s. a week - she then said he had given her a bed, which was worth 3s., and the whole of the time she was with him was but three weeks, and she had drawn another 1s. - when I found this duplicate she said that one of the shifts was the prosecutor's, and one was her own; she did not tell him, in my presence, that if she had not money she would pawn something - I saw 10s. taken from her; I do not know Mrs. Michael; I had been there but a fortnight.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HENRY KING. I am a constable. I received the prisoner in charge, and got the duplicates from Levy.</p>

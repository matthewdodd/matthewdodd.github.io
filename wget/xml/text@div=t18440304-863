About six o'clock in the evening of the 6th of Feb., I was behind the counter and heard a rattle in the window—I looked round and saw the prisoner outside the window with his arm through the window—I there was a broken square—I called out and he ran away as soon as he could get his arm out—I followed him—I met my little boy bringing him back—the box that held the cigars was empty which had been before full with a roll of twist tobacco on the top of it in the window—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I had never seen him before—I called out, "There is thieves," and my little boy ran out.</p>

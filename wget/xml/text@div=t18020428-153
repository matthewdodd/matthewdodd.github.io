               <p>- COCKRAN sworn. - The prisoner was once in my service, but I never saw him in the deplorable situation he appears to be in now; I never was so shocked in my life.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you send him to Mr. Looker for a knife, on the 6th of March? - A. No; I had not seen him for six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the pretence that the knife was for you was false? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BRISCOE sworn. - I apprehended the prisoner on another charge; understanding that he had been to Mr. Looker, I took him to Mr. Looker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Morris, the defendant, who is a pawnbroker, carrying on business in Little Bath Street—on Tuesday, 4th July, from 4 to 4.30, the prisoner Jenkins pledged this black velvet mantle for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the name of Ann Smith, 7, Duke Street—about 5.30 to 6 o'clock the same day, she brought this silver gravy spoon, broken—I asked her if it was her own—she said it was, she had broken it by treading on it—she asked me to buy it—I asked what she wanted—she said 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—Mr. Morris at the time was unwell, in the parlour—I took the spoon to him, and showed it to him, and afterwards gave the 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to Jenkins; and the spoon, was sold on the Thursday morning to Mr. Josephs, among other old silver.</p>

I am certain that I took the mantle and spoon from Jenkins—I saw her afterwards on the 8th, at Hunter Street, in custody—I had known her before as a customer—I can't say how often she had been there, several times—sometimes pawning in the name of Jenkins, and sometimes Smith—she had not pawned in the name of Smith before the mantle, to my knowledge—the salesman was in the shop at the time, and saw me buy the spoon—the policeman came to me on the Thursday, and said he had a woman in custody for the mantle, and he took me to see her on the Saturday morning—he asked if we had taken in a mantle—he did not ask me about the spoon.</p>

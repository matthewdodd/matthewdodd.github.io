               <p>Mr. Garrow Prisoner's Counsel. What sort of nails are they? - Flooring brads.</p>
               <p>How long had this man been in your service? - Oh! a great while, seven or eight years.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of these things? - Five or six shillings.</p>
               <p>How much could he earn a week in your service? - His wages was eleven shillings a week.</p>
               <p>How many thousand nails do you think since he has lived with you, he has delivered out to your workmen? - In the course of these last six months I have put great confidence in him, and trusted him with five hundred pounds worth.</p>
               <p>You have one Wells, a workman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you never said that you would press against this man, if he ventured to have counsel, to ask you questions? - I only said this, I considered the man as injuring himself to have a counsel, when I mean to state nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>You thought he was injuring himself by having counsel? - I thought so.</p>
               <p>You told him, I believe, that he would? - No, I did not tell him so; this morning about half an hour ago, I told a man, Wells, what are you doing here? but I appeal to his lordship, whether I have a right to be insulted by you.</p>
               <p>Court. You seem very much to mistake your situation, you are certainly bound to answer every question the counsel puts to you, any thing that can in any way relate to this business; and the Court will stop him if he puts any improper question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now master Silk stand up; now you see you have not been yet insulted; I know you very well, and I know you understand this subject very well; what conversation had you with the witness attending to prove the defendant's cause to day? - About an hour and a half ago; I saw him and said to him, what are you doing here? I did not know then he was a witness for the defendant? says he, I am come in the cause of Jones; says I, what for; says he, I cannot say; I said, you cannot be an evidence, you was not present; says I, I think he is throwing away his money, if he means to have a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280076"></xptr>councellor, because I shall state only the truth.</p>
               <p>That was all you said? - Yes; his brother came to me several times; I said, I shall be obliged to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Have you never said to any body (and I desire you to be cautious in your answer) that if this man employed counsel or lawyer, you would press the more against him? - No, I did not, upon my oath, I never said I would press the more; I said, I thought I should be obliged to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Did not you say it would be the worse for him? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Then if there was no counsel you would not speak the truth? - Since the man lias been in this unhappy situation, several stories have been told me.</p>
               <p>In the course then of the last six months he has had a most unlimited confidence placed in him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And has delivered out to your workmen numbers of things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you have a man of the name of Wells? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where does Wells live? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Not what part of the town? - I do not concern myself.</p>
               <p>But I do concern myself? - I do not know on my word.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he lives in a court in White-cross-street, into which street this man was going? - Upon my oath I do not know; I will take my oath I do not know where the man lived; I never heard it till you informed me.</p>
               <p>Did that man work any over hours, can you tell me? - Not that night.</p>
               <p>Had he that week? - I have no right to take notice.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that Wells was to do over-work the very next day? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard it? - I never heard it; his master passed by at the very time I detected this man.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath do not you know that Wells, your own workman, wanted those nails for your own business? - I never heard so, never since, nor before, nor have no reason to believe it.</p>
               <p>Were they the sort of nails that Wells used in that work? - I cannot recollect; I think he was fixing up escutcheons, and then he would not want these nails.</p>

               <p>What conversation had you with Mr. Silk since you came here; what has he said to you? - That is not my concern; he told the prisoner's brother that he would be more rash, and aggravate his case if he employed a counsel; and Mr. Silk wished to know what I came here about? I told him, it would be but a few words, and the truth should accompany them; Mr. Silk is not my master; he employed a taskmaster to finish four small houses; he offered me a guinea a week? and I said, if he would let me have a share of the profits<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280077"></xptr>that arose from it, and I would take it; Mr. Silk had spoke many times in the course of that week and the week before; he said, he would advance no money till his work was finished; therefore we were forced to work morning and evening, and particularly of mornings, that no accidents might ensue; we had proposed and fully intended, me and three more, to get up the next morning, and we asked the prisoner for nails; he said, he would bring some to me; I applied to him again; and he said, he would bring some; but he brought none; I did expect that he would have brought them that night; not but that there was other work, but these nails were necessary and wanting in the morning.</p>
               <p>Were these the sort of nails that you wanted? - The gentleman knows himself that these are proper nails for the business that we had to do; he had repeatedly, over and over, two or three times a day spoke these words.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the work that was to be done? - Flooring, chimney, ground-skirting.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to the constable. Are these proper nails? - They are fit most for laying of floors; they are fit for the purpose of laying floors, nothing else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wells. Mr. Jones was not asked for them sort of nails in particular.</p>
               <p>Constable. When I was going to the Compter with him, he said, I am very sorry such a thing should happen; I do not know that I ever robbed my master of a farthing; I wish you would let me go.</p>

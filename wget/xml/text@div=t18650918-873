On the morning of the 17th of August I was on duty in Well-street, Whitechapel—the prisoner was fight<lb></lb>ing with another man, and there was a crowd round them—the other man came to me and told me that prisoner had assaulted him—while I was speaking to him the prisoner ran at me with a knife in his hand saying, "You b——, I will give it you if you come near me"—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I hit him on the right arm, and knocked it out of his hand—the prisoner picked it up, and was coming at me again—I caught hold of him, and threw him on the pavement, and with the assistance of another young man took the knife away—he did not cut me.</p>

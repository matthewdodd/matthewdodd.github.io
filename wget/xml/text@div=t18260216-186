            . I am a constable of Enfield. On the 22d of January I had some information, and the next morning, about half-past three o'clock, I heard a waggon go by my house, which is in the way from Mr. Dale's to London; I called up another person, and went with him to the Horse and Groom, at Edmonton - the horses stopped to drink, and Scott, who was with the waggon, went and opened a stable-door, and when the horses had done drinking, he moved to the stable door, and took out one truss, which he put into the stable, and then went on with only one truss in the waggon - I followed it some distance, then returned; we got to Edmonton about four o'clock - I waited till the landlord of the Horse and Groom got up, and then I asked him who kept the keys of the stable - he said, "Whitman." I then waited till he got up, and asked him whose the hay was that was in the stable; he said it was his own - that he knew it was there, and had been there ever since Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Where were you? A. On the opposite side of the way - it was light enough for me to see it, but there is a gas light there; there was some other person in the stable; before Whitman got up, I was away some time - and cannot say whether any other person brought the hay during that time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you brought any hay that was found in the loft of the stable, to compare with this? A. No; there was other hay in a bin - I have only brought some from the truss.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS to THOMAS DALE. Q. Is not this a common quality of hay? A. No; it grew in a flooded meadow - I suppose there may be five thousand such meadows in the county.</p>

            . I was with Mead, and saw Scott go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160084"></xptr>and unlock the stable - he then took a bundle of something out of the waggon, and put it into the stable; Mead was nearer than I was - I believe I was before the waggon - it was moon-light, but a hazy morning.</p>

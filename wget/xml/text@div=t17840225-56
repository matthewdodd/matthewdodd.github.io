               <p>And had you heard her talk of this? - Yes, they make a common talk of their business, they never make any secret.</p>
               <p>And do you harbour such people? - She told me she had come out of gaol, and never intended to do any thing of the kind again; she had been a fine in Tothillfields, I followed and missed of her; I went into Short's Gardens, and she was not there, and she turned down an alley, and I stood in the street till I saw her; I saw her at the further end of the street, and when she saw me, she ran away, and we took her to the publican's house, and we went to that cellar, and there we found this pewter, and this skellet, but no pots.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - Close by St. Giles's workhouse.</p>
               <p>You keep a common lodging house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the criminality and danger of the conduct you have described in yourself, in receiving and harbouring in your house, people that make a habit of stealing? - She never had laid in my house before, I have had several of them taken up in the neighbourhood, since I have lived there; I never would encourage such a thing.</p>
               <p>Do you know that you are liable to be indicted as an accessary, for harbouring and receiving a selon? - We cannot be answerable for strangers that we do not know.</p>
               <p>No, but you can for people that you do know; now, by your own account, you knew this woman to be a thief before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Only let me warn you, that the very account you have given yourself now, if it had been given by another witness, would have made you liable to have been convicted as an accessary, therefore, take warning. - My Lord, I detest them, I will take warning.</p>

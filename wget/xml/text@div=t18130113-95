            . On Sunday evening, the 10th of January, me and my sister went to see an acquaintance as far as the Tower. On coming back, the prisoner accosted us, and said, she would see us home as far as Whitecross-street, where she was going to. My sister had drank too much. I was sober enough to protect myself.

My sister said, she would treat her with a glass of liquor for her kindness. We went into a public-house, and as soon as my sister had drank a glass of liquor she fell down, and directly we came out of the public-house this woman took my shawl off my neck.</p>

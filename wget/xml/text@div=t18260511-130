            . I am a harness-maker. The prisoner brought these things to my house, in Ray-street, Clerkenwell, about half-past six o'clock in the evening of the 5th of May; I asked him what was to be done with them - he said, "They are for you, if you like to buy them:" I said,"How did you get them - they are Mr. Jury's?" I had made them for him; he said Mr. Jury had given them to him, as they had laid kicking about the stable, and were of no use. I told him to come the next day, which he did.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>

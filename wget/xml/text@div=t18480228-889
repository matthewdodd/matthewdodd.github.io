                  </hi> I am in the service of George Palliser, of Bermondsey street, coach-builder—the prisoner was in his service. On 18th Aug. the prisoner applied to me for an order for three yards of green carpet—I wrote ✗—he went away with it—he brought no carpet back—I have seen the order it is now altered to blue—it was wanted for carriages.</p>

On 26th Aug. he came to my place, and wanted six yards of blue carpet—I cut it on and gave it him—he gave me two orders—one was altered from green to blue—I said, "How is this?"—he said, "It is a mistake; you scratch this one out, and write it blue"—the blue is worth 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more than the green.</p>

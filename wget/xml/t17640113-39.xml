            . I was going from Kensington Gravel-pits to Westburn-green: the prisoner and another young man were coming down from the foot path; they had a bundle; when they came up to us, they squatted down under a hedge, and the prisoner was sitting on the bag; there was a hole in it, through which I saw the wing of a fowl. The person with me had a gun in his hand: we wanted to know what they had got; the prisoner begged we would let him go. My friend said he would shoot him, if he offered to make his escape; he said he might, if he would: the other man ran away, I overtook him, we scuffled, and at last he got from me, and got off: the man with the gun brought the prisoner to Westburn-green, and they sent two or three men to fetch the fowls; there were four geese and a gander; two of the geese and the gander were dead.</p>

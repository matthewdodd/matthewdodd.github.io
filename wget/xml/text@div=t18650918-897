                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Medway-terrace—on the morning of the 27th of July my house was broken into—it was entered by the drawing window at the back of the house—the fastening had been removed or slipped—it was quite safely fastened the previous night—I saw my wife do it—I was called by my servant in the morning and I missed several things—a hearth-rug an ivory church service a curd case a flower stand, and a lot of little things—this hearth-rug and churcb service (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my property—there are several things still missing—I came down stairs about half-past 6.</p>

About 5 o'clock on the morning of the 27th of July, I saw three men in Brockley-lane—the two prisoners are two of them—Would was carrying a large black bundle—I followed them till I could get assistance—they crossed overcome fields to Nunhead Cemetery and got nearly up to them at the bridge—when I was on the bridge the three men turned back—I did not mean to attack them but Would before a word was spoken struck me with a stick about the head and body—I took him into custody when he called to the other two "Come here come here"—and Kennett turned round and drew a telescope from his side pocket, and struck me over the head and cut my lip through—this is the telescope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was knocked down—my head is still very giddy and I can scarcely see—the prisoners ran away and I followed them—when going towards the old Kent-road, they separated—one went towards Dulwich and the other two to Peckham-lane—I followed these two and saw Would throw the bundle away near the Kent-road bridge—in the Kent-road Would took off his over coat and pave it to Kennett—they then separated and I continued to follow Would—Kennett ran through the lime-yard close to the canal bridge—I lost Would near the St. Helena gardens—I have known Would three or four years but Kennett I never saw before until this morning—I found the bundle where I saw Would throw it—these plated articles were found in the coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the coat was dropped in the lime shed and was brought to me afterwards.</p>

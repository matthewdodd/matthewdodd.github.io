On the 10th of October, about five o'clock, I was walking on the pavement opposite his room, and saw him fall from his shop-board-nobody but him and the prisoner were in the room. There was a cry of murder! I believe it was the deceased that called. I stepped up to the window, and saw the prisoner beating him with the sleeve-board; he was on the ground, on his side. I heard him cry - I immediately drew the sash of the window up; it was shut before - I looked in, and said "In the name of G-d don't kill the man." I turned round, and called the people-they came. The deceased was laying by the fire. I saw blood, or black, on his eye. The prisoner caught him by the shoulder, turned him over on his stomach, and said"D-n your head, you old rogue, I will flog your a-s." He immediately gave him four or five slaps with the flat side of a sleeve-board, not very hard. He immediately put the sleeve-board down, and flew out of the window, which I had opened, and said "D-n your old eyes, I have not half done with you yet." He went four or five yards toward the racket-ground in a terrible passion. I returned, went on the pavement, and talked with one Dougle. He then returned to the window. I told Greaves to go in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You went there in consequence of the deceased crying out - A. Yes. I saw blood, or black, on his eye - I cannot say that there was any wound. I saw no blow struck on his head.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GREAVES. I am a prisoner in the Fleet. I saw several persons standing round the deceased's window. The prisoner was addressing himself to the others, telling them how Learwood had used him, by finding two letters, and giving them to Lewis. He said he had wipped his backside with the sleeve-board, had pulled him off the shop-board, and he would not forget that in a hurry - He appeared in a passion. He jumped down into the deceased's room again, and said, "You know pon did give him the letter." I jumped down myself-the deceased was then standing by the fire-place-the discourse was chiefly about the letter - He did not then strike him, but only threatened him. He said, "I have not done with you yet, and I will serve you out again, when I have proved that you did give him the letter." He went out of the room. The deceased put his hand to his thigh, and said, "I don't know, but I believe you have done for me now." The prisoner and I left the room together.</p>

            . I am a prisoner in the Fleet. I was looking out of my room window, which is above Learwood's, and saw several people there, saying, do not hurt the man. I heard a man crying out, as if he was in pain. I ran out of my room, and lifted the deceased off the floor - He was laying on his side-nobody was with him. I put him in a chair-the prisoner was at the window. I heard what passed, and asked Learwood how he came in that situation; he was a minute and a half before he could answer me. - I saw black coming all round his left eye. He said, Daly had been beating him. I asked, for what-Daly said, for picking up a letter, and giving it to a fellow prisoner. I asked the deceased if it was true? - he said several times, that he knew nothing about any letter whatever, the prisoner then came into the room, through the window, and said, "How can you deny it, when you told me on the shop-board, that you thought it no harm?" The room is below the pavement. The prisoner said he ought to be the last person to serve him so, for he had rendered him a great service about twelve months ago. I left the room.</p>
               <p>Q. When you picked the deceased up in what state was he - A. He was on his side. He did not complain of any thing. I put him in a chair - He was insensible for a minute and a half. All he said was, that Daly had been beating him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did not the prisoner say he had been giving him two or three slaps for his ingratitude - A. He did; the deceased did not contradict it. He had been two years in the prison-the prisoner had been there twelve months. I believe they were very friendly before this.</p>

The prisoner came into my room - I saw him go into Learwood's room, he remained there three or four minutes, talking very loud. He came out, and went in again in a few minutes. He appeared in a much greater passion than at first; he came in about five minutes. I heard a great noise, but paid no attention. He came to the sink, and drank some water, returned into the deceased's room, and shut the door-(he always shut the door when he went in). I left the sink, and went into my own room, returned, and saw the deceased sitting in his own room, and crying, "Oh dear! Oh dear!" I saw one or two gentlemen in the room.</p>

             BERESFORD. I am a prisoner in the Fleet, and the husband of the last witness. I was in the racketground, on the 10th of October, about five o'clock, and heard somebody say, "Don't go to kill the man, for G-d's sake!" I turned round, looked at Learwood's window, saw the prisoner in the room, and Learwood on the floor. The prisoner had the sleeve-board in one hand, and held<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280018"></xptr>the deceased with the other, either by the collar or arm; he appeared in the act of pulling the deceased. I only saw him strike one blow on the breech. The prisoner afterwards came through the window into the racket-ground, and explained to the persons assembled his reasons for doing it. He said, "he had pulled him off the board, and had given the old scoundrel a good cobbing on the a-s;" and I think he said he had richly deserved it, and in pulling him off the board he had scratched his eye a little.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. At that time nothing serious was thought-A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, as soon as it was discovered that the man was in danger, he used every means he could to do him good - A. Yes, he sent for Mr. Astley Cooper, and gave him every assistance.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PACEY. I am a prisoner in the Fleet. I heard somebody cry out, ran to the window, and saw the deceased lying down, and the prisoner with the sleeve-board in his hands - He struck him on the breech with it, with both hands, as hard as he could. He came out of the window, and said he had smacked his a-s three times with the sleeve-board, and he would not forget that presently. He then swore a bitter oath, and said, "I wish had killed him outright."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How many persons were by at the time he made use of that expression - A. A great many. I dare say some of those now present heard it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You was examined before the Coroner - A. Yes; the Coroner was very diligent in his inquiry to know every thing that he could about it,</p>

I was walking very near the deceased's room, and heard a noise; I did not know whether they were playing or quarrelling; the deceased was on the board-whether he fell off the board, or the prisoner had pulled him off, I cannot say; he came on the floor, and the prisoner slapped his b-ks-de with the flat side of the sleeve-board. There was a cry of Murder! several persons went into the room. The prisoner came up to me, and said he had been slapping the man on his breech-his shirt was torn.

It was afterwards discovered that my name was not inserted in the list which was given to the Coroner.</p>

            . I am a prisoner in the Fleet, and a surgeon. A few minutes after nine o'clock at night, on Saturday, the 19th of October, I was called in to see the deceased, who was on his bed, partly undressed. I found he had been sick - He was totally insensible, and in a strong paralysis, and a discolouration of his eye; the museles of his face were much distorted, and his tongue hanging partly out of his mouth. I understood he had received some injury on his head. I had him put on a chair, and examined his head; I could find no depression of the skull, but was still persuaded he had received some injury in his head. I found his pulse at 66, and that on his left wrist much more languid than the other. I bled him freely, upon which he breathed much freer, the paralysis gave way, and he appeared relieved. I ordered a warm bath, which was immediately brought. I attempted to give him medicine, but he could not swallow - I staid with him till ten o'clock. At eleven I visited him again, and found his pulse at 76-at twelve it was at 96. At five o'clock next morning I visited him, and found it at 150. I was so alarmed that I determined upon opening the temporal artery on the side opposite to the injured part, and bled him freely, which materially relieved them - I found him very dangerous. Between eleven and twelve o'clock further advice came. I should have said, that between nine and ten o'clock that morning the prisoner came into the room, and appeared anxious to know how the man was. I told him he could not survive forty-eight hours from the time of the inquiry - He appeared greatly alarmed. I told him I should be very sorry to be in the situation of the person who caused it - He said he was the person, and was very sorry for it, and inquired what he could do. I told him to send for good advice - He asked who I would recommend? I recommended Mr. Astley Cooper, or Mr. Abernethy; he said he would do it, and left the room. Soon after, the friends of the deceased desired I would go and request the prisoner not to come into the room any more. I went, and told him. He said, "What would you have me do?" I again advised him to write to a gentleman to come to his assistance. He immediately took a sheet of paper, and wrote something - I left the room. The man died between seven and eight o'clock on Monday morning. Mr. Delagarde saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. In your opinion, what was the cause of his death - A. I saw his body opened, and have no hesitation in saying my opinion is, that he died from an internal injury on the brain, occasioned by external violence. I ought to have said some conversation passed between me and the prisoner about the injury he had received. I told him my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280019"></xptr>opinion was, that it was in consequnece of the injury he had received on his head. He said he did not strike him on the head, he only struck him on the b-ks-de. He said it could not be from his striking him, it must have been from the fall from the window-seat, which was the shop-board. I said I could not think that, for the room was carpeted very thickly, and he was not seated above three feet six inches from the floor. He said, then it must have been against the bed-post. I said I did not see exactly how that could be, but it must have been from a violent blow. There was a bed within six inches of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What description of external violence do you believe occasioned the injury - A. On dissection I observed a rupture on the dura mater, which must have been from a blow - A blow on the eye in an oblique direction, I think, would have occasioned it. I could discover no external bruise, except on the eye. There were between two and three ounces of extravasated blood, which would depress the brain. This might have arisen from a blow on the eye.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. It is a stone floor-there was a very thick bag under the carpet.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you time to give your examination deliberately before the Coroner - A. No, I had time to give it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Coroner any thing about any intercourse between you and the prisoner, except about his expressing his great anxiety for the safety of the deceased - A. Yes, I did. Mr. Shelton seemed to wish to cut the matter short, and to come to the essential points.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any account about the blow, and the probable fall from the shop-board - A. I did. I heard my examination read over before I signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. I will read your deposition over to you-(read) - A. That is correct as far as it goes.</p>

             DELAGARDE. I am house-surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. On Sunday, the 11th of October, at eleven o'clock in the morning, I was called in to see the deceased; he was laying in a state of insensibility, and in such a state as argued that a great injury must have been done to the brain - I considered him in great danger. Several other medical persons were there. We all thought he laboured under symptoms of depression and concussion - He died. I examined the head. The cause of his death was internal injury, arising from external violence, which must have been considerable.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did it appear to have been inflicted - A. On the left eye. A blow or a fall would have occasioned it, if they had been inflicted with sufficient force - I am not able to say which. I did not observe the floor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find any fracture of the brain under the part where the external violence appeared - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the sleeve-board to have been used with both hands, in the violent manner represented, would it not have fractured the bone - A. It might have produced the injury by fracturing the bone. The fall would have caused it as likely.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The room is only carpeted in the middle, full five feet are left bare. I was standing in the ground, Dougle came to me, and asked if I had not lost a letter, I said I had - He said, he saw the deceased with it, that he read it to him, and he advised the deceased to give it to him; but he said, he would give it to Lewis, as I was at variance with him, and that he saw him give it to Lewis. I said, I did not think it possible, I went into the deceased's room, and asked him how he could treat me so - He said he did not think it any harm. I told him he ought to be punished for it. I called him a scoundrel. He called me a liar. I told him I would go to Lewis, and if he did not return it, I would complain. He was getting off his shop-board, and fell off, on the bare stcnes. I was going out of the room, went to assist him, and put him on a chair - I told him bad as it was, it was what he deserved - We kept talking about the letter for a quarter of an hour. He called me a liar again - I caught hold of him, and beat him on the b-ks-de with the sleeve-board.</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES HARMER. I am the prisoner's solictior. I attended the inquisition taken by Mr. Shelton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mead in the room - A. I do not remember it-the room was very much crouded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Coroner make the declaration, that if anybody present knew any thing of the facts, he was ready to hear them - A. He did repeatedly and loudly. Mr. Shelton had a list of persons supposed to know any thing about it. After examining them, he made this declaration. One or two came forward in consequence of his solicitation; every body could hear him. He called out loudly and repeatedly. I heard Hargraves examined - He has stated more to-day than what he did before the Coroner. He did not say a word about any conversation between him and the prisoner, as to the cause of his death. The Coroner has taken down all that he said. Nothing about the conversation about his falling from the shop-board, or anything else was said. It is untrue that the Coroner wished him to shorten the matter, and did not take every thing down. <rs id="t18181028-42-verdict250" type="verdictDescription">

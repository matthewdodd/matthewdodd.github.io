               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Giblet's son wanted to lie with me; I refused; he said if I would consent, he would give me these things, and would get me a place in the country; upon which I went up stairs with him; after he had done with me, he gave me the things, and then he got me a lodging: but he never came to see me from the time that I went away.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is the son?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. At home; he was at church with me. I am confident what she says is false.</p>
               <p>Court. Was your son at church with you all the time? - He came a little after eleven o'clock; our church is done about a quarter before one o'clock. I went out at about eleven o'clock, when the bell rang for church; he came to church in twenty minutes after; I believe it was not more.</p>
               <p>Was your son present when she was taken? - He was not there.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear this story before? - No, my son carries himself at a much greater distance than that.</p>
               <p>But did she ever pretend this before? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Orange and Furnell. Did the prisoner tell you this story she has told now when you first took her?</p>
               <p>Both. No, we never heard this story before; she did not say it then, nor before the Justice of Peace.</p>
               <p>Question to Prosecutrix. What are the things worth? 39 s.</p>

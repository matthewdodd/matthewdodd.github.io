On Sunday, the 6th of August, at three o'clock, I went to the hospital to my husband, who had a broken leg - I left the prisoner, who is my lodger, in the yard; I left Susannah Hollinshead and some other persons in the house; there was no one in my apartments, which are the two lower rooms - the prisoner took his meals in our kitchen - the front window was fastened by two falling drops - and when I went out I fastened the door of my apartment - I returned about nine o'clock in the evening, and found the prisoner on the stairs, very much in liquor; he said he had lost the key of his door, and could not get into his room - I put him to a bed, in another room, where he slept all night - he went out the next morning - I received information, and went in search of him, and found him at a public-house, at the corner, pretty much in liquor - I asked where my two shillings were, which he had taken out of the drawer in my room - he said "Here it is, take it and bed d - d;" I had missed the two shillings from a screw-box in the drawer, and the rest of the property - we usually fasten my backwindow with a gimblet.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. I have a sheet and a remnant, pawned by the prisoner, early in the morning of the 7th of July; I gave the duplicates the witness has just produced.</p>
               <p>COURT to Mrs. BELLAMY. Q. Is this your sheet? A. Yes; it was safe during the absence of my husband; but I cannot say it was safe on the 6th of August - I had seen the money locked into the drawer that day - the drawer, where the sheet was, was not locked - he had lived with us fourteen or fifteen years - he had access to all our property - we had a good opinion of him.</p>

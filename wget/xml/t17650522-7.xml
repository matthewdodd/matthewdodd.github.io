I saw him go down the area, and come up again in about two minutes with these things under his arm; I pursued and took him. (The things mentioned in the indictment produced in court.) These he had upon him; they are my property: he took them out of the pantry; the pantry door opens out into the area, and it was left open: I asked him how he came by them; he said a young man had called him down, and said, if he would come down he would give him something: there was but one young man in the house; I called him up, and asked the prisoner if he had them of that person: he said, no; that was not the person.</p>

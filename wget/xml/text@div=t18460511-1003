I am the prisoner's son, and was riding in the cart, when we got to Mile-end-gate, the deceased asked for the money or ticket—my father hallooed out, "Y"—he said that would not do and laid hold of the horse's bead, and my father hit at him with the thin end of the whip handle—the butt end was in his hand at the time—the deceased <hi rend="italic">bobbed</hi> out of the way and the shaft of the loaded cart knocked him down as he was <hi rend="italic">bobbing</hi> and the near wheel of the loaded cart went over him—the cart was drawn by three horses.</p>

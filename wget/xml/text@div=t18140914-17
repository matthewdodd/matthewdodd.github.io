On the 25th of July, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my master's shop; he asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs; I shewed him some. After he had looked at them, he asked to look at some others that were in the window. I turned round to get them, and when I returned to him with the other handkerchiefs I perceived his left hand behind his coat. He looked at these other handkerchiefs, and of them he offered me five shillings for it; I said I could not take it. He turned round to go out; I saw a piece of handkerchief behind his coat; I called to him to stop; he then began to run. I set off after him; a man stopped him, and took the piece of handkerchiefs from him. I got up to the prisoner; the man gave me the piece of handkerchiefs. I took hold of the prisoner, and took him back to the shop. This is the piece of handkerchiefs; they are my master's property.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

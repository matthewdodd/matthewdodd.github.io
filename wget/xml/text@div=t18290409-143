I have known the prisoner about six months, as frequenting my house - I have been told that he had been living, for the last twenty years, upon his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090078"></xptr>property; he used to have refreshment in a private room - he generally came about dinner-time, sometimes at tea-time - I have missed money occasionally out of my cash-box, which stood in the window ledge of the little parlour; it was locked, but the key was always in it - I marked my money on the 13th of March; there were four half-crowns and five shillings on the Thursday evening; when I went to bed I took it into my bed-room, and put it under my pillow, which I do every night: I brought it down on the following morning, about ten o'clock, and put it into the little parlour on the window ledge, its usual place - the prisoner came there that day about half-past twelve; the cash-box at that time contained 1l. 15s. 6d. in silver - none of the marked money had been taken out of it - I have a wife and a sister, but I had not gone out of the room all day, from the time I had my breakfast till the prisoner came; I had counted the money the evening before; my wife and sister go to the cash-box when they want it, but I swear that neither of them had been at it that day; the prisoner had two glasses of gin and water and two pipes of tobacco - he staid till about two o'clock; my wife was up stairs, my sister was out of the room - I was called to serve a customer at the bar, and heard the cash-box open and shut; no one but the prisoner was in the room; I can up stairs and told my wife of it - in the course of half an hour we sat down to dinner, and Mr. Fairfax said, "I will go into the tap-room and smoke my pipe while you have your dinner;" before I sat down to dinner I counted the cash in the cash-box, and found 6s. 6d. short - as soon as we had done dinner the prisoner came into the little parlour again, and bad another glass of gin and water; he then paid his reckoning, which came to 1s. 7 1/2d. and gave me two shillings, neither of which were marked; I put them into the till, and when he had quitted my house I sent a young man for an officer, who took him in the street - I had not spoken to any officer about this business before - there were 8s. found on him in silver and 9d. in copper, and among the silver there was one shilling and one half-crown marked, which I can swear to; I have not stated any thing more than I told the Magistrate - I do not know that I have; I will swear that I told the Magistrate that whilst I was serving a customer I heard the cash-box open - the money in the cash-box was not all marked; all the marked money remained in the box excepting one shilling and one half-crown, but I missed 6s. 6d. in all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You say you understand this gentleman lives on his property? A. I have heard so; he has come to my house for five or six months, two or three times a week - I never saw any thing like childishness about him; he always appeared very friendly - he did not appear intoxicated after he drank the three glasses of gin and water: I have never said, in reference to this prosecution; that I would not make it up unless I had something very handsome, nor any thing of that kind - I have never said I would not settle it unless I was well paid for it, nor any thing of that kind; I know a person named Pettit; upon my oath, I never said in his presence that I would not settle this business unless I was well paid for it, nor nothing like it - I was never present when my sister said, "My brother will not settle this under 200l.;" I never heard any thing of that kind - it never occurred to me to put the box in a safe place; I marked the money in order to detect some one; they were marked with a kind of round

            - I counted it the night before, but did not count it that morning; no one comes into my bed-room in the morning - I brought it down in the morning, and the key was in it; I did not say any thing to the prisoner about it, but went up stairs to my wife - the prisoner might certainly have gone away at that time; he was taken into custody about ten minutes after he had left; when he left the room, and I went to count the money, the box was locked - I had left it unlocked. The prisoner has played a game at cards with me and my wife in the little room - he has betted a penny on the games as we have been playing; I never passed any marked money to my customers till after the prisoner was taken, and then Mr. Richardson, who keeps the Prince of Wales public-house, came in and had change for a sovereign; losing the money had made us very uncomfortable in the house, but I never accused my sister of it.</p>

            . I am an officer. Mr. Cox sent for me, and I took the prisoner in Hermitage-street: I said the publican told me he had been robbing the box in which he kept his money - I took him into a public-house, and searched him: while I was taking the silver from his pocket, which I think was about 8s., and 9d. in copper, Cox pointed out this half-crown and this shilling - the prisoner said nothing about it; I think his money was all in one pocket; I think there was some copper among the silver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner sober? A. I thought he was stupid, or petrified with fear; he gave me no answers - he might be a little drunk, but he was sober when I got him to the office.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's sister. On Thursday, the 4th of March, he marked four half-crowns and five shillings; he put them on the chimney-piece, and in the evening he put them into the cash-box with the other silver; he took it up to bed with him, and came down the next morning between nine and ten o'clock - the prisoner was in the parlour alone, where the cash-box was kept; there was no change given to any one, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the mark made on the money? A. Yes - they were not all marked exactly alike; the shillings are marked with a kind of O, and the half-crowns with an X - there are two of them; I was in the tap-room at the time they were taken - I am confident there had been no change taken, for I was in an out of the room; I have never said that my brother would not make this up for less than 200l.; I never said so to Pettit, nor to any body in his presence; I have had no conversation with Pettit at all about it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have no recollection of touching his money; I did not find that I had a shilling more than I could account for - how the money came there I do not know, but it does appear that I had it.</p>

I have seen the prosecutor on this subject frequently; last Tuesday evening, when I was in his tap-room. a young man who was there said to Cox, "How do you get on?" he answered the bill was filed; the young man said, "You have not made it up;" Cox replied, "No. I will not make it up unless I am well paid for it;" last Tuesday week I was there when a gentleman came in, and his sister Betsey said her brother was determined not to make it up under 200l.; I received one marked shilling from the prosecutor on the 14th of March- this is it.</p>

I have known the prisoner about twelve years - he is about seventy-one or seventy-two years of age- he lived eight years in my house: I have observed that within this last year or two there has been a great difference in his behaviour and conversation, but his character has been perfectly honest, and he has been well respected.</p>

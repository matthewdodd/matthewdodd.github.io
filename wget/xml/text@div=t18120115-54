On Monday morning, the 23d of December, I went out of my house about half after eight, I saw three youths lurking about, I knew their persons, I am positive to Tonathy and Clark, and another person with them, which I believe to be Linton, but am not positive. I returned in less than half an hour, the neighbours said I had been robbed, and the thieves had gone towards Great Pulteney street, I saw two men bringing Clark with a carpet, which carpet is my property, this is it, I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that carpet in your house before you lost it. - A. I saw it the same morning, before I went out. I desired the men in custody of Clark, to take care of him; I went in pursuit of Mrs. Bailey, she was knocked down, I accompanied my wife home, and in a few minutes Tonathy was brought to my door; I believe the other carpet is here. They were taken to Marlborough street office. On Wednesday I took Linton at the Newcastle-upon-Tyne public house, the corner of Broad street, I went to a room at the top of the house, the door was fastened; I wished it to be opened. I was answered, that whoever attempted to come into that room, they would blow their brains out, and when the door was opened, a woman struck me; I found the prisoner in the room.</p>

One of them took these two carpets off a deal table at Mr. Bailey's premises; he took them under his arm that was outside of the shop, and then he went down the street, I cannot say which of them took the two carpets.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the other two at the time that he took the carpets. - A. They stood at the next door; when he had taken the carpets, he went to the other two, and the three went off together; they turned towards Great Pulteney street. When they went down Marshall street, I went down stairs and told what I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150046"></xptr>seen, they were pursued, I went up stairs, and Tonathy and Clark were brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. Had each a carpet with them. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take sufficient notice of the persons who were together when the carpet was taken, so as to be sure of these two that were brought back were two of the three. - A. Yes, I have no doubt about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice sufficient of the person that took the carpet off the table, so as to say one of them were one of the two persons that were brought back. - A. No, Tonathy and Clark were two of the men, Linton I cannot speak to.</p>
               <p>Q. But you cannot say whether either of them is the man that took the carpet, or only were standing bye. - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk of seeing them take the carpets, you do not know the carpets again, do you. - A. Yes, I had seen the carpets, and noticed the carpets, before they were taken away, these are the same carpets, they had lain there, exposed to sale, some time, not long.</p>

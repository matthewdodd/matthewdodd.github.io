On the 24th of March, about five o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in the parlour, when the prisoner came into the shop. As I was going out of the parlour, I saw her take something off the counter, and put it under her petticoats. I asked her what she wanted. She said, she had a pound of butter to sell for twenty pence; we could not agree for the price; she went out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any basket in her hand - A. Yes. I went and told my mistress that I suspected that the woman had taken something off the counter. We went directly after her, both of us. I saw her go into the Crown public-house, with her basket with her. I went in after her, and said, will you come back, we will buy the butter of you. She came a little way. She turned round. Miss

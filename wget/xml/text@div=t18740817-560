                  </hi>. I live at 42, Richmond Place, Plumstead, and am an engine driver—I have known the prisoner about fourteen years—I heard of his child, Joseph, being ill—I was called in to visit the child about 24th June; it seemed very ill—I don't know exactly what the nature of the dis<lb></lb>ease was—it seemed as though it was convulsed, or something after that nature—I was called in to pray for it as a rule of our faith—I laid my hands on it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and prayed over it, and I believe I anointed it with oil in the name of the Lord Jesus—I believe it was with salad oil—I did no more than that, and get on my knees and pray for it—I suppose I saw it from that time every other day until it died—it remained ill all that time—it seemed to be gradually declining—for the last four days I saw it every day; it was continually declining—I left it on the Sunday night about 10 o'clock and it died on the Monday—during that time no doctor was called in or any medicine given to the child—a little weak brandy and water was given to it, a little weak wine and water, and there was arrow root and, I believe, a little mutton broth occasionally—every care was taken of it—I sat up one whole night with it, and there were several nurs<lb></lb>ing mothers engaged in the case—the prisoner is a labourer—he was in work at this time.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Woolwich, and am an M.D. and surgeon—on 8th July I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the deceased' child—it was apparently about two years of age, well developed, and well nourished—there were no external marks of any importance about the body—on opening the head the vessels of the membranes of the brain were much distended and generally congested—there was a quantity of serum in each ventricle—on opening the chest I found extensive adhesions of the pleura on both sides, and a quantity of pus in each cavity—the pericardium was entirely dis<lb></lb>tended with turbid serum, and the head itself was covered with a fibri<lb></lb>nous deposit, indicating acute inflammation of the pericardium, and acute pleurisy—all that may arise from various causes, the original cause in the majority of cases is cold—all the other organs of the abdomen were healthy—the cause of death was inflammation of the pericardium—it is difficult to fix an exact limit to its existence, it must have taken some time, some ten days I should say must have elapsed since the commencement of the peri<lb></lb>carditis—the stomach contained a "little semi-fluid matter, mixed apparently with a small quantity of tea leaves—the cause of death was clearly indi<lb></lb>cated—if I had been called in ten days before I could have ascertained the nature of the disease—there was no obscurity, about it whatever, the symp<lb></lb>toms would be very well marked, it was a disease amenable to treatment—I mean in contradistinction to other diseases—fortunately there are few that are unamenable to treatment, which must run on to death—if I had been called in ten days or so before its death, I believe I could have applied re<lb></lb>medies that would have been beneficial to health, which would have in<lb></lb>creased the chances of recovery—I cannot presume to say more than that—a child may die of the slightest disorder, as well as of a more serious one—I have heard the term "conculsions" mentioned, but that is a term used in such a very loose way by that class, of persons that I do not attach any im<lb></lb>portance to it—I do not believe that real conculsions existed—the child must have been in great pain, and unable to lie down—with such a chest as I found the breathing would be much oppressed—there were symptoms of fever, of course.</p>

               <p>and weak wine and water would be desirable—there are differences of opinion in the profession as to the use of calomel, some approving and others disapproving of it—no doubt leeches would be very strongly objected to by homceopathists, they would think it very injudicious—probably they might think the same of calomel in the doses in which I should administer it—I should administer larger doses than a homoeopath—if I am to give an opinion I should certainly say it would be almost useless to apply homoeopathic medicines in a case like this.</p>

He may altogether have mistaken what his duty was; still I believe it was an honest mistake. It may be an ignorant mistake, in all probability it is the result of igno<lb></lb>rance and superstition, but certainly there is not, a trace" of anything like an intentional omission of duty or a culpable omission of duty within the meaning of that expression as used in the Criminal Law., I am therefore clearly of opinion that it is not a case for an indictment, nor a case for a judge to deal with in a Criminal court; if the Legislature (as they have done in dealing with the case of the prevention of small pox), are minded to pass a law on the subject, that, is a different matter, and it would be quite right then that persons should be cornpelled to conform to it although they themselves may personally object to it, because it is the law of the society in which they live, and they are bound by that law if society chooses to enact it. But I am clearly of opinion that no judge sitting in a Criminal court, without any direction or enactment of the Legislature, would be justified in saying that a parent who exercised his best judgment though a perverted one, in dealing with his child by nursing and care instead of calling in a doctor to apply blisters, leeches, and calomel, was guilty of criminal negligence.

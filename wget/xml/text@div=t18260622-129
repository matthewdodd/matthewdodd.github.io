               <p>FRANCES SAMUEL. I live at Stoke Newington. On the 23d of May, at ten o'clock in the evening, I was in <placeName id="t18260622-129-crimeloc641">Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see him at all? A. No; there were no boys near me when it was taken - I saw some afterwards.</p>

            . I was in a shop in Rathbone-place, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went out and saw the prisoner drop something black - I picked it up, and gave it to the lady - the watchman stopped him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A. No; he was running very fast - I only saw him about half a minute - I cannot tell whether he had a hat or a cap on - I can swear to his face, because there was a gaslight - I have said it was by his trousers that I could swear to him.</p>

               <p>The indictment was opened by Mr. Raine, and the case by Mr. Const.</p>
               <p>HENRY EDWARDS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am an <rs id="t17990109-11-viclabel69" type="occupation">officer belonging to Bow-street</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17990109-11-victim142 t17990109-11-viclabel69"></join>: In consequence of information of robberies, I was employed, with Dowsett and Jones, on Saturday, the 10th of November, to go to Hounslow-heath, we went in a post-chaise; we arrived at Bedfont as near seven o'clock in the evening as could be.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It was dark by that time? - A. Yes. At the door of the Bell public-house, at Bedsont, I observed two men on horseback; we proceeded on towards Staines turnpike, which is at the end of Bedsont-lane; about ten minutes afterwards, just as we got to the lane end that goes up to Stanwell, they came up to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a glass behind your chaise? - A. Yes; and Dowsett kept looking through the glass all the way we came, after having seen these two men, they both came up to the chaise on the near side, I sat on the near side, Jones in the middle, and Dowsett on the off side; they both rode past the chaise, and one of them went up to the boy and held up his hand in this kind of way, (describing it); and said, d-n your eyes, your b-r, stop; and the other having gone past, was obliged to turn his horse back to come to my window, he tapped at the window with the barrel of his pistol, which I could see very plainly, and said, d-n your eyes, you b-r, give me your money; I told them not to use us ill, and I would; then the man at the horses' heads said, d-n your eyes, Jack, give it to them -</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner's name is John? - A. Yes. And he fired that instant through the side glass, as I was pulling it down with my left hand -</p>
               <p>Q.Which of the men was it that fired? - A. The man who was at my side, and demanded my money; we found, when we got to Bedfont, that the ball had gone out at the opposite frame; I then fired at him, and said to my brother officer, so that he could hear me, I am certain that I have hit him; then the man at the head of the horses fired at the front of the chaise, and if I had not been stooping, had I been sitting upright, the bullet must have hit me; I was going to get out, and the man at the horses' heads says, holloa, Jack, d-n your eyes, are you hurt, if you are not, come this way; then Jones fired immediately, and the man at the horses' heads rode off; I got out of the chaise, and went back in pursuit of the other, but could not find him; it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you an opportunity of observing the horse? - A. I had, from the flash of both pistols, both his and mine; the horse's head being close to the glass, I could see that it was a dark brown horse, I could see perfectly the colour of the front part of the horse, but could not see the man's face, he had a kind of a rough shag brown bath coat on; the horse appeared to be between thirteen and fourteen hands high.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing about his head? - A. No, I did not observe any white about his head, it was the smallest horse of the two.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen that horse since? - A. Yes, I have, at Mr. Kendall's stables, in Long-acre, and at Bow-street likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak positively to that being the horse which the man rode? - A. Yes, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Mr. Knowlys. Q. It was dark, you say? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the only observation you made upon this horse, was from the flash of the pistols, during the short time which this transaction occupied? - A. And being so close to the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell us, that, by the flash of a pistol in a dark night, you can positively swear to the colour of a horse? - A. I can.</p>
               <p>Q.You do not even know whether there was any white about the horse's head? - A. I did not observe that there was, I took no particular notice of the horse, but its being a remarkable small brown horse; I knew him among a dozen others while he was standing in the stable.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you undertake to swear now to the height of the horse? - A. I took it to be between thirteen and fourteen hands high.</p>

               <p>Q. You had no opportunity of seeing the legs of the horse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet, in a dark night, you will undertake to swear to the horse? - A. I am certain to the horse, and nobody shall persuade me off of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The horse that you have seen since has a great deal of white in the face? - A.Very little; I believe there is a little bit of a white spot.</p>
               <p>Q.You were shewn a horse, for the purpose of judging whether that was the horse you saw upon that occasion? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And cannot you now recollect, whether that horse had any white in his face, or not? - A. It was never shewn to me in particular to judge; it was shewn to the other and the post-boy.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090018"></xptr>Q. Has he any white in his face? - A. I do not think that he has, I did not perceive any white at all about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine him in the stable? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he has no white in his face? - A. I believe he has none, there may be a white hair or two.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the colour of the horse? - A. A dark brown horse.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you say now whether he has any white legs or not? - A. He has not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. By the flash of the pistols, you not only had an opportunity of seeing the size and colour of the horse, but his shape? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you singled the horse out afterwards, without being shewn to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. If there were many other brown horses, could you have picked him out? - A. Yes, if he had been among fifty horses in a field I could have picked him out; he was a remarkable square-built little horse.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a conductor of the patrole; I was with the last witness and Dowsett in the chaise, at Bedsont, I sat in the middle, I did not see the men till they came up to the chaise; one of them went to the horse's heads, and said, holloa, stop, you b-r, stop; then the other man came to the chaise door, and tapped at the window, but whether he had a pistol or not, I did not see, I was looking after the man at the head of the horses; the man at the window demanded our money; we told them we would give it them directly; the man at the horses' heads then holloaed out, d-n your eyes, Jack, give it them directly: he had no sooner said that, than the man at the door fired through the window; Edwards immediately fired at him, and I still kept looking at the man at the horses' heads, expecting he would fire; Edwards had no sooner fired his pistol from the chaise, than the man at the horses' heads immediately fired at the front of the chaise; the ball that came from the horses' heads went through the glass, and cut the side of my face: I could then see him pull his left hand rein, and he went off; we then jumped out of the chaise; I heard Edwards cry out, I have hit him; we could not find the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of seeing the horses? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were in the middle, you say, and of course more forwards in the chaise than the other two officers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you do not venture to swear to the horse at all? - A. No, my eye was kept upon the man at the from of the chaise.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DOWSETT sworn. - I was with the two last witnesses: I looked through the glass behind, in consequence of having seen two men on horseback, I kept looking back for a mile and a half, and they did not come; just as we had got to the lane that turns up to Stanwell, they came up; I immediately said, here they are, be upon your guard, expecting one to come on each side, but they both came on the near side, I sat on the off side; they both rode past the chaise, the one on the mare, the tallest horse, rode against the post-boy, swinging a pistol round his head, and swore, stop you b-r, stop, and came against the boy with so much violence as almost to knock him over the off horse; the other man then turned his horse towards the chaise, and came to the door with a pistol, tapped against the glass, and demanded our money; Edwards said, do not be in a burry, or something of that sort; he put his hand to the window to let it down, when the man at the horses' heads said, d-n you, Jack, give it them directly; he then fired, and the ball went through the chaise, and out at my side; from the flash of the pistol I could see the horse's head and pummel of the saddle, and the man's flap of his coat; it was a close-bodied short-necked horse, and tight made; a brown bay, you may properly call it, I believe, it was a singular kind of horse; and I am very positive that the horse I have since seen is the same horse; the horse was upon the prance all the time, he did not stand still at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a brown bay? - A. A dark brown; I suppose he was between thirteen and fourteen hands high, it was considerably smaller than the other; Edwards immediately fired at the man, and said, I am sure I have hit him; and immediately the man at the horses' heads fired into the chaise; Jones returned the fire, which I blamed him for, for the other man was coming round, as I thought, to my side of the chaise, but upon Jones firing, he called out to the other man, d-n you, Jack, are you hurt, if you are not come along this way; and then turned his horse and went off; I got out of the chaise, took out the saddle-horse of the chaise, and pursued, but could not overtake him; I went the next day to No. 59, Gee-street, Goswell-street, where I found the prisoner at the bar, and Mrs. Barrington was in the room with him; he was lying in bed upon his back, and seemed to be very ill; I then went for Mr. Andrews, the surgeon, to see if he was sit to be removed; and, in consequence of that, he was removed to Carpmeal's house, in Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the matter with him? - A. He was shot, as I understand, I did not see his face that night, or else I should have known it, I know him very well; I saw the horse at the Red-lion, at Hounslow, it was a remarkable horse, and I have not a doubt but it is the same horse.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090019"></xptr>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Was the horse you found at Hounslow a dark brown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any white about it? - A. There may be a grey hair or two in the face.</p>
               <p>Q. For any thing you saw, all his legs might have been white? - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Q. And the hind quarters might be white? - A. No; I saw the hind quarters as he turned round.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you will pretend to swear to this horse? - A. I have no doubt about it; I flatter myself I know so much of horses I cannot well be mistaken.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HARRIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a labourer at the India-house: On Thursday the 8th of November, I saw the prisoner at the Mogul's head, in Drury-lane, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon. I lodge in the same house; there was one Clarke, and Bottom a currier, there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known Clarke any time? - A. I have seen him twice before; Haines said, I was the only person he wanted to see, that he wanted me to get him a horse for to-morrow; I then told him the only person I knew that was likely to got him one was Thomas Coles; he then appointed that I should meet him the next day, at the Green Man and Still, in Cow-cross; I met him there the next day, and there was Clarke with him; I went from there to Coles's, and Coles was not at home; then I went from there to Mr. Brown's livery stables, in Clipstone-street, Mary-le-bonne; I left them at a public-house the corner of Fitzroy-square, I was to call for them if I got the horse; I got the horse and called upon them; Haines desired me to ride through the town, and I rode him to the corner of a street in Piccadilly, I do not know what street; when I got to Piccadilly, I delivered the horse to the prisoner, Clarke was then with him on foot; he told me he was going to Crcydon, and he should return that night, about nine o'clock, I never saw him after that till Monday morning; I made inquiry, and found Clarke near the Elephant and Castle, in St. George's-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, by any means, from Clarke's information, find Haines? - A. Yes; there was a person with Clarke who went with me for the purpose of shewing me the prisoner, to No. 1, Union-square, Islington, there I found Haines in bed; I asked him how he did; and he said, he was very bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what was the matter with him? - A. Soon after the doctor came in, and Clarke with him, and they helped him up in bed, and the doctor examined his wounds; and during that time, Haines said, he was certain it was the Bow-street officers that had shot him, for the glasses were all up, and the door opened a different way from what they in general do; he then said, that after they had fired, they got out of the chaise, and that he afterwards had a great way to come to the public-house, and that, from the loss of blood, he had a hard matter to get there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where it happened? - A. He said it was about four or five miles from the public-house that he came to.</p>
               <p>Q. What house did he say that was? - A. The Nag's-head, at Hounslow; and the landlord there got him a chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity to observe what sort of a horse it was? - A. A dark bay horse, or at least a dark brown horse, it had no particular mark upon it; it was a very remarkable horse, tight made, short necked, and very active.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the horse that was produced at Bow-street? - A. Yes; that was the very same horse that I had of Mr. Brown for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you a labourer in the India-house now? - A. No, I have been in confinement lately.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it then that you have ceased to be a labourer in the India-house? - A. I have not been there since I was taken into custody for getting the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What jail have you been in? - A. In the House of Correction.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Upon this business was it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You came from there now, do not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were afraid to trust you out? - A. If I had tried for bail I might have had it.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether the horse was hired for yourself, or for the prisoner, we are to learn from you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day did you go about this horse? - A. About two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had been honestly employed at that time, you would have been at the India-house? - A. I sometimes employ myself in buying and selling horses.</p>
               <p>Q. But at this time you neither went to buy nor sell a horse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Brown then trusted you with the horse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Brown did not see where you took him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I am afraid I must not ask you if you went on this horse with him? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did ride it as far as Piccadilly, at least? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a great coat on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As persons would have that were going out of town? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You would think it impertinent in me if I asked you if you had pistols in your pocket? - A. No, I had not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what time they got up next morning? - A. I cannot tell; they had breakfast after they got up; I know that was about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did they quit your house? - A. I did not see them after that, I never saw them to change a word with them, I only served them with what they wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they go away? - A. On horses, I take it, I do not know, the ostler can tell you; I do not go into the stables once in a month.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this did you see the prisoner again? - A. I saw him about nine at night, that same Saturday night, about nine o'clock, he walked into the fore parlour, and called for sixpennyworth of brandy and water, and then he sat down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether, after that, he changed his seat? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular after that? - A. No, he called for a bason of water to wash his hands, the servant girl brought it to him; he asked me if I could get a chaise for him; I sent my little boy for a chaise, and while he was gone, he said, he had been sayed, or shot, in Belsont-lane, but could not tell by whom; then he called for another sixpennyworth of brandy and water, and when the chaise came up, he desired me to ask what the chaise came to to Smithfield; I asked the ostler, he told me fifteen shillings and sixpence, and he paid the boy for the chaise, and gave him two shillings and sixpence for himself, and sixpence for turnpikes; the chaise came up to the door, and he told the ostler to drive the chaise close to the door, for he was rather lame, he said, he would walk to the chaise, and as he was going to the chaise, I saw the back of his coat dirty, I saw no more of him after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem well or ill? - A. He did not seem ill to me in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he went, did he deliver any thing to you? - A. Yes, a pair of pistols, a pair of spatter-dashes, and a pair of spurs; he told me to take care of them for him; my girl held the candle for him to go into the chaise, and I stood quite in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to her? - A. Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at any of the chairs he had sat upon in the front parlour? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Haines and Clarke coming to your house, and supping there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Haines dressed? - A. In a striped waistcoat and corderoy breeches, with a close buttoned coat, a white neck handkerchief round his neck, and a silk one over it.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he any great coat? - A. He had one on his arm, and laid it down, it was a brown rough great coat; when Haines came in, Clarke seemed very fond of him, and said he had not seen him for a great while, and was glad to see him, and he agreed to come there, and have something; they talked so while I was laying the cloth; Haines said, he was going to London as soon as he had supped, for he had very particular business, and must go to market, and when I went to clear the cloth, Clarke said, this gentleman sleeps here to-night; I lit Clarke to bed, and then I lit Haines to bed; Haines desired me to call him at five, for he had some particular business to do at market; he had a blue apron on, which he untied while I was in the bed-room with him, and I thought he was a market, gardner; they got up again about eleven o'clock, they had their breakfast; Haines said, he was going to market, and the other said, he was going a different road; I saw Haines mount his horse, but I did not take notice where Clarke went to, and, about nine o'clock on Saturday evening, I saw Haines there again, and he desired a chaise to be got to go to town; he said, he had been sigged; my master sent for a chaise; he seemed to me very uneasy, and put his hand to his back; I did not take notice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090021"></xptr>of it to any body, because I thought it did not concern me; I saw him go away; I offered to light him, and he told me he did not want any candle, I need not trouble myself; I then saw that his coat was very dirty; I went to clean the room, and found the chairs that he had been sitting on were very muddy, I was obliged to take a wet cloth; he had sat in two chairs, he had moved from the chair he first sat in, and sat behind the door.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt about the prisoner being the man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You perhaps knew Clarke before? - A. Yes, I knew him when I lived in Piccadilly.</p>

               <p>Q. What business was Clarke, when you first knew him? - A. I never knew him further than seeing him come into the room; one called himself a market gardener, and the other said, he kept a public-house in London.</p>

               <p>Mr. Raine. (To Hommond). Q. I think you said, Haines returned about nine in the evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any horse run out of your yard soon after that? - A. Yes, I heard a horse go out of the yard directly after, but we have a great many horses in our yard.</p>

             sworn. - I am a post-boy: A chaise was sent for to the Nag's-head, at Hounslow, a little better than half after nine in the evening, Hammond told me, to go to Smithfield; I took up some man that I did not know, I went to the Windsor-castle, at Hammersmith, and there the man in the chaise told me to stop and take some refreshment; he called for a glass of brandy and water, I drank after he had drank, and the landlord had drank; then he got out of the chaise, and went into the back room, and I went into the taproom, and he ordered me another sixpenny worth of brandy and water; I had been there about five minutes, when another man came in, and asked, if I was going to town; I told him, I could not take him without leave of the gentlemen that I had brought with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him? - A. Yes; and he gave me a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. You proceeded to town with these two persons? - A. Yes; and the man that got into the chaise last, when I got between Kensington and town, told me to stop at the first house that was open; I told him, there would be none till I got to Piccadilly; when I got to Hyde-park-corner, the same man put the glasses down, and told me to go very softly over the stones to Westminster; when I got to Westminster, he told me to stop, and he got out of the chaise, and went to a public-house, and called for another sixpennyworth of brandy and water, and called another man out.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that got in first, had not spoke to you? - A. No. Then he took some brandy and water to the man in the chaise, but I do not believe he drank any, for I brought the glass back. Then he told me, he wanted to get some assistance for that gentleman, for he had a fall from his horse, and dislocated his collar bone; he then told me to go on to the Obelisk, in St. George's-fields, and I sat him down near the Elephant and Castle. While I was waiting for the other man to come from the public house, the first man seemed to be in a great deal of pain; he groaned once or twice, as if he was in pain, and put up the glasses; by that time, the other man had come back, and said, my man, we do not want you any further, I will get the gentleman some assistance, and take him home in a backney coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that near the Obelisk? - A. Yes, within about one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a coat had he on, do you know? - A. It appeared very dirty, and appeared such a coat as I have got on, a rough coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Just before you got home to Hounslow, what did you observe? - A. A Little brown horse loose in the road, he followed me, sometimes behind, and sometimes by the side of my horses; I put him in the stable, and gave him some corn, it was about four o'clock in the morning, I did not take his faddle off, I observed that one girth was broke; I went into the stable about ten the next morning, and saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. What size is he? - A. About fourteen hands and an inch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing further about the faddle? - A. Not till the officer came; I observed, that upon the near side of the faddle, there was some blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any white marks about him? - A. No, only under the faddle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there about the head? - A. I do not believe there were any.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a shape was he? - A. A tight made little horse, very active, and full tailed, and a shortish neck.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You took no particular notice of the head? - A. Not particularly.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a surgeon: On the 16th or 17th of November, I went to Gee-street, Goswell-street, to examine the prisoner; I found that he was wounded in the left shoulder; he was extremely weak, apparently from the loss of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you conceive to have been the cause of that loss of blood? - A. Apparently from balls; one ball had certainly gone through him.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a ball do you suppose that to have been? - A. A large pistol ball: he was then removed to Carpmeal's, and some days afterwards I extracted a ball from his shoulder. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Q.(To Edwards). Have you got the pistol here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any of the balls that you put into that pistol? - A. Yes, (produces some); I had put four of these balls and one large one into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that ball which Mr. Andrews has produced? - A. This is exactly the same kind of ball, so much so, that if it was put with the rest, I could not pick it out.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Andrews). Do you believe there are any balls within him now? - A. I believe there are.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been a considerable issue of blood, from whence did that blood proceed? - A. I did not see him for a week after, but I should suppose from the fore part of the shoulder; one ball passed through, and therefore it might bleed on both sides, between the body and the point of the shoulder</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Edwards). Q. That is a great deal less than the bore of your pistol? - A. Yes, I only put in four of these to assist the other large one, in case of any thing happening.</p>
               <p>Dowsett. A great coat was found in Haines's lodgings, which we did not take away, because he had it round him; it was very dirty, the dirt had not been rubbed off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. What Harris has said is entirely false.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you chuse to give any account how you came by your wound-you may use your own discretion?</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no answer.</p>

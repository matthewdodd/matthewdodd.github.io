On the 29th of January this jack was stolen from the side of my door - I saw it about two o'clock when I went to dinner; and in three minutes my little girl came running down, and said, there was a thief - I ran up, and the lad whom I had left in the shop was gone - I pursued into Oxford-street, but the prisoner escaped; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150089"></xptr>the same evening I saw the jack in a broker's shop in Great St. Andrew-street - I am certain of it - my private mark is on it. In consequence of a description of the man I went and saw the prisoner about two hours after, going into a broker's shop, in Little White Lion-street, and he was taken.</p>

            . I am a patrol, and was sent for, and took the prisoner - I told him it was for stealing a jack - he said he knew nothing about it - I had not found Wright then - I asked him what part of the street it was left in; he said, "Mr. Wright can tell you that, for I told him" - he said he left it at the shop with the boy till the woman came in - I then went to No. 29, Great St. Andrew-street, Seven-dials, and found it - the prisoner afterwards said a boy gave it him to sell.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a young man, who asked me to earn 1s., and gave it to me to sell - I left it at this shop - when I was taken the lad was behind me, but ran away.</p>

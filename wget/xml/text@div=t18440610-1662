               <p>years. In consequence of something that transpired, I placed myself to watch him—about six o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 28th of May, I saw Riley-go to the gate of our yard, and let himself in with a key—I kept an eye on the premises—we have two entrances—I went round to Wardour-street, and saw the gates open—I then went back to the Dean-street entrance, and soon after Sharman came out of the Wardour-street entrance—I had not known him be<lb></lb>fore—he had twelve boards, twelve feet long, on his shoulder—it was quite as much as a man could carry—I went round and met him in Queen-street—I stopped him—he laid down the boards—I asked him where he got them from—he said, "From your yard"—I asked what he had paid for them—he said, "Ten shillings"—I said, "What, only 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for so many boards? I suspect there is something wrong, and shall give you into custody for stealing them"—he went away, leaving the boards, and, as I did not see a policeman just at the time, I went into the yard—I saw Riley there—I asked him if any one had been there—he said, "No"—I said, "Has not the man out of Rose-street been?"—he said, "No"—(Sharman lived there)—I said, "He has taken some boards, and they are stolen, if you have not seen him"—he said he had not seen Sharman since Sunday last—I afterwards got a policeman, and went to Sharman's house, in Rose-street—he said he did not care, he had tendered half-a-sovereign, and the man could not give him change; he would explain it—I said, "You had better come up and explain"—the policeman was outside, and took him—I then went to the yard with the policeman, and saw Riley—I asked if Sharman had been there—he said, on his oath, he had not seen him since Sunday—I desired him to come to the Police-court—he came—Sharman was there—I made my statement before the Magistrate—then Riley said it was his fault, he let him have the goods, and he was to pay him after breakfast—upon that he was put into the dock—Sharman pulled out two half-sovereigns, and said that was the money he had borrowed to pay for it, but the man could not give him change—these boards are worth 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and are my master's.</p>

I live at 18, Minerva Street, Hackney Road, and am a potman—on 8th December I saw the deceased in Hackney Road lying on the ground about a yard and a half from the kerb, on the near side, and a yard and a half from his cab—there was a horse in his cab which stood in the dires<lb></lb>tion of Victoria Park, and a brougham and horse driven by the prisoner was going in the other direction—if I had been riding on the box, the man would have been lying on the road on my left, between the cab and the kerb—it was a four-wheeled cab, and he was about a foot from the wheels of it—the brougham and the cab were close together when I was there—I helped Morgan up and put him into his cab—I did not notice any cut or wound about him—two persons who were in the cab got out and stopped the brougham.</p>

I am a cabinet maker, of 224, Gloucester Street, Cambridge Heath—I was in the deceased man's cab, with Mr. Black more—the driver was sober—a collision took place, we were then about five feet from the near side kerb—the road is about forty feet broad at that part—the collision gave us a shock, and we thought we were going over; I was on the side that went up, and Mr. Black more pushed against me and we</p>

               <p>balanced the cab, or else very likely it would have gone over—it was against the off fore-wheel, and the driver fell off from the shock—I afterwards saw the brougham driven by the prisoner, I ran after it and stopped it—there were people inside, Mr. John Davidson was one of them—the prisoner was not sober—there was plenty of room for the brougham to have passed the cab—the deceased was put into his cab and taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Mr. Saunders, in the cab—his descrip<lb></lb>tion of the collison is correct—the driver was sober, in my judgment—I saw him lying on the near side of his cab, between the kerb and the cab, perfectly insensible, and groaning heavily—it was a moonlight night, and very frosty, and the road was slippery—it was not foggy—there was plenty of room for the brougham to have passed without colliding with the cab—the brougham was about twenty feet away—I went up to it with my friend, and saw the prisoner, who was the driver of it—he was the worse for liquor, I mean drunk—I formed that opinion from his general manner—I asked him his name, but I could not get it out of him, he said he had no Christian name—he told me his surname with some difficulty, but I had to ask him several times—he then said it was Mansfield—I told him he was perfectly incapable of driving a brougham, but he said nothing—I told him he had injured a man very seriously; he said nothing to that.</p>

I live at 8, Edgware Road—I was in this brougham, with my daughter and two friends—it was hired, and the prisoner was the driver—we had been to a friend's house—the prisoner was told to come at 11.30, and we kept him waiting till 12.33 or 12.40—my friend gave him a small glass of gin, as it was a very cold night—I cannot say whether he was sober or not—we were not going at any great pace, and the collison was so slight that I did not know whether it was against a carriage or over a stone—the cab horse came up against the brougham door—we were both in the middle of the road when the collision happened—I got out and reprimanded the prisoners—they were both on their right side of the road, and he was in the middle of the road, to keep the horse on his legs—I was twenty feet from the cab when I got out, the brougham had not moved a peg; the cab horse was almost against the brougham door when I got out—the result of the collision was that two vehicles stopped together, but they did not block—when I got out they seemed close together; they had not moved—I do not think I was taking a nap; I am sure I was not</p>

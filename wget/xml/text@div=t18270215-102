               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was 7s. a fair price? A.

When I had the sample from him in the morning, he asked if I would buy it at 7s. a yard; I said I did not know what it was worth, and I went to Durant, who said, "If you can get it for less, I will find a market for it, and we will share the profit;" Jones being a respectable tradesman, I did not consider there could be any thing wrong in it; he said a friend of his, who was a manufacturer, had it to sell, and wanted to make up some money.</p>
               <p>GEORGE COOPER. I live in John-street, East-lane, Old Kent-road, and have known Cleeves nearly five years; I saw him last Wednesday fortnight, in the morning - the day of the month I do not know; I went to his house at twenty minutes past seven o'clock, and remained with him till half-past eight - as I went along Brick-lane I heard the clock strike half-past seven.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you in his company every morning? A. No - I called there, having been sent into Brick-lane; his wife and child were there - he was at work all the time; nobody else was in the room; I had not been there before for two years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear of his being apprehended? A. Not till yesterday, when he sent for me to come here.</p>

            . I live in Anchor-street, Bethnal-green, on the first floor; Cleeves lived on the second floor. On the 31st of January I did not see him at home, but heard him get out of bed, and go into his room, between seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150062"></xptr>and eight o'clock; I heard him speak to the baby about five minutes after he went into his room.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you not his mother-in-law? A. Yes. I heard his wife blowing the fire; I heard somebody go up to him, but did not hear them talking; I do not know Cooper.</p>

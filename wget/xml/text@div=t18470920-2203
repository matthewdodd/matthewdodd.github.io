                  </hi> I am wife of John Brown, of the Harrow-road. The prisoner was our servant—I discharged her on the 1st of Aug.—I had re<lb></lb>turned from the country the day before—five weeks after she was gone, I missed two shifts, three pairs of stockings, some socks, and a gold ring—the ring had been locked up in a workbox the day before I went into the country—I had seen it safe five or six weeks before—I gave the prisoner in charge at her mother's—she was taken to the station—I was present when she was searched—she had on one of my shifts—I said, "That is my shift"—she said, "I am sure it is not; I had three of them three months ago"—I asked what she had done with the other two—she said they were worn out—this is my shift (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and the one she had on, I swear to by the cut of the neck and the twilled tape it is bound with.</p>

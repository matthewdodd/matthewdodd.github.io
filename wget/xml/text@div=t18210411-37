My watch was then in my fob, I saw the prisoner advancing towards me, at a quick pace, and when he came even with me, I felt my watch going very gently - he hardly made any stop - I had hold of my wife's arm, and had an umbrella in my other hand. I turned round and saw the back of the case of my watch in the prisoner's hand; he darted away; I went after him, and cried Stop Thief! There was a great noise of carriages. I saw him for several yards, but could not come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110022"></xptr>up with him. I did not see him stopped, he got out of my sight as the carriages intervened; I ran round the carriages, and found him in custody of the next witness, who had my watch. I am quite sure it was the prisoner who took it.</p>

            . I am a carver and gilder; I was at the head of the procession, it was the Society of Odd Fellows, going to the East London Theatre. I saw the prisoner running, two others were running behind him; the others tried to obstruct me in pursuing the prisoner. I directly got between them and shoved them away, and pursued the prisoner. He ran backwards and forwards several times. I at last stopped him, near the bridge; he had his left hand in his left hand breeches pocket, part of the watch chain was out of his pocket; I shoved him back on the pavement, he fell, and the watch fell out of his hand. I picked it up, Byron came up in a minute or two, and asked if I had got the watch. I said I had - he claimed it, and said the prisoner was the person, but he did not wish to prosecute him.</p>

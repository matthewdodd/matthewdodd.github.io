               <p>in the evening, I was at the South Eastern Hotel, Tunbridge, which was kept by George Breeze, the deceased—the prisoner was in the house, and her husband, or a man I knew as her husband—I have known him from a boy, and have known her some time—she was the worse for liquor—they were in the house when I went in—a quarrel commenced between her and her husband—Mr. Breeze was in the bar—the prisoner's husband went out and she threw a pint pot out of the door at him, upon which Mr. Breeze came round the bar and attempted to put her out—he asked her to go out, but I did not hear what she said—he then came round the bar and attempted to put her out, and she fell down by the door—I mean that he took hold of her and she fell on the ground and put her arms round his legs and then bit his right leg inside just below the knee—he had trousers on—she went away afterwards—he said "Oh, you have bitten my leg"—after she had gone out he turned up his trousers and showed me his leg, and the blood was running down—I did not see him again till next day when I went into the bar, and he said that his leg was very painful—he was managing his business—I never saw him after<lb></lb>wards—he had been there five or six months—I do not know what aged man he was, but by the paper he appears to have been thirty-seven—he was not an old man—I do not know much about his habits as to drink—I know he used to drink, but I never saw him drunk.</p>

I am a printer and live at Baden Road, Tunbridge—I was at the South Eastern Hotel on the 27th September—I was not there when the prisoner was turned out, it was an hour and a half after<lb></lb>wards—the deceased told me that a woman had bitten his leg, and he showed me his leg—it was bleeding a very little then—I saw him the next evening, Friday, when his leg looked a little worse; it looked mortified; at least, it looked more inflamed than it was before—I did not see him on the Saturday—I saw him on the Sunday, in bed; he was then very ill, and he said he was suffering from his leg—I saw his leg that day about 12 o'clock, it was more inflamed than it was on the Friday—he was not in the habit of lying in bed on Sundays, but he was com<lb></lb>plaining of his leg, and I sent for a doctor, Mr. Irving, who came on the Sunday afternoon, and I never left the deceased, except for refreshment, till "Wednesday morning at 3 o'clock, when he died—on the Monday morning his leg was a little swollen, and on the Tuesday it was about half as big again as the other leg—I also noticed something else the matter with him, he looked mad—he was delirious—he began to be delirious on the Tuesday morning about 3.30; he was seeing visions, and he said that he saw dogs—that was the first time I saw any symptoms of delirium—that continued till about three hours before he died—he fancied he saw objects before him—he could speak, but not sensibly—I could understand what he said—he was quite sensible before he died, the delerium went off three hours before he died—I have known him intimately for the last five months, but not more than as visiting the house—I have heard people say that he did drink a good deal, but I have never seen him the worse for drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Licentiate of the College of Physicians—I practise at Tunbridge—on Sunday, 30th September, I was called to see the deceased, George Breeze, and I went at 5 o'clock in the evening—he was in his bedroom on the bed, but not quite undressed—he was suffering from the effects of a wound on the inner side of the knee, a little. above the knee, and from the commencement of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremem</hi>—I saw the wound, it was inflamed all up the thigh to the groin—he was partially delirious then—he would rest for a moment, but every second or third question he would answer irrationally—I ascribed that to <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, and prepared for an attack of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, as those are the beginning of the symptoms, and I also treated his leg—I had never seen him before in my life—I noticed nothing else at that time but the delirium and the inflammation of his leg—I next saw him on the following morning, Monday; his condition was then worse in every respect—I had pre<lb></lb>scribed for him on the Sunday—I treated him with narcotics to try and induce sleep and endeavoued to cut off his alcohol, but it was not cut off—it is common for persons to be afraid of carrying out the doctor's orders—by degrees I stopped it altogether—my orders were slightly disobeyed,' I found that he had whisky or port wine, but not in any large quantity—on the Monday the symptoms of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> were more marked—I saw him next on the Tuesday morning, when his condition was worse in every respect—his leg was decidedly much worse, there was a great deal of swelling and inflammation—I was with him more than an hour on the night he died, which was early on the "Wednesday morning, and I had also seen him on the Tuesday evening earlier—I was not with him when he actually died, but I was within an hour of his death—he was simply comatose and moribund when I last saw him—I was called in to give a certificate of his death, and my first certificate was <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> simply; I afterwards added to that that the exciting cause of the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> was a wound on the leg—I express my opinion now that the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> was caused by the wound.</p>

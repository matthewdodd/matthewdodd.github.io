                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>whether he should go to a certain town or not—I think they were oftener left to his discretion than to our dictation—at this moment I cannot recollect any particular town that I have dictated to him to go to—I do not think I have seen him for eight years—he might not have gone to any part of England and obtained orders for us; we would not have allowed him—there was nothing in that agreement to prevent him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not his writing—I should think it is Mr. Salmon's writing—it is not the writing of any of our firm—Mr. Salmon was a person who destroyed himself—(<hi rend="italic">Several documents were here put in by</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I submit that the evidence does not establish the relation of master and servant between the prosecutors and the prisoner, but that of an agent; although the characteristics of those two relationships sometimes trench very closely upon each other, the difference is to be maintained; there are distinct statutes applicable to servants, and distinct statutes applicable to agents; there is nothing in the case which at all abrogates or increases the terms of the original written agreement, and any duties performed by the prisoner voluntarily or beyond that agreement, cannot be taken into consideration. The question is, does that agreement constitute him a servant or a mere agent; the manner in which, and the place where, he was to perform his business, was left to his own discretion; no action could lie for a breach of that agreement upon the prisoners part; it does not make him a servant, but he stands exactly in the same position as an agent to an Insurance Company; no doubt a person might be a servant, although authorized to exercise a discretion in certain matters, but there is no case of a servant where that discretion is not subsidiary, and subject to the master's orders, which in this case the prisoner clearly was not.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COMMON SERJEANT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">If the discretion is not liable to be interfered with authoritatively by the employer, then that is an absolute discretion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I think that distinction is a sound one, and fairly arises upon this agreement. In the case of Reg.</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Tite, the Jury found the prisoner to be a commercial traveller; a person who might be in one sense a clerk or servant; in this case the prisoner acted simply as an agent, I therefore contend, first, that Hue prisoner is bound by this undertaking, and that alone; and secondly, that upon the foundation of that undertaking he is neither a clerk or servant.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">on the same side). To establish this indictment, there must be a contract of hiring and service, and that necessarily supposes that the master has a right to order what shall be done, and also how and when it shall be done, and the right to terminate the contract—that is not pretended here; the agreement amounts to a simple undertaking to do business on commission, the prisoner even having to bear a portion of the bad debts. See Reg.</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Carr, Russell, and Ryan, page</hi> 198; <hi rend="italic">Reg.</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Tite, Sessions paper, Vol.</hi> 53, <hi rend="italic">page</hi> 273; <hi rend="italic">and Reg.</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Walker,.</hi> 8, <hi rend="italic">Cox Criminal Cases, p.</hi> 1.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">The nature of the relation between the parties must be ascertained by the duties agreed between them to be performed; if the written agreement be clear and definite, of course it must be binding, but if it is ambiguous, as this agreement is, it is the same thing as if there was no agreement at all, and you must then ascertain from the facts of the case the relation that really exists. The prisoner travels, collects money, and transmits it to his employers; if that is not a contract of service, I cannot see how inference is to be made stronger. I do not see how this case is to be distinguished from that of a commercial traveller. My friends rely upon the term agent; an agent, after all, has no definite legal meaning attached to it. The prisoner was clearly not authorized to carry on</hi>

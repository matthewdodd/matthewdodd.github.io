                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, of 21, Pudding-lane. I produce an order for the delivery of six dozen of champagne—it was brought to me on Tuesday, 10th Sept., by a man named Cornell or Smith; another person named Savage was with him—I delivered to Cornell one case containing three dozen of wine—the order is for six dozen—I did this merely to catch the prisoner—I was perfectly aware that it was a forgery—the value of the wine is about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am agent for Mr. Jacquenot—he consigns wine to me—I have an interest in the sale, and am responsible for the wines.</p>

From information I received I went on 10th Sept., between three and four in the afternoon, to Pudding, lane, and went past Mr. Day's house—I saw a truck there, and also saw Smith and Savage there—I went to the bottom of Pudding-lane and saw the prisoner just at the bottom of the lane, looking up the lane towards the truck; he was about twenty or thirty yards from Smith and Savage—I saw a case of wine put into the truck, and Smith and Savage went away with it to the top of Pudding-lane, where it was blocked in with a horse and cart—as soon as it went away the prisoner and another man who was with him went away towards London-bridge—the truck was detained some time in Pudding-lane, and during that time the man who was with the prisoner came up Fish-street-hill and went into Pudding-lane, and spoke to Smith and Savage, who were with the truck—he afterwards turned back and went down Fish-stret-hill, towards London-bridge again; in the same direction the prisoner went, the truck went over London-bridge exactly in the same direction as the prisoner went—I took Smith and Savage into custody—the prisoner I could not see on London-bridge.</p>

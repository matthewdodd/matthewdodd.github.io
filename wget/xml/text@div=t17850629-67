               <p>I went to see an acquaintance in the Borough, and returning home a man asked me to look at some handkerchiefs, he said he was afraid of the custom-house officers, he shewed me some, I did not approve of them, and I bought some linen of him at 22 d. per yard, he sold it me for fourteen yards, and I brought it home and kept it four or five days, and I got Mrs. Halloway to make it for me, as my wife goes out every day with fruit and fish.</p>

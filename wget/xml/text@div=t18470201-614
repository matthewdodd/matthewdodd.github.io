               <p>half past eleven o'clock—the deceased came to the door as I came to it, with a bundle under her arm, as if mangling clothes—she seemed pretty well, as well as she always was—she knocked at the door, and said, "Miles, open the door"—he opened the door, and said, "Who is that you are talking to?"—she said, "Mr. Steadwell is gone up stairs to her room"—with that she went in, and the door was shut—their room is on the ground-floor—I went up stairs into my own room—my husband was up stairs with me, but he went down afterwards for some beer for supper—that was not above four or five minutes after their door was shut—he was not gone above five minutes—in about five minutes he came up again with the beer—I heard the deceased cry "Murder!" once—the cry appeared to come from her own room—when I heard her cry, I opened my room door, and she opened her room door, came out, and came to the street door, and said, "You murdering villain, you have been trying at this for years, and I suppose you have done it for me at last"—I could not see the person to whom she addressed that observation—I took the candle, looked down stairs, and found she had gone out of the passage—the street door was shut, and I heard her room door shut—I heard no more—she went out almost immediately on making that observation—I am confi<lb></lb>dent there was no one in the room after her daughter left, but themselves—I did not go down at all—they very frequently quarrelled—I did not see the deceased again till the Monday, when they came to me and said she was dying—I then went up to Mr. Steadwell's, which is three or four doors off—the deceased was then insensible—she took no notice of any one.</p>

On the 26th of Dec., about half-past eleven o'clock at night, as near as I can recollect, I went out to fetch some beer—as I came in I had to pass the door of the room where the prisoner and his wife lived—as I passed the door I heard the pri<lb></lb>soner say, "If it was not for the law I would cut your b—throat"—I went up into my own room, and shortly after heard the deceased call "Murder!"—my wife opened the door—I looked down the stairs, and saw the deceased's room door open—she came out, and went into the street—at the street door she exclaimed, "You murdering villain, you have often threntened to do this, and I think you have done it at last"—she then went into the street—the prisoner shut the door, and fastened it, and, as I supposed, went to bed—I cannot say that I heard the street door locked or bolted—I heard him fasten his own door—I heard no more that night—on the following Tuesday, in the forenoon, a female friend of the deceased called, and in consequence of what she said I went down and knocked at the prisoner's room door several times—he opened the door—he had not got all his clothes on—I said to him, "Phillips, Pray," or, "for God's sake, put on your clothes; I Understand your wife is dying"—he said, "It is all right, old boy"—I then went up into my own room.</p>

               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">WOOD</hi>. I am a surgeon. On Monday, the 28th of Dec., I was called in to see the deceased—she was insensible—judging from her symp<lb></lb>toms, she was labouring under bronchitis, which is inflammation of the air cells of the lungs—my attention was not called to the injury to her back at that time—I did not attend the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination.</p>

               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">LEE</hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called in to make a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I received the Coroner's warrant to do so on the 4th of Jan.—I made a partial examination on that day, and also on the 5th—I made a point of examining first to ascertain whether any external marks of violence could be seen—I first examined the skull and found nothing about it to indicate violence, but on the lower jaw, on the right side, I found a considerable patch of ecchymosis, or diffused blood, extravasation of the blood—I could judge whether that was an injury inflicted during life, by ex<lb></lb>amining the state of the blood vessels—I opened them, and ascertained that it resulted from an injury during life, from particular marks in the blood—that was not an injury that could lead to death—on the right side, between the hip joint and the ribs, part of the skin was abraised—the upper skin, called the epidemis, was removed—it was a piece about two inches square—I examined the internal part of the body at the same place, and found a large band extending to about the depth of six inches, extending from, or rather commencing from the medial line, or centre of the body, to the spine—it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184702010141"></xptr>
               <p>in the form of a band, six inches in width—that was inflammation, and cor<lb></lb>responding with that portion of the abdominal parts—the intestines were decomposed—part of the band was right underneath the place where the skin was abraised—I judge that the decomposition of the intestines was the consequence of the inflammation, for this reason, because it formed such a perfect contrast to the other vessels, which were so healthy—they were not at all in a state of decomposition—the injury to the intestines that I describe would be quite sufficient to account for her death—the state they were in would explain it—I cannot form any judgment as to how that injury was caused—any external violence, a blew, a fall, or a kick, would be sufficient to cause it—I examined the lungs, they were congested, as might be expected in a person of her years, and from the season of the year, but not to an extent that would cause death—I could not form any judgment as to whether she had been suffering from diarrhoea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see externally any marks of such a violent blow as would have occasioned the internal injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was ecchymosis on that part certainly, but so many days after death I cannot say whether that was not from decomposition taking place—there was nothing to enable me to say that there was a blow of sufficient violence to occasion what I found in<lb></lb>ternally—there was no appearance of such a blow, fall, or kick, as would have produced what I found inside, but there is no resistance at this part, and consequently the appearance of an external blow would not be so much seen—I mean although there was no external mark, that did not prove that she might not have had a blow, considering the want of resistance at that part.</p>

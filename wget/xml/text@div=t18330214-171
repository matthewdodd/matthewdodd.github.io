We had had a little rum; I was not affected by it, nor was the prisoner; the silk was missing; it was black, but it had been wrung, and would not stain any thing - I was about four yards from him when he put it into his bosom; I did not charge him with it before he went out - I did not know how to act, as my master was not there; there had been 41lbs. of silk in the parcel on the 26th, and this was on the 30th - there were seven other persons there; I saw the prisoner take one handful, but there were two missing - I looked at his shirt afterwards, it was not stained; that silk would not stain it.</p>

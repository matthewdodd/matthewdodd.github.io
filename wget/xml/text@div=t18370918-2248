                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 100.) I received some information that induced me to go after the old man—I found the prisoner at the bar in bed with him—I left the house for some time, and about an hour after I met the prisoner going from Greenwich towards Deptford—I said, "Where are you going, my lass?"—"To Deptford," said she, "and I came from Woolwich"—I said, "You must have made a quick passage; I saw him in bed with the pensioner"—she said, "I left him; I did not like to stop with so old a man"—I said, "What money have you got about you?"—she said, "Only one shilling"—I said, "I am afraid you have been doing the old man, as the other one did before; I shall search"—I found another shilling, a sixpence, and a halfpenny—I said, "Where did you get this?"—said she, "To tell you the truth, I have taken it from the pensioner"—I told her I should take her to the station-house—in going along I saw she wanted to shift something—I saw her going to throw something into the road—I caught hold of her by the hand, and said, "What have you got here?"—she said, "I don't know"—I said, "It is a purse, or something like it; where did you get it?"—she said, "I took that out of the pensioner's pocket likewise"—there was a half-crown, ten shillings, a sixpence, and an old piece of silver in it, which the pensioner has identified.</p>

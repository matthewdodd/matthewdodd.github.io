            . I a am bricklayer. On the 19th of December I was at the <placeName id="t18270111-109-crimeloc609">Adam and Eve public-house, Pancras-road</placeName>

I inquired for Mrs. Waterfield, who came forward; I told her the prisoner had taken something out of the till; the prisoner heard this. Mrs. Waterfield looked, and missed two half-crowns, which she said she had taken of the prisoner that morning; he was taken into the parlour, and Waterfield wished him to give up the money - he said he would not, he would stand search first - an officer was fetched, who took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not he been drinking? A. Yes; he was very tipsy indeed. I was very near him; he did not well know what he was about.</p>

            . My husband keeps this house. The prisoner frequented the house for about a week; I changed two half-crowns for him that morning, and put them into a wooden bowl in the till. I had been out of the bar about a minute and a half; my husband asked if I missed any money; I looked, and missed the two half-crowns - 8s. 4d. was found on the prisoner, and two half-crowns among it - he was very tipsy.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you think he knew right from wrong? A. I do not think he did.</p>

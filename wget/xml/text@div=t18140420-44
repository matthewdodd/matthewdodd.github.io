            , JUNIOR. On the 20th of February, I was going down <placeName id="t18140420-44-crimeloc236">Church-street, Spitalfields</placeName>

I had a bundle in one hand, and my other hand was banging down. The other man laid hold of my arm; the man that I pushed against, he shoved me with his hand against the wall. The prisoner snatched my watch from my fob, and ran away, at the time I was so pushed, while the other man was holding me.</p>
               <p>Q. So that one held you while the other took the watch out of your pocket - A. Yes. The prisoner then run away; I followed him, and cried stop thief. He ran into Spitalfields-market; I lost sight of him. While I was standing still I heard some one say come on my lad, he is taken. I went up to him; he was in Crispin-street. It was the same man who had taken the watch out of my pocket; he was standing with his back against some iron railing. He asked me if he was the man; I said yes, I would swear to it. He then gave me my watch, and begged for God's sake to let him go; he said he had a wife and a large family; I said he should not go. He was taken to the watchhouse by Mr. Rackam, and Mr. Townsend let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Townsend - A. A butcher. He let him go before Mr. Rackam took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say if I let you have the watch you would be satisfied - A. No, I do not remember saying so.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Yes, you did, and then Mr. Townsend let me go.</p>
               <p>MR. RACKAM. I live in Wood-street, No. 11. I heard the cry of stop thief; I came out. Upon that I saw the prisoner in custody of a person I did not know; the prisoner was supplicating mercy of the gentleman that held him. The gentleman let him go, and seeing him at liberty I took hold of him, and advised the prosecutor to follow me to the watch-house; he did so. I delivered the prisoner to the officer at the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am a butcher. On the 20th of February last, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in West-street, Spitalfields-market, I heard the cry of stop thief; the last voice I heard was a lad in a faint voice crying, he had lost his watch. I came out, and saw a man come in the market, and as he cleared the corner he set off running, and kept walking; it struck me he might be the party; they were giving the alarm. I hailed him; he gave me no answer; commenced running. I followed him, overtook him, and detained him two minutes. I said, gentlemen, I will thank you if you will go into the market and find out who gave the alarm; some persons went into the market, and brought the prosecutor to me. I asked him if he had any knowledge of the man I had in custody; he said that was the man that stole his watch. Upon so doing, the man said if you will forgive me I will give you the watch again. Accordingly I saw the motion of the two hands, but not the watch; as if the watch passed from one to the other, but the watch I did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the same man - A. Not to my knowledge. It was a dark night. I consider the man I detained to be a more powerful man than he appears to be.</p>
               <p>Q. to Rackam. Is that the man you saw supplicating for mercy, and which you conducted to the watchhouse - A. It is; I have no doubt at all about it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The watch produced by Hart is the watch that was taken from me by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been very ill since I have been confined; I hope you will shew mercy to me.</p>

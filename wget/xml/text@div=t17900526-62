               <p>I am wife to the prosecutor. The prisoner hired a lodging of me, a bed only for a single man; he came on the Saturday, the 1st of May; he staid only one night; he said he was come out of the country, and had no friends in town; and asked me to let him be there for a night or two, that he was going into the country again soon; he went away on the Sunday morning; the sheets were off the bed, and gone; as he went out, I observed a lump by his side; he was gone about thirty yards from the house; and I sent my daughter up to see if the sheets were gone: and a young man who lodges in the house, said he would watch him; and he went, and brought him back with the sheets upon him; the sheets are here: the constable has got them; (produced): I saw them taken off him when he came back.</p>

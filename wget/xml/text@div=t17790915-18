               <p>This affair was found out on Saturday the 24th of July. I came home and ordered my girl to undress my little daughter at ten at night.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Baldwin's-place, Baldwin's-gardens; my husband is a powder-flask maker. When I ordered the girl to undress the child, the child said mammy, wash me, I said I was so tired that I could not wash her; she said she was sore and could not walk. I drove her up stairs; when I got her up stairs I observed her to be lame; I took her up stairs and put her upon my lap; I found her private parts were swelled as big as my fist; I cried out Lord, fetch in my neighbour to look at her; she came, and said the child has been injured by a man, she has got the foul disease; I immediately took her up to Mr. Dimond, in Holbourn; Mr. Dimond ordered me to bring her up next morning; the two brothers examined her. We took the prisoner up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150026"></xptr> and had him before Sir

When we went with the warrant, the prisoner came to the door; I stood on the other side of the way, I crossed over and said that is your prisoner; he started, and said O Lord, what have I done, what have you got to alledge against me! I said young man, I am sorry for you, that you have not had more grace, go along with that gentleman, and you will know too soon to your sorrow.</p>

               <p>Was you present at the time? - I was.</p>
               <p>And the prisoner was present? - Yes. She said Mr. Wright's coachman; Sir John said where was it in the garret or the kitchen; she said neither, it was in the stable; where did he lay you? on the hay. Sir John said point out the man; she pointed out the prisoner; upon that Sir John committed him.</p>
               <p>You say the prisoner was present all this time? - He was arraigned at the bar.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said he was innocent.</p>
               <p>Did he deny the fact? - He said he was innocent. I remember the child two or three weeks before, came in to me at dinner time; she had been missing; I could not find her; I asked her where she had been; she said, mammy, I could not come for Mr. Wright's coachman locked me in the stable; I said what did he do there; she said he took up my clothes before and behind; I took up her clothes and observed her to look very red; I said to my husband what does the fellow mean by playing tricks with my child, I'll go and kick up a dust with him; he said pho, pho, the coachman is always playing with the children. My child told me another time when I told her she might take a walk along with a girl, that she would rather go with the coachman who was to give her a ride; I gave her a penny to spend; when she came home she said that instead of taking her to ride in the coach he locked her in the stable; I said no more, but sent her to bed.</p>
               <p>Do you of your own knowledge, or does any body else to your knowledge know any thing that affects the prisoner except what they had from the story of the child? - It is three times, by the child's story that he has taken her into the stable.</p>
               <p>Has any one ever seen any thing pass? - I believe not.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Poultney brought the child to me on Saturday night between ten and eleven o'clock; I looked at the child, and told her there was some degree of inflammation upon the parts; she said she apprehended the child had been injured; I told her it was impossible to judge of the state of the inflammation by candle-light, but wished she would bring her the next morning; she brought the child about nine or ten o'clock the next morning; my brother and I both inspected the child; there was some degree of inflammation in the exterior parts, and there was a little discharge.</p>
               <p>What was your opinion? - I cannot pretend to say what was the cause of it.</p>
               <p>From your view of the parts is it your opinion that she had been lain with by a man? - I cannot pretend to say that; we find inflammations in children of that age upon these parts from other causes. I could not perceive any laceration. I saw her again on the Monday morning, there appeared then rather an increase of the discharge, but the degree of inflammation was much the same.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon. I was called in by Mr. Dimond on the Monday morning to inspect this child, as Mr. Dimond did not choose to give his opinion himself. I washed the parts with milk and water; I inspected into the vagina as far as the inflammation would admit, but the inflammation was so great then that it was impossible to have such an examination as would enable one to say whether the child had been penetrated or not. If I had had the child under my care till the inflammation abated, I could have ascertained that.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband's name is John—we live at 23, Elliott Road, St. George's Road, and occupy the second floor—Shea is my brother—I remember his being taken in custody on Tuesday evening, 4th March—Hemmings was not at my place that day on my oath—a different man entered the house with my brother, about 6.30—he was quite different in his dress—Hemmings did not come up to my room that day.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FRITH</hi>. My brother brought a gentleman with him in a Hansom's cab, between 9.30 and 10 a.m.—he said, I think, that it was Mr. Woodford—he said that in the gentleman's presence, and he did not deny it—when the cab came a sack tied at the mouth was brought upstairs—I do not know what was in it—the two men came again after 6 p.m., and* the gentleman asked me to lend him a box, and I consented, provided I had it back next day—the things in the sack" were put into my box, and the gentleman asked my brother to meet him at Waterloo railway station, and wished him good evening, and gave my children some coppers—my brother took the box away at 9 o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MEAD</hi>. I have two rooms—Woodford did not assist to carry the box out—the cigars were put into the back room where the box was kept—I spoke to Harvey and gave him two boxes of cigars which were left behind in the bedroom, I suppose they could not be got into the box—they said nothing about leaving them—I do not think my brother even knew it—I did not tell Harvey that I asked these two men whether the cigars were stolen property—I said that the man who brought them said that he bought them at a sale—I did not say they said so—throughout it all I did, not know that they were cigars, I did not go into the room where the sack was, nor did I ask what they were, I had no suspicions—I saw the box carried down, and opened the street door—I swear that only one man went out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Hemmings did not come in at all—he had not been there for a fortnight or three weeks previous—the cord was put round the box at 6 p.m.—Woodford asked me if I had a kef for it—I could not find it, and he asked me if I had some cord, and I got some from the washhand-stand and he corded it—Woodford is not like Hemmings, quite different, he had a short hat and a black moustache—he could not be mistaken for him—I understand that Woodford is a commissioner at a sale-room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Kirkby, an upholsterer, of 23, Elliott Road; we let it out in lodgings, and occupy the ground floor—on Tuesday evening, 4th March, about 6.20, somebody knocked; I opened the door and saw John Shea and a strange gentleman—I swear it was not Hem<lb></lb>mings—I admitted them, but did not see them go out—I was indoors but did not notice Shea go out at 9 o'clock with the box—I did not see Hemmings that day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have seen him there visiting Mrs. Cantwell—the strange gentleman was rather stout and very showy, like a racing man—I think he had a moustache, but I did not take notice—I saw a cab come between 9 and 10 am., but did not see who got out of it, nor did I hear any voice which I recognised—I did not notice that they were carrying anything—I was at my front window ground floor—I did not go into Mrs. Cantwell's room that day—I very seldom, do.</p>

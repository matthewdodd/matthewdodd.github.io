               <p>My Lord, on Saturday the 25th of last month, I had been to dine with some friends at Blackwall, and coming home in the evening in a hackney coach, with some of the gentlemen that had hired the coach in the day time, they took me to bring me home with them, I think it was between seven and eight, somewhere on this side of Limehouse Church, near the place that they call the bun-house; there came two people and opened one each coach door; there was a cutlass put in and held to my stomach, the point very close, and demanded my money and my watch; I told him I had no watch, no money; they swore that I had a watch, and that they would have it; my seals as I sat upon the seat were seen on my breeches, they said, damn you, you have a watch, and I will have it, and one of the prisoners came to my breeches, I thought to pick my pocket, I said, damn you, I have no watch, or something like that, and I put my hands to my watch and found my watch was safe; then immediately there was a snatch, and a cry of stop thief, and the men ran away; I got up to jump out, and was going to take out my watch to leave behind the seat, and I found my seals were gone, and part of the chain; I thought to run after them, but there was a wide ditch for me to get over, so wide that I thought it was very likely I should be in the middle instead of jumping over it; they got over, and I afterwards was sent for, and the next morning a person called for me, and shewed me my seals and a part of the chain of my watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was the person that came to you the next morning? - One of the people that apprehended them, I really forget his name, there were two or three of them came together, he has the chain and seals, and has kept them in his possession ever since; on Tuesday I was obliged to attend the Magistrate, Mr. Staples, at his office; the two prisoners at the bar were brought there, they asked me if I knew either of them; I told them no, I did not, neither do I; I have not the least recollection, they had something over their faces, what it was I cannot tell, I do not know that I particularly minded.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were they masked? - I did not observe the mask, the other gentlemen said, the man on my side had a crape, and they said the man on my side had a crape, but I was intent on my watch, I did not look much at the man.</p>

A. I think to the best of my recollection; the servant of the house found this cutlass the next morning, standing up in the corner; the prisoner Dodd was the man I stopped, the other prisoner passed me in the street, while I had hold of this man by the collar, he had got as I thought a stick, but it proved afterwards to be a cutlass; I saw him make several blows at the people, as he passed along.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Dodd. Will you swear that I threw these things out of my pocket? - I have not a doubt, but I will not swear positively.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not understand the distinction? - By the motion of the man it appeared to me to come from him.</p>
               <p>What is the difference between swearing positively, and saying you have not a doubt, do you or do you not believe that he did? - To the best of my knowledge he did, I do not pretend to say positively, he had a great coat on, he seemed very much agitated, and it was in motion, and on a light being brought the things were picked up.</p>

               <p>I was standing in the passage of my own house, when I heard the cry of stop thief; I live at the Ship-tavern, Radcliff-cross, I went out immediately and saw the prisoner, and followed him to Mr. Saunderson's walk, I helped to take him, he had a hanger in his hand, and lifted it as if he intended flinging it in the river, but it fell upon a craft; when I found he was safe, I went to Mr. Green's and told him, they sent a runner, and he was brought up to the office.</p>
               <p>Did you see it taken up? - I saw it after he was taken up, I saw it in his hand, I did not see him searched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Moore. Do you swear that I was the person that threw it away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you swear that was the same hanger that I threw away? - There was a hanger taken up very much like the hanger you flung away.</p>

               <p>I am a labourer, I live in London-street, I heard the cry of stop thief, I looked up the street, and saw the prisoner Moore run down with a naked cutlass in his hand; and I stepped across to stop him, and he made a cut at me, then he flung away the cutlass, and I collared him; he offered me a guinea to let him go, and I would not take it; he attempted to fling the cutlass into the Thames, but it fell into one of the crafts.</p>

               <p>Was you by when he was searched? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>What was found upon him? - There are two guineas, a half crown piece in one purse, and a farthing, I believe it was a King Charles's fathing, and a ring or something like that in the other.</p>

               <p>Was he searched? - Not at that time, he was searched at the Justice's.</p>

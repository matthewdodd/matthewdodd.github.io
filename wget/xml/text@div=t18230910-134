Two years ago, I met the prisoner in Finsbury-square, about five o'clock in the afternoon - I had seen him before, in company with a gentleman; he asked me to go out on horseback with him; I consented, and he went home with me - my watch was on the table; he noticed it, and said one of the hands were broken, and he would get it mended, and return with it that evening; I entrusted him with it for that purpose, and did not see him again for twelve months after, when I met him in the City-road, on one of the Paddington-stages - I stopped the stage; he got down. I asked him for my watch; he said, that going from my house that evening, he was arrested, and put into the Bench, and had since that been to France, and brought me home a chain and seals to the watch, and if I would let him go home, he would return at seven o'clock that evening with them - we parted, and I did not see him again till three weeks ago, and then gave him into custody. My watch was produced at Worship-street; it is worth 10 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How often did he call with this gentleman - A. Frequently, for two years before; he might call alone. I knew his name, and where his uncle lived, and have told persons to enquire there about him - I did not go to his uncle's myself; I did not meet him at the Theatre after the watch was taken. I am certain he never gave me 2 l. for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a young lady who see company - A. Yes, I am. He did not visit me as such, but his friend did. His friend has been abroad ever since.</p>

            . I am an attorney, and live in Wynyatt-street, Goswell-street-road. About the later end of January last, I lent the prisoner 1 l. upon the duplicate of a watch and three seals, pawned at Ashman's, in the Strand, for 3 l. 10 s. I redeemed the watch in August, and have it here - I paid 6 s. interest, from November last. I had seen him wear the watch for twelve months prior.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you known him long - A. Three years; he was in a respectable attorney's office. He frequently wore the watch, with the seals attached.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you seen it in his possession further back than a year - A. It may be a year or two. I cannot say.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Friday night, three weeks ago, I understood that a lady in Cheapside, had lost her watch. There was a mob, and I found the prosecutrix holding the prisoner, and accusing him of stealing her watch; he wanted to go to the watch-house. I took him to the Compter - he acknowledged receiving the watch; he said he took it from her house; but that he had seen her two or three times since, and had given her 2 l. for it - she denied that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he gave her 2 l. for it at the Theatre, and if she returned the 2 l., he would return the watch - A. That was before the Magistrate.</p>

            . This is my watch. The seals are not mine - he never gave me any money; it is totally false.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a written Defence, after alluding to the prosecutrix's situation in life, stated that while the watch was at the watchmaker's, he met her at Covent-Garden Theatre; where she said he might keep it by giving her 3 l. - that he had only 2 l. about him, which he gave her, and on meeting her three weeks ago, in Cheapside, she demanded it, and gave him in charge.</p>

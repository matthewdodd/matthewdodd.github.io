               <p>Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - Yes; more than I desire to know. She came into our house on Friday last under a pretence of asking for her namesake; she said I was her namesake, that her name was Williams. I said my name was Williamson. She sat down; she said her husband was a Scotchman, and that she much loved the Scotch; and asked me to get a quartern of gin; I said I did not use that sort of liquor. I went and got a pennyworth of gin. I had a newspaper in my hand; she said she had found a purse with bank notes and money in it to the value of three hundred pounds, and asked me if it was advertised; she then asked me to come and dine with her on the Sabbath-day; which I did not agree to. When she was gone, I missed the cloak; there was nobody in the house besides her, my wife, and myself. On the Saturday following my wife went to the Brown Bear, in Rosemary-lane, and saw the prisoner. My wife sent for me.</p>
               <p>Did you find the cloak? - We found it where she had sold it.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you where she had sold it? - No, another woman told me; I went to the person, who said he had bought such a cloak.</p>

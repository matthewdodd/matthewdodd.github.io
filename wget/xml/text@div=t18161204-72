            . I am an officer; about one o'clock in the morning, of the 5th of November, the prosecutor came to the watch-house, saying he had been robbed. I apprehended the prisoner about two hours after; he was concealed in a coal-shed, in Denmark-street; I took him to the watch-house; he had the prosecutor's jacket on his back. We went to the coal-shed, and the man who keeps it produced a bag, which the prosecutor claimed, with its contents; next morning the prosecutor brought a coat, which he said he had found in his cabin, and the prisoner claimed it as his, and he put it on to go before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH SAVAGE. I am a watchman; the prisoner passed my box, which is near the coal-shed, with a bag; I asked him what he had got; he said it was his clothes; that he had been discharged from an Indiaman; he said, he wanted a lodging, and I recommended him to Elias, who keeps the shed; soon after the prosecutor came by, and asked me if I had seen any body with a bag, I sent him to the coal-shed. The prisoner hearing him come in, jumped out of the back-window; he was afterwards found in the coal-shed.</p>

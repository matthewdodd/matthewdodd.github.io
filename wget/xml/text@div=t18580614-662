                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Bagster, a bookseller in Paternoster Row. I watched the premises of Mr. Hodgson a bookseller—on 10th April, I placed myself behind a partition in his warehouse—I was there at about a quarter past 8 o'clock, and about a quarter before 9 o'clock I saw a man named Atley, who has since been convicted, go behind another partition and take up a bag which contained 176 volumes—I came out and saw Atley and the prisoner by the side of one another, and both running—I followed the prisoner, he went down Canon Alley into Newgate Market—I kept him in view and caught him; a butcher came up and took hold of my wrist, and twenty or thirty others came up and hustled me, and the prisoner escaped—I had not known him before; I know him now—I saw him again about 12th May, in custody—the books were the property of Mr. Thomas Hodgson, they were worth about nine guineas; they were carried down stairs and dropped at the foot of the stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Allen of the Aldine Chambers. I was there about half past 8 o'clock in the morning, on 10th April—I was on the ground floor in Mr. Allen's premises, in the office—on hearing a running down stairs and a cry of "Stop thief!" I opened the side door, and saw the prisoner drop the bag from his back in coming down the stairs—he passed the door that I had opened; there was another man with him; they both ran away together—the last witness was coming down stairs pursuing the men—I had seen the two men on several occasions before—I saw them both go up stairs that morning—I am certain the prisoner is one of them; I had seen him that morning and on former occasions; the other man generally used to go up stairs first, and the prisoner generally followed—I had seen that seven or eight times; the prisoner was not employed in the premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper at the Aldine Chambers, in the service of Mr. Bagshaw. On the morning of 10th April, I saw the prisoner and Walter Atley—I had watched them for three mornings before—I observed them, about five or eight minutes before 9 o'clock, go into the chambers and go up the stairs—I went and looked through the gate, and saw the prisoner standing on the first landing; I could not see the other person, he had gone up—I went and got two or three more shutters down, and the prisoner and the other man came out without any load, and Whiting followed, crying, "Stop thief!"—I followed Atley, and Whiting followed the prisoner—I am certain the prisoner is the man.</p>

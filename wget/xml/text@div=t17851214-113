               <p>Mr. Garrow. My objection is, that Mr. Bottlebold being applied to, is to transfer that which is prima facie evidence against him as the thief, and put himself into a less disagreeable situation.</p>
               <p>Court. Having called the two witnesses, they have proved enough of this man's evidence to go to the Jury, for there is no objection to the competency of the accomplice, he is at all times liable to be examined, but the objection is to his credit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There is no evidence at all against Power, for whom I am concerned, therefore your Lordship will not let him say any thing against Power.</p>
               <p>Court. I must hear what he says, but I shall direct the Jury, that what he says against Power alone, is not evidence.</p>

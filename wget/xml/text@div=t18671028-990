I live at Wisengen, near Neustadt, in Bavaria, and am in partnership with my father-in-law Schmidt, as wine merchants—in August, 1866, Oster was introduced to me—he said that he was the agent of a London railway and steamboat company, and was introduced to us by his former master, who felt very proud that he came back to his former country, being a rich man now; he had been dining at our house, and found our wines very good, and that in that article there was a good deal of business to be done in London; that he had a very extensive connection in London, and would recommend us, and would only recommend us to very good houses, with whom we might transact business—he took a case of wine samples with him, which he paid for, but no orders came—in June, 1867, I wrote to him and received, this letter ("P") in reply—I have never seen him write.</p>

"—he said, "Yes"—I cannot say which letter it was, as I had them all in my hand together—they are the same bill heads, and had the same heading—he said, "I was introduced by a baker, named Clunkert, to a man named Capma, a general merchant; he sold the wine for me, but the money was paid to me by Mr. Wilson, the Custom House agent; I gave the baker 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Capma 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for commission"—I found this receipt in Kockmann's box for the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I unlocked the box with a key which I found in his pocket—he added, "And the money you found is all that I; have left"—he said that he received 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the wine, and that he had given some money to his friends and bought some furniture—he again im<lb></lb>plored me to have mercy on his wife and children, as he did not care for himself, but for them—on the road to London by railway he repeated sub<lb></lb>stantially the same—I told him I found three letters in Oster's box—he said, "I know, I wrote them"—I took him to London and locked him up, and next morning he thanked me for the kindness I had shown his wife in giving her the money—on 16th October I took Oster at 1, Elfin Villas, Forest Hill; when I knocked he opened the door; I read the warrant to him and said, "Do you understand it? "—he said, "I understand some<lb></lb>thing"—I then read it in German—he said, "Oh! we have to prove that; I hope you will do things as quiet as you can, because my wife is very weak"—I searched and found this price list of wines from Schmidt and Hammell, and in a little box I found these three letters, signed by Kockmann—when I laid hold of them he said, "I do not think you have any right to take them, because they are private letters"—those are the letters marked "A, B, and C"—I said, "I have told you already I shall take all papers addressed to you; if they turn out private I shall be very glad to hand them to you"—he said, "I may as well tell you those are three letters relating to the</p>

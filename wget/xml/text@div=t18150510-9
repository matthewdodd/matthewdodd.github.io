               <persName id="t18150510-9-person141">A. </persName>
            No, I do not. His house was broken into on the 12th of April. I went to bed about half past eleven; the other servants were left up, I left them up in the kitchen; before I went to bed the doors and windows of the kitchen were all fastened; I had fastened them myself. I arose next morning about twenty minutes past four, it was drawing towards day-light; the house maid and me came down to the street door; we first went into the kitchen a little after five. After we had been at the street door, we went up to our bed room again. We went down because there was a man rung at the door; the man asked if any body was sent from there with a bundle; we said, no. He said, he wanted to see the house; we said, we could not open the door at that time in the morning. A little after five, a ring of the bell came again; we went into the drawing-room; from there we went into the kitchen, when we came into the kitchen, we found the kitchen doors open; we then went out at a door that opens into the passage to come up to the parlour; I do not know whether that door was shut or not. I found all the things in other parts to where I left them the night before; we found the bread and meat which had been put into the pantry the night before, was standing on the kitchen table; we observed both the back doors of the room unbolted; one back door goes into the back yard, the other door goes in a yard, seperate from the kitchen; they were both unbolted. I bolted them myself the night before I went to bed. The sky-light was broke; there is a sky-light over the sink; the skylight was broke, some of the frame work was broke, and some glass was taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it broke so as to enable any person to get in - A. Yes; then when they went into the kitchen, they unbolted the back door, and by that means they were capable of getting into the back yard, and there is a gate in the back yard that takes them into the tenter ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100011"></xptr>Q. What then did you miss - A. There was some money missing out of a gentleman's writing desk, it is a small desk with a drawer; I had put some money there the night before, one pound some shillings; there were two one-pound notes in the kitchen taken; there was a small trifle of money taken out of the house besides, but where it was, I do not particularly know; there were two towels, and a pair of shoes of mistress's; I had seen these things all safe the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. No; I had never seen him before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen some of the things since - A. I have, some.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to the notes - A. No, I could not.</p>

               <p>Q. How late that night of the robbery, did you go to bed after the cook went to bed - A. I was up at twelve o'clock; I was last up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you opened the back doors after the cook went to bed - A. No, they were neither of them opened; they had not been opened after the cook fastened them to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the sky-light was broke before you went to bed - A. I never know of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get up at any alarm at the same time the cook did - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards in consequence of somebody giving you information, you went into the kitchen with the cook - A. Yes, I did; I found the back doors both standing open, I observed then the sky-light, over the sink, the frame was broke, and the glass was taken out; so that there was a space large enough for any body to come in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how high the sky-light is above the sink - A. No very great height.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to trace how a person might come in that way - A. I did get down that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the place, were there any footsteps or marks there - A. I did not observe that. There was no other part of the kitchen broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any person gone out by the kitchen door - A. The kitchen door was wide open; there was a middle door that was fastened; the kitchen door was wide open; it was not locked. I do not know whether we shut it to or not. The middle door, which is a door in the kitchen, was fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. Can any body come out of the outer part of the house into the kitchen, without passing through the middle door - A. No, they cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing out of the kitchen - A. A shawl belonging to me; I lost them out of my drawer in the kitchen, a middle drawer, that is my drawer; a sheet and a frock belonging to my mistress, that I was at work on, on the over night, that was gone; and two shillings and sixpence in silver, belonging to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What else - A. Four silver table spoons, they were under my care; I had seen them the day before, I make use of them every day.</p>
               <p>Q. What place where they in, the kitchen - A. I cannot say whether I had laid them in the closet or not; they are Mr. Dacosta's; a pair of shoes of master's, were taken, and a clothes brush.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 12th of April, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner; I was on duty, I was in the Minories; it was dark; it might be about two hundred or three hundred yards from Mr. Dacosta's house; he had two bundles in his hand, he was walking, coming down from that part where Mr. Dacosta's house is; I turned round on my heels, and walked along side of him, he was by himself. I asked him what he had got in the bundles; he wanted to know the reason I asked; I told him, I must do what I generally did, know what were in the bundles. He said, one was a parcel he was going to send down to his mistress at Portsmouth; he said, his mistress was Mrs. Dacosta, I asked him what that other bundle was; he said, provision, bread and meat. I asked him whether he was going to send his mistress provision; he said, no; that was for himself; he was going by the ten o'clock coach, and the parcel was going by the five o'clock coach. I asked him what capacity he was in at Mrs. Dacosta's; he said, footman to Mrs. Dacosta. I then asked him where did Mr. Dacosta live; he said, No. 41, Prescott-street, Goodman's fields; that is Mr. Dacosta's house. We walked together until we came to the watchhouse; I said, young man, you can have no objection to go over the way, I am not satisfied; I laid hold of his arm; he made no resistance; we went into the watchhouse, and I examined the bundles. When I came to look at him by the light, I knew he was not a footman; he had a dirty check apron on. I asked him if he had any objection to my going down to Dacosta; he said, no I said, what name am I to ask for if I go. He said my name is Johnson. I left him in the watchhouse, and went to Mr. Dacosta's, rung the bell, and two women servant came to the door, they would not let me in; I went again between five and six o'clock in the morning, they spoke to me at the window; I told them they had been robbed; I entered the house, found the windows of the house all safe; we went into the back yard, we found the outer shutter broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. The shutter that was in the yard - A. Yes. We went into the kitchen; we found the frame of the sky-light split: there was an entrance there, so that they could get into the kitchen. I examined the kitchen with the servants; the servants said what they had lost. I went back to the watchhouse, I searched the prisoner's person; I found exactly the money the servants said they had lost; two one-pound bank notes, a three-shilling piece, seven single shillings, and half-a-crown; that was all the money that was lost; he had exactly the money.</p>

            . I went along with Forrester into the watchhouse. I know nothing of the transaction, but, that the prisoner was brought into the watch-house with the other officer; he had the bundles with him; the bundles were examined on his being brought, and his person was afterwards searched.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100012"></xptr>I went to Dacosta's house in company with Forrester.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the house in the state that Forrester has represented - A. Yes, I did. The kitchen goes right along from the passage. I got a pair of steps to get into the kitchen from the yard; the top of the kitchen is tiled; I went out over it. I found some wood, which matched to the place where the sky-light had been broken away; there had also been feet marks in the gutter. On my return from Dacosta's, at the watchhouse, I took this shawl off the prisoner's neck, I took these shoes off his feet, and the pair of stockings from his legs, after he had been examined before the magistrate, the same day.</p>

               <p>Q. In what parish is Dacosta's house - A. In the parish of St. Mary Malfellon.</p>

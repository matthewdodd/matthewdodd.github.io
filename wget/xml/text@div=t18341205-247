On the 27th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in Goldsmith's-row, Hackney-road—I saw the prisoner in company with another, whom I do not know—I saw the prosecutor's window shoved up by one of the two, I cannot say which—it was shut close down before—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner take something from the window—they both walked away about ten yards—they turned round, and saw me walking towards them, and then both ran away—I ran after the prisoner about forty yards, and then saw him <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> a decanter from his person on the ground—something else was thrown from his person—I could not tell what it was—they both kept running on—I ran after them, calling "Stop thief"—the prisoner was stopped by Benjamin Key, and given to me—I never lost sight of him—I told him I took him for stealing the decanter—he said it was not him, it was the other—I had not said a word to him about it being better or worse to confess—I took him back to the house the glass belonged to, and saw a woman standing at the door, who gave me a decanter and basin—the top of the decanter was broken off—I have had the care of them ever since—I took the prisoner to the station-house—it was about a quarter before six o'clock in the evening—it was a very dark night—I could not distinguish the features of a person by the natural light in the open air—I do not think I could distinguish a man's face without the assistance of the gas.</p>

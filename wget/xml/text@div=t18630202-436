                  </hi>. My brother manages the Carpenter's Arms, in George-street, Camberwell—I was there on Saturday night, 10th January, when the prisoner came in with a man; they came together—the man asked for a pint of ale, and gave me a half-crown in payment—I placed it in the till; there was other silver there, but no other half-crown—I gave the man the change—they drank the beer and went away together—shortly afterwards</p>

               <p>I went to the till, saw the half-crown, found it was bad, and bent it—it was afterwards given to the constable, who is here—on the following Saturday, 17th January, the prisoner came again, alone—I was not there when she first came in; my brother was at the bar; he is here—he called me out to see if I recognised her—she said she did not know the coin was bad, and that she had taken it from a man who had just given her three half-crowns—a con<lb></lb>stable was sent for, and she was given into custody—I am quite sure she is the woman who was there on the Saturday before—I told her she was in with a man when I took a bad half-crown on the previous Saturday, and she must wait till a constable was sent for—she said I must be mistaken—this is the half-crown I took out of the till (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

I am brother to the last witness—on Saturday, 17th January, the prisoner came to the Carpenter's Arms alone, and asked me for a glass of ale, and gave me a half-crown—I looked at it; it was bad—I sent for my brother, and then told the prisoner it was bad—she said she was not aware of it—my brother said something to her, but I could not be sure of the words—a policeman was sent for, and she was given into custody—I gave the bad half-crown I received to the constable.</p>

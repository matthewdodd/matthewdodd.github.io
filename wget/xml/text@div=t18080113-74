               <p>Q. What man was that. - A. I did not know that person, I passed him, I thought he was a tradesman of the town, till I got within sight of my own door, then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130061"></xptr>I met the prisoner at the bar about fifteen yards from my door, with the two pieces of stuff that are here, he was coming towards me in a direction from my shop; I saw him come direct from my shop door; my shop rather stands out of the main street.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him come out of the shop door. - A. No, I do not believe he came out of the shop door at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him, how near was he to the door. - A. Close by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he standing there or walking. - A. Just as I turned round to the main street, he was walking from my door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any houses or shops in the recess where your house stands. - A. Not linen draper's.</p>
               <p>Q. There are other houses that are out of the main street. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come up to you. - A. I met him within fifteen yards from my door; I caught hold of the stuff, and asked him how he came by them; he immediately ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the same. - A. I believe he is the same; I have not much doubt about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you judge from your recollection and the figure of his person. - A. From the appearance of his person, and from the observations that I made; I described his dress to my wife; when I went in she said the prisoner had been in the shop,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to pursue him when he run off. - A. No, I took the stuff first; I went out to see if I could find him or his comrade with the other two pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance from your shop was it that you had seen the other man. - A. It might be an hundred yards down the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What success had you in searching after the prisoner and his comrade. - A. I had been to a pawnbrokers in Old Brentford; in about three quarters of an hour after, as I was returning up the street, the prisoner was standing up against the wall. I stopped and looked at him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that from your own shop. - A. It is about a quarter of a mile down to Old Brentford.</p>
               <p>Q. You stopped and looked at him. - A. Yes; he asked me if I knew him; I told him I thought I did; and I asked him if he would walk up the street with me, which he did; he did not resist. As I walked up the street with him, I asked him if he had not bought a silk handkerchief at a linen draper's up the street, he said, no, he had not, he did not want one; when I took him into my shop, I sent for a constable; and my wife recognized him being in the shop a few minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the two pieces that you took from him. - A. Yes. These are the pieces; there is my private mark on them; they are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had not disposed of these pieces in the way of business. - A. I am certain I had not; the four pieces were there when I went out in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value of them. - A. They are put down two pounds in the indictment; one of them cost me forty shillings, discount two and a half; the other twenty five shillings.</p>
               <p>MARY DAVISON. Q. You are the wife of the last witness. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner at the bar. - A. I do, I saw him in my shop on the 6th of January about five in the evening; he came into my shop to buy a silk handkerchief. I asked him six shillings for it, he asked me to let him have it for five and six pence; he gave me six shillings; the money I had asked him before.</p>
               <p>Q. While he was there was it light. - A. It was; I had candles in the shop, I distinguished his face, and likewise a scar he had on the upper part of his lip; I remarked his dress. I was just gone out of shop a few minutes when Mr. Davison brought in the two pieces of stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call them. - A. Bombazets. He told me he had taken them from a boy in the street; he went out and brought in the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at these bombazets when they were brought in by Mr. Davison. - A. I did; I had seen them in the shop a short time before the boy came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon before. - A. A short time; I cannot say; they lay within side of the shop door, close to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door open. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from that part of the shop were you when when you sold him the silk handkerchief. - A. Not above two or three yards; our shop is very small.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the boy go out. - A. Yes, and I went into the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course they could not go out with such a thing under his arm at that time. - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. So you went out of the shop a very short time before your husband came in with the bombazets. Did you leave no one else in the shop. - A. There was no one else in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door wide open. - A. The shop door was wide open, and the bombazets were against the door, they kept it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband afterward come back with the boy; did you then observe the person of the boy. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the same. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any alteration when he was brought back by your husband. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that mark on the lip. - A. Yes, it was by a cold, I believe; I do not observe it now.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the mark was not a scar, but something broke out on the lip. - A. It was. He gave me a seven shilling piece for the handkerchief, and I gave him a crooked shilling. When he came back to the shop he had a crooked shilling but I would not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband and you occupy the whole house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the shop a part of the house. - A. Yes, we have no lodgers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to see my uncle at the next town to that; I was coming back to take the coach at Kew bridge; that gentleman stopped me as I was making water, I asked him if he knew me; he asked me if I would come up the town with him, I said yes; he asked me if I had bought a handkerchief, I said no.</p>

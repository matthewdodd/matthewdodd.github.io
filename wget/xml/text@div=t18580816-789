                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Lawrence, who lives in Princes-street, Drury-lane—on Sunday evening, 18th July, I was going along Fleet-street; my husband was in advance of me; I felt a hand being drawn from my pocket—I immediately laid hold of the hand—I had a purse with me which contained 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had seen it safe not two minutes before—when I seized the hand, the man immediately ran—I kept hold of him—he ran quite as far as to the end of this court—I had an imperfect view of the man, and to the best of my belief the prisoner is the man; he had a rough coat on—I kept hold of him, and he made a sudden jerk and left the coat in my hand, and ran away across the road and escaped—he got out of the coat—he made a jerk which nearly dislocated my shoulder, and left the coat in my hand—I felt the edge of my purse in his hand—I after<lb></lb>wards missed it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 286). On 19th July, I went to Union-court, Holborn-hill, about 9 o'clock in the evening—I found the prisoner at the Union public-house with two other persons—I went to him and said, "I want you for picking a woman's pocket in Fleet-street, last night"—he said, "I don't know anything at all about it"—I asked him where his rough jacket was—he said, "I don't know what you mean"—I told him he must go with me to the station—he said, no, he should not—I took him by the collar, and told him he was in my custody—they commenced fighting and kicking, and one of his companions got both my arms behind me, and they dragged the prisoner away; he made his escape—I saw him again on Saturday night, 7th August, in Upper White<lb></lb>cross-street; I followed him—he went into a public-house—I went to him, and said, "I suppose you know what I want with you?"—he said, "Yes, master, I do; I was coming on Monday to give myself up"—I have known the prisoner about two years—I know this coat (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>), I have seen the prisoner wear it, I might say some hundreds of times—I saw him on 18th July, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and he had this coat on—I saw him again on Monday morning, the 19th, without any coat at all; then it was between 9 and 10 o'clock, before I had received information of this robbery—when I took him in the evening, he had a smooth cloth coat—I have not the least doubt that this rough coat is the coat the prisoner wore—I know it by the colour of it, the cut, and a button off the collar.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

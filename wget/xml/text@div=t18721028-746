                  </hi>. I live at 24, Blakesley Street Commercial Road—I am the prisoner's brother, and the son of the deceased woman—on Saturday even<lb></lb>ing, 21st September, I went home about 9.30, and found my brother quarrel<lb></lb>ling with my mother—I believe, he was drunk—I was struggling with him in the passage; my mother came to part us, and he kicked her in the bottom of the stomach—I do not know whether he was kicking at me—she went in, sat down on a chair, and said, "Oh!" and sent for a doctor—she then kept toiler bed till she died—her age was forty-nine—she died on the Fri<lb></lb>day morning, the 27th, about 12.30; six days after the kick.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 20, Collett Place Commercial Road—about 9.30 on this evening I was called to see Mrs. Rymer, and found her in bed, but not undressed; she wais suffering great pain in the lower part of the abdomen, and stated that her son had kicked her there; there was no external mark—I attended her up to her death on the following Friday, the 27th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found the brain and lungs healthy, and the heart congested; the peritoneum was in a state of inflammation, which was the cause of death—that might decidedly have been caused by a kick at the bottom of the abdomen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Death did not arise from natural causes—there is no doubt that it was the result of violence.</p>

On the 30th November, I was in the room behind the shop, and saw the prisoner coming from behind the counter; I went out, and asked him what he wanted; he said, a situation; I told him, he had no business there - I got between him and the door, and reached over and locked the door; I saw him step back, and throw down these four handkerchiefs; they are my masters', and are worth 1l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to inquire for a situation. I stood at the door; no one came. I went in, and knocked on the counter; this gentleman then came out, and locked the door. I stepped back, and he said, I had thrown these down, but I had not touched them. Witness. He began to beg me to let him go; but I had not then accused him of anything - the handkerchiefs had been behind the counter, near a glass.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you first accuse him of it? A. At the station-house; but I had been for an officer, and told him of it - the handkerchiefs were still in the place where he threw them, but I left a lad with him in the shop.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Did he attempt to go away? A. He could not as I had shut the door - he was at first nearer the door, than I was - I had not noticed the handkerchiefs in their place that morning, but I saw him throw them out of his hand.</p>

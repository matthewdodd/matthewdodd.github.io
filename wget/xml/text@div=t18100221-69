On the 15th of February, near six o'clock in the evening, I stepped to the street-door in haste; I found the prisoner standing against the window, the window was cut, and two pieces of kerseymere had been taken out; I saw the prisoner's arm in the window, higher than the cuff of his coat; the glass had been cut and taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the window was entire a short time before this - A. Yes; I passed the window twenty minutes prior to this, and every thing was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose, his arm being through the window, the goods were within the reach of his hand - A. Yes; when I saw him, just as he drew his arm out of the window, there was a blue piece of kerseymere that had the appearance of his hand being upon it. I had the pane of glass put in the week before; there was the mark of putty on the kerseymere. I ran in haste and cried out, what are you about; he took to his heels, crossed the way, and ran into Cecil-street; as he turned round to get into Cecil-street he fell down. It was light sufficient for me to see him fall down and run into Cecil-street. He was brought back in about five minutes; I firmly believe him to be the man I saw standing against the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever recovered these two pieces of kerseymere - A. I have not. When the prisoner was brought back, I charged him with the theft; he said, he was not the man. I detained him. An officer came and took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you think the blue piece of kerseymere had been removed from the place where it was - A. About four or five inches. I cannot swear that the prisoner moved it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the two pieces of kerseymere stolen - A. Six pounds, and the blue piece four pounds.</p>

            . I am a currier. I live in Essex-street, in the Strand. As I was coming from my tea I passed Mr. Grainger's shop, I heard a cry of, stop thief. I saw some people standing at the top of Cecil-street, I crossed the way; I saw the prisoner running from the bottom of the street towards the Strand; young Mr. Grainger was running after him; I laid hold of him; the prisoner said, he was not the man. I took him to the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been in the Strand to take some work home for my master; on my coming back I was taken short; I went behind the stones, and while I was there, I heard some people running down the street; there were two or three people ran past me; I went up the street to see what was the matter, and three or four people catched hold of me. The gentleman searched me, and found nothing.</p>
               <p>Grainger, jun. I saw the prisoner behind the stones; he was by no means in the position that he has described.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

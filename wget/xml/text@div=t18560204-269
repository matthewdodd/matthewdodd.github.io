                  </hi>. I am a lithographer, carrying on business in Gerrard-street, Soho, for about seven years—I am patentee of the process called the Anastatic process, for taking impressions on metal from paper—I have been employed on several occasions as an engraver by the Prussian Embassy—the prisoners came to me on 23rd Nov., in company with the last witness—I was at my work in the front office—the prisoners came to me—the wit<lb></lb>ness waited out in another room—some general conversation passed between the prisoners and me, and Edmund showed me a Prussian 10 thaler note—he had just before asked what my business was—I said, "A lithographer," but I did not keep a lithographer in the house; I took originals from other works—he said, "That is just what I want"—he said, "I have a great deal of business"—he then showed me the 10 thaler note, and said, "Can you do that?"—I said, "I can, but I won't do it; I dare not do it"—I saw it was Prussian money—he said, "Don't be foolish, this will pay you better than all the other work which you have"—I said, "Well, I will do it, if you can give me the authority"—he said, "Oh, the authority I can give you," and he showed me his passport, and told me he was a merchant—I did not look at the passport, I only read that he came from Belgium, and was a mer<lb></lb>chant—he said that he would get the authority from the minister—I said, "Very well; I have no time now, I must go on with my work"—he said, "Well, I won't detain you any longer; I will call again"—when he first showed me the note, there was Edmund alone, and after I consented to do it if he brought me the authority, he said he would bring me the autho<lb></lb>rity, and then he called his brother in, and said, "My brother knows how,</p>

               <p>he has done it before," and Louis Schehl told me he had done it before on stone, and he said there was a lithographer in the City who had done it, but he died the week before—Edmund showed me the note, be took it out of his pocket—I did not keep it, he took it away with him—they asked me what time they should call again—I said, "After I have done work, after 7 o'clock in the evening"—they went away, and after they left I made a communication to my foreman and to the Prussian Embassy—when they first came it was between 12 and 1 o'clock—I went to the Embassy between 1 and 2 o'clock—I there saw Mr. Albert—I communicated to him the fact of the prisoners coming to me—in consequence of instructions from the Embassy, I proceeded with the work—about 3 o'clock the same afternoon the Secretary of the Embassy came to my house—the prisoners came to my house in the evening, according to appointment, and a conversation again occurred about the notes—I showed them some specimens of my own work—they both said, "It will do very well"—they then asked if I would do what they wanted, and asked me what time I would commence with the work to do the 10 thaler note—Edmund tendered the note to me—Louis was by—I showed him specimens of notes, cheques, and portions of engrav<lb></lb>ings—he said it would do very well, and if I would print 1,000 copies of the 10 thaler note, he would pay me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he asked me what time I would commence to do the work—I said, "To-morrow is Saturday; I can't begin then"—I told him it would be on Monday—before they left they gave me a 10 franc piece to begin the work—I would not accept it, and it was left on the table—they said they would bring me the authority, and they went away—they invited me to the corner public house, and I had some pale ale—they both came on Sunday morning—they both spoke about the water mark—they showed me the note again, and said, "If you transfer the note and print them off, we want the paper to have the water mark"—I said, "It is quite a thing out of my line, but no doubt I can do it"—they said, "Well, well, if you will consider about it, and try if you can do it"—we came to an agreement about it—I agreed to do the water mark as well—I did not mention about the authority, but Edmund said that, he would bring it—it was again mentioned that they should want 1,000 copies for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can't say whether it was then or afterwards, but he said he would give me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for fifty copies—I cannot recollect how many copies they said they should want in all of the 10 thaler notes, but it was an enormous number—they made an appointment to come the next day, and they went away—on Monday they came again, they then showed me two 10 thaler notes, and in their presence I transferred the fronts and backs of those notes to a zinc plate—the transfer of the two are made at the same moment—this is what I did (<hi rend="italic">looking at the plate</hi>), and this print (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) was taken off the plate on that occasion—by moving about, the plate has got rubbed, and I cannot see the number of it—they said I should look out for paper which would be similar to that of the genuine note to make the water mark on, and on Monday evening they gave me a sovereign to go on—on Tuesday, the 27th, Mr. Albert, the secretary, called on me with Mr. Mullens, the attorney, and from that time up to the time of the prisoners being taken, I was in communication with Mr. Mullens every day—on that same Tuesday the prisoners came, and in their presence I transferred from the impression I had made the day before—they would have been satisfied with the process, but I was not, because the notes were very much worn—I believe they took away some of what I showed them—what I had left I tore up—they said they would send and have some clean notes sent over</p>

               <p>from Germany—they said they would send over to Germany for clean 50 thaler notes—they wanted to have them produced an well—they said they would bring me two clean 10 thaler notes the next day, and if I could get fifty copies done they would pay me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they came again the next evening, Wednesday, the 28th—during that day I had employed Mr. King, an artist, to trace the water mark, and when the prisoners called they saw Mr. King at work at the water mark—they gave Mr. King some money—they had got two notes, and they said they were the best they could get, but they were very dirty—they said they expected a gentleman over from Germany, and the vessel would arrive the next day, and they would then bring me clean notes—he said, "I have written over to procure from the office a clean 100 thaler note"—they said they should want that transferred and printed—they said they wanted to send the proofs off to Germany—they wrote a letter in my place, one letter, which the boy took himself, they said it was gone over to Triers—they said they expected the person to whom they were writing to come over the next day by the steamer, but he could not come before 3 o'clock, and he would bring them clean notes, and he would bring the money as well, and he would fetch those notes which were done—next day, Thursday, the 29th, they both came in the afternoon, they produced two 10 thaler notes—they were not the same that they had pro<lb></lb>duced on Wednesday—I told him they must be cleaned first, and I laid those notes in solution—they said I should procure some paper to make the water mark on—they saw King at work on the water mark on that Thurs<lb></lb>day, and all the week—they asked him first of all whether he thought he could manage it, and, as it was in progress, they said they were very much satisfied with it—they came again on Friday—I had made the notes as clean as I could, and in presence of the prisoners and Mr. King I transferred the front and back of a note on this plate (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—this is the transfer I made—I believe they gave Mr. King on that occasion two sovereigns—they came again on 1st Dec., and were there the whole day—in the after<lb></lb>noon they were pressing the water mark from the water mark plate—this is the water mark plate (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I think the water mark plate was complete on Saturday—on Monday, 3rd Dec., the prisoners came and were at my house nearly the whole day again—I cannot remember exactly whether any impression was taken from the second plate in their presence that day—there were proofs taken from the water mark on the Monday, and they said they would do very well, and on that occasion they told me they expected a person by the steamer from Germany, and he could not come before 3 o'clock—on Tuesday, 4th Dec., the prisoners were at my house—they were there pretty nearly from day to day till Monday, the 10th Dec.—on Tuesday, the 4th, the prisoners themselves printed the water marks with their own hands—they took copies on paper—Mr. Slatter was then my foreman—he came in and out—on several other occasions the prisoners brought in other notes, and I made transfers of them—this went on till Monday, 10th Dec.—during that interval they were at my house every day—on Monday, the 10th, they themselves were cutting the paper on which the notes were to be printed, to its proper size—in the middle of that day they went away to dinner, between 1 and 2 o'clock; when they returned, Edmund said to me, in presence of the other prisoner, "Have you got an enemy in your house?"—I said, "I believe not"—he said, "Well, consider about it; I think you have"—I said, "If there is one, it must be my clerk," because I had given him previous notice to leave—he said he thought it was, because he told him that he thought I had told the policeman—I</p>

               <p>told him I had not, which was the fact; I had not—Edmund said he was cleverer than the clerk, for he could know what I was doing—they prepared to take the press and the plates to their home, because the clerk did not know where they lived, no more did I—they asked me whether I would lend them the press, to print at home, so that the clerk should not know—they said they would come after 8 o'clock to fetch the press and plates away—that was the press at which they had been working at my place about the water marks—they came after 8 o'clock, and commenced to take the press away with them—they did not take anything else away to my knowledge—Edmund went for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, he said, to fetch the press and plates away—while Edmund was gone, the other prisoner remained—he was wrapping up the plates—after he was gone I found the water mark plate and the paper was gone—that was after he was fetched away—he had been wrapping up the Anastatic plates—I had not given him permission to take away the water mark plate and the paper.</p>

I took Edmund Schehl into custody in the street, when he came out of Mr. Appel's house—I told him what I wanted him for, but he struggled at the time, and there was great confusion—I held him for some seconds till a second party came up—I searched him, and found on him these nuts, and screws, and this wrench—I afterwards took Louis Schehl at Mr. Appel's house in the first floor—I searched him, and found on him some nuts, and screws, and some of the engravings from the plates, a copy of the notes, and a card of Mr. Appel's—I went to No. 6, Featherstone-buildings—I went into the first floor front room—there was a sideboard, I searched it, and in a drawer in it I found a quantity of water marked paper, corresponding with the plate which was with the paper, and some copies of an original Prussian note, and I found the note itself—I found 102 impres<lb></lb>sions of the water mark—I found impressions of the front and of the back—I found several letters in the back bed room—I was in private clothes when I apprehended these men—I could not say that the impressions were of this particular note.</p>

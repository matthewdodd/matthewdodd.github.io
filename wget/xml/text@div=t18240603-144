I had to drive my master to Hackney in the chaise very early that morning; but being too early, I sat down to see the men fasten up the oxen - the prisoner came by and made a snatch at my coat, and unbottoned it - he returned again, unbottoned my waistcoat, and snatched at my seals. I had hold of them; his hat fell off, and so did mine. I I went to pick it up - he gave me a blow in the eye, and ran off. I called Stop thief! - his companions stopped me. I got my hat, and pursued him down Three-fox-court; he held up a stick, and swore he would murder me if I followed - he got over a wall into the pig-market; the watchmen got over and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master expect you so early as four o'clock; A. I was to be at his house at six. I had come from Crown-street, Soho. I got up at half-past three.</p>
               <p>Q. When he unbuttoned your coat, then returned, and unbottoned your waistcoat, did you not suspect he was going to do something - A. Yes, my Lord; I struggled with him, and got my watch back, and put it into my fob. I did not lose sight of him.</p>

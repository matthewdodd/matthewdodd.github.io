                  <hi rend="largeCaps">ELIZA WILLIAMS NEWCOMB</hi>. I am housemaid, in the service of Captain Codrington, of 82, Eccleston-square. On Monday afternoon, 8th Nov., about 4 o'clock, I was coming down stairs, near the water closet door, and observed some dirty marks there—that induced me to go into the scullery, where I found the cook, the prisoner—she had been washing the skirt of her dress in a pail by the sink—she showed it to me—I said to her as I came along the passage, "Halloo, Harriet! have you been sick?"—she made no answer—when I got into the scullery she said, "I am so at last, Eliza; and no one knows what I have suffered"—she lifted up her dress, and showed me where she had been washing it—about five minutes after that I went upstairs to her bedroom; I slept with her—I found the door locked—I said, "Open the door, it is only me, Harriet"—she opened it directly, and I went in—she was moving about the room, dressing herself; she bad got on her petticoat—I then went downstairs, leaving her there—as I was passing from the kitchen to the housekeeper's room, I heard a noise in the closet called the store closet—the housekeeper's room is on the same floor as the kitchen, the basement—</p>

               <p>as I went by with my tray in my hand, the noise attracted my attention—I went on to the housekeeper's room, and came back to listen at the door—it appeared to me to come from that closet—I thought it was like a cat most desperately hurt; the cry was horrible, dreadful—I did not try the closet door at that time; it was locked—I went to listen; the noise came from within—I have no doubt about that—I did not try the door at that time—I listened there some minutes, and still heard the noise—I then heard some person coming down stairs—it was Mrs. Tobin, the nurse—I called her attention to the noise—she put her ear to the door—she told me to go up for the key—I did so—we went first of all to the drawer, to look for the key; it was not there; and then I went upstairs to get it from the prisoner—as I went up, I found the prisoner coming down—I said to her, "Oh, Harriet! there is such a dreadful noise in your cupboard; the poor cat has got in, and is very much hurt; give me the key, and I will let her out"—she did not give me the key—she walked down by my side—I said to her, "Oh, don't open the door till I get a light; she may be in a fit!"—I meant the cat—I went into the house keeper's room for a light—I did not go to the closet with the light—the pri<lb></lb>soner was coming out of the closet when I came out of the housekeeper's room—I was hardly an instant away—when I came back with the light, the prisoner was returning out of the closet—she came out, turned the key, and put it in her pocket—I did not hear any noise in the closet after that—when I was at the bottom of the kitchen stairs, I heard it; and I said to the pri<lb></lb>soner, "Oh, Harriet, it is such a horrid noise; it is more like a young <hi rend="italic">kid</hi> than a cat!"—she made no reply—when I saw her coming out of the store closet, I said, "What is it?"—she said, "The cat; she has run up there (meaning to the kitchen); her tail was shut in the door"—I followed to see, but saw nothing of the cat—there was a little kitten in the house; I did not see it for some hours afterwards—I had never said anything to the prisoner about her being in the family way—I never saw her at work upon any clothes for a child—she used to work in my presence—I never saw anything being made for a child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Tobin, a bricklayer, in Johnson's-place, St. George's-road. I was at Captain Codrington's on this day, about half past 4 o'clock—as I was coming downstairs, the last witness said to me, thinking I was the prisoner, "Good God, Harriet, there is a dreadful noise in your cupboard!"—I said, "Whatever is the matter?"—she said, "There is a dreadful noise in Harriet's closet"—the key was not in the</p>

               <p>closet—I looked for it, but could not find it, so I sent her upstairs for it—she came down immediately with the prisoner by her side—I heard the noise in the closet; it sounded to me like the <hi rend="italic">squeal</hi> of a cat that had been severely hurt—I listened to it—when the prisoner came down I turned into the pantry for a light, and sent Eliza for one into the housekeeper's room—as she came out with it I took it out of her hand, and at that moment the prisoner was coming out of the closet—I saw her unlock the door and go in—I cannot say exactly how long she was in before she came out—it could not have been more than two minutes—I came up to her with the light, and said, "Harriet, where is the cat?"—she said, "It has passed out there," into the kitchen—she said the door had pinched its tail—I did not hear the noise when she went into the closet—as soon as she went in the noise ceased—I went into the kitchen with the housemaid to look after the cat, and the prisoner came in after us—I noticed that she locked the closet door and put the key in her pocket—I cannot say whether she usually kept the key—I afterwards went up into her bedroom—I saw a gown and petticoat of hers there, all stained with blood; I afterwards found a chemise and flannel petticoat stained in the same way—some hours afterwards I went again up to her bedroom—she was then in bed—that was between 9 and 10—I asked her how she felt—she said she was better—I said, "Harriet, did you not know that you had a dear little baby, and not to do away with it?"—she said she did not know that she had; she thought she should be put on the streets, and she had no home.</p>

From information, I accompanied Cope and Forrester to the prisoner's house, Duke-street, Aldgate - Forrester went in first, Mr. Cope and I followed; we had agreed on a signal, which he made, and Cope and I went in - the prisoner was asked if he had any Greek paper, (meaning paper with Greek characters on it); he said he had none - in the meantime his stock, which laid on the counter, was turned over, and we found about a quire of a Greek Testament; we searched about, and found about two reams of the same sort, about forty quires; he was asked where he got it, and he said he bought it of a man named Griffin, who lived at a bellows-maker's in Holborn; we searched for Griffin, and found he lived at a clock-maker's - there was no bellows-maker in Holborn; he was not at home when we went</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Did he give you such a direction as led you to the clock-maker's to inquire for Griffin? A. Yes - after a great deal of search Forrester found him; if a work hangs on hand the booksellers sometimes sell it as waste - we took stock on the 1st of March; I suppose the works missing would nearly fill two waggons; we had not taken stock in Water-lane for six years - the Delphin Classics have been printed about twelve years - the Greek Septuagint was printed in 1829. and the Testament about two years ago; I cannot say at how many periods this property may have been taken - the prisoner is a retailer of waste-paper - it is a regular shop, and has"Dealer in waste paper" written over the door; one quire of our paper was on the counter, and the rest on the shelves in the shop - he made no difficulty about our searching; I asked if he had any Greek waste-paper - he said No; the quire on the counter did not lay uppermost - waste-paper is bought in the bulk, which often consists of different works, but we never sell any wastepaper.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Could he have a quire of loose paper on the counter without knowing it was Greek? A. Certainly not; I am sure he said he bought that of Griffin - we never sold any of it; it is usual in the trade to call paper with Greek printing Greek paper.</p>
               <p>DANIEL FORRESTER. I am a City officer. I accompanied Mr. Folthorpe, and Cope to the prisoner's house; I asked if he had any clean newspapers - he said, No; I asked if he had any waste demy - he said he had not; I did not hear him asked about the Greek paper - I was not near enough to the counter; I searched and found a quantity of paper claimed by Mr. Folthorpe, which I produce, this is all that was found at the house, except one sheet, which I produce.</p>
               <p>MR. FOLTHORPE re-examined. The paper was mixed up; they are all of the same book - this is all the paper that was found; this is a sheet of another sort, the first latin exercises - all the rest is Greek; here are about two reams.</p>
               <p>DANIEL FORRESTER. I went to Mr. Henman, fishmonger, Bow-lane, the same day, and found some paper that Mr. Folthorpe identified - I did not go any where else; I found about a ream at Henman's - I took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Has not the prisoner a hesitating mumbling manner of answering questions? A. Yes, I believe he has; it appears to be his manner.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Mumbling or not, did you understand his answers? A. Yes, many of them.</p>
               <p>MR. FOLTHROPE. This paper found afterwards is part of the Delphin Classics.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL GRIFFIN. I am a labourer in the East India warehouse, Crutched-friars - I lodge at a clock-makers in Holborn. I have sold paper to the prisoner - I did not sell him this paper; I never saw it till it was produced at the Mansion-house - I have sold to him paper, two, three or four times; there was a parcel of printed paper which I bought of Mr. McLean, in the Hay-market, but that was all English printed characters.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What paper did you sell him? A. I sold him about 8 cwt. of coach way bills, which I bought of Bumpus, in Holborn, and about 2 cwt. of English printed paper - I looked through the whole of it; paper is sold sometimes in bundles, but I looked through the lot I sold him, and do not think such characters as these could pass my eyes without being seen - I used not to open every sheet I bought, but was always particular where I bought it: I may not open paper sometimes, but I did in this case - I should examine to see the quality of the paper; what I sold him was plain English characters; I am employed in the East India-house in the early part of the day, and deal with several persons; I never deal in Petticoat-lane - what printed paper I sold the prisoner. I bought of Mr. McLean; I have dealt with the prisoner three or four times - there was no Greek characters in any that I sold him; I never said I had sold him paper consisting of different works - I am not a Greek characters in any that I sold him; I never said I had sold him paper consisting of different works - I am not a Greek scholar.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you particularly examine the paper you sold the prisoner? A. Yes, as to quality and the character of the print.</p>
               <p>DIGHTON MOTT. I am a poulterer in Leadenhall-market. On the 16th of February some paper was ordered of the prisoner, and sent in; I saw him write this receipt, and paid him for the paper, and here is five quires of the paper which I bought of him - there was originally a ream of it; we used the rest in our business - I never looked at the works; I gave him 9s. a ream - it is Latin</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The last item of this bill refers to the lot you have produced? A. Yes, I have dealt with him for six months - very few in our line buy paper in reams; we buy small quantities - I took very little notice of it, and had no conception of the value; he used to sell small parcels of paper in the market, and had a stall there for paper.</p>
               <p>EDWARD HENMAN. I am a fishmonger, and live in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110078"></xptr>Bow-lane. About Christmas I bought some paper of the prisoner, which the officer has produced; it was Latin - I have one sheet and a half of Greek, which is all I had left; I bought three or four reams of Greek, or there might be only three reams of Greek, or two reams, but it is all used I am certain - I bought two reams of Greek, and the last four reams of the Latin; I paid him 9s. a ream.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESLEY. Q.Is this Greek or Latin? A.Latin; I think there are some Greek characters in the notes, and at the head of them - I attend Billingsgate; the prisoner occasionally comes into the market and sells publicly there - he brought this paper to me.</p>

               <p>MR. FOLTHORPE. Both these parcels of paper are Mr. Valpy's - I know nothing of Griffin; this paper was never sold from our warehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I buy paper by weight, without examining the print - I did not know that I had any that was improperly come by; I gave the value for it - it cannot be supposed I have a capital to buy such a quantity as Mr. Valpy lost; it must have gone somewhere else.</p>

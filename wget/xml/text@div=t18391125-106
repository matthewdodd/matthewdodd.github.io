                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's sister—my husband is a shoe<lb></lb>maker, living in York-street, St. Luke's. On Monday afternoon, the 18th of November, the prisoner came to our house about four o'clock—when I came down stairs I went into the room where he was—I was very much alarmed at his appearance—he put his hand out, and gave me the key, and said, "There is the key," three times—he then appeared almost choked, and said he was a murderer—he got up and asked me to come and see, several times, and he put my bonnet on, and took me round the waist, and said, Come and see," again—we went out—he was walking with a very firm step, with my brother John, till we got to the middle of St. Luke's madhouse, where the pavement was—(my brother John and his wife had come out with him besides me)—he then rushed from my brother John, came and seized me by the hand, walked a few steps further, and then looked round for my brother again, and when we were both together, be plunged his arms out again, and said, "A murderer"—I was very much alarmed at his appearance then, and called a coach—we all got in, and got out near Chapman-street—the prisoner and his wife lived in Chapman-street—when we got out he went up one street and down another, as though he wanted to go in, and did not like to—I had the key—they were talking about half-and-half, or something.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he appear, during the whole time you were with him that day, like a man in his senses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not, he was a distracted man—I have seen him and his wife very much together—I lived with them for three years—he appeared very fond of his wife when sober, and when he was drunk too, unless he was aggravated to passion—his general conduct to her was kind and affectionate—I have seen him very much aggravated—mostly his dis<lb></lb>tracted times were when he has expected her home, and she has not come home till the middle of the night—he has been waiting, expecting her to come home, and when she did not come home he would go out and get drunk—he appeared to me to be rendered very unhappy by her conduct—they were both given to habits of drinking—I have seen her in a state of intoxication many times—I have seen her strike him when in that state, and my brother came one day and told me she had attempted to cut her throat—I had never seen her do so—when she has struck him he has most times borne it patiently—he used to say she could not hurt him—he was a man who, when he was ill, would never say he was ill.</p>

Last Monday week I was engaged in removing some things of hers, to her house in York-street—between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the back-parlour of her house with my brother-in-law, Benjamin Bailey—the prisoner came in, took Bailey by the hand, kissed him, and said he was a murderer—he did not say of whom—he said nothing more than I have said—he produced a rope from his pocket, but said nothing, and he produced the key of his door to his sister—he lived in Lower Chapman-street—he did not say what he produced the key for—we then accompanied him to the coach-stand in St. Luke's, and went in a coach to Chapman-street, with my wife and sister—he wished us to go with him the coach stopped before we came to his house, in a street in Chapman</p>

               <p>street—I cannot say who paid for the coach—I know the Chapman's Arms public-house, kept by Pedder—the prisoner and I went into the Chap<lb></lb>man's Arms public-house, and the women went over to the green-grocer's—the Chapman's Arms is not far from the prisoner's house—the prisoner called for a pint of half-and-half and a pipe of tobacco, and I had a pipe—I did not believe what he had said, that he was a murderer—he was not sober then—he appeared drunk when he came to me—I did not rely on what he said—he and his wife were both in the habit of drinking, and when drunk were very quarrelsome and very passionate—I cannot say how long we staid at the public-house—it was not half-an-hour—I did not smoke my pipe out before we went away—I do not recollect whether I saw Kaines—after being in the public-house a short time, the prisoner took the half-and-half into the tap-room or parlour, I do not know which, and I went out to see for my wife and sister—they were over at the green-grocer's—I did not hear any conversation with any body in the public-house—I do not recollect whether Kaines was there—when I went to the green<lb></lb>grocer's I left the prisoner in the Chapman's Arms—I went with my wife and sister towards the prisoner's house—my sister had the key—she tried to open the door, but could not, and I unlocked it—we all went in but my wife—she came in in a few minutes, but could not stay, and went back again—this was between four and five o'clock—it was the shop-door I opened—the shop was dark—when the door was opened my sister felt about—I do not remember her saying any thing—I could not discern any portion of the body of the deceased, it was too dark—the prisoner fetched a light—he had not come to us from the public-house—when we came from the green-shop he was coming out of the door, and we went down together—he went to fetch a light, and returned with one—when he brought the light, I discovered his wife lying on the floor of the shop, dead—I was agitated, and did not take particular notice of the body.</p>

               <p>had come in at one, and was going out at the other—this was not a minute after he spoke to me about the tobacco—his brother caught hold of him by both collars of his coat, and said, "Bill, you shall not go, you are a murderer, you hare murdered your wife, and his brother said the Almighty required him for something—but the rest of the sentence I lost—the prisoner said nothing to that—I looked at him, and saw he was very agitated, and very pale—he must have heard what his brother said—when I looked at him, I noticed some blood on his shirt collar, and one of his hands was covered with blood—I cannot remember which hand, as I did not notice—it was not spots of blood on his shirt-collar, but as if it was a smear with the thumb, or something—when the brother took hold of him by the collar, I asked the brother if it was so—he seemed agitated, and said it was, and that his wife laid dead on the floor of the shop—he said that in the hearing of the prisoner—the brother appeared very much agitated—the landlord of the house was about to send one of his sons for an officer, and I intimated to him, by a nod of the head, that I would fetch one—I went immediately to the prisoner's house, and found two females standing on the step of the door, crying—I believe it was the two witnesses—the door was shut at that time—I brought a policeman to the public-house, and when I got there the prisoner and his brother were gone—the landlord gave me some information, in consequence of which I went after the prisoner, towards his own house—I passed through the Rein Deer public-house in Richard-street, into James-street, and found the pri<lb></lb>soner towards the Commercial-road end of the street, walking in a direc<lb></lb>tion to the Commercial-road, which is in a direction from his own house—there was no one with him—I and the policeman went up to him—I said to him, "Where are you going?"—he said, "I am going up here"—I said, "Come along with me"—he turned round to come with me, and the policeman laid hold of him—he said he did not want any policeman, he would not go with a policeman—I said, "Come with me, you and I will walk together," and him and me walked arm-in-arm to the station-house, the policeman sometimes behind, and sometimes by the side of us—he went with me quietly to the station-house after that conversation—after he was searched, I went back to his house, and saw the body of the deceased lying on the floor, close to the back door, with her head to the fire-place, quite dead, and appeared to have been dead some hours, two hours, I might say, for she was quite cold—the inspector was there before me—I was not acquainted with the deceased.</p>

I was at the station-house on the Monday evening, and remember the prisoner coming there with Kaines, and Cook, a policeman—Kaines said, in his presence, that he had murdered his wife—the prisoner did not say any thing at that time—I did not ask any questions then—I afterwards laid hold of his hand, and turned up his sleeve—the constable pointed out some blood on his shirt-collar, on the right-hand side—I asked if he had cut his head—that was the first blood I saw—he said he had not hurt his bead at all—the blood on his shirt-collar appeared quite fresh—I also observed blood on three fingers of his left hand, and a cut on the little-finger joint—the blood was on the edge of the fingers, and there was a spot of blood just on the bend of the hand—I should say the blood had not come from that wound on the little-finger joint, the cut was not sufficient—the blood had dried on his hand—I exa<lb></lb>mined his right hand—there was nothing on that—I found no wound about his person, but the cut on his finger—I asked him how his finger came hurt—he said, he had fallen out of a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on the Thursday previous, near St. Luke's Hospital—it appeared to have been recently done—he then</p>

               <p>pulled off his coat, and said, "I will show you"—he turned up his shirt<lb></lb>sleeve on the right arm, and there appeared to be an old hurt on the elbow—I said, "This is what you mean was done on the Thursday"—he said, "Yes"—I did not notice any blood on his dress at that time, but next morning I noticed, on the leg of his trowsers, a sort of small spot of con<lb></lb>gealed blood, rather streaked—I could not say whether that was recent—nothing was said between me and him about that—when he was brought to the station-house he appeared to have been drinking, and was very much excited—I did not know him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the police. About half-past five o'clock on Monday afternoon I was at the station-house in Denmark-street, and, in consequence of information, I left the station-house to go to the prisoner's house—as I was going I met him in custody—when I got to the house I saw the deceased lying with her head towards the stairs, and her face towards the back-door—she was lying on her side—I observed her throat—it appeared to be cut, and I found a razor lying on her right-hand side, open—there is blood on it now, and it is very fresh now—I immediately sent for the surgeon—I looked round the room, and observed a piece of rope in the front part of the room—the end was tied to a bit of a staple, which goes into a beam across the ceiling, and a sort of noose, broken—the noose was about six feet from the ground—I could have stood under it without touching it—there were a couple of chairs in the shop, I think—I cannot say whether they were near to the rope, because the people were all there when I got there—I have another rope, but I know nothing of that, only the Coroner's Jury wished me to take care of it—it is a new rope, and does not appear at all connected with the one first produced—one is new, and the other old—the new rope was produced before the Coroner—I took down the rope I found hanging in the shop—the noose appears to be broken—Mr. Garrett came about ten minutes after I got there—the body was not moved till after he came.</p>

I am a surgeon, and live at No. 3, New-road, St. George's in the East—I knew the deceased—I saw her for the first time on Monday afternoon, the 18th of November—about ten minutes after two o'clock I received a message to go to the house—I got there about a quarter past two o'clock—I was detained some time knocking at the door before I could get in—Hall let me in, and the deceased came down from up stairs—I found her in a nervous condition, and after a little conversation with her, she had two distinct hysterical attacks—as if she had been excited—she was perfectly rational and decidedly sober—she continued under each attack from two to three or four minutes—women are much subject to hysterics—it will arise from any exciting cause—either violence in the conduct of the person attacked, or from violence or quarrelling of any body else—the soon recovered—while I was there Mr. Cordy's brother brought some me<lb></lb>dicine—the latter part of my conversation with the deceased was with regard to a pain she felt in her back—the prisoner was not present—she assigned a cause for that pain—I inquired of the gentleman who brought the medicine, the composition of it, by her desire—it was an effervescing mixture, a draught calculated to quiet her and tranquillize the system—in my judgment, she did not require any thing else—there was nothing at all in her conduct or in her answers to my questions which denoted to me that it was unsafe to leave her by herself, nor any thing to denote that she was not perfectly self-possessed—she came down to me in the shop—I was in the shop ten minutes or. a quarter of an hour—if there had been a cord suspended to a beam there I should have observed it—I did not observe it—I had opportunities of observing, being by myself some time—the place the cord hung from was afterwards pointed out to me by the offi<lb></lb>cers,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183911250078"></xptr>
               <p>and I should say it could not have escaped my attention—the prisoner came in while I was there—I knew him before—I knew his person—he had been drinking—I observed no excitement about him beyond what might be the result of taking drink—when I came away I left the prisoner, the deceased, and Mr. Cordy's brother in the shop—the prisoner did not administer any medicine to her in my presence—I think he went to fetch a cup for her to take it in—I was remunerated for my attendance by the deceased, in the prisoner's presence—the prisoner was present when she desired me to ex<lb></lb>amine the medicine—her object was, as I had been questioning her as to her symptoms, and knew more of her state than the gentleman who had not seen her before, she wished me to ascertain whether it was proper for her to take—she appeared to be alive to the propriety of taking care of herself—she was particular about my examining the medicine—after I got home, I received another message from the inspector of police, at half-past five o'clock—I proceeded immediately to the house—I found a great many persons outside the house, and in the room besides—I saw inspector Nor<lb></lb>man there—I saw the body of the deceased between the foot of the stairs and the door leading into the yard—she was with her face fronting the door—her knees were drawn up, the left arm under her body, and the right lying on the body—on examining the head and face I found a consi<lb></lb>derable number of wounds, they were on the face and neck and head—there were eight in number, and with one exception they all partook of the character of incised wounds—that one was rather a stab, a puncture, a contusion—it was not exactly a bruise—the largest, the deepest, and most important of the incised wounds was on the left side of the neck—that in<lb></lb>cision measured four inches at least in length and two inches in depth, but not all the way, more in the centre of the wound—in that incision all the principal and main arteries of the left side of the neck with the veins and nerves were totally divided—the windpipe was severed through, with the exception of a small portion at the posterior part—in my judgment it was a mortal wound, and death would ensue in a very short time—a querter of an hour, perhaps, or twenty minutes—the arteries on the right side would have carried on the functions of life for a short time—she was a slight spare woman—immediately above this large wound was another, as if there had been a previous attempt—it was parallel with it and merely dividing the skin, merely superficial, and of no importance at all—the next wound of importance was on the lower lip—in that incision the upper part of the lower lip was divided through—the wound took a curved direction to the left—it went right through the upper part of the lip, and was to the extent of two inches and a half—there would have been considerable hemor<lb></lb>rhage from it, and it divided important arteries—it was a deep wound—the next was on the right side, opposite the other, on the same lip—it divided the skin and a portion of the lip and took a straight direction—that was not mortal—the fifth was on the right side above the lip on the cheek—that incision was merely cutaneous—the sixth incised wound was opposite the right eye—that incision extended through the skin and some considerable portion of the muscles and flesh, aid took a straight direction—it was about an inch and a half or two inches in length, and about half an inch in depth—the seventh was behind the right ear—it was a short but deep incised wound—it extended to the bone, which is rather prominent just there—I should say it was half an inch deep, that I also consider an incised wound—the eighth was on the right cheek, that was deep and partook of the character</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183911250079"></xptr>
               <p>of a punctured wound—it was far different to the others, and in the inflic<lb></lb>tion of which there must have been some considerable force used—it went to the bone—it slanted off a little at the side of the bone—it did not pene<lb></lb>trate into the mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at the instrument which lies before you; with regard to the first wound you speak of, is that razor such an instrument as would have inflicted such a wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly so; the other wounds about the left cheek, the lower lip, and the back of the ear, might also have been inflicted by such an instrument, and on reflection, I have thought that the wound on the right cheek would correspond with this part of the razor—(<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—I understand what is called <hi rend="italic">jobbing</hi> with a knife—that wound was not done with a <hi rend="italic">job</hi> of a sharp instrument, but I think it must have been done with the upper part of the razor, from its appearance, and the direction it took—I do not think it could be done with the heel of the razor—the wound was not of that shape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment could those wounds be inflicted on the deceased by herself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly not—according to my judgment the large wound commenced at the back part of the left side of the neck—the body was lying on its left side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is your reason for saying the wounds could not have been in<lb></lb>flicted by the deceased herself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Judging from the position of the deceased, lying on her left side, with her left arm under her body, corresponding to the wound in the throat, with an immense quantity of blood on the floor, the manner. in which the razor was found, and knowing her previous con<lb></lb>stitution, and after the infliction of those wounds on the face, in my opi<lb></lb>nion it would be impossible to inflict that on the throat—assuming that the wounds on the other part of the face had been first inflicted, I consider it impossible she could inflict that large wound on the throat, they were of such a serious extent—she would not have power to inflict that on the throat—there would have been considerable hemorrhage from the one on the lip especially—assuming the wound in the throat to have been first in<lb></lb>flicted, it would have been quite impossible for her to have inflicted the others—the blood would have been so great it would have immediately exhausted her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Looking at the nature of the wounds, the quantity of blood, and the position of the body, can you undertake to say with certainty whether or not those wounds must have been inflicted while she was on the ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were; especially the wound on the neck—supposing her to have inflicted the wounds on the other part of her person, and fallen from ex<lb></lb>haustion, I should say it would be impossible that she could inflict the larger one when on the ground—the prisoner had not applied to me for a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of his wife's body—there was no appearance of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> about her on my first visit, nor any appearance afterwards which could account for it—I did not in any way give the prisoner to understand that she had died of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, nor say any thing about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that old rope; supposing it to have been suspended in the shop, is it possible or probable that that rope would have given way with the prisoner's weight, supposing he had attempted to hang himself with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If he had been suspended with all his weight on the rope, I should say it would have given way, but there is another mode of strangling by being on the ground—I should say if his weight was hanging on that rope, it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183911250080"></xptr>
               <p>would have given way—I cannot say whether the same consequence would have taken place if the deceased had put herself in that rope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Regard being had to the state you found her in at a quarter-past two o'clock, was she a woman, in your judgment, who about three o'clock would have been able to make any successful resistance to an attack? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She appeared quite incapable at my visit to her, for even in common con<lb></lb>versation she had two hysterical attacks, but not knowing her general constitution, I cannot answer—I do not think she was in a state to have used sufficient violence to inflict the wound on the cheek, which must have been inflicted with violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> With regard to the possibility of the wounds being self-inflicted, I observe, you hesitated before you gave your answer; did that arise from any doubt on the subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all—I certainly give it as my perfect conviction, that it would be impossible for her to inflict all the wounds herself—I consider it impossible a person could inflict wounds on the neck and face, from the nature of the wounds and their extent—after the seven on the face, it would be impossible to inflict the one on the neck, and after inflicting the one on the neck, it would be impossible to inflict the other seven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing she had possessed herself of a razor, and was preparing to use it, either on herself or the prisoner, and a struggle to take place between them, he trying to get it out of her hands, in such a struggle, might those wounds have occurred? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not those about the face—I should say it was impossible they could have taken place incidentally in a struggle—my rea<lb></lb>son for saying it would be impossible to inflict the seven wounds after the one in the throat, or that one after the seven, is because there would not be sufficient strength—life might remain, but not strength to inflict a wound—when I saw her in the morning in hysterics I told her it was very slight, and I need not stay—it was then she mentioned the injury to her back—she said she would tell the truth, and mentioned how it happened—she told me she had jumped out of window the week before to avoid her husband—I do not think she said what time it was—I understood her to say it was to avoid her husband—she did not say he had tried to prevent her getting out—she said nothing more—the prisoner had been drinking—strong mental excitement will sometimes present an appearance in a person very much resembling intoxication, but I had another proof of intoxication, the <hi rend="italic">fetid</hi> from his mouth—half a glass of gin would not have produced that, unless he was in the habit of taking spirits—in a person of intemperate habits that might appear if he had drank a small quantity—I heard that he and the deceased and Hall had taken a small quantity of spirits before I came.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you gather from his speech, as well as other things, whether he had been drinking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not address me particularly—my impression decidedly was, that he had been drinking—the deceased told me that she had jumped out of the up-stairs window—it was at that time she said she would tell the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe any marks on the deceased's neck, as if there had been a rope round it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not.</p>

               <p>before it—she was given to getting drank, and he also, latterly—both drank very hard, and were very passionate and very aggravating—I have known her go away from her home—I remember one Sunday morning he expected her home on Saturday night, she did not come home, and he went out, I think, and got drinking—on Sunday morning he came home tipsy, and asked where Betty was—I endeavoured to tell him she would be home presently—his sister and I persuaded him to go to bed, and after that his sister went out to go to church—I was in the adjoining room, and thought I heard a noise down stairs—I went into the room where I had left him on the bed, and he was gone—I went down stairs, and he was sitting in the corner of the shop—he cut his forehead with a rusty knife—we had put every thing away, because when in that state he used to attempt to lay violent hands on himself—he attempted to lay violent hands on himself on that occasion—I had put every thing away, fearing he would do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker. I live next door to the house the prisoner occupied, and am his landlord—I have known him and his wife seven years last September—I have seen them together a good deal at times—his general conduct to her was very good, when sober—they were both given to drink—she was very aggravating when they used to come home—I have frequently heard him accuse her of being in bed with other men and a good deal of conversation—there is a very thin partition between our two houses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When were you told to come here as a witness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two or three days ago, about Tuesday I think—his friend Mr. Bailey came and his relations—it is about eighteen months or two years ago that I heard him charge her with being with other men—I have heard it more than once, but that was the last time—they were a loving couple when sober, and when one was drunk, the other was drunk—they both went out together, and got drunk—she was a slight made, thin woman—not strong and pow<lb></lb>erful, but she was always the master of him when they quarrelled—I have been told so by the neighbours—his mother has been in and said she could not live with them any longer, they were so quarrelsome and used such aggravating terms, and I have heard it from her own tongue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, within the last six months what have you heard her aggravating him about? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot call to mind—I remember her jumping out of window—I heard her fall—I did not go to her assistance—I went to the prisoner—she ran down the street—the prisoner appeared drunk—that was four days before the murder—they broke the partition between the yards, and I went in to speak to them about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not she on that occasion complain that it was the cruelty of her husband which made her jump out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see her then—I saw her afterwards—I did not have any conversation with her about jumping out of the window—I went in about having my yard mended, and the pri<lb></lb>soner was breaking the shop windows—when they were drunk they were both violent.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before you heard her fall out, had you heard anything going on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—several people were looking at the house—it was a long time before she did jump out—she stood on the sill of the window some time first—I did not see the prisoner at that time—he was inside.</p>

               <p>Court. You went to the office in expectation of seeing some man there that had robbed you? - Yes, my servant said, he knew the man, and I went in expectation of seeing somebody that my servant should know.</p>
               <p>When you went in were there many people in the room? - Not more than six or eight, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner the first man that was fetched when you went in? - Yes, as soon as I came in, Mr. Bond sent for him immediately.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner was fetched, was he shewn to you as a person that was under a suspicion of robbing you, or did you make any observation of him? - When the prisoner was brought, Mr. Bond asked me if I knew that man; I said, I did not, for I did not know the men that robbed me; and I immediately said, I am upon oath Mr. Bond, to speak the whole truth, the man's voice exceedingly corresponds with the voice of the man that ordered me to get into my carriage again.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observations besides the voice? - Not the least; only the man that was on that side, was a very tall man.</p>
               <p>How was it as to the light at that time? - It was not sufficiently light for me to distinguish exactly the colours; I could see white from black, but I suppose, I could not distinguish blue from black; all the recollection I have, I think the man on that side, when he turned round he appeared to have lightish clothes, but I cannot say with certainty; I took particular notice he was very tall; as to the faces of either of them I cannot tell; I do not think either of them were muffled; but I cannot be positive; nothing has been found; it was only money, and there was nothing singular about it; we drank tea in London, and left town about six, and we jugged on about five miles, or five miles and an half; we came from Moorfields in order to avoid the stones of the city; we went through Paddington.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Counsel. If I understand you right, it was so dark that you could not distinguish colours? - Not sufficiently.</p>
               <p>You made no observation at all on the person? - No, only that he was a very tall man.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Holbrook; my master was robbed of a Tuesday night about a month ago; about half after seven as nigh as I can guess; I was driving the chaise; he came up and said, stop, post-boy, stop, or I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Who came up? - A tall thin young fellow, in light coloured clothes, with a long face.</p>
               <p>Should you know him again? - I believe I should.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the person? - I believe that is the person.</p>
               <p>Do you believe the prisoner to be the man? - I believe him to be the man; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Why did not you say so at first? - I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Is it by looking at him that makes you sure? - I am sure he is the man; I took particular notice of him at the time of the robbery; the prisoner at the bar came up and said, stop post-boy, stop immediately, or I will blow your brains out; I stopped immediately; he was close to me; he came from behind; he was of the near side of me; he turned back and demanded the money; your money, says he; he did not demand my money; I am a servant; he demanded my master's money; he went on the near side of the carriage where my mistress was; the prisoner was not the person that went to my master.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether your mistress gave him any money? - I cannot say; I heard none pass between them.</p>
               <p>What passed after this? did he do any thing after this? - No, he swore at them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250193"></xptr> that were in the carriage before the glasses were let down; he said, let the glasses down, or I will blow your brains out; my master got out of it, and said, if they were gentlemen, to behave as gentlemen, as they had got his money; he told him to get into the chariot again, or else he would blow his brains out.</p>
               <p>Which of them said so? - I cannot say, they both said they would blow his brains out, if he did not get into the carriage.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they both said so, or only one of them? - They both said so; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Was the tall man on the side of the carriage with your master, or on the other side? - He was on my side.</p>
               <p>Did they both speak together? - Very near together, but I cannot say which spoke first.</p>
               <p>Did they both speak to you at the time you stopped? - Only one, that was him that was on my side, that was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Then at any one time, did you hear his voice alone? - I heard his voice then, that was the only time, the other was not speaking then.</p>
               <p>When you went to the magistrates with your master, did you go in expectation of seeing the man that robbed your master? - When I first saw the prisoner, he was brought into the room.</p>
               <p>Was you asked if that was the man? - Yes; I said, I believed he was the person by his voice, and by his complxeion.</p>
               <p>Was there light enough to see his complexion at the time of the robbery? - Yes, he was close to me; he partly touched me; he had no disguise in the least; he rode up to me; I knew him by his voice, and by his long thin face, and his dress.</p>
               <p>What had the man you saw in Bow-street the same dress on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What dress had he on? - A light coloured coat, a cocked up hat, and his hair tied behind; when I saw him at Bow-street, he appeared in the same way.</p>
               <p>Had he a cocked up hat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Considering the situation in which he which he stands, his life depending on your evidence, can you safely swear, what you have sworn already, that you have no doubt but he is the man? - I have no doubt but he is the man.</p>
               <p>You will swear that positively? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How long have you been coachman to my friend Mr. Holbrook? - About four months.</p>
               <p>You knew the prisoner perfectly well before the robbery? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by complexion? - I know him in every respect.</p>
               <p>But explain what you mean by complexion? - His complexion, and his height, and his thinness, and his dress, and his voice.</p>
               <p>The man that robbed you, you never saw before; and you never saw him till a month afterwards? - It was very nigh a month.</p>
               <p>You knew before you got there, that you was to see a man that was charged with robbing you master? - I did not mind any thing about that.</p>
               <p>But you was told to drive your master to see the man that robbed him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you had talked of this robbery to your companions, and says you, or says they, if we can convict him, there is forty pounds? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You never heard of forty pounds? you will swear that upon your oath? - I have heard of it, but never heard any thing about my having the forty pounds; I heard there was forty pounds for somebody.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you first hear that? - A long while ago.</p>
               <p>Before you went to Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you expect some share of it? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Who was to have the forty pounds? - I cannot say, I never inquired about it.</p>
               <p>Do not you expect some of it? - No, nor desire any.</p>
               <p>Who did you understand was to have the forty pounds, upon your oath? - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250194"></xptr> did not understand who in particular was to have the forty pounds one way or the other; I did not know the witnesses was to have any thing; I cannot say who was to have any of it; I never enquired about it; I never heard in discourse who was to have it.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived near London? - Not a quarter of a year.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have not your fellow servants told you, it would be a good thing to put a part of this money in your pocket? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did nobody say any thing about it at Bow-street? - Nobody said any thing about it at all.</p>
               <p>You never heard you was to have a part of it? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to say it was light enough to distinguish? - It was light enough.</p>
               <p>Is not your master a man of character? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He says it was not light enough? - He could not see so well as me.</p>
               <p>Your master was out of the chariot? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he says it was dark? - I could distinguish clear.</p>
               <p>Now as to voice what was there particular in the man's voice? - Like the person's that is at the bar.</p>
               <p>How is his voice different from mine? - He does not speak like you; he came up to me in a good humour.</p>
               <p>How came you at first to say, I believe he is the man, two or three times, and then afterwards mend your evidence; was not you told to plump it now? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you understand the counsel just now? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know what is meant by plumping it? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Did any body tell you to say any thing about it? - No, Sir, neither in Court, nor out of Court.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any conversation with any person desiring you to give any account of this business? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Could you swear to my voice to morrow, if you was to hear it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You would forget it to-morrow, should you? - No, I do not think I should.</p>
               <p>You would swear to my voice to-morrow? - Yes, if you spoke as you do now.</p>

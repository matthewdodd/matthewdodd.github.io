                  </hi>. I live with my father, George Jackson, a shoe<lb></lb>maker, in London-street, Greenwich.

I have not"—I called in a policeman, and then she produced them from under her cloak, and said if I would forgive her she would never do it again—she had got out of the room into the shop—the boots were tried on in the small room—she was taken into cus<lb></lb>tody—the policeman took the boots—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know them to be my father's, by the letter on them—I saw her take them from under her cloak.</p>

                  </hi>. I assist Mrs. Vice, a tobacconist, of Orchard-street, Westminster—on 15th February, about 6 in the evening, the prisoner came for half an ounce of tobacco, which came to three-halfpence; I had not seen him before, but am certain he is the man—he gave me a half-crown—I put it in the till, where there was no other large money—I gave him the change, and he left—Mrs. Vice came in about half-past 8—I did not see her clear the till, but I saw her bring the money into the par<lb></lb>lour, and put it on the mantel-piece—on the next afternoon, Tuesday, she gave me some money to buy some tobacco; I saw her take it off the mantel<lb></lb>piece—there was a half-crown among it, which I afterwards found was bad, and rolled it up in paper, and put it in my pocket—next day, Wednesday, I saw the prisoner looking into the shop—he afterwards came in and asked for half an ounce of tobacco—he gave me a half-crown—I bent it, and told him it was bad, and that I had the fellow one in my pocket, which he gave us on Monday—he said that he was not out of barracks on Monday, and he would take me to where he had it from—he took me as far as Queen-square, where I saw an officer, and gave him in charge—I marked the half-crowns, and gave them to the officer at the station—the prisoner was dressed in his red coat and foraging-cap on both occasions.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was there anything remarkable about the person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, his likeness; his moustache being light—I do not suppose there is any one like you in the whole battalion—you did not take me straight towards the barracks; you were making your way towards York-street, and your way was through Queen-square Gate, and up Birdcage-walk, where the barracks are—you could have got away from me, but I could have sworn to you at the barracks.</p>

I keep a tobacconist's shop in Tothil-street—on 15th February, about half-past 10 or a quarter to to 11, I cleared out the till, and found a half-crown and some smaller silver, but no other large coin—I put it on the mantel-piece in the parlour; I sleep in the adjoining room—I saw the same money there on the following morning; it was never touched—in the course of that afternoon I gave that money to Pierpoint—I do not think I took any money on the Monday, because I was not home till half-past 8—that half-crown I afterwards found to be bad—I found no other half-crown in the till, till Wednesday evening, when the prisoner came and paid with one.</p>

Yes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130025"></xptr>there on the 24th of June; the prisoner and I were at the Dolphin in Long alley. About three o'clock in the afternoon I had occasion to go to the privy; I put my watch on the seat, I came away and forgot it; about one hour after that I missed it. I returned to the privy, the prisoner was in the privy; I asked the prisoner if he had seen a watch on the seat, he said no; I called the workmen together; by that time the prisoner came out; they all denied it together; the prisoner denied it a second time. About six o'clock in the evening the prisoner left work. I believe the man was intoxicated, or else he would not have done it. I have seen the watch since.</p>

            . Q. You are a pawnbroker - A. Yes, I live at No. 6, Aldersgate street. On the 24th of June, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner pledged this watch with me for fifteen shillings</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at work at the building for the prosecutor's father; we drank freely; I had occasion to go to the privy, he came and accused me of the watch; I denied that I had it. On my getting up, stupid as I was, I took and pawned it for fifteen shillings. I came back and left the duplicate and a seven shilling piece for the prosecutor; I confessed that I had pawned the watch; he received the ticket of the watch on the following morning and the seven shilling piece; it was all agreed on in part of payment, and that the remainder part of the money should be paid by me in a fortnight, but the constable would not permit it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

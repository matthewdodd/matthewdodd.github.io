I am a clerk in the London and County Bank, Lombard Street—it is part of my duty, after the notes have been entered in the waste-book, to take charge of them when they are put in the tray, and to make out a list in the Bank list register—the prisoner shared that duty with me—I was at the bank on the 25th March—about 2 o'clock that day he said, "Shall you want me this afternoon?—I said, "I shall, the notes are rather heavy"—he said, "All right, I shall be back soon"—he went out, at least he left me—I saw him again about 3 o'clock—I said to him, "You have been rather long," looking at the clock—he replied, "Yes, I have, just an hour"—I entered in the bank list register all the notes I took charge of that day from the trays—at the end of the day I went through the list to see whether the notes were all right—I balanced them with our books, and found we were 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short—it might have been two notes or more—I examined the whole of the waste-books, and tried my balances twice—I could not say whether it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, or ✗ several 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I ascertained, by working up the register, that it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I examined the waste-book—I knew the note, 00892, was missing—I found that out about two or three days afterwards, when I worked up the balances—that is a very long job, it takes us four hours to work up the notes and check them—we send the notes to the bank once a day.</p>

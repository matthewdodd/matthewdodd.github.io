            , my niece, lived in my room. On the 13th of June, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I left the house to see the charity children go to St. Paul's. Pepper and my husband went out before me - I left nobody in the apartments; I locked the door. When I opened it the lock did not appear injured - somebody must have used a false key to get in - I had left a gown on the bed; I was not the first that went in - Pepper's gown hung on a nail when I went out; and the petticoat was on the bed.</p>

            . I left the apartments at half-past ten o'clock. Mr. Winder was gone before me; I went to see the procession, and returned about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, and found the door locked; I saw nobody there; I had left my gown hanging on a nail, and the petticoat on the bed. I went to the Swan, public-house, in Coleman-street, to wait till my aunt returned, and in about ten minutes I returned to the house again - I had two friends whom I left at the bottom of the court; I went up stairs, and saw the prisoner just coming out of the room door, with his foot on the first step; the door was ajar, I did not see anything in his possession; he walked by me. There is no higher stairs in the house, nor any other room door on that floor. I went forward to the door to see if my aunt was come, and was much alarmed - the gowns were thrown behind the door; mine had been moved some distance from where I hung it. Mrs. Windser's gown was also there; my gown was not much worn. I called Stop thief! but he got away - I pursued him; I lost sight of him after he got out of the house, but saw him three or four minutes after in custody of Read. I am sure he is the same man I saw coming out of the door.</p>

I was with Pepper, and was waiting with my mother at the corner of the court - I saw him come out of the house, and heard the cry; he ran by me - I caught him without losing sight of him. He was searched in my presence, and a large bag was found in his hat, and three keys wrapped up in rags separate, and more keys were found in his waistcoat pocket - I took him back to the room; he was searched there - two gowns laid on the floor with a petticoat all rolled up together.</p>

I heard the cry of Stop thief! and found the prisoner in Read's custody; I took him back to the room, and found three door keys in a bag in his hat, and three door keys wrapped up separately in rags; I found five other keys in his waistcoat pocket, two of which will open Windser's door.</p>

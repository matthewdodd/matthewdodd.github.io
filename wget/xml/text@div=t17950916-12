I met with the prisoner the corner of King street, on the 6th of July last, to the best of my knowledge, between twelve and one in the night, as near as I can tell; I dined in Oxford-road, I staid till the afternoon, till that time. I lodged in Stockwell, in Surry.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you going home then to Stockwell - Yes. She asked me to treat her; I told her I had no money; afterwards I told her I did not much mind treating her, for I would have a glass of gin myself.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you was pretty far gone in liquor at this time yourself - No, I was not. I was coming away from Oxford street about eight o'clock, and I met with an acquaintance, and went back again, but I was not the least in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. How was you to treat her without money - I had money, but I was not willing to let her know I had any. I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160041"></xptr>her to go one side of the way, and I would go on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go? - Yes, to the Broad way, to the Cumberland Arms, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this that you got to the Cumberland Arms? -Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the house open? - Yes; the door was shut, but we knocked at the door and got in; the people were up at the house; she had a glass of gin and I had a glass of ale; we came out of the door after drinking of this; there was an acquaintance of mine that sat in a box, and had a pint of ale, and I had a glass of that with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect to find him there, or was it by chance? - No, it was accidentally. She asked for a glass of ale, and it was given her by me; she asked me whether I was going with her? I told her no; which she stopped till the ale was drank up, the ale that this man was drinking of. I went out of doors, and she followed out after me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you agreed with her that she was to follow you? - No, I told her I would not go with her. When I went out of the door I wished her good night; she turned her hand about and snatched the watch out of my pocket, close to the door in the street; I catched her by the hands and insisted on having of it again; she swore she would be damned if I should, she would have two shillings from the landlord of the house for it, or on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any talk about the landlord having this watch? - No; I don't know what her meaning could be.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you agreed before to give her any money? - No, I told her that I had none.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing passed in the house about the landlord giving her two shillings? - No, nothing was said till she said she would get it of the landlord. I catched her by the hand and held her fast, and she made a very great noise, and I was afraid of getting into the watch house; I thought of getting it more easy, I followed her in to the landlord of the house, she had the property under her apron; I got hold of her gown tail up to the bar door; she asked for Mr. Luxton, the landlord, that she wanted to speak to him; he replied, what do you want? when I stepped from that bar door round into the parlour, to speak to him to take the watch; (you go round into the parlour to get into the bar) but before I could say any thing to him I missed

            ; I ran out of doors without saying any thing to Mr. Luxton; I went up and down the street, and see nothing of her; I came in and told Mr. Luxton what had happened; he told me that he was very sorry for it, that he would try and find her name cut, and where she lodged, by an acquaintance of her's that she had some conversation with before; he found her name by one of the girls that came in; her name was set down and where she lodged, and I stopped there all night; Mr. Luxton told me to make myself easy, I should find my watch the next day. When I got up the next morning I had a particular acquaintance that called in, that came from Stockwell, he was acquainted with Mr. Luxton, which Mr. Luxton wished him to go with me and take this girl. We went, my friend and me, Mr. Luxton was ill with a scalded leg; we went into Peter-street, Westminster; she had been moved from there about three days; we were directed to Pear-street, to the best of my knowledge.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you go to Pear-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find her? - Yes; in a back parlour; I cannot tell you the number, a private house. My acquaintance went in while I stood at the door; he asked her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160042"></xptr>what she had done with the watch? she said that she had never seen any; I heard him. He brought her out to the door to me, and asked me whether that was the person? I declared that was the girl that was in my company the last night. He took her up to the office, and I followed close behind; when we had got near the office she declared that he had never seen the watch; but before we had her over to the office, my acquaintance went over for a runner, which I was left in care with her at the public house opposite; she said to me the time we were alone, you know that you carried the watch yourself to the landlord; I told her that she was a false woman for so saying, and I insisted upon it she should be punished if she would not deliver the duplicate or the property.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no intimation of its being pawned; not till after. Immediately the runner came in and took her in possession, searched her, and found nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she searched in your presence? - No. He came to me from the office, and went down to the house where she was taken from, in Pear-street; we found nothing there belonging to me, neither duplicate nor nothing; there were new shoes, and bread and butter, and tea, &amp;c. in the room. We went back to the office and went to the pawnbroker's that is opposite almost, in the same street a the office, the office is in Queen-square, of the name of Brown to the best of my knowledge; the runner asked if there had been such a watch there that morning; the shopman said, there had, but he did not take it in.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was not there? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then? - We went to the office, and she was committed for further trial.</p>

               <p>Q. You have not got the pawnbroker here? - No; the justice would have sent for him, but the runner got the pawnbroker off on account of saying he had not taken it in.</p>
               <p>Q. What house had you been drinking at in Oxford-road? - One Hanson keeps the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you dine? - About three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What company were you in? - Twenty or thirty. This is a house of call for the trade of carpenters.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you was perfectly sober? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to go with this woman out of your way going home to Stockwell? - Nothing more than wishing to have a glass myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of your dividing, going different sides of the way? -Because I was afraid of people seeing me with her, as a woman of bad character, as I was well known thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no sort of connection with her? - Never, not till she took the watch from me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What he is saying he is telling a great many stories; I never had the watch or did I ever see it.</p>

On the 6th of July, I think, about the hours of twelve and one, this gentleman and the prisoner came in and had a glass a piece (ours is a watering house for hackney coachmen) and one single pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid for that? - Mr. Knowles From that they went out of the house and staid about five minutes to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about my watch before they went out? - No, nothing at all. They came in again, the woman came in first, and I was at the bar, and the says, Mr. Luxton, I want to speak to you; and I made her answer in a hurry, what do you want? In the mean time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160043"></xptr>Mr. Knowles was coming round into the bar, through the parlour, to speak to me, while he was coming round she went away; from thence the young man ran after her, and he came back and told me his story; I told him I was very sorry for if, if I could find out the person I would. Accordingly I found out the person, and I told him and his acquaintance in the morning where he might find her.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find out where she lodged? - By one of the coachmen, who told me that she lodged at the Cross Keys, in Duke-street. I made Knowles stay there that night till the morning; I thought it was very hard for the man to lose his watch. He was sober when he came into my house. In the morning there was a friend of his came to the house, and they found the prisoner at the bar, and took her to Queen-square; the justice sent for me. She told the justice that Knowles had left the watch with me for two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go any where afterwards? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming home very late one Sunday night, and I light of this man, and he asked me to go and have a glass of something, and I went with him to have a glass of gin, and he called me on one side in the house, and told me that he would give me two shillings to go home with me; and I said that was too little; and he said, that if I would not take it there were plenty of girls that would. With that he went to the bar to speak to Mr. Luxton about something, but what I cannot say; and I staid in the house all the time, and had half a pint of gin, I and some girls, and we drank the gin, and I came out of the house directly, and I left this Mr. Knowles along with this man in the watering house, talking to him in his own bar, after he gave me the glass of liquor. In the morning he came down to me to my lodgings, and he swore that I had robbed him of his watch, and I said, I have never seen it. With that he and another man began pulling me about, and I said, don't ill use me, gentlemen, I will go any where with you, and they took me down to the office in Queen square, and from there I have been committed to prison ever since.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Were there any other disorderly women in the house? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you drink with other women there? - No. There were other women there that she drink with.</p>

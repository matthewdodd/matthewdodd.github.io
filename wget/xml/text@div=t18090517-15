               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes. On Friday night, the 12th of May, about half past ten, the brought with him two horses.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of horses were they - A. Bay horses; they seemed to be post chaise horses; one had a saddle and bridle, the other had a collar and bridle, of a led horse. There were no traces on them at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came in about ten o'clock at night, what did he do - A. He put up at our house, I had the care of the horses, and he slept at our house; in the morning he got up about half past five; he went into the stable, he put the saddle and bridle on the horse that he rode; he brought him out of the stable, telling me he was going to have a shoe put on; he left the other horse in the stable; he ordered me to feed the horse, and clean him, and give him some water, I did so; at the time I was cleaning the horse, Girdler came and owned the horse; he asked if there was not another belonging to it, I told him there was; he was gone to the blacksmith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Girdler go towards the blacksmith - A. Yes. The two horses and the prisoner were all brought back to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Girdler went away with the two horses - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember in the course of Friday evening, or on Saturday morning, the prisoner giving any account of the horses, what they were - A. I asked him in the morning if they were coach horses, he said one was a coach horse, and the other was an old charger; he told me that he had been taking a carriage to town for his master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you who his master was - A. No, nor did I ask him; he said he was going to take them to the barracks, after he had got one shod.</p>
               <p>Q. to Girdler. Now the horse that you saw at the stables, at the King's Arms, are you sure that was your master's horse - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the horse that you saw facing of the sadler's, that horse was likewise your master's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this, you took both the horses, did not you - A. Yes; and my master has had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Williams. The horse that was brought back with the prisoner, was that one of the two horses that he brought in the night before - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, look at him - A. Yes; he came to my master's shop on Saturday morning the 13th, he brought a horse with him to be shod.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your shop facing a sadler's - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not tell you how he came by this horse, did he - A. No; I shod him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner take the horse away - A. Yes; after I put the shoe on the horse, he sent me for the other horse to be shod all round. I went for the other horse, I found it in the possession of Girdler.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with Girdler when the man was taken - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of his attempting to escape, did he run away - A. Yes; I ran after him with Girdler.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been punished by the regiment a great deal; it made me quite careless almost to think I should be punished, and not in fault; for that reason, I was careless what I did. I did not take the horses with intent to make money of them, or steal them. A gentleman that I never saw in my life before,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170018"></xptr>persuaded me to ride the saddle horse, and be rode the other. We went on the road, I cannot tell what place it was; I never was in the country before. The other man took the traces off the horses; I asked him what he was going to do with them, I thought it was wrong; he said you never mind; he told me to put up at the house where the ostler lived, he would call at eight o'clock in the morning. As we were riding along, I perceived the horse I was riding, go lame; I said we had better get him shod, than for the horse to go lame. When I came to the stable in the morning, I asked the ostler where I could get a blacksmith, he told me. I took him to the blacksmith; I saw the other horse wanted shoeing all round. I told the blacksmith to fetch him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Robert-street, Hampstead-road. On the 29th of July last, about half past ten o'clock at night, being in Kingsland-road, I went into the Acton Arms public-house, for the purpose of ascertaining my way to Islington—I had a glass of beer there—three females followed directly into the house after me—they went to a different part of the bar, and called for some gin—I was having my beer immedi<lb></lb>ately inside the door, at the bar-counter—the women went up to the bar, a short distance from me—all of them—it was a very short distance, the bar being small—one of them called for some gin—not having any change in my pocket, I was compelled to take out my purse to pay for the beer I had—I gave the landlord a sovereign, and previous to his giving me the whole of the change, he inquired of the women who was to pay for the gin—one of them immediately said I was to pay for it—I refused doing so—upon which, finding the three women were drawing near to me, and never having been in the neighbourhood in my life before, I asked the landlord how much it was, and on his saying 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I told him to take it out in the change, rather than have a disturbance about it—I paid for it, and then feeling myself unwell from the beer I had taken 1 left the house—I felt sick from the beer—I had dined at East Ham with some friends, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260031"></xptr>
               <p>taken about a pint of wine—I should have stated, 'that on the landlord's giving me my change, I immediately put it into my purse, which I put into my right-hand trowsers pocket—there were six sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and three half-crowns, a shilling, and sixpence in silver, I be<lb></lb>lieve, in it—I had dined about half-past four or a quarter to five o'clock—this was about half-past ten o'clock—the gas was lighted in the bar—I left the house, and the three women followed me—it was a fine night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you take on yourself to say whether the prisoner is one of the three women you saw in the public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe her to be one, but I cannot swear to her—they were dressed in common cotton gowns, and had common bonnets on—so little notice did I take of them, I cannot say what sort of bonnets they had—immediately I got outside the door one of them seized me by both arms—a second placed her hand to my left side, and while I struggled for one moment to release myself, my pocket was unbuttoned, and my purse taken from it—it was not taken by either of the two that seized me, but the third one—the unbuttoned ray right-hand pocket, and drew my purse from it—I immediately gave the alarm that I was robbed—two of them ran away, and the third was apprehended almost on the spot—she was tried in August, and convicted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a die-sinker, and live at No. 6, Maria-street, Kingsland-road. I was acting as pot-boy at the Acton Arms at the time in question—Mr. Kelly came there, and called for a quartern of gin—three women were at the bar at the time the gin was called for—he was served with it, and then I went into the tap-room—he was then taken sick, being the worse for liquor—I cannot say that I heard him call for the gin, but it was lying on the bar when I went in—I was out at the time it was called for—I did not see him drink any gin—he had a glass of porter to drink—there were three women at the bar—I did not hear them call for any liquor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said before the Magistrate that they called for a quartern of gin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw the gin on the bar—Mr. Kelly paid for it—I saw his sovereign on the counter—he pulled out his purse—I then went away into the tap-room—he was taken very sick, and was retching very bard—I did not see him put his purse into his pocket—he was not to very much in liquor, but he was a little the worse for it—I had seen the women before—they were occasionally customers at the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at the prisoner; can you take on yourself to say that she is one of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was dressed very differently then to what she is now, hut I believe she was one of the three—when the prosecutor was taken sick, my master told me to see him out at the door—I did not do so—the three women saw him out—I remained against the door—I could see what</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260032"></xptr>
               <p>was doing—the door is three or four yards from the bar—I went to the door with him—I observed the prosecutor leaning over some palings, and retching very much—he was about five yards from me—while he was retching, the three women were round him, the same as I had seen in the public-house—the prisoner and another woman then went off. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see any thing done before they went off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner had the prosecutor's purse in her hand—she got it from his right-hand trowsers pocket—I saw her take it, and then I saw her and one of the other women go off—I had seen the prisoner at our house several times before—I am positive she was in the house that night, and I am positive that she had the purse in her hand—the Acton Arms is a public-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What do you mean by saying that she was dressed very differently when asked if you knew the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was dressed differently—she had a bonnet on then—it is about four months ago—I am positive she is one of the persons—she had a bonnet on, and a kind of a light shawl—I think the shawl makes a good deal of difference in identify<lb></lb>ing her—she is in a different dress now—that made me doubt about her at first—I was not exactly sure of her then, but I have looked at her since—I did not say she was dressed differently without looking at her—I had seen her, and was not positive of her—I am positive of her now—I did not say I was not positive of her—she had on a kind of straw bonnet—I have not seen her since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to swear you did not see her on the 26th of Decem<lb></lb>ber, and speak to her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw her in Old-street-road on boxing-day, and spoke to her—she was very tipsy then—I did not give her in charge—I would not attempt such a thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you lead the prosecutor to the door of the public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—I swear that—I was examined before the Magistrate—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—this is my handwriting—it was read over to me before I signed it—I was desired to attend to it—I said, "By the desire of my master I led him to the door," and I said that the three prisoners led him out—(<hi rend="italic">the deposition being read, was as follows, "By desire of my matter I led him to the door, and the three women followed him out,"</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, did not you say that you led the prosecutor to the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not swear it—I swore that the women led him out—when I saw the prisoner in Old-street, it was in the open street, between two and three o'clock in the day—it was above a mile from my master's house—the wo<lb></lb>men were all perfectly sober on the night of the robbery—I have always been of that opinion—I have seen them tipsy sometimes, but they were sober that night—I gave evidence here on the last trial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did not you then say that the prisoner then on trial, one of the three women, was in liquor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—the prosecu<lb></lb>tor was rather in liquor—I did not swear the woman then being tried was rather in liquor—there were only the three women there—there were no girls there, only the three women—that I swear—I never said there were three or four girls round the bar—I called these-women girls—I did not say there were any girls besides these—I never stated there were more than three—they said they would see Mr. Kelly out—they all three lived together, at least, Ann Sherwood, the one who is transported, said so.</p>

I am a gardener, living at 353, City-road—on the morning of 27th December, about half-past 3, I was aroused by a noise overhead—I sleep in the back parlour on the ground floor—I got up, and called for a policeman—a policeman came, and I went up with him to the room above, and found the window open—I saw the window safe about half-past 8—I went to bed about 9—I missed this key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is the key of my parlour cupboard—I looked out at the window, and saw the prisoner go out from the next door into the road—there was a gas-lamp there—I on swear to the man.</p>

On the morning of 27th December, I was called to 353, City-road—when I was in the drawing-room, the window being open, I saw the prisoner leaving the garden of No. 355—that was at quarter-past 4—I am quite sure he is the man—I saw an officer on the opposite side of the road; he brought him into the garden, and I put my hand into his pocket, and took out this key—I asked him what key it was—he said, "Door"—I asked him where he lived—he said, "Holborn"—the key had been recently filed—there were two other keys with it—I could not find any owner to the others—they were together.</p>

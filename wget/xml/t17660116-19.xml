I felt my watch snatched out of my pocket. This was right opposite Chiswell-street. The prisoner was next me. I strongly suspected him. I took hold of him, and took him to the watch-house, and charged a constable with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any resistance?</p>
               <p>Snape. No, he did not. We took two more of them, but I had no opinion of their taking it, and they were let go. We searched the prisoner, but I never found my watch again.</p>

            . I had been in company with the prosecutor all that day. Going home between: 12 and 1 at night, we were surrounded by eight or ten fellows: he cried out, he had lost his watch. The prisoner being next to him, we secured him. This is all I know.</p>

The prisoner came to our shop a little before nine o'clock, on the evening of the 28th of April, and asked the price of a pair of trowsers; I said I did not know, but he took them down, and I saw the mark was 1 l. 7 s. - he then took and twisted them up in his hand, and ran off - a person at the door pursued him; I saw him again at Marlborough-street office, and am certain of his person.</p>

            . I am a draper and hatter, and live in Lamb's Conduit-street. I was going to see Mr. Smith on this evening - when I got to the door I saw the prisoner talking to Mrs. Smith, and I paused to consider whether I should go in then, or call as I returned; I then saw him wrap something round his arm, and dart out of the shop; I threw a bundle which I had into the shop, and followed him - he was taken by the watchman, in Southampton-street, but the trowsers were not found; they were drab colour: I am positive he is the man; he ran, and called Stop thief! I am quite sure he was the person - I never lost sight of him but at the turnings.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I stopped the prisoner in Southampton-street - he was running, and no person was before him; he is the person who was pursued. - Mr. Addinsell came up, and said he was the man; he had passed through several by streets: he came up White-Lion-street, and Bloomsbury market. I was at the post at the end of Southampton-street and Bloomsbury-square - I heard the cry and the rattles sprung; he came towards me, and I stopped him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the travelling inspectors of the missing letter department attached to the Post-office—in consequence of instructions I received, I went to Belper, on 25th February, and made up a letter, in which I enclosed two half sovereigns and eighteen postage-stamps, each of which I marked with the word "Trent," and "T. J." my initials—I addressed the envelope in which I enclosed them, to F. Bury, veterinary surgeon, Esher, Surrey—I posted it myself at the Belper post-office at half-past 9 that night: it would be in time to go by that night's post—I then went into the post-office, and saw the postmaster take it from the receiving box, and I left him some instructions concerning it—it would go to London that night, and the bag containing it would be opened in the travelling post-office on the Midland Railway in its passage up to London—the prisoner was employed in the post-office tender that night—he was a sorter, and was also acting as assistant mail-guard—I went from Derby to London by the same train, and arrived at the General Post-office about 5 o'clock—I was there a little before the prisoner—previous to his coming I had received some information, in consequence of which, when he came, I sent for him into the comptrollers-office—he came there to me, and Child, the Post-office constable also came in—I said to the prisoner, "You were on duty in the Midland sorting carriage last night?"—he replied, "Yes;"—I said, "You sorted the London letters from Belper, I believe?"—he replied, "No; I did not"—I said, "I have been informed that you did"—he said, "Perhaps I did assist," or "help; it was Mr. Hill's duty"—I said, "Did you see anything of a letter directed to Mr. F. Bury, veterinary surgeon, Esher, Surrey?"—he replied, "No"—I said, "The truth is, circumstances have come to the knowledge of the authorities which have led to the suspicion that you have been taking letters for some time, and the letter I have spoken to you about, was purposely sent from Belper last night, with a view of testing that matter; the letter came into your hands that is now missing, will you let us see whether you have got it about you now, or any of its contents?"—he took various things of no importance from his pockets, and turned some of his pockets inside out: after he had done, I said to Child, "It will be more satisfactory if you examine the pockets now"—he did so, and took from one of the coat pockets eighteen postage-stamps, rolled up in a small compass, but still all attached—I said to the prisoner, "Where did you get these stamps?"—he replied, "I bought them in London, when I was going down into the country on Monday night; I intended writing to my sister, but have not done so"—there were no marks visible on the stamps, at that time, but soon afterwards I applied a liquid to some of them, and then recognized my own mark, "Trent, T. J." on each that I applied the liquid to—I told the prisoner I could identify them as the stamps I had put into the letter I had been speaking to him about—he still adhered to</p>

               <p>his former story, that he had purchased them on the previous Monday—he said that he did not know how it was, and I gave him in custody—these are the stamps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the address that I put on the letter was fictitious.</p>

Just show us how the stamps were found. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were rolled up like this—I think he had on the ccat he has now—I believe his great coat was off at the time, but will not swear to it—I was not in the van where the letters were sorted—there were four persons in the van, Garsyth, Hill, Bannocks, and Crofton—I am not quite sure, but I think those were all—the prisoner has been in the Post-office about twelve years—the prisoner's house was searched I believe—I believe all the persons who were engaged in the van that night are in the same position still in the Post-office—it was the prisoner's duty when he got to the station to get into a conveyance, and the driver drives him straight on to the Post-office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the postmaster at Belper—on 25th February, I received some information from Mr. Jeffery about a letter, and on the evening of that day I took a letter out of the letter-box addressed, "Mr. F. Bury, Veterinary Surgeon, Esher, Surrey," which I could feel con<lb></lb>tained coin—I stamped it, and tied it up in the bundle of letters for London, which I put in the London bag, sealed it, and sent it down to the railway-station—it would, in due course, go up to London at 11.30—I had no communication with Garsyth.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who did you give the bag to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To Kirk, the messenger appointed to take it to the station—he is in the employ of the Post-office—he is not here—I know nothing of it after it passed out of my hands.</p>

                  </hi>. In February last, I was a sorter in the Midland district travelling tender to London—the mail-train coming up at night does not stop at Belper, but there is an apparatus which holds the letter-bag, which the train touches as it goes by, causing the bag to fall into a net—Mr. Jeffery, the travelling inspector, had made a communication to me about a letter which was coming—on the night of 25th February, the prisoner brought me the sealed Belper bag into the travelling office—I broke the seal and opened it—among the letters, I found two bundles, in one of which I saw the letter for Mr. Bury, veterinary surgeon, Esher—I opened the bundles, and placed them before the prisoner to be sorted, with that letter among them—it was placed among the letters for the London district—the prisoner ought to have placed it in the blind letter-box, but I looked there, after he had finished sorting, and could not find it—I knew that it was a test-letter—the Midland train stops At Rugby twenty minutes, and before we got there I tied up the letters out of the blind letter-box, and placed them in a bag with other letters to go to London to be sorted there—the London district letters are sorted in the train—the prisoner got out at Rugby, put all the bags on a truck, and brought them to the train to the post office carriage—his post-office duties at Rugby occupied him about eight minutes—on arriving at Euston-square station, the bags are conveyed from there in vans and post-office omnibusses—the prisoner had charge of the Midland bags in the omnibus; there was only him in that omnibus—I made a communication to Mr. Jeffrey's at Rugby—besides the prisoner and</p>

               <p>myself, Hills and Crofton were in the travelling carriage, but Hills and the prisoner were the only two who sorted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How do you know that the prisoner was the only person in the omnibus at the Euston station? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he was—I do not know of my own knowledge—the driver would be outside—the prisoner has orders to remain inside—I have only known the prisoner since he has been on the railway, about eight months—we have always been on very good terms—I have smoked a pipe with him, but not every night that I had an oppor<lb></lb>tunity—I was friendly with him—I am quite positive that I saw the letter in the bundle, addressed to this person at Esher—I have no doubt about that—I was not asked the question before the Magistrate—I am unable to state how many bags the prisoner had to take out at Rugby and leave—he brought back about eleven, I think, or it might be a dozen—it was not fourteen—the amount of time he took would depend upon whether the bags were ready for him or not—Hills was standing upright, close to the prisoner—they stand to sort—I was about a yard and a half from him—Crofton was about two yards and a half from him on my right—the prisoner was not working in his shirt sleeves, he was dressed in his coat as he always is—I cannot tell you about his great coat—I am still in the Post-office, not going up and down the line, but in another position.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a public-house. The prisoner came to me after twelve o'clock at night, on the 14th of June, and asked if I would let her have something to drink—I said, No, not unless she paid what was owing—at last she pulled out this watch, and told me a sailor gave it her—I advanced 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on it, which made up 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with the money she owed before—she promised she would fetch it in the morning—the policeman found the watch in my possession—the prisoner told him the same as she has to-day.</p>

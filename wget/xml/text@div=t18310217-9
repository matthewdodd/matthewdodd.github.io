            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. On the 11th of February, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was in company with Myers and Gollocker, who are officers, and went with them to a house on <placeName id="t18310217-9-crimeloc57">Great Saffron-hill</placeName>

               <p>Q. Describe the situation the other two prisoners were in when you entered the room? A. They were all round the fire, Swift sat in the middle next to Devereux, senior, between her and her daughter, who was opposite - they all sat close together by the fire; I believe Swift was sitting down on a bag which had a few coals in it, and at the other corner sat Devereux, junior, on an old saucepan - there was a fire, an iron pot on it, and a tobacco - pipe in the pot; they had a brisk fire - there was some white metal in the pot in a liquid state; Gollocker went round and seized Devereux, senior - they had a struggle, and rolled down on the ground together; the candle was at this time either put out or knocked out - they had a candle in the room, and we had one, but it went out before we got to the door; before the candle was put out it was in the hands of the prisoner Swift, as they were sitting all round the fire - Myers secured the younger Devereux, and I caught hold of the hand of Swift; I then gave Swift into Myers' hand, and procured a light from the next house - I could get no candle in the house; when I came up stairs with the light I saw Gollocker and Devereux, senior still on the ground, and assisted him in getting her away from the moulds, which were then under her - she was laying on them, for I could feel them under her, and to prevent her from crumbling them all to pieces, I moved her away; when we had removed her, there were the broken moulds under her - they are here; there were several pieces of moulds which form a pair now they are put together, as well as they can - I picked up these six counterfeit shillings before they left the room - they had also laid under her on the ground; I first saw them on the floor just after she was removed, and exactly on the part of the floor where she had been - one was about half a yard away from her; Myers and I brought the other two prisoners to the opposite side of the room, where Devereux, senior, had been placed, and the younger Devereux said, "Spare my mother, I don't care what becomes of me;" Swift made answer and said, "it is of no use, it is all over with us, we shall be transported at any rate;" I searched Swift, but found nothing on her -I then searched the younger Devereux; she objected to my feeling in her bosom - Swift told her it was of no use, for she was sure I would search her; Devereux, junior, then put her hand into her bosom, and took out three of these counterfeit shillings - I told her I was not satisfied, and should search her further; I then untied her apron loosened her clothes, and nine others dropped from her - one had fallen from her before that, and Myers had picked it up; that was before she was searched, and before I found the three - I produce the three and the nine, the twelve are together; I then searched the place, and we then picked up the six shillings - Myers took the pot off the fire; we secured the prisoners and brought them away -Myers locked the room, and took the key with him; the next day, in consequence of what Gollocker told me, I went to the room and brought a pan away - I got the key of the room from a woman down stairs.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Any body else might have been in the room in the mean time? A. Yes - the woman hesitated at first to give it to me, but I told her who I was; the pan had the appearance of plaster of Paris having been mixed in it - I had seen it in the room when we were there the day before; it was full of dirty water.</p>

            . I am a constable of Lambeth. I and Myers applied to Hall to assist in apprehending the prisoners - we all went together; I followed Hall up stairs - when the door was open I rushed past Hall, and seized the elder Devereux; she cried out, "O Lord!" she had got her left arm up, just as if she was frightened - when I entered the room she was sitting down close to the left-hand side of the fire-place, on a basket; she had something in her right-hand - I could not say exactly what it was; her right-hand was in her lap - I seized her hand, and the candle, which Swift was holding, dropped, or went out, and we were left in the dark; Devereux, sen. threw herself down on the ground - I threw myself down also, to keep her quiet; I kept her in that position till the light came, which was in about three minutes - before the light was brought I heard something break; I thought it was the mould - it appeared something crumbling, like the breaking of chalk; the noise proceeded from under her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she perfectly still all the time? A. No, she was very restless all the time she was on the ground; both before and after I heard the crumbling I thought, from her manner of moving about, that she had something under her which she wished to break - I reached across her, and dragged her right hand from under her right hip, where the mould was.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you judge it was under her hip? A. She was so very restless - I ascertained that it was a mould as soon as the light came; I did not take it up before the light came, but kept her as quiet as I could - while she was in this position I heard something drop from her; it rang on the ground like money - when she was taken up there were six pieces of coin - Hall picked them up.</p>
               <p>Q. State what passed when the light came? A. Hall assisted me to remove her from where she was laying to the other side of the room, which I should think is about twelve feet square - there were also the pieces of mould laying on the floor where she had laid; Myers picked them up, and he has them - Myers and Hall moved the other two prisoners across the room; Hall searched them - I saw the pot on the fire, and white metal in it, which was melted, and there was a tobacco-pipe in the pot; it appeared to be to hand the metal out, and put it into the mould - here is the pot; there was a very good fire - I saw this knife laying on the floor in the room, and in the cupboard there was some plaster of Paris; I produce a file, which was on the mantel-piece in the room - it seemed as if there had been white metal in the teeth of it, and does so now; I produce about 3lbs. of plaster of Paris, which I found in a bag in the cupboard - it is in dust; I found a small piece of white metal among the ashes under the grate, similar to what was in the pot - it appears to have fallen from the top of the mould after the mould was full; I saw a pan that was full of water, but I did not take particular notice of it that night - Myers locked the door, and took the key away when we left; I went back next day with Myers, and saw the pan standing there - I did not go with Hall; I left the pan there - something struck me, as the elder prisoner was sitting by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170012"></xptr>that she might have put something into it - here it is; there is plaster of Paris in it; there were a few hard lumps in it when I threw the water out - plaster of Paris will make a mould.</p>

            . I am a tobacconist, and live in Newington-causeway. I went with Hall and Gollocker -Hall went up stairs first, Gollocker next, and I behind, with a small lantern; when we got to the top of the stairs Hall burst the door open, and the moment he got in he said, "There are the moulds;" he seized hold of Swift, who was in the middle - Gollocker went by him and seized Devereux, sen., who was on the left hand side; I caught hold of the younger Devereux, who was on the right hand side, and at that time a scuffle-ensued between her and myself - the candle was knocked down and went out, and at that moment my lantern went out; at that time I saw Gollocker and Devereux, sen., on the ground - I shifted my hands, and seized the youngest Devereux with my right hand; I put my left hand across the old woman, and took up this shilling, which had just fallen from her, as I suppose, for it was directly in front of her- it was so very hot when I picked it up, that I dropped it, and in dropping, it broke away from the get part, which is the substance it is poured in by; I have got both parts here - the get is the part that is not round; it fits exactly to the coin; there is a little notch over the get, where it fits; it broke in two on my dropping it - it fell on this piece of black rag, which was open, and appeared to be what the moulds had been held in; the rag had some small particles of metal about it - at that time I heard the younger Devereux shifting some money about; I told her it was of no use, she had better be quiet, for I should find it by and by, after we had got them quiet; Hall put Swift in my care while he went down and brought up a candle - after the candle came up I removed Devereux. jun. and Swift to the further corner of the room; I placed them in a chair there, and tied their hands together, one hand to the hand of the other - each had still one hand loose, and while I was so doing, this shilling dropped from Devereux, jun.; I picked it up, and produce it here - Devereux, jun. repeatedly said, "Let my mother go, and keep us;" Hall and Gollocker then removed the elder Devereux, and brought her up to where I was, and underneath where she had been this mould laid, broken in pieces, as it is now- I put them together as well as I could, with Mr. Field's assistance; they are the pieces of a mould which form both sides of a shilling - here are some small pieces, which I could not put together with it; the get fits this thick part of the mould exactly - a small file laid in the black rag; it all laid there till after we had secured the prisoners - we then picked it all up together, before we removed them from the room.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was it you observed the pieces of metal in the black rag? A. At the same time as I saw the shilling, because the shilling laid on the rag - I saw it as soon as I went into the room, and I observed some small marks of metal on it, little splashes; it had fallen from Devereux, sen.'s lap, when I got in, as I was the third - it laid close to her, and I saw the shilling on it; I kept the key after the door was locked - I went back again that night, and saw the earthern pan there, with some water in it; I desired Gollocker the next morning, when we went, to pour the water off, which he did, and at the bottom of it were some hard pieces of plaster of Paris; I had observed the water in it the night before, but could not see the plaster of Paris - no one could have got in without picking the lock.</p>

               <p>Q. Hall says he got the key from a woman? A. Yes; after we had poured the water off, and had got every thing away, I left the key with the landlady of the house - we put the pan in a corner, and told Hall to go and fetch it- I should have said that I took the iron pot off the fire; it was in a very hot state, with a long tobacco-pipe in it - it is here, with its contents.</p>

            . I am a practical chemist, and am the assistant at the London University. I took a part from these moulds while they were in Myers' custody; I examined it - they are made of what is commonly called plaster of Paris: I examined some of the powder which Gollocker produced, and that is the same material - the moulds are made from the same material, and might have been made from this powder; the effect of water on plaster of Paris is to consolidate it - it becomes a perfect solid body, like this mould.</p>

            . I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint. I have seen several moulds of this description - I have had some experience in seeing implements for coining; (looking at the moulds) these now present parts of a broken plaster of Paris mould for casting shillings - parts of both the obverse and reverse sides of a shilling are visible on them now; this shilling picked up by Myers is counterfeit in all respects, and appears to have been made from this mould.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it the appearance or not of coin which is usually made by moulds of this nature? A. It has in all respects - I have seen a great many shillings which have been counterfeited by plaster of Paris moulds; they usually present this appearance when first cast - it is not finished; it has parts sticking to it, which are generally removed before it is circulated - it has the impression and perfect similitude of a shilling on both sides; nothing remains to be done but to file off the rough edge; these twelve are all of the same sort as the one - they are the same metal, and cast from the same mould, and alike in all respects; these six are the same as the twelve - they all require to have the particles round the edge removed before circulation; it is always necessary to remove the spray, as it is called - plaster of Paris moulds will not produce a shilling fit for circulation, but it will produce a perfect similitude of the figure of a shilling; this get appears to me to fit the shilling exactly; in my judgment, it is the get which was cast with that shilling - I have compared the get with the mould; it appears to fit exactly - the moulds are generally<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170013"></xptr>formed by putting a good shilling into the plaster of Paris; the channel to admit the metal to the impression is generally made with a piece of metal, or scraped out; the channels differ in size in different moulds - the get fitting the aperture of this mould leads me to suppose this shilling was cast in it; the get is the metal which fills the channel - the iron pot contains white metal similar to what the shillings are made of; I should think the metal now in the pot would make twelve or fourteen shillings, or hardly so many; these files are fit for filing the edge of the coin - one appears to have been used at white metal; the other also, in a slight degree - the impression in the mould exhibits the wrong side - the matrix; it is like the impression of a seal, the letters are reversed; the mould is hollow where the impression is to be raised.</p>
               <p>Devereux, Sen.'s Defence. I have nothing to say but that I had just come into the room, and a man came in there - I was only two days in the room; he took the room and brought these things there: I did not know any thing about it - he had hardly gone down stairs five or ten minutes when the gentlemen came to the room.</p>
               <p>Swift's Defence (written.) On the 11th of February I was on Saffron-hill, and met a woman, named Jones, who stopped me, and asked if I knew her husband - I asked his name; she said they called him Bob, and he wore a white coat; she suspected he was in Devereux's room - while talking he came up; she asked if he was coming home to tea - she asked me to tea, and said it was just by; she pressed me, and I went up - her husband went down, telling her to get tea, and he would be back directly; she asked me to go down, saying, "I think he has gone to Devereux's," she pointed to the door, asked me to go to the two pair, and ask for her husband - I knocked at the door, and somebody answered; I said was Bob there, and they opened the door - I said, "Your wife wants you, Bob," and he went down; Devereux asked where I had met his wife - I said in the street; I asked if she was not afraid to do such things as she was doing - she said,"It is nothing when you are used to it;" she asked me to sit down, which I refused - I took the candle off the chair; I heard somebody coming up whistling, and said, "Here is somebody coming;" Devereux said, "It is only Bob," she knew his whistle - I put the candle on the chair to open the door, and the officers came in; Devereux took the candle off the chair - they laid hold of the mother and daughter, and one took hold of me; I was searched, and nothing found on me- we were sent to Clerkenwell prison for another hearing -Mary Devereux went to her mother, and told her she had twelve bad shillings about her, and would sell them; she told her to do as she liked with them, she had brought her into trouble enough with them; she called Mrs. Foley, sold the shillings to her, and said, "You say it is the last you will buy of me, Mrs. Foley, but I am sorry for it;" Mary Devereux said, "You buy of my sister" - I hear they have carried on this trade a long while, and got many a young woman into trouble.</p>
               <p>Swift to MR. BARRETT. Q. Did you not see me at your house the same night that I was taken, on the 11th? A. I cannot speak exactly to the time; I recollect her being in the shop very well with another person, about dusk - I live in George-street, Hatton-garden, which is a very short way from Saffron-hill; it was either Thursday or Friday, but whether it was the day she was taken or not I cannot say - it must have been last Thursday or Friday week; she came with a stout woman, to buy some goods - I do not know her name, but I knew her by sight; it was in the evening - I do not know what they asked for.</p>

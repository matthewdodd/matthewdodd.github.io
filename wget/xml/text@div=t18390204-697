                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Kingham, of Barbican, an oil and colour-man—Mr. Knapp, the jeweller, resides next door to us. On the night of the 7th of February, about half-past nine o'clock, I had shut up my master's shop, and was putting up the bar which was next to the prosecutor's window, when I saw the prisoner go up to his window—he gave a <hi rend="italic">job</hi> with his elbow, and broke the window—I heard the glass fell—he then put his hand inside—I put the bar down and took him—I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him into the shop, and told the policeman to search him as he had the property in his hand—I saw the policeman take something from his hand, but I could not see what it was—some other things were scattered on the pavement, and I went out with Mr. Knapp to pick them up—I had seen the prisoner's hand inside—I saw his hand within the shop to just above the wrist, and I expected his wrist would have been cut by his snatching it out so quickly as he did.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Feathers public-house, Lambeth. The prisoner came into my service in July, through an advertisement—he was authorized to receive monies from my customers—his duty was to put them into the till—he had no authority to appropriate them to his own use—he came I think, on the 4th of July—I had seen something that created my suspicion, and my till did not answer my expectations—it was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week short—Mr. Bridge is a friend of mine—on the 27th of July, he took two shillings out of his pocket, and marked them, and I marked them after<lb></lb>wards—we made arrangements that he was to take some proceedings with regard to those two shillings—I saw him again, and learned that he had taken these steps with the two shillings—I examined the till, and found four sixpencees the first time, and one shilling after—there were neither of the two shillings that were marked—I had cleared the till of shillings be<lb></lb>fore he came—there was no shilling put into the till, till Mr. Bridge came because I sotto next to the prisoner—I asked the prisoner if he had re<lb></lb>ceiced one shilling of Mr. Bridge—he said yes, and he had put it into the till—I took him by the sleeve, and told h him to come into the back parlour, and sent for a constable to search him—he put his h and into his pocket, and pulled out twelve shillings—there were both the shillings among them which Mr. Bridge had marked—he said the money was all</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher and live at Lambeth. On the 27th of July I was applied to by Mr. Gurney—I marked these two shillings—I went to Mr. Gurney's bar between ten and eleven o'clock—the first time I called was for three-pennyworth of brandy for myself, and three-halfpenny<lb></lb>worth of gin—I tendered one of the shillings to the prisoner, and received sevenpence-halfpenny in change—he took that from the till, and put the shilling into his pocket—I afterwards went again—I was present when the money was produced—the prisoner said it was his own.</p>

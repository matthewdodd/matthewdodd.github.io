               <p>Q. Did you leave any body in the shop while you went out. - A. No; I returned down, and the young woman that I had at work with me; as we came to the bottom of the stairs to go into the shop, we heard a clutter of the glass of the window; I ran to the window, I looked and missed a piece of gingham; the window was cracked a few days before; I had put a large cabinet against it; the glass was drawed out, it laid about a yard distant from the place. I shut up the shop directly and went to the pawnbrokers and I found three pieces of the gingham. It was whole when I lost it; the piece contained twenty nine yards. I bought it on the 2nd of January; I lost it on the 4th, I meant to return it, as it was dirty before I had it; I knew the pattern and the quality. I am positive it is the same. I found one piece in half an hour after it was taken; between eight and nine o'clock I found the next; the third piece was not found till the next day.</p>

               <p>Somers's Defence. Last Monday night was a week, this young woman and I were going to get something for supper; we met four girls, they asked us to have something to drink, we scrupled at first, at last we did; they asked us to pledge some cotton for them, we did; she went into Mr. Lane's, I went in with her, I went to Mr. Dobree's and pledged a piece for six shillings. I brought the money to them, and they gave us a shilling a piece. The next day this young woman had occasion to go to the pawnbrokers, they took her in custody. I delivered myself up.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. What was the price of the whole piece. - A. I paid one shilling and ninepence a yard.</p>
               <p>COURT. - GENTLEMEN. - The two prisoners are indicted for a burglary, but with respect to the capital part of the charge, namely the burglary, it is an essential circumstance to constitute a burglary that the offence should be committed in the night. You find this offence, whoever it was committed by, was committed at half after four, or rather before that. At the time the robbery was committed the sun did not set till five minutes before four. It is not night, within the meaning of the law, till after twilight: as long as the light of the sun is remaining it is not night. It is a capital felony for any one to be found stealing in a dwelling house to the value of forty shillings; the value of the article stolen has not been valued at a great deal more than that; your enquiry is whether the case is brought home to either of the two prisoners, and whether you do not think it sufficient if you find them guilty at all, to find them guilty of stealing to the amount of thirty nine shillings only. That they are found in possession of part of the property is beyond a doubt and also of pledging it. One of them went to the pawnbrokers the next day, where she was apprehended, and the other prisoner coming to Bow-street, where she was apprehended, which is a circumstance for your consideration. It is for you to decide how far you think the prisoners were either or both of them innocent or guilty.</p>

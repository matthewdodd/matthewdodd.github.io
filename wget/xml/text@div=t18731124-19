                  </hi>. I live at 37, Wellington Road, Islington, and am in Mr. Moss's employ—the prisoner and I used to work together; he was the foreman—on Saturday, 25th October, we were in the bakehouse between 4 and 5 o'clock, he was tipsy, and on that account I was obliged to send for my master to do the work, he did it and then went out—I was sitting on the trough, the prisoner was near me—I got down and said to him," Take care of your work, or else you will have to pay if you spoil any more to night"—as soon as I had said that, he jumped up from the trough with the knife in his hand, and stabbed me on the shoulder—he stabbed me three times; on the shoulder, in the back, and a slight wound on the top of my head—I ran up stairs, and the doctor came and dressed my wounds.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been in the prisoner's company from 11 o'clock on the Friday night—we had a half-gallon of beer at dinner-time on Satur day, which we always had—I don't know anything about a second half gallon—I don't recollect the master coming down and asking why it was all drank and none left for him—I was out when the prisoner sent for the second half-gallon—when I returned I spoke to him in German—I did not use any strong language—I said "Had you not time the night before to get drunk?"—I did not catch hold of his legs or neck and pull him off the trough; I did not touch him—I know Peter the apprentice—I did not say to him next day that I did not know who was to blame; I never said that—Mr. Moss did not arrange with me that I was to have 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave my wife 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Saturday night; I don't know that that was the prisoner's wages—after he was given in charge the solicitor came to me to settle it; I said it could not be settled—I did not strike the apprentice on the Satur day afternoon before this happened; I did not say I would beat him too if he interfered—I do not know Frantz Obeist—I never said to him, or to anyone, that I did not know whose fault it was, and that I struck the pri soner first and seized him by the throat; it is all invention.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 6, Westbourne Road, Barnsbury—on Saturday, 25th October, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I was called to see the prosecutor—I found him in the parlour, lying on a couch—I found a small wound on the back of the left side, 3 inches long, and 2 1/2 inches deep; another on the top of the left shoulder, about 1 inch long, and about 2 inches deep; and a very slight wound on the head—this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would be likely to cause such wounds—they were not in themselves dangerous.</p>

It matters not to the policeman whether persons are convicted, so long as he gets them convicted. I should have escaped when I had the opportunity if I had been guilty. Colonel Henderson has the police to back him, and supplies them with funds to commit perjury. A man cannot come here and get justice. It is only proved that there was one piece, and that I did not utter with a guilty knowledge; and I have never been convicted of tender<lb></lb>ing counterfeit coin.</p>

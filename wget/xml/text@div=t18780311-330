                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Gask and Gask, silk mercers, Oxford Street—on 11th February the prisoner came to my department and selected some goods—she came again on the 12th and made a further selection—on the 13th she came again and made another selection—she gave her name and address as Mrs. Keech, 19, Albany Street, Regent's Park—on the last occasion she requested me to give her an invoice of the total purchases she had made and she would give a cheque on the London and Westminster Bank in payment—she said the goods were to be sent at seven that evening to 19, Albany Street—they were sent by Mr. Thomas, the chief clerk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk to Messrs. Gask and Gask—on 13th of February I received a communication from Mr. Groves, in conse<lb></lb>quence of which I took a parcel of goods to 19, Albany Street—I there saw the prisoner—I never saw her before—she had no credit at our place—she asked me to undo the parcels to compare the goods with the invoice she had, which I did—she said "It is all right, I will give you</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The cheque is drawn on the London and Westminster Banking Company and has no date—I did not notice that at the time or I would not have taken it—I expected it to be cashed—I saw her solicitor after she had gone away—I did not say that the only thing I wanted was the money or the goods back—I said I wanted information as to where she was.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I should not have paid such a cheque as this even if the drawer had an account with us—we should not refuse it because it is called a Banking Company, but because there is no date to it—we are agents for the Wilts and Dorset Bank, at Ilminster—we have received no cheque from there on the prisoner's account, or any advice.</p>

I traced the prisoner to several places and ultimately to Ilminster in Somerset on the morning of the 20th, I read the warrant, when she said she was very sorry, she hoped Mr. Gask would look over the matter and she would be able to pay him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I made inquiries at Ilminster—I found that the prisoner is a native of Somersetshire—she did sot say anything about the cheque.</p>

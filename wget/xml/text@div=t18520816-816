                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Ivy-lane. I have known the prisoner since he was eight years old—I was present, thirteen years ago last Christmas, when he was married, at Christ Church, Newgate-street, to Emma Welsh—I gave her away—I have known her living with him up to within a month or two of this time.</p>

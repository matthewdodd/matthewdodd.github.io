                  </hi>. At the time in question I resided with my husband, the prisoner, at 10, Gospel Oak-fields, Kentish-town—on Monday, 8th June, we were in our own room—we had angry words—the first blow he gave me was with his fist on the left eye, which caused a very black eye and knocked me down—he then struck me with a chopper on the head while I was lying down—it cut my bonnet, and hurt me very much—there were four wounds on my head, and one on my little finger—I bled very much—I had not struck him—my two children were present—I had had a little to drink, but knew perfectly well what I was about—I believe the prisoner was perfectly sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Southampton-terrace—the prisoner and his wife have been lodging with me—on 8th June, I heard them come in together, and heard loud talking between them in their room for about half an hour; I then heard a fall, and the eldest child came downstairs screaming—I went up into their room, and saw the prosecutrix sitting on the floor with her arms round the little child, six years old—there was a good deal of blood—the prisoner was sitting on a chair at the other side of the room; I saw the chopper on the floor near him—I directly went downstairs, and he followed me—I asked him what he had been doing—he said, "What am I to do when she comes home drunk?" and then went out—this is the chopper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prosecutrix came down to my room and was there when the doctor saw her—I could not see then whether she was intoxicated or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at University College Hospital—the prosecutrix was brought there in a cab on 8th June—she had four large scalp wounds, two on the left side of the head and two on the back, and a small wound on one of her fingers—she had lost a great deal of blood, and was still bleeding when she came to the hospital—the wounds were not, in themselves, dangerous, they were simple scalp wounds; but erysepelas after<lb></lb>wards set in, and at one time she was in danger, so much so, that I sent for a Magistrate to take her deposition—the wounds were caused by a sharp instru<lb></lb>ment of some sort—this chopper would inflict such wounds; the skull was fissured in one place—I should say there had been considerable violence used—the wounds were very long, one of them especially—they were not likely to have been inflicted by the back of the chopper, more likely by the edge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> She was three weeks drunk successively every day and I could do nothing with her: in fact, she was always drunk, morning,</p>

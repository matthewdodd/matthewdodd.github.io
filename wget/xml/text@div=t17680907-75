               <p>Q. How did you first become acquainted?</p>
               <p>Child. I ran away from my master, a hatter in Water-lane, and strolled about, and got into Field-lane, and from thence to Chick-lane; there I got acquainted with the prisoner, and some more; I used to see them go out, and at last they asked me to go out with them, so I went out; we used to go out on nights a shop lifting; we went to the prosecutor's house on Christmas evening, Bagnell and Thorp were with me; the prisoner was apprentice in Field lane, he ran away from his master; we were walking by Mr. Harrison's, we saw Mrs. Harrison go down stairs to serve some coals; Thorp said, he believed no body was there, upon which Bagnell went into the house, the door was partly open; he brought out a paper snuff box, and gave it to Thorp; Thorp gave it to me, said Thorp, is this all you could get; he answered, no; there were a pair of blankets and a bed-quilt; Thorp said, go in and fetch them; he went in, and Thorp with him; Bagnell went to lay hold of the blanket and quilt; Thorp said, look over there, and pointed to the beauset; then Bagnell took out a quart silver mug, and the rest of the things were in it; I stood at the door, and saw them go cross the room; when they came out, they both told me what they had got; Thorp ran one way, and Bagnell the other; I went after Bagnell, and overtook him on Ludgate-hill; I said, what was the matter you ran so; said he, O! we are made for ever, we have got a quart silver mug, and some spoons in it; we found Thorp at Fleet-ditch, he had the mug and the spoons; we put them into a bag, and carried them into Black-boy -alley; we all lodged there in one house, and some others besides, all of the same business.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of you?</p>
               <p>Child. There were five of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever given information against the rest?</p>
               <p>Child. No, I never went out with them; Bagnell, I, and Thorp generally went out together; Bagnell got a young woman, a whore, in Black-boy-alley, to carry the things in her lap, to one Lyons, a Jew, in Duke's place, she did not belong to us; we all three went with her; Bagnell went up stairs, Thorp, I, and the young woman staid below; Bagnell brought down five guineas, we divided the money among us three, the young woman had none of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Bagnell to be taken up?</p>
               <p>Child. I was taken up for stealing a shift, and carried before Major

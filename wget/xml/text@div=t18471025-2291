                  </hi> I keep the Crooked Billet in Ratcliff-highway. On the 1st of Oct., about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner—he asked me for threepenny-worth of brandy, I served him in a teacup—he gave me a five-shilling piece—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and put the five-shilling piece in a little private till, apart from all other money—he then had half a pint of beer, and paid me with one of my own pence—he went away, and directly he was gone I looked at the crown, and found it was bad—I went to the door, but the prisoner was out of sight—a policeman went past, and I gave him the crown—he marked it, and gave it me again—I kept it—on the 15th of Oct., about half-past six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came again—he called for half a pint of beer—I served him—he gave me a bad shil<lb></lb>ling—I put it in my mouth, and went round to the fore door—the prisoner said, "Master, don't you like it?"—I said no, it was a bad one; closed the door, and sent for an officer—the prisoner pulled off his handkerchief, and wanted to leave it for the beer, I would not take it—I did not mention about the crown till I got to the station—I knew he was the man that passed the crown when he first came in at the door—the officer came, in about ten minutes, and the prisoner was taken into custody—I went to the station, took the crown and the shilling with me, and gave them to the officer—I said to the prisoner, "I recollect you about three weeks ago"—he said, "You are a liar."</p>

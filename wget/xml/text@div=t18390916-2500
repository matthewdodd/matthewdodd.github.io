                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. Richard Masters, a draper, at Hammersmith. About four o'clock in the afternoon of the 31st of August, the prisoner came for a pair of stockings—I showed her seven pairs in a packet, at 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and another which had thirteen pain, at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one of which she selected, and put outside—she then wanted some print, which was at the other end of the shop—I went for it, and she followed after me—she bought some of the print—while I was doing up the print she went for the stockings, and brought them, she held them up, and asked if they were the stockings—I said they were—I put them and the print up in a piece of paper—she paid, and went away—after she was gone I looked at the packet that had had thirteen pairs in it, and there were only eleven.</p>

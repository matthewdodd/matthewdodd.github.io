            , a Chairman. I was standing at the St. Alban's Tavern in St. James's Market, when Richard Carr came to me and said, a young Man had got a Spoon to sell in haste. I went with him to a Goldsmith's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173412040035"></xptr> Door, but the Goldsmith was gone to Bed. Then we went to a Pawn-broker, who weigh'd it, and said it came to 10 s. We went out again. I had 7 s. in my Pocket, and borrowed three more, and bought the Spoon my self; for Richard Carr being very/ well drest, I had no Mistrust that the Spoon was stole.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Andrew's Holborn. On the 29th of September, I was officer of the night - Simons brought the prisoner and another into the watch-house; the prisoner was accused of having stolen the handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket - the prisoner said it was his, and he had bought it in Field-lane; I asked if there wereany marks on it - he said No; but there is R. H. E. on it: I took them both to the Compter, but the bill was thrown out against the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told him if he had seen me, why did he not take me into the Blue Posts - When I came before the constable I told him there were three marks on it, but I did not know what they were, as I cannot read or write.</p>

               <p>JAMES DENNING. I was a shipmate of the prisoner's, and lodged at Pearson's. I had a jacket the beginning of December, which I put into my chest in the store-room at Pearson's, on a Sunday night, in the presence of the prisoner, who lodged there; I locked the chest, put the key into my pocket, and went down to tea, leaving the prisoner in the store-room, in the dark - I went to my chest after tea, found it broken open, and my jacket and trousers were gone; I found the trousers in another man's chest the next morning - the prisoner was gone: I afterwards saw him in custody, and, of his own accord, he said he had broken open my chest, taken the jacket, and pawned it for 2s., with two shirts and a pair of trousers of his own.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 28th of December I was applied to by Denning, and went to Pearson's house, High-street, Shadwell; the prisoner was given into my custody - I took him into the store-room, to search him; he began crying, and begged to be forgiven: I told him to be very cautions of what he said to me, as it did not lay in my power to forgive him - he said he knew he had done wrong, he had robbed his shipmates, and he ought to suffer, but he hoped we would be merciful to him, and if I would go with him he would show me where he had pawned the things - he acknowledged he had broken the chests open; I showed him this piece of iron - he said it was broken off by him; we went to a pawnbroker's opposite Shadwell church - they said the articles had been pawned there, but taken out again; the prisoner heard this - he said he had either sold or lost the duplicate.</p>

             re-examined. Q.You did not actually see either of the prisoners go into the warehouse? A.No; I saw Phillips at the door - three of these shillings are what I marked and put into the till in the counting-house, which adjoins the warehouse; we do not close the door always - I was in the granary, taking in some corn when I saw Phillips, and watched him; Lightfoot and Best were opposite, and could have got in without my seeing them.</p>

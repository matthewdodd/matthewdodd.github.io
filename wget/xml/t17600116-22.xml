            . On the 17th of December, I was at <placeName id="t17600116-22-crimeloc118">Guildhall</placeName>

I laid hold of the handkerchief, she had hold of one end, and I the other; then she went to go down the back way, to Basinghall-street; she let go the handkerchief and ran, and a person that is here ran after her and catched her.</p>
               <p>Jencup Janaway. I was at Guildhall at the close of the lottery, being concerned in two or three tickets, and the prosecutor was standing by me; suddenly he turned about and catched hold of one end of a handkerchief, and the prisoner at the bar had hold of the other; the prisoner got down the steps going into Basinghall-street, and was pulling the handkerchief at the bottom of the steps, and he above. I said to him, why do not you lay hold of her? then she flung off her cloak, and ran away. I and others pursued and took her, and I took particular notice of the handkerchief, putting a mark upon it with ink before the alderman ( the handkerchief produced, and he looks at it.) This is the same, here is my mark.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is this your handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is the same that I saw in the prisoner's hand, and it is my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>The gentleman's handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket, but I never handled or touched it; I did not know what they were going to do with me, and so I went to run away; what they say is false, for I never saw it more than I see it now. I have no friend but my mother, a very old woman, who sells fish, and has done so these forty years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am going on for eleven years of age. On 7th Sept. I was going home with a bundle, which had three dresses and other articles in it—I was at the corner of Judd Street, and this man and two others came up to me—one put a handkerchief to my mouth, and the prisoner took my bundle—I am sure he is the person—he ran, and I ran after him—I lost sight of him—about half an hour afterwards I saw him at the station, with other persons—I looked about, and fixed on the prisoner—I am sure he is the person.</p>

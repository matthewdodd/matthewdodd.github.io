            . I am a pensioner's wife. On the 26th of December, I went to the prosecutor's for some beer- I saw the prisoner standing on a ladder, and taking down a goose; he put it into his apron, wrapped it up, and put it into his basket; I was close by the foot of the ladder when he had the goose in his hand; I said to him that if I was in my own country, I could buy one like that for 1s. 2d.; I did not tell the landlord then - I did not know that he was stealing it; I told the landlord and landlady the next day - I was not at home the day they went to Queen-square; my husband told me at night the goose was stolen- he had a pint of beer, and they told him.</p>

            . I am carman to Mr. Montford. I have known the prisoner eight years - he has been an honest industrious man: Collett came to me one day, and said she was going to appear against Leggett: it was much against her will, but she was obliged to go - I had been with Leggett, drinking in Mr. Roberts' house, for three hours that day, and on my oath he came out with nothing but his apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What day of the month was this? A. The 26th of December; we were there from between two and three o'clock till near five: I assisted him to do the bell - we had two or three pints of beer, and went to the bar to get something to drink; I was taken to Queen-square, and was accused of having taken a pail - I said they must prove it; we came out together, and I can swear he had nothing - I took the ladder there; I cannot swear I did not see the goose: I saw a leg of mutton there; the waiter made some observations about the mutton - my foot was then at the bottom of the ladder - there was no goose near that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who came out with Leggett? A. Burgess, Darby, and I; I did not see the ladder in different places.</p>

            . I am a cooper. I was in the house, and went out with the prisoner - he could not have had a goose without my seeing it; he had his apron on as he has it now, and had no goose in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he any other apron on? No, I had had part of two pints of ale, and had been in the room up stairs; I did not see the ladder - I only came down after he had done his work: he came into the room, and we came out together; there were three of us, but no one had a bundle that I saw; I had been about an hour with him; he came into the room, and said he would be a pint with us.</p>

On the 22nd of April last, the prisoner came into the shop for a pound of candles. I served her. She paid for them one shilling and a halfpenny. I sounded the shilling, and Mr. Johnson came in and took it from me. He marked it, and gave it me again. I marked it, and after I had marked it he took it. The prisoner was in the shop at the time. He took the prisoner in custody, and searched her. I saw her searched; there were some shillings in her hand, about eight or nine, doubled up in paper, and there were a small parcel in a cloth or handkerchief, and in it there might be five or six shillings in halfpence.</p>

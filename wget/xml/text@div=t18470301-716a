                  <hi rend="largeCaps">ELIZABETH SMITH</hi>. I am cook to Mr. Salter. I missed from my purse a shilling, which had been previously marked by Mr. Salter—he marked a shilling, a half-crown, and two sixpences—the shilling was in my purse in a drawer in a room adjoining the kitchen—I went up stairs to make the beds on the 17th Feb.—I was away about an hour—when I came down the shilling was taken out of the purse—this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>).</p>

I went with Mr. Salter, and found the prisoner in the boot-house, cleaning Mr. Salter's boots, about eleven o'clock on the 17th Feb.—I was in plain clothes—I told the prisoner I was a police-constable, and he was given into custody on a charge of stealing 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—he said he hoped Mr. Salter did not suspect him—I commenced searching him, and then he took a shilling and sixpence out of his pocket, and gave it me—I found on him a bunch of small keys—I took him into custody—this is the shilling and sixpence.</p>

I marked this sixpence with black ink, here is the mark—and this shilling is marked—these are a bunch of my keys—two of them belong to my desks—the prisoner had before impudently stated that if anybody charged him with thieving, his father was a lawyer, or a lawyer's clerk, and he would make them pay for it—I took him out of charity as his mother is very much distressed—a lot of table-knives were taken out of the paper, and the paper rolled up again as if they had not been touched.</p>

            , my brother. The goods that are charged to be stolen I was in possession of them, and I had the charge of them. The prisoner lived in my service about fifteen months. From information I went to the prisoner's brother's lodgings, Long-alley, Moorfields. I only saw at that time five china figures, a hanging book shelf, and two prints, all of which I knew to be my property. I went to Dalston and took an officer with me, and took the prisoner into custody; the officer told him that he had taken him in custody for robbing his master, and that his brother was in custody, and that we had found the articles, in the indictment, upon which he made a full confession of taking the whole; he recapitulated all the articles, and mentioned the different times he had taken them. A chest of drawers he had taken about a twelvemonth ago. I found the chest of drawers at his brother's lodgings, they are my property.</p>

            , of King's-street, Snowhill, one of the petitioning creditors under the Commission against the prisoner. I know of transactions between him and the prisoner. (Looking at two bills of exchange for 78 l. and 40 l.) These are drawn by my uncle upon the prisoner, whom I saw accept them. I gave him his account, and he gave the bills in consideration for that account. I know that my uncle furnished him with goods to the amount specified in those bills before they were accepted. I tendered his account to him, and wished for cash, which he could not give, and I 
               <persName id="t18240916-232-person1920">drew</persName>
             these bills, which he accepted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who was the money due to? - A. My uncle, and his late partner, Mr. Ricardo. The debt was contracted during their partnership. They dissolved partnership after Christmas, 1823. I came into my uncle's service in March, 1819; I was articled to him only. I know that Mr. Ricardo was a partner; he lived in Weston-street, Pentonville. I manage the concern, and have seen their partnership agreement, though not read it. Mr. Ricardo acted as a partner, and was generally there every day for two or three hours. The partnership ceased in the beginning of 1824; I think about February or March; it was advertised in the Gozette. The goods for which the bills were given were sent to Hastings. I saw the prisoner look out about 78 l. worth, the rest were ordered of our traveller.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How soon after you went into your uncle's service did you see Mr. Ricardo? - A. He became a partner about the beginning of 1823. He generally posted the books, as he knew nothing of the business, which takes some time to learn; - it is manufacturing portable desks, &amp;c. We always sign bills, Smith and Co., which means Mr. Ricardo.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did he act as partner? - A. He did; he had the management of the business. He ceased to attend about the beginning of March I think.</p>
               <p>Mr. CONSTANTINE. I am solicitor to Mr. Smith. The partnership ceased the beginning of the year by a notice in writing signed by them both. I know that before that they agreed to dissolve. Mr. Ricardo assisted in winding up the books. They instructed me to prepare an advertisement for the Gazette, which I did. They signed a paper empowering me to do so. This was before the issuing of the Commission.</p>

               <p>MR. RUNDER. I am an acting assignee under the Commission, and was present on the 15th of June, when the prisoner's last examination took place. I had two books in my possession - I do not know how they were marked. They were the same books as the bankrupt produced. I looked over them, to see if there were any small debts which could be recovered. They were produced to me four or five days before the, last meeting, and left at my house. I took them to the meeting, and gave them to my co-assignee, or Mr. Lewis's, the accountant. I did not look over them carefully - I do not know what has become of them.</p>

            . I am an accountant, and was employed by the assignees to make up these books - the bankrupt attended me for that purpose; the accounts were made under his direction, from bills handed to me by the assignees. The books were not produced to me. I saw him produce a book marked A, at the last meeting. The last time I saw it was in Mr. Runder's possession - the bankrupt was asked for them at the examination on the 15th of June, and said Mr. Runder had them. Mr. Runder came without them, but went home and brought, I think, only one - it was handed in with the accounts. I sat within half a yard of the bankrupt - I do not know what became of the books.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, Upper Eaton-street, Pimlico. Glasspoole is my cousin, and lived in Three Tunn-court, Borough, in April last, with her mother. On the 4th of April, at ten o'clock at night, she came to my father's in a coach, and brought two small boxes, covered with carpet. They were put into a cupboard under the china press, in our front kitchen - she went away; the carpet was sewed round them with pack-thread - one was moved into a closet under the stairs, and the other into a closet in the area. Three of the creditors and a messenger came on the 10th of August and fetched them away. I saw the prisoner three doors from my father's house, in the street, on the 10th of August, when he was taken. Glasspoole was at my father's house that morning, and Evani knocked at the door, which I answered; he asked for Miss Glasspoole - I said if he would walk a few paces from the door I would send her to him, but I said nothing to her - she went out. I did not observe where she went to - she returned in about five minutes. I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160087"></xptr>not see Evani again - she staid about half an hour, and then left.</p>

             the 13th, about half-past nine o'clock, I went to the Coach and Horses public-house, Dover-street, Piccadilly; and about half-past ten o'clock the prisoner came in - the officers were in waiting - he said to me,</p>
               <p>"Sir, the boxes and property do belong to me."</p>
               <p>Q. What boxes did he mean - A. I cannot say that he meant these boxes; they were then in possession of the creditors; I had never seen them in my father's house myself; he said the boxes belonged to him, and if I would give them up he would give me every satisfaction that they belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you said to him to produce this conversation - A. The boxes had been the cause of much conversation between Glasspool and me. I did not mention her name to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us how the conversation began - A. He addressed me nearly in those words: it was merely a plan for his apprehension; I therefore seemed to agree with his proposal; he inclined his head on the table, and said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, my head is under your arm;" the officer with a creditor then came in and took him.</p>

On the 12th of August, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, when my cousin Glasspole was leaving our house, I saw the prisoner on the opposite side of the way; she had come about half-past eleven o'clock; and when she went out, he was standing opposite the door; she went down by the public-house to go down Arabella-row; he walked very slowly after her while I had the door open, but I pulled it open again, and saw him walking very fast after her, and crossing over: on the following morning, about seven o'clock, Glasspoole came again, and I saw the prisoner walking about for a considerable time, and about eight o'clock he knocked at the door: I was at the foot of the stairs, and heard him ask for Miss Glasspoole, my sister, who opened the door, told him if he would walk a few paces Miss Glasspoole would come to him; we went down and told her; she went to the door, and said,</p>
               <p>"Where is the man?" my sister pointed to him, and she went out immediately: I saw the boxes on the night of the 4th of April, but was out when they were brought; I saw them next day in the china press, covered with carpet, and sewn with pack-thread; I saw Searle take the same away: I had moved them from the china press.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you ever see the boxes - A. They were covered with carpet, but I saw through the pack-thread; one was a black wooden box, and the other a hair trunk.</p>

Here is a watch worth full thirty guineas, in this box, which he sold to the prisoner in January - I saw it delivered to him; here is another, worth ten guineas, which was sold to him at the same time - here is another, worth six guineas, and a gold one worth ten guineas. He bought eight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Do you mean to say your master has no others made in the same way - A. One I know is of a description which he never sold to any one else; it is a very handsome chased dial and case - they all go through my hands; there are many marks about it, and the number, by which I can swear to it, No. 37,240; I swear that watch was sold to him. I do not mean to say I recollect it by the number alone, but by the appearance and number also. I have valued them at the wholesale price. I should take off 15 per cent. for profit.</p>

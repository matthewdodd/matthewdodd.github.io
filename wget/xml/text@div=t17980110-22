               <p>Court. (To Townsend.) Q. Did you keep any thing of a public-house? - A. Yes; I keep a lodging-house.</p>
               <p>Q.(To M'Gregor.) What is the prosecutrix - does she keep a lodging-house for men or women? - A. I believe, both.</p>
               <p>Q. In Covent-Garden? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. She keeps the Key bagnio, a most infamous house; the spoon was up stairs with a sea-faring captain and two women, and I put it in my pocket to take care of it; she takes in women and children all day long; her women steal her property, and then she lays it on innocent servants.</p>

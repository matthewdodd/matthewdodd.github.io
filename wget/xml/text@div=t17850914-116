               <p>I called at Mr. Blackburn's with an order on the 24th of June, the prisoner at the bar came in while I was there, he said he wanted to look at some low priced mens silk stockings; Mr. Blackburn reached them down, he said he wanted two or three dozen, Mr. Blackburn said he had them at the trimmers, and should have them in the course of an hour or two, accordingly the prisoner left an order directed to No. 1, in Bow-lane; I let Mr. Blackburn have some of the stockings that the prisoner had, I sold him a dozen of mens white silk stockings, and six pair of womens; and the six pair of mens he parcelled out, and I saw Mr. Blackburn go out of the shop with some stockings; I took the prisoner in Saint George's Fields the day the balloon went up, about eleven weeks ago, I think it was the Wednesday or Thursday; after he had been in the shop, there was another gentleman with him, he came back with me, and I asked him what he had done with the stockings, and he told me he had pawned six pair, six pair he had at his lodgings, and a dozen and half he had left with Captain Richardson, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140154"></xptr> brought him to Mr. Blackburn's shop, and when the constable took charge of him, he would not give any direction to this Captain Richardson; in examining his pockets the constable found in my presence a duplicate for six pair of stockings, and he had two or three bills upon him on some of the first houses in town that were past due.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not you in Mr. Blackburn's shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You heard when I agreed with Mr. Blackburn for the prices? - There was no agreement at all, you said you was not particular to prices; you left an order for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Blackburn. What time was it when you brought them stockings home to my lodgings? - Five o'clock, but I understood they were for the Captain.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you sell the stockings to him in the shop? - No.</p>

Now, my Lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I leave it to you, whether this is stealing or no.</p>

               <p>Did you lose any iron wire on the 23d of March? - I did; the prisoner was a servant of mine, I believe about twelve months, during those twelve months these things were missing; on the 23d day of March I took from the prisoner sundry bobbins of silk and covered wire; they were in a drawer, which was the prisoner's drawer, in a chest of drawers that belong to him in the house; he was not present; I do not positively remember what he said, I had him committed.</p>

               <p>I am a weaver, my wife winds for Mr. Heighway; we mark the bobbins, and there is one here that is my marking to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Heighway. In the course of the business he works with the articles to cover the wire, with the different materials.</p>
               <p>To Lemon. Which is the bobbin you marked? - It is here.</p>
               <p>What is the mark on it? - 40.</p>
               <p>Do you know your hand-writing to that? - I cannot swear positively; to the best of my knowledge that is it.</p>
               <p>How do you know that that which is marked 40 was carried back to the prosecutor's house? - I am certain, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Heighway. Can you say with certainty, that that bobbin was ever in your house? - As far as a tradesman can say, it was; in the course of my business there are many marked 40.</p>
               <p>Can you swear for a certainty that bobbin was ever in your house? - That cannot be.</p>
               <p>Do you think it was possible this woman to be deficient a bobbin, and you not to have known it? - No.</p>

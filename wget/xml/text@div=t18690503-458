I am a tailor, and live in Little Britain—I knew the prisoner, he is a tailor, and lives in Edward's Place—on the night of 17th April, I was in Alderagate Street—we had been out together that day, drinking—I was sober, none of us were the worse for drink—the prisoner accused me of sending him a valentine—I said I had not sent it—he called me a liar—I said, "You are another"—he then rushed on me, and caught me round the neck, and bit my lip off, or partly so—I went to the hospital and had it dressed—I did not strike him before he rushed at me.</p>

I am a hawker, and live in Edward's Place—the prose<lb></lb>cutor and prisoner are strangers to me—on this night I saw them together at the corner of Edward's Place—I heard something said about dirty blinds and sending valentines—the prisoner accused Hanley of sending him a valentine—he said he did not—he called him a liar, and he called him one back—with that the prisoner rushed at him, caught him round the neck, and bit his lip—a constable came up and pulled him away—Hanley said he had bit his lip—the officer said "Serve you right," and shoved him away—I went to the hospital with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean the officer said it served him right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he said that to the prosecutor—I stated that to the' Magistrate—this was near 8 o'clock at night—I was standing at the corner, not two yards from them; they were close together, talking—the prisoner caught Hanley round the neck, and he struggled to get away—the policeman pulled them away.</p>

On this Sunday night, I heard a disturbance in Edward's Place—I heard Hanley call the prisoner a b——liar—he said, "If you call me that again"—I could not hear what else passed between them—I saw them closing together, and in the struggle Hanley's hat fell off—I went and took hold of Hanley—he had got Burke round the neck with his arms, and I had to force him on to the pavement</p>

               <p>before I could make him release his hold—I told him he had better go away, and Hanley likewise—there was nothing said about taking the prisoner in charge at the time, and not a word about his lip being bit—I saw the lip bleeding—it was trifling at the time—he went away somewhere—I don't know where—I did not see Collins there.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's hospital—Hanley was brought there by Collins, about 9 o'clock—I examined him—I found a small piece cut completely out of his lip, he had lost a good deal of blood, but was not bleeding at that time—he will always have the mark, it will never completely recover—there were the marks of teeth on the lip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he appear as if he had been drinking very much? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had been drinking, certainly—a blow with a ring would not have caused the injury, a piece was cut completely out, and there were the marks of teeth—the front of his dress was stained with blood.</p>

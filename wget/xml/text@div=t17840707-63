               <p>Between one and two in the morning, I cameupon deck on board the ship Stanislaus, to see if there was a good watch, and I spoke to the watch then on the gangway, and desired him to keep a good look out on the craft; I went to my cabin, pulled off my shoes, and went to bed, I laid down for the space of six or seven minutes, when I heard a man very distinctly ask where is Mr. Barrett, the mate, I came out of my cabin, and saw the prisoner dressed in a blue jacket on the quarter deck, I asked him who wanted the mate, he asked me if my name was Barrett, and if I was the mate, I told him yes, he said unless we kept a better look out our craft would be robbed along side, that was the prisoner, he was standing between me and the craft, I thanked him and said I was much obliged to him, but asked him how they could rob the craft, when there was a watchman standing in the gangway; during these words the watchman cried out, Mr. Barrett, the man that brought that man on board is robbing the craft of the fruit; I immediately left the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070092"></xptr> prisoner on the quarter deck, I jumped down the gangway, and saw a man on the gunnel of the craft, handing a chest of lemons into the boat that was along side of the barge; immediately I got down into the craft, and cried out in a menacing manner to them to come back, or I would shoot one of them, but I had no fire arms; they shoved off the boat, and the two men jumped into the boat, and she might have been about ten feet from the craft when I got on the gunnel, they said to one another pull away, and they rowed a few strokes, during this time the prisoner came to the gangway, and the watchman was there, and he cried out in a loud manner, George, put back and take me in; they made him some reply, but I was so confused I could not understand what it was; they then backed one of their oars or scullers, and they pulled back with all their might; I came on the gangway and met the Captain with the prisoner, I asked him if that was not the boat that brought him off, he said yes, did not you see the fruit in that boat, said I, he did he said, I asked who this George was that he called, he said he called no George, he called Jem; I asked him who Jem was, and he said he did not know; I asked him if he knew me or had any business with me, he said he had no business with me, neither did he know me; he was then in custody with the Captain, and I had no more business with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. When you had got up and directed the man to keep a good watch, you had not observed any mischief going forward? - No.</p>
               <p>The first you heard was from the prisoner that came on board your ship? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It seems to have been very easy, if it had been his design, for him to have gone off without giving your notice? - No, Sir, the watch was on board.</p>
               <p>The watch had not given you any alarm? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear him tell this story, That he was going on board another ship, for some purpose of smuggling, and that these watermen had forced him to this ship, and that he suspected them, and came to give you the alarm? - No, Sir, he said he came on board to know what them boats were rowing about for; and that his intention was to go on board some ship to deal, but he came voluntarily along side us, against the the watch's will.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear him say that he was forced on board your ship? - I do not recollect any such thing,</p>
               <p>The mischief was done after he had given you the alarm? - No, Sir, I saw one chest after, but there were chests in it before.</p>
               <p>He gave you timely notice to prevent it? - I cannot say he did, he gave me notice before all was in.</p>
               <p>You had timely notice to prevent that chest being lowered down into the boat? - I had not, I used my diligence and could not stop it; I never saw the other two afterwards, nor our fruit, I immediately missed three chests, I saw one shoving into the boat the moment he spoke to me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was the watchman on board that ship, it was past one o'clock in the night, a wherry came along side the craft, and I hailed the wherry and told them to put off and not come in the night time, they told me they wanted to come on board; I hailed them a second time not to come on board in the night, he told me it was nothing at all to me what he wanted, he wanted to come on board and speak to the mate.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he name his name? - He said I want to speak to Mr. Barrett, the mate, I told him he was asleep, he was not on deck, he told me you must show him me, I want to speak to Mr. Barrett, the mate.</p>
               <p>Was this before he came on board or after? - When he was getting up the ship's gangway; then he came upon deck, and I went along the gangway and shewed the prisoner the mate; when I was going to shew him the mate, the prisoner walked to the gangway, and he spoke to Mr. Barrett on board, and I saw the same wherry take the lemons; this was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070093"></xptr> time that I shewed him the mate that they took the lemons; so I said to Mr. Barrett, there is the same wherry that brought Mr. Parry on board is taking the lemons out of the lighter, upon which I and Mr. Barrett jumped down from the ship's gangway into the lighter, and the wherry pushed off with one sculler; I saw three chests; when Mr. Parry saw that the boat pushed off, he called out George, come back and take me in.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of the lemons? - Four pounds the three chests.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Smith. Have you examined these chests of lemons accurately? - No, Sir, they were with the rest.</p>
               <p>Does not the length of a voyage often make a very material difference in the value of the fruit? - Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Were they not common fruit? - They were not picked chests, they were common fruit, but many of them were green; I saw them packed in Lisbon, and they had been a very short time on board, they are valued by the fruit merchants at that value.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know of your own kno wledge? - Only as I have been informed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Oldnup. Did you know Mr. Parry? - No, that was the first time I saw him.</p>
               <p>How did you know his name was Parry? - I said there is a man, I heard his name.</p>
               <p>It was your duty to keep a good watch? - To be sure, I do, I told him not to come on board, he said I want to come and speak with the mate, Mr. Barrett: the fruit was in the craft, he said I must shew him the man.</p>
               <p>You never saw him before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Was he never on board any ship that you watched smuggling? - Never.</p>
               <p>You are frequently watchman? - No.</p>
               <p>You never saw smugglers come on board in the night time, I dare say? - Never.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my case to my Council.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Smith. Did not the prisoner tell you he came to smuggle? - After the alarm was made, I came on the quarter deck, I there saw the prisoner standing on the quarter deck, I called to the watchman and asked what noise that was, he informed me the prisoner had come out of the boat alongside, and the people were taking away the fruit out of the craft, I told him not to let him go till I came out and conversed with him, I put on my slippers, and went on the quarter deck in my shirt, and called for a a pair of pistols, but none were brought me; I called for my great coat, which was immediately brought me by one of the boys, I then addressed myself to the prisoner, and asked him his business on board the ship at that hour of the morning, he informed me that he knew his business if I did not; I insisted on knowing, and he informed me that he came to see if he could deal, and not to thieve; then the fruit was taken away, and I insisted on taking the prisoner; he made no resistance, and told me his name, which he said he was not ashamed of; he said he did not rob the craft or design to rob it; I told him if he did not his confederates did, and it was his artfulness to keep the mate in dispute. I sent for a mate of another ship that he applied to, and he came on board, but he could say nothing in his favour, any farther than he had sold him some things, and he paid for them; I told him I should detain him, and would bring him to justice, he threatened me with making me pay five pounds per hour for detention and false imprisonment: he mentioned one Mr. Wallis that would be bondsman for him for his appearance on Monday morning, I sent for him, and he would not be bound for him, nor knew any thing of him, any farther than his name was Parry, so I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The way that I came to go on board this ship was this, a man that deals in smuggled goods came to me that night, we went into the Two Brewers, he asked me to go on board the Nonsuch, I could not get my own boat off, I went to Limehouse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070094"></xptr> look for a boat and I saw two boats, one was a pair of oars, and the other was a pair of scullers rowing another man, I called scullers, they came on shore directly, I said I wanted to go outside that tier of ships, the tier Captain Smith's ship lay; they kept shoving astern, and when they put off along side the lighter, now, says they, damn your eyes, if you do not jump out we will heave you over-board; I went directly and called for the mate, and told him, and I sent for the mate of this ship, who came on board, and said he had no doubt but as I had bought goods of him, that I was come to buy goods that night of Captain Smith.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury. We do not think we need give your Lordship any farther trouble on this matter.</p>
               <p>Court. Well, Gentlemen, it is for you to exercise your judgment upon this case; to be sure the whole thing depends upon this, with what view he came on board this ship, if he came to put the men on their guard, he did a commendable thing, but if he only came to amuse the men while the things were taken out of the ship, he was an accessary to the theft; now, to be sure, it does not appear that he had any particular business on board that ship, nor was it very likely that at that time of night he should come from on shore on purpose to give this information on board this ship.</p>

                  </hi> I am a labourer, and live in Star-street. On Wednesday morning last, about one o'clock, I was going home with another man, and the prisoner was lying across the pavement—we passed by him—he jumped up, and got hold of a stone, and threw at us, saying, "D—n your eyes, what did you do that for?"—I had done nothing to him—I cannot tell whether my mate touched him as we went passed, but I did not see him do so—I said, "Come on, or else we shall get into a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>"—we both ran down the street, and the prisoner and his wife ran after us—she had nothing on her, she was naked, except her shift, and they were pelting us with stones—we ran right out of the street, across the road, to the Bedford Arms—it was shut up—they would not serve us with anything—I lodge in the same street—we went then to my own door, and stood there—the prisoner and his wife had then gone back—I could not see anybody in the street—I was standing talking is my mate opposite my own door, when the prisoner came up with a bit of bamboo in his hand—he came right up the street, with no shoes and no hat on—h struck at me with the stick—it struck against the wall, and spilt it—I stopped down and got hold of one piece, and he the other—he fought me with his piece, and I fought him with mine—I hit him over the eye, and cut him—he then threw down his stick, and came to wrestle with me—in the wrestle, I heard a knife—it was a shut-up knife, and it went off with a <hi rend="italic">click</hi>, and then I received a wound in my breast—I said, "I said, "I am stabbed," and he followed me up, and stabbed at me in the head—I put up my hand to save my head, and I caught it right in my hand—I stood on one side against the wall for a second or two, and then fell down—when I got away from the prisoner, he turned round to my comrade, and by that time the policeman came up—I was taken to the station-house with the prisoner—Mr. Ross examined me and I was conveyed home—I had been drinking a little—I was neither sober or drunk, something between the two.</p>

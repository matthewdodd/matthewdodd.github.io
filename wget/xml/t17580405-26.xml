            , Esq; there was the prisoner; I told him I was robbed; he said he believed my helper that was, had got my money. I went to justice Fielding, and got a warrant, and went to the house where the prisoner lives; he was not to be found, but there I found a bundle of linen of his. I advertised him, and last Sunday I found him in the Strand, with one of my shirts on his back, and a pair of my stockings on. I took him before Mr. Fielding, he ordered him to the Round-house, and the next morning there again, and from thence to Newgate; there were three pair of my stockings in the bundle which I found; they were at a watchman's in the Meuse.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the things mentioned in the indictment, when you went out of town?</p>
               <p>Smith. They were all with the money in the box?</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched when taken up?</p>
               <p>Smith. He was; and we found five guineas in his pocket, and a purse, which I believe to be mine; he owned he had bought the watch with the five guinea piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he own he took the things and money out of the box?</p>
               <p>Smith. He owned he stood at the stable-door, while another man brought the money out, and that they shared it. He ow ned it was my money and my linen, but would not own to the taking that, but said he bought it in Monmouth-street, and that he knew it to be mine when he bought it.</p>

            . The prisoner lived fellow-servant with the prosecutor and I almost two years. When he was taken, the coachman came and told me; I went with him to the justice's house; there he was searched, and there was found upon him five guineas, fourteen shillings and sixpence in silver, and eight pence in halfpence, a silver watch, four handkerchiefs, a case of steams, a knife, a pair of nut-crackers, a snuff-box, and a pocket-piece. (Produced in court.) I asked him how he came by that watch, he said he bought it, and changed the great piece of money to pay for it; but what change he had out of it he could not tell; I asked him where he bought it, he said in a great street beyond, St. Paul's church-yard we went and found it to be Cheapside.</p>

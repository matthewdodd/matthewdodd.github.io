             sworn. - I am ostler to Mr. Woolcock, he is the builder of this house, and lives in St. John's-street-road; my mistress desired some of us lads to come out, and see if there was any body on the building; I saw a man at the top part of the building; he seemed to be stamping the lead together, and when he came on the ladder he seemed to have a bundle under his right arm; I heard the watchman crying the hour of half after nine o'clock; we went to the corner of Percival-street to call the watchman, and coming back again I saw that man make a dart, and he went right backwards; he sprung into a passage when I and the watchman were coming up; in making up to him, he run across the road on to the footpath, and run under the railing; I ran after him, and just at the corner of Northampton-place I stumbled against a bank; I then saw this young man lay hold of him.</p>

               <p>Q. When he run across the road had he any thing with him? - A. No, I never saw any thing with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any lead about him at any time? - A. I saw a bundle under his arm, I could not tell what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bundle afterwards found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The first that you saw of any person was on the ladder, high up? - A. He was upon the scaffold.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was a quarter before ten, we all know it was quite dark at that time; if you had seen any man on the scaffold you know you could not tell what colour his coat was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor whether they had round hats on or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not see what their faces were? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Percival-street, so that the people who were on the ladder might get away if they had a mind? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a carpenter: my mistress sent me out to see if there was any body on the building, and when I came to the front door I saw a man on the building; he was making a noise, by which I supposed he was ripping off the lead; I watched him, and saw him come down the ladder, very slowly, with a bulge under his coat; I watched him about a quarter down the ladder; I left him then, and run to the watchman along with the witness Goodey.</p>
               <p>Q. What man was that you saw come down, was it the prisoner? - A. I cannot tell, because I lost sight of him when I went to the watchman; the minute I told the watchman, I run forward, and before I got to Mr. Percival's house, I saw a man, and I cried out, that is the man, and immediately he crept under the rails and dropped something from under his arm; he ran immediately into the road, I followed him, and just as I got up to him at Northampton-place Pottinger knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same man that stooped down and dropped something that you saw taken? - A. Yes, and the lead was found exactly where I see him drop it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you see the man that came down the ladder stoop under the rails? - A. I do not know that it was the man that came down the ladder, I lost sight of him about two minutes. (The lead produced and identified by Collis.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to a person that I knew, to do some work for me; I have five days work in a week; I am a gardener, I wanted this man to work for me while I finished some other work; I saw a mob running, holloaing out, stop thief; I was running to see what was the master, and they took me.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the Jury how you came up to that rail? - A. Upon my word it is quite false, it is indeed.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

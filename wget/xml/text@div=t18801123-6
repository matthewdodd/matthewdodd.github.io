I am a labourer at Charing Gross Station—Conquest spoke to me and I watched the man not in custody—he went towards the stall at which a bad florin was afterwards found to have been passed—on 29th October, about 6 o'clock, Conquest pointed out the two prisoners with the same man—I took M'Coig and saw Conquest take Price, who dropped some florins, which I picked up—we all went in a cab to the station—I saw some money at the bottom of the cab, which Con<lb></lb>quest picked up, and I picked up a piece of velvet.</p>

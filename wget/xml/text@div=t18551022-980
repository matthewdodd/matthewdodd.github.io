                  </hi>. I am in the employment of William Alexander Fisher, a wharfinger and granary keeper, of Rotberhithe Wharf. On Sept. 7, the barge <hi rend="italic">Bee</hi> came to the wharf with a quantity of linseed—at 6 o'clock on that evening I left the barge properly secured, with three tarpaulins, which were tacked down with nails at the corners—they were all three marked with Mr. Kemp's initials—when I came next morning, I missed from ten to twelve bags of linseed, which had not been landed—we had commenced landing over night—I do not know what quantity was left, but I counted the tiers in the morning, and will swear that ten were gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 40, Princes-street, Rotherhithe, and am lighterman for Mr. Fisher. I-recollect the barge at Tardley's Wharf on the 7th—there were three tarpaulins on it, to the best of my knowledge—the <hi rend="italic">Industry</hi> was inside, and the <hi rend="italic">Bee</hi> outside—I missed one of the tarpaulins from the <hi rend="italic">Industry</hi> on the 8th, marked "W. A. F." which was sewn into the corner of it—it was worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should say that ten bags of linseed were missing—the tiers were stacked in elevens, and one tier had ten in it—there were four tiers disturbed; three were gone from each of the three tiers, and one from another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many tiers were there altogether in the barge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About twelve—there were eleven bags in the top tiers, but less below, as they are narrower at the bottom of the barge—I was not there on Friday, when the hundred bags were removed, but I brought the barge there on Friday morning, and I was there about eleven o'clock on Friday night, putting another barge there—the wharf was closed, but I got there by a boat, and I then shifted the barge of linseed, but did not remark whether any bags had been taken away from her—Viner and Thompson were with me; one of them is a lighterman, and the other a labourer—they are not here—I did not see the tarpaulin that night, to notice it, but I found out the following day that it was missing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barge-builder, of Queen-street, Rother<lb></lb>hithe. On Friday, 7th Sept, between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came there, and said that he wanted to hire a boat to take over the water to Hibernia Wharf, for some old rags—he agreed to hire a lug<lb></lb>boat of me—after he left I locked the lug-boat up, to prevent her being taken away, and left her safe at 7 o'clock, but she was taken away during the night—I missed her at next morning, and I did not see her again till Monday morning, when she was brought back by the prisoner—she had</p>

               <p>then been damaged and sunk, and had been repaired in a very slovenly way—I did not examine her for a day or two, but, having been sunk, any sweepings in the bottom would have been washed out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Has the prisoner ever hired boats of you before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it is not unusual for lightermen to come to me to hire boats—another party applied to me, and I told him he could have the boat, as the prisoner was a stranger to me—I have several craft, but only that one fit to go out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 42, Princes-street, Commercial-road, Lambeth. On 8th Sept. I was weather to Mr. Wright, a coal merchant, of Bankside, by South wark-bridge, and about 10 o'clock that morning saw the prisoner there in a lug-boat, with ten bags of seed—he employed some man at the wharf to land them, and they were put into a cart—I pushed one of them, and it felt like seed which was not round—the cart drove away, and the prisoner followed, and in an hour or an hour and a half he returned to the wharf; rather in liquor—I saw some tarpaulin left in the lug, but did not see any mark on it, as I did not go on board—the lug was left there all Saturday night, and on Sunday morning she got under Mr. Wright's barges, and got sunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there much traffic at Mr. Wright's wharf? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just at that time we were doing no business, because the wagons were out—the prisoner had no permission to take the barge there: he never asked—I said nothing about the irregularity of the transaction—it was done openly—I do not know whose cart it was—it may happen that lightermen may have orders to carry goods from a certain place to a certain place, and know nothing more about them—there were twelve of Mr. Wright's men there—there are one or two more of them here—the prisoner came back about the dinner hour, rather the worse for liquor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

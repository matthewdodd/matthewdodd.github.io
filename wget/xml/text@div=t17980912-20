               <p>Q. Your shop was a shop that a person would naturally report to if they wanted ear-rings, or wanted an ear-ring mended? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When these ear-rings were upon the ground, the prisoner at the bar was picking them up, and you called thieves at the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did he continue picking up the ear-rings after you had cried out thieves? - A. Yes, before and after.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no hand at all? - A. No; I am sure there was no hand came in the shop at all, nor no person.</p>
               <p>Q. Any person, besides the prisoner, might have been under this place and moved the board? - A. No, I am sure there was nobody else.</p>

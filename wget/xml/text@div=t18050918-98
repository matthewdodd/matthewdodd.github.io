             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Pearson: On the 14th of September, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop to look at some black silk stockings; I shewed her some embroidered ones; the paper contained ten pair; she wished to see some lace clocks; I shewed her a paper containing fourteen pair; she offered me twelve shillings for a pair of lace clocks; I told her, I could not take less than thirteen and sixpence; then she wished to see some broader lace clocks than what I had shewed her; I told her they would come higher, they would be fourteen shillings; she said, that was higher than she intended to give, she thought she could get them cheaper elsewhere: At that time there was one pair of embroidered clocks which laid by the side of the lace clocks on the counter; I turned my head to see if I had any that might suit her, and turning my head back again, I found a pair of embroidered was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw something move? - A. I did not; I found the embroidered pair was gone; I turned over the lace clocks to make myself positive, thinking perhaps she might have put them amongst them; not finding them there, I was thoroughly convinced that she must have taken them; the prisoner said, if I would not take her money, she must go elsewhere, she immediately got up, and went out: I went after her, and told her I was sorry to lay under the disagreeable necessity of detaining her for taking a pair of stockings, which she denied: I told her, if she looked in the tail of her gown, where she put them, she would find them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they? - A. I took hold of her and opened her hand, and in the tail of her gown,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180084"></xptr>which the had been holding in her hand, were the stockings; I brought her into the shop and sent for a constable; I gave charge of her, and I gave the constable the stockings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Who else was in the shop? - A. There was a young lady and Mrs. Pearson.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you told her when she went out of the shop, that she had got them in the tail of her gown - therefore you suspected that she had got them in the tail of her gown? - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Had she any thing else in her hand? - A. Yes, a parasol.</p>
               <p>Q. She had the parasol and the tail of her gown in her hand, and the stockings in the tail of her gown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear positively, you having suspected and told her she would find them in the tail of her gown, that it was not by accident? - A. It could not be by accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a muslin gown? - A. I cannot say; it was a white gown; I have not been able to ascertain whether it was muslin or no.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a white gown and a long train? - A. I cannot answer whether it was a long train or a short one.</p>
               <p>Q. The lady had it in her hand when she came into the shop and when she went out; I should suppose if a lady's train was not long, she would not hold it up? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stopped her what did she say? - A. She denied having them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say when you found them? - A. She said, good God! so I have! She seemed very much confused.</p>
               <p>Q. I should think so too - upon your oath was that all she said? - A. I believe that was all she said; I was as much confused as she was.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mrs. Pearson serve in the shop? - A. Occasionally; she was not then serving in the shop, Mrs. Pearson and her friends were in the back shop; a young lady stood at the side of me while I was serving the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There was a young woman in the shop standing by the side of you - was she a shop-woman? - A. As occasion requires she assists in the shop; she did not see her take the stockings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. She should have been here to tell us herself, because she stood next to you, and therefore she might have seen it, if her head was not turned on one side. - A. Certainly it is possible she might.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. She was near enough to see it? - A. She was close by the side of me.</p>
               <p>- STONEHOUSE sworn. - Q. You are a constable? - A. Yes; I produce the stockings. (The stockings identified by Leech.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. If you think proper I will state the circumstance as it happened, if it will be any satisfaction to your Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury: When I went to buy the stockings, this is the gown I had on at the time (shewing the gown), it was a nice dress gown; I held it up a great deal, and when I went into Mr. Pearson's shop, it was about six o'clock in the afternoon, I asked him to let me see some black silk stockings, which he brought; I told him I did not like them, they were not so good as I wanted them, I wished to see others; he brought another parcel, they were not the clock that I wanted; I wanted to see open lace gores; these stockings lay on the counter; I then looked at the open lace ones, and they were striped down the gore; I told him I wanted them as good as I could get them, and as rich; I would thank him to let me have a pair of clear lace gores; he looked, and found a parcel of this description, he said; and when I examined them, I made him sensible that the description of stockings that I wanted, the gore ran broader at the bottom; he made me answer, the reason he did not shew me them was because they were of too large a size for me; I said I believed he was right, but if he would look out a short size of that pattern, I would be obliged to him; he then found a pair, which I looked at; he told me the price was thirteen shillings, I told him I would give him twelve shillings, he said he would not take less than thirteen shillings; I said to him, you have been always in the habit of asking thirteen and taking twelve, take the twelve and I will have these stockings, if you will not, you will oblige me to go elsewhere; he said, I cannot help it, I will not take less than thirteen; with that I took up my train off the counter (the young woman came out of the parlour), I held my train up and took my parasol, and bid them good evening; and when I was going some way from the door, he came after me; he said you have got something that does not belong to you: I returned back with him; he said, if you look in your gown tail, you will find the stockings; I said, good God Almighty! you astonish me! I let my gown tail fall, and, to my utter astonishment, as well as the young man's, I saw the stockings. I am an innocent woman, I never knew they were there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Stonehouse.) Q. You found some money on her? - A. I found two half guineas and twelve and sixpence in silver in her pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

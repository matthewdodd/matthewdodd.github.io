               <persName id="t18340703-145-person891">Brennan</persName>
             dragged me away, I saw my husband down on the ground, and 
               <persName id="t18340703-145-person892">Maconolly</persName>
             over him - I did not see him do any thing to him; only I heard my husband say, before I brought him home, that he was kicked and stamped on by Maconolly - I helped to take my husband away - he walked about twenty yards, and then fell down in the street - Maconolly followed him - I did not see the prisoner follow him - Maconolly was daring my husband with his fist, when he followed him, to hit him, and to hit me too - Maconolly did not strike him after that - when my husband got up he was retching - he complained of his stomach, putting his hand to it - I got two men to help him home; he was not able to walk without assistance - he was very bad that night, retching and screaming. On Sunday morning, I observed about a thimbleful of blood that came from him - it went down through him - Mr. Walker, a surgeon, saw him, and he was carried to the London Hospital in a cradle - I saw him in the hospital, and attended him till he died, which was the Wednesday following, about one o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the prisoner put his hand on him, and want him to go to another public-house, was it done in an angry manner or not? A. I did not think that it was; he said he would give him half a gallon of beer if he would go- the public-house is quite close to where we lived - I cannot tell what he received for his pay; he sometimes had more and sometimes less - I took out of his pocket, (when he was brought home, before he went to the hospital,) half-a-sovereign and three shillings - I told him I had taken out what was in his pocket - he was in great pain; he did not tell me what money he should have in his pocket - he had nothing that I know of in his pocket when he went out that morning - when he received his wages he always came home and gave me what he wished - I cannot tell whether he had any more money in his pocket than what I found - I did not see any attempt made by any body to take any money from him; if any thing of that sort had happened in the public-house I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Maconolly here? A. No - he is about twenty-one or twenty-two years old,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030064"></xptr>and a strong hale young man - when the prisoner offered to treat my husband it was all in friendship - Maconolly was on the spot when my husband complained that he had kicked him while he was down, and he appeared in a passion - and he faced me with his fist when my husband was on the ground.</p>

            . I am the landlady of the Turk's Head. These people came in and had two pots of porter - there was no quarrelling while they were there - I heard no complaint of any attempt to rob - they had two pots of porter, which Reilly paid for - they went out together - the last witness went out with them - I saw Reilly and Maconolly trying to pull their clothes off - I don't know the prisoner, but I understand he was one of the party - I saw nobody fight with the deceased but Maconolly - after seeing them pull their clothes off, I went into another room - when I came back I heard a heavy fall - I looked, and saw them both on the ground; Maconolly was on the top of Reilly - I had heard Reilly, in the house, say he would give them a gallon of porter; and afterwards he said he would give them half a gallon - when I took in the second pot, Maconolly, as I understood, said, "If you will go with me, I will treat you to half a gallon of beer" - I only heard the voice, I cannot say who it was said so - I did not hear the least about any old grudge between them - I knew Maconolly by sight before, but did not know his name - I know he was one of the party.</p>
               <p>Q. Your deposition states you saw Macarthy endeavouring to take him home, and he said he would give him some beer; and you said you did not know Maconolly? A. Yes; I did not know their names, and made a mistake.</p>

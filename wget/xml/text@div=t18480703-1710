                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On the night of 28th June, I was in the Back-road, Wapping—there were some girls there, and several people quarrelling in the road—I heard a scream, looked back, and saw a man hit a female on the head, and knock her against the paling—before I could get there she received a second blow—I caught the man by the collar, and asked' why he knocked her about—he did not answer—another man struck me—I looked round, and was struck again by another—there was a great mob—I was knocked down in the road—my hat fell off, I got up, and ran after Joseph Bryan; James Bryan tripped me up on my face and hands, and Joseph ran at me as I got up, and stabbed me in the inside of my arm—it bled very much—I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of John Soulby, a ship-chandler, residing in Wapping. I remember the prisoner coming to our premises on the 23rd of Jan.—he said he wanted some half-bleached or brown canvas—I told him Unit we had no half-bleached, but that we had got brown—he said be wanted it for Captain Brown, of the <hi rend="italic">William</hi>, of Kirkcaldy—I showed him a piece of brown, and let him have twenty-five yards, because we believed it was for the captain—I booked it—he came afterwards and had twenty-four pieces of twine which he said were for the same captain, and he took them away—I gave him a bill with the first, and then I put the other in the same bill.</p>

I remember the prisoner coming and selecting the canvas—he said he wanted it for the <hi rend="italic">William</hi>, Captain Brown, of Kirkcaldy, lying in the St. Katherine's Docks, at the jetty—he had the canvas—I said I would send it, but he said he had a person to take it, I had better not send it—I followed him, but I did not find the vessel—I had been there two or three hours before, and there was no such vessel in the dock—I have never found such a person as Captain Brown—I have searched since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable. The prisoner was given into my charge on the 24th of Jan., near Bermondsey New Church—I asked Bridge what was the charge—he said, robbing them of two bolts of canvas—this was said in the prisoner's presence—the prisoner said it was no robbery—the acting inspector asked him, in my presence, where he lived—he said, "Mill-lane, Tooley-street"—I went there, but found no such residence—I found that he had occupied a loft there two year's back.</p>

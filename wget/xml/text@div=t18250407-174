            . I am the bailiff. Orders had been given that no more beans should be used for the horses - I had given the order myself to all the servants; I missed the quantity of beans out of the bulk when I came home that evening, between six and seven o'clock; there might be four or five quarters of beans there - I had seen them all safe on the 25th; my master had a field then ready to plant beans, and I believe they had been planting beans that day; but the prisoner was not employed in that service; he ran away as soon as this was found out.</p>

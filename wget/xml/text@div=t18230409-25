About a fortnight after Christmas, I had been to Mr. Pocock's, Whitefriars, and received 8 s., and on my return I went into the Goat, public house, at Kensington, and called for a pint of beer, and had it in the tap-room. I found four men there in company together, and in good humour, and quiet. We got into conversation; they said they supposed I was a pensioner, and had just been to get my pension, and said.</p>
               <p>"Old cock, you are a hearty cock; drink with us." I said,</p>
               <p>"No, gentlemen, I am not used to drink with strangers." They said, Oh, then I was above it, and pressed me. I did drink with them, and put my pint into their pot. I mentioned the name of

We got to the end of the high wall, and then a tall man, who they called Smith, was alongside me, on my left; my right hand was to the wall, and the prisoner was close at my heels on the right, next the wall, and the other three were outside. The tall man turned his head towards me, with the pipe in his mouth, and said,</p>
               <p>"Old cock, you'll see Stockley in a moment," and on coming to the end of the wall they tripped me up, knelt upon me, and caught me by the throat; his knees were on my right chest; my head laid against the ditch; he screwed my neck round to the left, and the prisoner took my handkerchief and money out of my left pocket. It was a half-crown and two shillings in silver in my left-hand jacket-pocket; I lost a sixpence, twopence-half-penny, and some tobacco in a paper, from my right-hand pocket. I received no blows, but was very much hurt in the chest; I had two ribs broken, and my lungs injured. The prisoner was one of the four men in the house when I went in; he was sitting on my left, and talking about Malta. I was confined to my bed several weeks in consequence of the injury, and attended by the doctor. They all left me on getting my money, and ran down the lane. The watchman came on; I crawled down to the turnpike with him, and with assistance I got to Hammersmith that night. I did not see the prisoner again until I recovered, when he was in custody, in the cage, at Kensington. I went to the Goat afterwards, and the landlord knew me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time did it happen - A. A little after nine o'clock in the evening. When I called on Cole, the landlord, he said he had heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know me before you saw me that night - A. I was never in his company, but had seen him frequently before, driving a glass coach at Kensington at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn back to look behind you after you left the Goat - A. Yes. I saw him on my knees, taking the money out of my pocket. He was close at my heels all the way under the wall.</p>

About a fortnight after Christmas, one evening, between eight and nine o'clock, the prosecutor came to my house; the prisoner and three more were there, and had a pot of porter; the prosecutor called for a pint; the prisoner and his companions were talking to him; I heard some name mentioned; I think it was

            . The prosecutor was enquiring about him; they said they knew him, and would shew him. The prosecutor and all four men went away together, and turned towards town. The prosecutor appeared to be sober, and so was the prisoner and his companions. I did not see the prosecutor again for a month a two after. I had heard nothing about him until he came - I recollect his being the man who was in his company. Neither the prisoner nor his companions ever came to my house afterwards, to my knowledge; nor did they frequent it before. I have sometimes seen the prisoner driving a hackney-coach. I do not know what house he frequented. I am positive he is one of the four who were talking to the prosecutor, and who went out with him.</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody on Thursday, the 20th of March, as he came out of the Marquis of Granby, public-house, at Kensington. The prosecutor had described him to me the night before; Butler was with me. I fetched the prosecutor, who immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090013"></xptr>said he was the man who took the money from his pocket, but not the man who used him ill.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it not represented to you that I had not been out of that place from the time the robbery was committed - A. I told him he was charged with a highway robbery; he was very particular in enquiring when and where it was - I have seen him about before. I have endeavoured to find Smith, but cannot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the charge. I went to the public-house with Smith, to have a pint of beer; two more came in, who were strangers to me, but Smith knew them - we sat down together, and they began talking to the prosecutor. When I came out, I turned to the right, towards a corner for a necessary purpose, and went straight home. It is unfortunate for me that he does not know the date when it happened, or I could have brought respectable witnesses, who knew I was at home at the time. The Magistrate particularly asked if he saw my hand in his pocket; he said he felt me, that he could not tell it was my hand, but he thought so. I had not been out of the town a long time before or since, and could have been taken if I was wanted. I have known Smith some time; he is a stone-mason.</p>

The prisoner lodged in my house for about a fortnight; in the morning of the 11th of October I left the house, with the prisoner in it - I afterwards missed him, and two pairs of woman's shoes, which had been in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180078"></xptr>the room where he was; I found him in a public-house, and asked if he knew what he had done - he said he was sorry for it; the duplicates were taken from him.</p>
               <p>Q. But did not the prisoner tell you where they were to be found? A. No; I made inquiries about the first pair, and at the office he said he pawned one pair at Mr. Bailey's, and one in Camden-town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you tell him if he would tell you what he had done you would not prosecute him? A. No, I did not, nor did I send such a message by Southerden - I had some conversation with him, but did not send any message to the prisoner; I had no quarrel with him.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL HARRISON. I am a nurseryman, and live in Alexander-square, Brompton. On Thursday, the 8th of February, I saw the prisoners at my door; Oakham asked if I wanted to buy gravel; I said I wanted a few loads, very course, to form the foundation of a road in front of my house; they said they could sell me some; I agreed for four loads at 4s. a load; they said they got it from the bed of the river, as it fell over from the barges; they brought two loads next morning, which I thought was chiefly stone - I did not see it shot; four cart loads were deposited there, two on Friday, and on Saturday another, that was of a different description; I said it was not what I was in the habit of having, and I should have no more.</p>

            . I am a constable of Chelsea. The stones that fall from the barges are taken up by the men -I am employed to prevent it. On Friday evening, the 10th of February, I saw Taylor draw a load of stones from the wharf, and next morning I traced the wheel of a cart out of Jubilee-place, where it should be shot down, to Godfrey-street, and some stones remained there, which I would swear were the same as were being unloaded - the cart had no business in Godfrey-street - I traced the wheel out of Godfrey-street into the road again to the stable - I compared the stones in Godfrey-street with those in Alexander-square; they are peculiar from all other stones; I went to Oakham's lodgings, and told him I wanted him for stealing stones, which belonged to the trust; he said he had picked up two loads of shoreings, and sold them to Harrison, and shot two loads in Godfrey-street - I took him to Newman; he then said,"I hope you will look over it this time" - I took Taylor, and told him it was for the two loads of stone in Godfrey-street; he said, "D-n it, I meant to have taken them up again;" I said he had no business to shoot them there - he said he wanted to go home for his corn.</p>

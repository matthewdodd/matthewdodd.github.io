                  </hi>. I was an able seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Star of Peace</hi>, which left Melbourne at the latter end of last July—I shipped at Melbourne to come home—one night, about a month after, while off Cape Horn (I don't remember the date) the captain (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) sang out to shake a reef out of the mizen topsail—I was on the deck-watch that night—I had come on at 8 o'clock, and our watch would be over at 12 o'clock—there were six or seven of us in a watch—I was in the closet at the time, but I don't think I was two minutes after the men got on the poop—I came aft just as the men got on the topsail halyards—the captain said "Evans, what is keeping you last?"—he did not speak too slow, and he did not speak too high—I said "My God, do you want me to fly"—he said "For the future I will keep my eyes upon you"—says I "All you can do to keep your eyes upon me"—he then sang out for the mainsail to be loosed—I went up the rigging to loose it—others went up with me—there were two to each side—I got half-way up the main-rigging, and the captain sang out to the second mate "You send that fellow up"—I sang out "I am up"—directly I got on the main-yard I loosed the sail, and I came on the midships of the yard and sang out to those below for the bunt-line to be let go—the captain said "If you don't shut up I will fix you"—the boatswain said the bunt<lb></lb>line was all gone—I took another pull on it, and could not get it, it was still <hi rend="italic">taut</hi>, and I sang out again, and it was then loosed—I did all that was wanted, and came down, and went on the poop to the captain, and said "What is the meaning of your trying to shut my mouth up when I am singing out for a rope to be let go"—he said "I will let you know I am half owner of the ship," And he mentioned something else about a superior ship, or a Government ship—I said "That's nothing, if you were full owner that does not say that you are going to stop my mouth"—he said "You are a blackguard"—I said "Well, you will be the means of making me one"—says he "Get off my poop," And as I was going down he said "Here, here, stop there," And then he sang out for the boatswain to fetch the irons out—when he said "Get off my poop," I said "Perhaps it is only very lately that you have had a poop"—the boatswain brought the irons aft, and gave them to the captain to put them on me—I told the captain I would not allow him to put them on me—he said "Who will you allow to put them on"—I said "I will allow the boatswain," And the boatswain did put them on—the captain then said, pointing up the mizen-rigging, "Now up there you will go"—I said "I will lose my hands, if you put me up there"—it was about 10.15 or 10.30 at night; the wind was dying away, and it was a regular sharp, cold night, the moon was bright—I told him I would not allow him to put me up there; with that he stamped his foot, and <hi rend="italic">crunched</hi> his teeth at me, and said "You will have to go," And he got hold of me round the body, and pulled my shirt outside my trousers, and tore my shirt, and I held my hands with the irons on them like that, and shoved him, and he fell down—I told him I was willing to be put in any place except being triced up in the rigging—he said "You will have to go"—the boatswain said to me "Well, Evans, it is best to go on quietly, you will not be stopped up there long"—then I went—I went to the starboard side of the mizen-rigging, and they triced me up there—my two hands were</p>

               <p>triced up like that above my head; I had to lay my head on my arm so; I could not sit down, my breast was up against the rigging—there was a piece of rattling-line in the middle of the handcuffs—the boatswain fetched that—I had my feet on the deck—I could not sit down or incline; if the ship rolled, I had to roll with her—I was kept for two hours in that position; it was 10.15, and when I got down in the after-cabin it had just gone four bells, 2 o'clock—I could not account for the time, because I was in such agony with the cold—I was there when the next watch came up—when the captain fell I did not fall also—just as I shored him I fell up against the poop-rail—I did not fall on him—I did not fall on the deck—all this took place on the break of the poop—the men came aft, but I know nothing about that, only I heard them growling at the captain—I heard someone come aft, and put a screw of tobacco in my pocket, and one in my mouth, and said "You will not have to wait long there, the captain has found a place for you?"—when I was loosed I was taken down to the sail-room, and was kept there till 2.30 next Sunday afternoon—I had the irons on all that time, and for a fortnight after—the carpenter and cook cleared out from where they lived, and went forward in the forecastle, and I was put there; it was a deck-house; it was fitted up as a prison for me—I was kept there eight weeks and two days, till the vessel arrived in the port of London—I was kept in irons day and night for fourteen days—after that the irons were taken off during the day, and put on at night—during all the time I was in the deck-house I made no effort to break out or escape; it was no use—I am not sure of the day of the month that we arrived in the port of London; it was on a Saturday—I had the irons on as usual, from 5 o'clock in the evening till 9.30 next morning—I was shut up in the same place on the Sunday—I had the irons off till 6 o'clock, and then I was kept there with them till they were taken off by the officer, on the Monday afternoon, when I was taken away by a warrant-officer, and taken before Mr. Paget—I was convicted, and sentenced to one day's imprisonment.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SEYMOUR</hi>. I was put to steering the ship about a week after we left Melbourne—I said I could steer—I could do it, but I had the headache, I was sick; they would not allow me the wheel any more—the captain said I could not do it—that was about two or three weeks before I was put in irons—I did not say to a seaman named Man<lb></lb>hood "The b——, (referring to the captain) said I could not steer; I have a good mind to go aft and do for the Scotch son of a bitch"—I don't think I spoke over a dozen words to that man—I did not say to him "If you were of the same mind as I am, you would go after the Scotch b——now;" nothing of the kind—I never said in Manhood's hearing that I would do for the captain—I never uttered any threat against the captain before the night that I was put in irons—I never said that if the captain ever said anything to me there would be a row—I never said so to James Brufort—I never said that if two or three would join me I would make a different ship of it, nor anything to that effect—three or four days before I was put in irons I had a dispute with a man named Miller—I got a belaying-pin to frighten him—I did not strike him with it—I hit him with my fist first; I and then, to frighten him, I struck the side of his bunk with the belaying-pin—I did not strike him on the body several times, nor try to do so, or threaten him—I had been in prison, in the hulks, for fourteen days, before I left Melbourne; that was for knocking off duty; that was the only time I was in prison—I was in Calcutta for four hours, for being drunk, that was</p>

               <p>a few months before—I had left the hulks just before I joined this ship—I was four weeks ashore—I had not been sent there for following the mate of my previous ship with an open knife—I did not tell Manhood and Shields so—I was imprisoned for knocking off duty—there was no charge of threat<lb></lb>ening personal violence to anyone—on the night in question I sang out as loud as I could to let go the port bunt-line—I sang out bard enough to let them know below—I did not shout out louder than was necessary—when I sang out the second time I shouted at the pitch of my voice; not louder than I need have done—there were two boys and me and another man at the starboard side of the yard—the men I sang out to were about as far from me as this man (<hi rend="italic">the foreman of the Jury</hi>)—the captain did not tell me not to call out so loud; he never spoke—he did not tell me to shut up; he said he would fix me—he said "If you don't shut up I will fix you"—I might have said "I will not"—I don't remember saying it—I had no busi<lb></lb>ness on the poop at the time I went to the captain—I went to ask him why he told me to shut up when I was singing out for a rope to be let go—he said I was not to let him catch me again on the forecastle—I told him I was not in the forecastle—I did not say to the captain "I will give you a better chance to fix me yet"—I did not say so in Brufort's presence—I did not raise my arm, threatening to strike the captain—I went up to him with my arms folded, so—I called him an old woman, not an old wh—,—, or a son of a bitch—I told him to p—up his leg; that was when I was up the rigging—I shouted that from the rigging—I did not at the same time shake my fist in his face, and say that I would rip his puddings up and do for him—I was ten minutes on the poop, and my knife in my pocket at the time, and if I had had any ill-feeling towards the captain—it was not after I had called him an old woman that he sang out for the boatswain—he told me to get off his poop—I know Joe Senna, he was examined before the Magistrate—it is not true that after I called the captain an old wh——, he called the boatswain to bring the irons, and said "You beat all the men I ever saw"—I did not tell the captain before I was put in irons that I was only waiting for the fine weather to do for him—he did not say "If you don't keep quiet you will compel me to put you in irons"—he said he would let me know he was half-owner, and he would 'put me where I could not see him—after the irons were put on me, I shoved at him to stop him from tricing me up in the rigging; not several times; twice; it is not true that he fell undermost and I on him, on the deck—I did not fall at all; the captain fell himself—I did not fall on him—I know the second-mate, he attended to me during his watch, when I wanted to go to the closet—he did not take off one of my irons a day or two after<lb></lb>wards, nor did I point towards the captain, and say "I should like to shoot the b——"—I did not use any expression of that kind—after I had been three days and a half on bread and water, the steward brought me some coffee and biscuits; it was not the morning after I was confined—I did not say to him "Take your b——coffee, you d—son of a bitch;" I was too glad of it—I did not, that same afternoon, while I was being removed across the deck, turn round and shake my fist at the captain, and say I would do for him yet—I said "You will pay for this"—I did not shake my fist at him; I was in irons when I came out of the cabin—I did not say I did not care to be put in irons, and that I would go home as a pas<lb></lb>senger—I was twice offered to go out and walk about the deck—I did not refuse to go—I went outside the door, but the boatswain and mate were</p>

               <p>out there with a big bur, ready to hit me with it—I went so far as the door—I refused to go further than the door—on one occasion I threw my soup about the place—I refused to clear up the mess when I was told to do it—I did not threaten the mate with violence—I said "You have been torturing me in my grub all the time"—he said "Me! you are a pretty b——"—I said "Perhaps I am as good as you," And with that he swung the door in my face, and I never saw him till next morning, when I got my bread and water—I did not say I would do for him yet, as well as the captain, nothing of the kind—some beef was brought to me one day and I said I preferred bread and water, when I saw what grub it was—I was not told it was beef that all the crew were eating—my grub was brought to me about an hour after all the rest had had their meals; and it was not fit for a pig to eat, let alone a Christian—I persisted in taking bread and water for fifteen days—I told the mate I was quite content with that, before I would eat such grub as that; it was as black as ink—it was not the same that they got forward; I don't know that it was, I was locked up at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Star of Peace</hi>, a British ship, sailing under the English flag—I joined at Melbourne for the homeward voyage—I was in the same watch with Evans—on the night of 26th August I went to the wheel from 10 to 12 o'clock—about 10.15 the captain, who was on the poop, ordered a reef to be taken out of the mizen topsail—all the men came aft—Evans was the last—the captain said to him "Why are you always the last man coming to your work when you are called?"—Evans said Why, what do you want me to do, to fly?"—the captain said "No, I want you to come to your work when you are called"—Evans did what he was called for, and the captain afterwards gave orders to loose the mainsail—Evans went up the rigging to loose it—after he got up in the main-yard he loosed the sail, and sang out "Let go the main bunt-line, and then he sang out a second time rather loud—the captain said if he did not shut up he would have punishment for it—Evans said to the captain "Why don't you do what you mean, not always nagging and growling"—he then came down from the mainyard, and went on to the poop where the captain was standing—I was at the wheel all the time—he stood before him, and said "Well, captain, why don't you do what you mean, not always growl<lb></lb>ing, anything you want to do, fighting, or anything; I have been waiting for the fine weather to come, so I will have a talk to you"—the captain told him to go off his poop, he did not want to have anything to do with him—Evans said "It is lately since you had a poop of your own"—the captain said "You beat all the men I ever saw" And he ordered him off the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He got the same food as the rest of the crew—I never attended upon him—I heard him sing out to let go the bunt-line—he sang out rather loud, not in the usual way—the captain told him not to call out—I don't know whether the captain did right in reprimanding him for</p>

               <p>it, perhaps he did not like to hear him sing out loud; some men might, perhaps, like to hear them sing out loud—when he first came up on the poop I was looking at him; I could not be always looking at him, because I had to steer the ship, and watch the compass—I could hear everything that was said, but I could not look at everything—I did not see whether or not he raised his hand as he approached the captain—I heard the cap<lb></lb>tain say that he wanted to have nothing to do with him, and that he had better go off the poop—he said "Go off my poop"—Evans said he had very lately had a poop, and the captain then said "If you don't go off the poop I will put you in irons"—he did not go then—he called the captain an old wh—, and used other language—one day before this when we had rather too much work to do I heard Evans say "I try to go along quiet in his ship, but I see I can't do it, being humbugged like this; I will kick up a row, and get put in irons, and go home as a passenger"—he told me that he had been sent to the hulks at Melbourne for chasing the mate of a ship round the deck with a knife; he did not tell me alone, he told all the watch on the forecastle—he said he was there eight weeks—I never sailed with the captain before this—I sailed with him from Melbourne to London, two months and twenty-five days—I have no complaint to make against him—I don't know about another man—he always treated me well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was about two or three weeks after we left Melbourne that Evans told us about chasing the mate with a knife—I did not mention it to the captain; it was not my way to tell anything I heard—he did not say what he meant by humbugging on board this ship—sailors are always saying something when there is too much work to do, or when the weather is bad—it was bad weather when he said this, rough, and blowing.</p>

I was an able seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Star of Peace</hi> on the voyage from Melbourne—Evans was a shipmate—two or three days after leaving Melbourne he was at the wheel—the captain told the second<lb></lb>mate to send him aft—Evans came aft, and the captain asked him what was the matter with him, and he told the captian he was sick—the captain said he was nothing but a d—<hi rend="italic">loafer</hi>, and it would be best for him to go about his duty—I heard Evans say "You can do it as soon as you like"—on the night of 26th August I was in Evans' watch—I was one of the men called to reef the topsail—I was in the forecastle with Evans at the time, we went aft together—we were the two last—I was before Evans, he was just behind me—the captain said to Evans "You are last again, you are always last"—Evans said "Do you want me to fly?"—the captain said "No, I expect you to be here with the rest of the crew"—the captain told the second mate to loose the mainsail—Evans went up aloft—when he got up he sang out "Let go the bunt-line" In rather a loud tone—the captain told him to shut up—the second mate went toward the bunt-line and sang out it was all gone—Evans told the captain he should not shut up when there was anything to be done aloft—the captain said "I will fix you," And Evans said "I will give you a better chance of fixing me than this"—after the mainsail was let go, Evans came down and went on the poop to the captain and said "Fix me now, as you talk so much about fixing me"—the captain called him a d—blackguard—Evans used very abusive language to the captain, and the captain told him he would put him in irons, and called the boatswain to fetch the irons—the boatswain went—Evans was abusive to the captain—the captain was going to help the boatswain put the irons on Evans—and he said "I won't allow you to put the irons on, I will</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187111200020"></xptr>
               <p>let the boatswain," And then the boatswain put them on—the captain said he would seize Evans up to the rigging—Evans said "No you won't,"—Evans was then standing quietly on the poop—the captain said "I will," and Evans said "What, would you seize a sick man up to the rigging?"—the captain sent the boatswain for a piece of rattlin line, and when he brought it, the captain went to take hold of Evans and Evans up with his hands and struck the captain, and they both fell on the deck—Evans was uppermost; after that the boatswain was ordered to trice him up to the rigging, and he was triced up—his hands were placed about six inches above his head—it was a cold frosty night—Evans was tied up there about an hour—I was there when the next watch came to relieve us, and I asked the next watch to go aft and ask the captain to take Evans out of irons—Evans was standing quietly up against the rigging at the time, saying nothing—he had his head down—all hands went aft and told the mate that we wanted the man out of the rigging, and we did not intend to do any more work in the ship until he was out—the mate went down and called the captain—the captain came up, and I told the captain I did not consider it a fit place for a man to be in the rigging such weather as that was, and if he wanted to punish the man he was to leave it for the law to do—the captain said he was perfectly aware of that, he would take the responsibility on his own head, all we had to do was to look after ourselves and not trouble our heads about him—we still refused to do any more duty, and the captain said he would take him out of the rigging—I was not there when he was released, it was my watch below then—it was about 1.45 when I left the deck—he was still in the rigging when I left the deck—I know that he was afterwards released and put in the carpenter's house—during the time he was in the deck house I never heard him use any threats or make any attempt to get away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He could not very well create a disturbance when he was in there—I did not attend to him—when he went on the poop I was below it, about 8 ft.—I could not see all that passed—I did not see him put himself in a threatening attitude to the captain—I did not see when he did, but I heard—I heard the captain say that he would keep him in the rigging until he got a place ready for him—I did not hear him say "If you don't go off the poop I will put you in irons"—there were several remarks between his speaking of the irons and the irons being brought—the man was still standing on the poop, and using abusive language to the captain—I know a man named Miller who was on board—I saw Evans strike Miller with a belaying-pin—I don't know whether it struck him; it caught on the edge of the bunk—it is true that I said "I saw him fetch an iron belaying-pin, and strike Miller with it twice on the body"—one blow indented the bunk—that was two or three days before—it was either on the morning of the 26th, or the day before—I heard Evans say if the captain ever said anything to him he would have a row—when Evans was called away from the helm he said "You can do it as soon as you like"—I did not hear the captain say to Evans that if he did not reform his ways that he would oblige him to punish him—all I understood was that the captain would punish him in some way or the other; what the language was I did not get hold of—the captain said he would punish him for his neglect of duty, and Evans said "You can do it as soon as you like."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Miller had to relieve Evans on the watch, and Evans went down to arouse, him—Miller used abusive language to him, and Evans</p>

               <p>pitched into him—he did not hurt him at all—he struck the bunk with the iron belaying-pin, but I thought it was more to frighten him than anything—Miller got up out of his bunk directly after that, and relieved him—I was close to the poop when I heard the conversation between Evans and the captain—I could see on the poop—I did not see any threatening attitude on the part of Evans to the captain.</p>

I was an able seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Star of Peace</hi>—I joined at Melbourne on the night of 26th August—I had to go on the watch at 12 o'clock, and when I came on deck I found Evans tied to the rigging—he could just touch the deck with his toes, and was tied up in the starboard mizen rigging—he was in a poor condition, crying with cold and pain—I was one of the men that went aft to remonstrate—I asked the captain what he was going to do with the man—he said "He will have to remain until to-morrow, when I find a place for him"—the captain had him sent down below afterwards—during the time Evans was confined in the deck-house he did not use any violence, and I did not hear any disturbance—he was always quiet—I had a quarrel with Evans a couple of days before he was put in irons, when he came to turn me out of the bunk—he struck me with his fist in the face—he did not hurt me to speak of—I did not make any complaint till a couple of days before we got in, and then I would not have spoken about it only the second mate came and asked me about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I only saw one bunk; that was not included in the measurement—it was boarded up, leaving room for a man to get into it—it was about 2 1/2ft. wide, and 6 1/2ft. long—there was plenty of ventilation—I saw the captain before the Magistrate the first thing on the Monday morning at the sitting of the Court, when he made an application for a warrant.</p>

I live at Brunswick House, Clapham Common—I was Coroner and Magistrate at the Castlemaine District, in Victoria, fourteen years—I returned from Australia in the <hi rend="italic">Star of Peace</hi> with my wife and child—Dr. New bold was the only other passenger—I was not present when this disturbance took place, on the night of 26th August—we were in bed—next day, at breakfast, the captain spoke to me on the subject—he consulted me upon that and other occasions, during the voyage; altogether five times, I think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He told me the facts upon which he had acted, he told me the whole affair—he told me that he had had reported to him threats against his life; that Evans had threatened his life, and that he was afraid of his life—I had noticed Evans constantly, just as a man would who has nothing to do on board, and my opinion that he was the man was confirmed by the observations I had made of him—I did not know who the man was, but I picked him out—I did not see any violent conduct on his part, but he always had a sulky, sullen appearance, and when the captain told me what had occurred, I said "Was it such a man,"Describing him, I did not know his name; and I afterwards found that was the man in custody—the captain consulted me afterwards, five or six times, about the course he was taking, whether I thought he was acting right, or too harshly, or too leniently—my advice was to keep the man there, that it would not be for the safety of the passengers or the property on board to let the man go, and I myself demanded it of him for the safety of my family—I have frequently seen the deck-house where Evans was confined—I have seen the door left open—he had much more room there than I had in my cabin, and mine was supposed to be the best in the ship—I never saw any unseemly conduct on the part of the captain in any way—I never heard him use any un<lb></lb>seemly language, and I never wish to sail with a better man as a captain.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I noticed a peculiar look about Evans before he was con<lb></lb>fined; he could never look you in the face—I never saw him guilty of any violence, or heard him use any threats—the advice I gave the captain was from what he told me—I also heard one of the men, Senna, tell the captain that he was in fear of his life; that the man was constantly getting up</p>

               <p>quarrels with the crew—I heard that he was kept fourteen days with the handcuffs on—that was not by my advice; the captain mentioned the matter—I forget whether it was fourteen days or not—I left the ship about 6.30 on the Saturday, to get my luggage out—I was not aware that he was put in irons that night—during the voyage home I did not hear of any disturbance in the deck-house, or any attempt to get out—the captain told me of his being tied up to the rigging—he did not tell me that the two watches came aft, and he had to take him down—he told me he only had him secured there until he could get a safe place to put him in.</p>

He was not tied up with his hands over his head to the rigging, merely as high as his chin, with a slack rope about a foot to spare. I then consulted with my officers and passengers as to his being kept in confinement, and they agreed with me that it was not safe to allow him at large. He had the same food as the others; he was attended to three times a day by the chief officer, and occasionally by the doctor. I never had occasion to place a man in irons during the five years I have been a master."</p>

At to the Counts charg<lb></lb>ing an unlawful imprisonment after the arrival of the vessel in port, some argument might be urged; but the evidence showed that the captain had taken the earliest opportunity of releasing himself from the responsibility of the man's custody. With respect to the imprisonment during the voyage, the man's insolence and insubordination fully justified it; and as the acts of the crew in demanding his release amounted in reality to mutiny, the captain was fully justified in retaining the man in confinement for the protection of the lives and property entrusted to him. With regard to the tricing up, it was limited in point of time, and was not shown to have caused any pain or injury; it was a punishment for a very grave offence, but not such an abuse of authority as to justify the indictment.</hi>

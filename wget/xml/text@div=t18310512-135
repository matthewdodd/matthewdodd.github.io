               <p>JACOB JOSEPH. I am a quill-merchant, and live at No. 9, Suffolk-street East, St. Pancras. I have known the prisoner some years - he called at my house on Saturday, the 16th of April, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and requested me to purchase two skins of parchment of a law-stationer; he said he wanted to get them stamped to send into the country to his father, who is a lawyer, and lives at Axminster, in Somersetshire - I knew his father well; in consequence of this I applied to Mr. Nicole, of Carey-street, and procured two skins of parchment for him that evening, and after Mr. Nicole wrote the beginning of a deed, the words, "This Indenture" on them; I took them home - the prisoner came to my house about nine o'clock that evening, and I gave him the skins; he came to my house again on the Monday, and brought the skins with him - they had then each a 25l. stamp on them; he desired me to take them to a lawstationer in Chancery-lane, and sell them for him, as he said they were stamped wrong - they were too great an amount; I took the stamps to Mr. Nicole, and offered them to him for sale, or asked him to sell them for me - he went out to one place, came back, and said he could not sell them; I took them home again - I saw the prisoner again, and told him I could not sell them; I mentioned no name to him - he said, "I wish you would go out this evening, and try again to sell them, for I want the money;" I took them again to Nicole, and left them with him all night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Did you ever deal in stamps before? A.Never; I never sold any, nor bought any - I never was in this Court before in my life.</p>

            . I am a law-stationer, and live at No. 21, Carey-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. On Saturday, the 16th of April, I recollect Joseph calling on me to procure two large skins of parchment for him, and I wrote on each of them in German text, the words."This Indenture:" I gave them to him - he came to me again on the Tuesday morning, to ask if I thought I could dispose of two 25l. stamps, and produced the two skins with a 25l. stamp on each - they were the same two as I had written on; I took them to Mr. Matthews, the law-stationer, and left them with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MANNING. Q. At what time on Saturday did he call on you? A.About nine o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>CHRISTIAN GEORGE MATTHEWS. I am a law-stationer, and live in Castle-street, Holborn. I recollect Mr. Nicole coming to me with two skins of parchment on Wednesday morning, the 20th of April - they had each a 25l. stamp, and the words "This Indenture" was written on them; I said I would take them on allowing the usual discount - I took them to Mr. Duncan, of Carey-street; I observed that the parchment was not impressed under the blue stamped paper - the parchment had not received the impression of the stamp - that excited my suspicion, and I took them to the stamp-office.</p>

            . I am chief clerk in the office for the allowance for spoiled stamps. The prisoner was employed in that office as a junior clerk; spoiled stamps which are brought from the country with an affidavit are examined by me on Wednesdays and Fridays, and on the Saturday they are sent up stairs to the commissioners room, where I attend - I call the stamps over to a commissioner, who has the warrant before him; the stamps are then handed over by me to the junior clerk to cancel - the prisoner was the junior clerk on the 9th of April; it was his duty to cut the stamps off, and throw them into the fire, not to take the blue paper off the parchment.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the mode in which they are delivered?(handing the witness the corner of a sheet of parchment with the blue stamp upon it.) A. That is the mode in which he cuts them off, and he should throw them into the fire; there were two 25l. spoiled stamps allowed on the 9th of April - I know that by my own signature to this warrant (looking at it) - I have no doubt from that that two 25l. stamps were handed to him that day to be cancelled; I say so from my own signature to the warrant, and from the commissioner's signature to the warrant also - that was the first day, the prisoner had acted in that situation for some considerable time; he also attended on the 16th - there were no 25l. stamps that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive of Mr. Matthews, on the 20th of April, any parchments? A. I received two from him; I cannot particularly recollect the day - those produced are them; the stamps on them are genuine, but not genuine on the parchment, because the impression would appear through if it had been impressed on the parchment - the impressions would appear on the other side, which they do not on either of these; I went with the officer to the prisoner's house twice, and the second time I went I found a gluepot under the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look under the bed the first time? A. I might take a casual look; I suppose there was a fortnight between the first and second time - I did not lock the door of his room when I left it; there was glue in the pot- he was apprehended on the day we found the glue-pot.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said it was on the second visit, which was a fortnight after, that you found the glue-pot? A. No; I consider that if these stamps were glued on the parchment they would appear as they do now.</p>

               <p>Q. Are these blue paper stamps, in the course of business, ever impressed on paper? A. I think not, only on vellum or parchment, according to my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. This warrant is an entry of stamps brought, to be allowed on Wednesday and Friday? A. Yes - it is an account of stamps allowed by me; it is the prisoner's writing, but has my signature to it - I sign, and the commissioner countersigns as the stamps are allowed; it was not usually, the prisoner's duty to cut off stamps - there was another clerk who should have done it, but he was ill, and had been away about a week: on the 9th of April the prisoner attended in his place - it was the prisoner's duty to cut off the stamps that were to be allowed, in order to their being destroyed, and it was his duty to put them into the fire.</p>
               <p>Q.Did they go into another clerk's hands to do that? A. No - he was the person to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. In cutting them off he did his duty, and in not putting them into the fire he omitted his duty? A. Yes; there is a private-mark on the die of the stamps, but I cannot distinguish one stamp from another, nor say that any one stamp produced is the very one the prisoner ought to have put into the fire that day; the power which impresses the stamp is a very heavy one.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that it never may have happened, from any cause, that it failed to make the impression on the parchment? A. I cannot say that - when instruments come to be stamped the office gives the paper, and it is put on with glue.</p>
               <p>Q. And, according to the thickness of the glue, the stamp may, or may not, fail to give the impression? A. Very likely - I do not consider myself capable of judging - I do not know what may be; I say such a thing may happen, but it is not in my department.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The question is, whether that might arise from the quality of glue? A. I never experienced it -I always found, as far as my practice has gone, that it has always gone through; the stamps do not pass through my hands to the purchasers - that is quite a different department.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. The cancelled stamp comes in this form to the prisoner? A. No, he cuts it off- it is his duty not to take, the stamp off, but to cut it off, parchment and all, and throw it into the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. If I find this on another parchment, it must have been taken off afterwards? A. Yes; I have no idea that the glue could prevent the impression going through.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM HINDS. I am supervisor of stamps in the Stamp-office. The stamps on these two skins of parchment are the stamps employed to denote the payment of duty under the 55th of George the 3rd; neither of them appear to have been stamped on these skins of parchment.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear to you that they have been taken off some other skins? A. Yes; when the parchments are first sent in, the blue paper is attached to the skin by paste, and the skin will always bear the mark of the engine; the operation is performed by a fly-engine and a weight - it makes a very strong mark; I am sure these skins have never been under the engine in the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been in the office? A.Fifteen years, and in the stamping-office four years; there were 25l. stamps before the passing of the 55th of George the 3rd - I certainly cannot swear that this may not be one of the stamps issued before the passing of that Act.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Have you got the Commissioners' book? A. Yes (producing it); here is an order of the commissioners made on the 18th of July, 1815 - it is signed by Mr. Kappen, the head secretary, who is now dead.</p>
               <p>Stamp-office, London, 18th of July, 1815.</p>
               <p>By the Commissioners - On taking into consideration the Act of the 55th year of His present Majesty's reign, cap. 184, lately passed and entitled (here followed the title of the Act),"It is ordered that impressions shall be forthwith struck in this book, of such of the stamps or dies heretofore provided, and now or late in use, for denoting the present or some former stamp duties, or the payment thereof, as are fit and proper to be used for the purposes of the said new Act.</p>

               <p>22nd of July, 1815.</p>
               <p>By the Commisioners. - Ordered, in pursuance of the aforesaid Act of the 55th year of His present Majesty's reign, cap. 184., that the stamps or dies, whereof impressions are struck in the ten preceeding pages of this book, shall be used for the purpose of expressing and denoting any of the duties granted by the said Act, of the same amount, with the former duties denoted by them; and for expressing and denoting the rate per cent. of the legacy duties, and the amount of the other percentage duties granted by the same Act, and for denoting or testifying the payment of certain stamp duties thereby granted, without specifying the amount in special cases, as occasion and the law shall require, And it is also ordered that two or more of the said stamps or dies, and of any new stamps or dies, which shall be provided, in pursuance of the said Act, shall be used for denoting the amount of any one duty granted by the said Act, as occasion may require, until a single stamp or die shall be provided for that purpose, save and except that the stamps or dies bearing the word receipt shall be used only to denote the duty on receipts, and that the stamps or dies, bearing the word policy shall be used only to denote the per centage duty on policies of insurance. And it is further ordered, that either of the stamps or dies before mentioned, which denote a duty o 10s., shall be used for the purpose of expressing and denoting the stamp duty of 10s. on licences for keeping stage-coaches, granted by another Act of the 55th of His present Majesty's reign, for repealing the stamp-office duties on stage-coaches, and on licences for keeping stage-coaches, now payable in Great Britain, and for granting new duties in lien thereof.</p>

               <p>MR. TWYFORD re-examined. Q. Will you look at these warrants - do you know from them any thing with regard to the time that the two stamps were issued which were given to him to be cancelled? A. No - stamps must be brought to the office within twelve months of the time of their being spoiled.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. But not within twelve months of the time of their being issued? A. No; if they kept them for twenty years before they were spoiled, they still would be allowed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If an instrument were brought which was fifteen years old, it might be allowed for? A. It would depend upon whether the stamp was taken under the existing Act of Parliament - for instance, a person might make a deed previous to the passing of the 55th of George the 3rd, and keep it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Using a stamp is what you would call spoiling it? A. If the deed were not executed or signed by any party; the Act directs that it shall be brought within twelve months of that time, but how long the stamp itself has been in existence the office does not inquire, and cannot know.</p>
               <p>MESSRS. ADOLPHUS, MANNING, and PHILLIPS contended that the offence as proved could not be construed to come within the meaning of the 55th of George the 3rd, c, 184, there being no evidence to show when the impressions of the stamps were made, and that they might have been in existence before the passing of the Act, consequently they could not have been provided under that Act, as alleged in the first four Counts of the indictment, and that the two last Counts were defective in point of law, as they did not allege the prisoner's intent to use them on other parchment liable to a stamp duty, without which liability no fraud could have been intended to the revenue - and, further, that the stamps having been taken off by the prisoner, in the execution of his duty, he could not, at the moment of the removal, have intended to impress them on another parchment, which was essential, to constitute the offence.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. HINDS. Q. Is it usual to have skins stamped before they are filled up? A. Yes, very frequently - it is the genral practice with skins which are to be sent into the country.</p>
               <p>The Jury having retired, came into Court, and being asked the usual question, found a verdict of</p>
               <p>GUILTY.</p>
               <p>MR. JUSTICE BOSANQUET. Q. Gentlemen. allow me to ask whether you find that the impressions of the stamps in question were issued before the passing of the 55th of 
               <persName id="t18310512-135-person1027">George</persName>
             the 3rd,(i.e.) 1815? FOREMAN. We have no means of ascertaining that, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you do not find that they were issued after that time? A. We do not, we cannot tell.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then your verdict must be taken on the two latter Counts; now, are you of opinion that the impressions were detached with intent to be annexed to some other parchment, at the time when they were first cut off? A. We acquit him of any fraudulent intention at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, whether they were got off the slip of parchment after it was detached from the instrument, with intent to annex it to some other parchment? A.We find him Guilty of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you of opinion that the impressions were taken off the former parchment with intent to annex it to the other skin of parchment destined to be used as an indenture? A. We find him guilty of that.</p>
               <p>MR. JUSTICE BOSANQUET. The Jury acquit him of having a fraudulent intention to use the stamp at the time he first cut it off, but when he detached that from the piece of parchment, he did that with intent to make use of it.</p>
               <p>FOREMAN. Yes.</p>

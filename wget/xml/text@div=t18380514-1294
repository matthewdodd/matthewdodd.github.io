                  </hi>. I was a waiter at the Old Duke William public-house, Old Grvel-lane. On the 14th of May I was talking to the prisoner there—I missed him all at once—I went to put something into my drawer, and missed my shirt—I immediately went out after him, but could not see him, and when I returned, he was in the bar—I saw my shirt the same it between the tiles in the wash-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler. I was sitting in my parlour with some friends, and observed the prisoner go out into the back yard through the window, and go" into a privy at the further end of the yard—he came out, and came a little way down the yard, then went into the privy again, came out, and went into the wash-house—I went out, and met him coming out—I asked what business he had there—he said "No<lb></lb>thing"—I said, "What did you go there for?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "I am not satisfied with your account," and went into the wash-house to see whether he had put any thing there—when I came back, he was gone—my daughter gate me information—I went to the door—he was there—I said, "Come back, my servant has lost his shirt"—Moyse came up, and said, "You bare stolen my shirt"—he took Moyse into the with-house where I had seen him go, and showed him where he had put his shirt.</p>

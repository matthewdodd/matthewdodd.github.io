             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was intoxicated in liquor the 23d of January; returning to my lodgings about half past nine, which is at the White Bear in Princes-street, Red Lion-square, I was accosted by a woman, I never saw her before; she is not here, I believe it was in Newtoner's-street in Holborn, I went with her to her lodgings, the prisoner at the bar was at the room that she took me to; they then asked me for something to drink, which I gave them; I gave the money to the woman that carried me there.</p>
               <p>Court. What money? - As much as paid for two or three glasses of gin, about three pence I believe; as soon as they had drunk it, I found it was rather late to go to my lodging; the woman that I went with asked me what I would give to sleep there; I told them I was a <rs id="t17890225-69-deflabel318" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17890225-69-defend636 t17890225-69-deflabel318"></join> out of place, and it was out of my power to give much; but what she asked I would give her; I gave her a shilling; in a very short time they fastened the door, and both of them went to bed; I put a guinea into one of my stockings, I did not take them off; whether they saw me I do not know, but they both rose out of bed immediately, and insisted upon taking the money out of my stocking, or I should not lay there; they insisted upon it several times; I took about two shillings out of one stocking, and put it into my breeches pocket; and a guinea out of the other, and put it into my watch-pocket; I had no sooner put the silver into my breeches-pocket, and the guinea into my watch-pocket, but I took my coat and waistcoat, and breeches, and hung them over a chair about a yard from the bedside; I had not been in bed above three or four minutes, before I heard the chair drawed by the prisoner; I asked her what she was about; and in three or four minutes I found her laying on the side of the bed, and I thought she had taken my money; I said it was a lodging I did not like; upon which she got up, and unfastened the door, and ran up stairs; I got up directly, and could not find my clothes, and a strange woman came in with a light, and when I took up my breeches, I missed my watch and a guinea; I found my breeches on the floor, close by the chair, and my watch, a shilling, and a knee-buckle laying upon the floor under my coat and waistcoat; then I charged the watch with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you search the floor for the guinea? - I sought for it some little time, but I did not give myself much trouble about it.</p>
               <p>Why might not the things you lost be on the floor as well as the others? - Very possibly they might; I think it was impossible the other woman could take them, I am sure the prisoner is the person I was with; she denied knowing any thing of it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went into the room for my bonnet, the gentleman told me if I would come to bed, he would give me a present; he would not. I told the watchman to search about the floor, the guinea might be about he floor; he would not; I never saw any thing of the guinea.</p>

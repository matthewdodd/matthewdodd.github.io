            . I am a clerk in the house of Abbey and Cook, wholesale tea dealers. On Wednesday, the 8th of March, as I was walking along Pancras-lane, about half past nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in company with another lad, they were a short distance before me; one of them made a sign by which one went on one side of the way, and the other on the other side of the way, when the person that took the goods he came to the warehouse, he made a sign sufficient for the other to know that that was the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner make the sign - A. No; the one that took the goods when they got to the house of Joshua Noble.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Noble - A. He <rs id="t18150405-11-viclabel60" type="occupation">keeps a manchester warehouse</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18150405-11-victim152 t18150405-11-viclabel60"></join>. The man that took the goods made a sign to the other, that, that was the house; he walked on three or four steps, returned, and went immediately in, which the prisoner observed, went across to the door where the other had gone in, he looked in, opened his coat ready to receive something when the other came out, and popped it under his coat; then they went down Size-lane. I went into the warehouse, and informed the prosecutor that he had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the warehouse - A. There was a person in the warehouse; he locked the doors and went in search of him; I went with him; I saw which way he went, he went towards the right to Queen-street, and I fearing he might miss him, I went to the left; the person from the warehouse overtook the prisoner, and took him with the property. The prisoner was the man that received the goods at the door, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am warehouseman at Mr. Noble's; he keeps a manchester warehouse; he has no partners. Mr. Place called at the warehouse, and informed me the warehouse had been robbed by two boys, one of the boys had a loose coat on, and the other with a close body coat; one handed the goods out of the warehouse, and the other received it them; according as he described the persons, I pursued down Size-lane, into Queen-street, and at the top of Queen-street in Chepside, I saw the prisoner with a bundle under his left arm; I seized him, and found two pieces of printed shawls; I took him into custody, and delivered him up to an officer; what became of the other man I cannot say; he must get into the passage to go into the warehouse; the warehouse belongs to Mr. Noble; the upper part of the house belongs to another person; Mrs. Palmer is landlady to Mr. Noble; she rents the house.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received the prisoner and the property of Mr. Brown. This is the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Brown. Look at that property, are they Mr. Noble's - A. I cannot tell that they are; the shawls were wrapped up in this hessian when I found them; the shawls were loose in the warehouse piled up in a heep; there is no private mark to them; they are the exact patterns that Mr. Noble had.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt - A. I have a doubt; I cannot swear positively; there are other goods in the market of the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost such goods, did not you - 
               <persName id="t18150405-11-person156">A. </persName>
            They are of the same pattern and the same quality of cloth as were left behind; the mark on them is fifty-eight shawls in two pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. To Place. Did you see what was taken out of the warehouse - A. I saw a blue parcel done up in a square form; I saw the prisoner take two pieces of goods of that colour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along Queen-street about nine o'clock in the morning, a young man of genteel appearance asked me which way I was going; I said towards Cripplegate; he asked me to carry these parcels for him; at the corner of Queen-street this young man tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me what I had got; I looked round for the other young man, he was absent.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. What sort of a place is this you keep your pigeons in - A. In a shed in the back yard; they go in and out at a trap door; I had fastened the door of the shed and the upper part; the pigeons could not go out till I let them out. When I went to them in the morning there were nine gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Were these pigeons brought to you at any time - A. On the 9th of August, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought nine pigeons; the prosecutor had been to me and described them. I detained the prisoner with them. I saw Mr. Coombes, an officer of Lambeth street, going by; I called him in, he took him in custody; there were two other persons with him at the shop door, they did not come in; the prisoner offered them for sale, he asked me twelve shillings for them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. I believe he told you he had bought them that morning - A. I believe he told me so.</p>

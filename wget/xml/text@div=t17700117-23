(There is a statute of bankruptcy in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170018"></xptr> the house.) This was between the hours of three and four o'clock in the afternoon; one Mr. Phillips, a founder, came in with her; they had something to drink together, but I can't tell particularly what. He parted with her at the bar, and went away. She called for a pint of half and half. The kitchen and parlour join: the door was open; she came to me in the parlour, and said, Landlord, give me change for a guinea. I said, I will, What have you to pay? She said, I have only this pint to pay. I put my hand in my pocket to give her change. Said she directly, Will you lend me a guinea? I don't want for money, and pulled out a box of gold, I believe there might be eight or ten guineas in it, and said to me, I'll lend you five guineas, I'll be d - nd if I don't. Before she went out of the room, she there pulled out another box of gold; besides money, there were several gold rings, above twenty, I believe. Said I, your shewing me your gold, is nothing at all. What do you want to borrow a guinea for, when you have so much about you? I pulled out my money, three guineas and a half, and a shilling. She took a guinea and a shilling out of my hand, and said she would keep it. I said, What do you take my guinea for? you want change for a guinea. Said she, I'll keep it. I said, What should you keep it for? I never saw you before in my life: I shall punish you, if you don't let me have it again, without any further trouble. Then Mr. Cook said, Give the man his guinea again, he is only a servant here; he can't afford to lose his guinea in this manner; if you don't he will send for a constable. Said she, I don't care for that; Where will you send me? I am well known there, if he does: I'll keep it for a trick that I know. By that time, my wife came into the room, and said; What is all this noise here? There were eight or ten farmers by. She swore she would be d - nd if she gave it me again; and if I had her before a justice, she would swear I wanted to be bad with her; and made use of many bad, indecent words: this was before the farmers. But when she took my money, there was no body in the room but she and I, and Mr. Cook.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your guinea and shilling again?</p>
               <p>Gilbert. No, I never did. She was there three or four hours. I left Mr. Cook with her, to see if he could persuade her to let me have my money again. She told Mr. Cook, if he would do so and so to her, (meaning in her indecent language) she would give him a crown of it. Finding I could do nothing with her, I charged a constable with her.</p>
               <p>It not being a felony, but a trespass, for which he might, and was advised to, bring an action against her, she was <rs id="t17700117-23-verdict155" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am the wife of Thomas Payne. On the night of the 22nd of October, we lost three geese, one was brought back by the officer - I knew it was one we had lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long was that after you missed it? A. I saw it safe on the Saturday night, and the officer showed it me again on the Sunday night; it was then dead; it was alive when I saw it on the Saturday - the head and wing of it are here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the place in which the geese were, broken? A. Yes, the staple was drawn.</p>

            . I am an officer of South-mimms. I received information, and went to Mr. Bull's, who keeps an eating-house at Hadley, on the 23rd of October, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I found a goose dead, but quite warm - I showed it to Mr. Pitman, and then Mr. Paine; they claimed it: there were some marks of blood on the back of the neck, but none on the prisoner when I took him.</p>

            . I live at Hadley. On the 23rd of October the prisoner came to my house, about half-past one o'clock; he asked what I had done with my ducks - I said I had got rid of some, and some persons had got rid of some for me; he then asked how geese were - I said they were too dear for me; he said he knew where there were some to be had cheap - I said I supposed on the cross - he said No, it was all right, that he had them from a person he had been ditching for; I said I had no goose money - he paid for what he had, and went away: he came again in about an hour, with a goose in a sack, and asked if he could leave it there, and call for the sack by and by - he gave it to my wife, and as he passed me he said, "The goose is in that;" there was one in it, which did not appear to have been killed above ten or twelve minutes - the head was nearly severed from the body; I put it into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050101"></xptr>sack again - I afterwards delivered the same geese to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had the sack been out of your sight? A. It had not been out of my premises; he was not in the habit of selling geese; I meant by the cross, that he had come by it in a dishonest manner; I said I would have nothing to do with it, but he brought it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Had you fed and observed your geese? A. Yes; I had had them about three months - I can say, from my observation of it, this was one of mine; Southmimms is about fourteen miles from town, and Mr. Bull's is about three miles from me.</p>

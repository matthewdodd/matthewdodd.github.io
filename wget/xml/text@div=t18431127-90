                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I live in Union-place, Stepney-green. On the 18th of Nov. I was at my window about one o'clock in the day, and saw the prisoner Cundick take a sack containing oats and beans mixed, a nose<lb></lb>bag with oats, beans, and chaff, and a bag containing oats, beans, and chaff from the wagon of Mr. Matthews, and cross the road with them to his own</p>

               <p>stable—the prisoner Slaughter was at the wagon when he did it—I went over, and told Cundick he had done wrong in buying the corn of that man, which was not his own—he said he was not aware that he had done any thing wrong, and was sorry for it—I told him not to touch it till I fetched Slaughter across to the stable—I told Slaughter he had done wrong in selling his horses' provender—he said he was heartily sorry for it, and hoped I would look over it—I told him to carry the sack back to his wagon, which he did—they were taken to the station—Slaughter there said he had found the sack containing three quar<lb></lb>ters of a bushel of oats and beans as he was coming through Stratford—I sent my brother officer back to Cundick's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Ann Matthews, of East Ham. Slaughter was our carman—on Saturday the 18th, he was sent from Smith<lb></lb>field-market with three horses to get a load of manure, for which he had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he was allowed a nose-bag of corn and chaff for each horse, and a sack containing about four bushels of mixed corn and chaff—he was not allowed to barter it for dung, and save the money—in case the horses did not eat all, he should have brought it back with him, and it would be given to the horses in the stable—I saw the mixture at the station—it was the same quality which he had—the sack he had the mixed provision in belonged to my mother—the other sack was marked "S. Hammond, Upminster," to whom it belonged, but the provisions it contained was ours, and had been given out the night previous by the foreman—I have brought a sample from the granary, and compared it with what is produced—it is the same pro<lb></lb>portion of mixture and the same articles—they are white Irish oats, termed Irish birds—the beans are split, and there is a small lump of clay in them.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 3, Charles-street, Millwall, Poplar. Last Friday, I was at Brown and Lennox's anchor-manufactory, the prisoner and his brother were there—the prisoner was very much intoxicated—his brother was persuading him to go home—he would not—he said he should work it off, but instead of that he got more drink, and got very intoxicated—his brother said he should go—he did not take hold of him—he said he would not, and hit him on the head with a hammer.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon at High-street, Poplar. On Friday week I examined Benjamin Shore's head—there was a contused wound, it was not dangerous, and a small incised wound on the side of the head—there was a slight concussion of the brain from it—he recovered in a very short time—neither wound was very important.</p>

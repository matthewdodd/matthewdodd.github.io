                  </hi>. On Saturday, the 17th of September, I went into Mr. Cotton's house, in Grafton-street, Soho, between six and seven o'clock in the evening—I left my cloak in my gig, in charge of Mr. Cotton's errand-boy—I remained there about half an hour—when I came out the cloak was gone—it has never been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to my brother, in Grafton-street. On the evening of the 17th of September, I saw the prisoner at the corner of my brother's shop, which is opposite Mr. Cotton's—that induced me to watch him—I saw him looking at the gig—I went inside the shop, I never took my eyes off him—I saw him take the coat or cloak, or some<lb></lb>thing of that kind, out of the gig, and I directly ran over to Mr. Cotton</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183610240021"></xptr>
               <p>and told him of it—he run up Greek-street, and turned towards Moor-street, and there we lost sight of him—I have not the least doubt that he took it—I knew him by sight before, that induced me to give information to the police—we found out where he lived, and went to his house and look him.</p>

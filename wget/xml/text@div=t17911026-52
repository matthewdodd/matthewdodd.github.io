               <p>What sort of delicacy? - I thought that it would be the means of taking away a man's life; but on considering farther, I thought it an act of justice I owed to the public; the prisoners were committed; Mr. Wilson swore to the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>You say still you are positive now, and were positive at that time, when you saw him before the Justice, that he was the person that robbed you; though you did not chuse, on account of this sort of false delicacy, to swear to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hosty, Prisoner's Counsel. From what circumstances can you take upon you, in so short a time as one minute and an half, to swear to the prisoner? - His face is very particular; I kept my eyes particularly on his face; he had a round hat, no great coat, and came up with a pistol cocked to my side, and demanded my money; I gave them my money; Wells demanded my pocket-book and watch; I told him I had none; he said by God I had; and he clapped his hand on my thigh, and seemed satisfied; he bid me go on, and not look back; if I did, he would shoot me; I do not swear to Kingland; I never saw my purse afterwards.</p>

I believe the prisoners to be two of the men; I took particular notice at the time; and from the best of my recollection, I think they are the men; I looked at them particularly, as they came in that sort of hurry; they went up the hill, towards Watford; Mr. Foster of Harrow, was in the bar; and he came out and said, Will, these are three scampsmen; by that I understood highway-men; they came the Pinner road from Harrow Weald Common, and went up the Watford road.</p>

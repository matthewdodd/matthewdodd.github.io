                  </hi>, Esq. (Barrister-at-law). I have with me some papers in a cause of Clark <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Judkins, which was referred to me for arbitration—I produce the particulars of demand in the action, and one letter; that is the only letter—this is the order of reference—I have not got the summons—on 12th Nov. there was a meeting, at which the defendant was examined—he was sworn on the New Testament—I produce the papers which are in my possession, but I would take his Lordship's opinion whether I am bound to give any evidence of what took place, before me as arbitrator; I believe it has been held that it is a matter for the arbitrator's discretion, and, if he wishes it, the Court will not compel him to give any information of any thing that transpires before him—I think there is a case to that effect in 3 Carrington and Payne; besides, this can be proved by other witnesses—(<hi rend="smallCaps">THE RECORDER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that the evidence must be given, the note taken by the arbitrator being the best and most satisfactory evidence of what passed before him</hi>).</p>

               <p>except from hearsay; I have no knowledge of any transaction with Mr. Wright"—I have not the words, "in any way"—that is the whole of the examination, with respect to Wright's account, on that occasion—in his re-examination he said, "The letter of 7th March, 1857, I have only seen to-day."</p>

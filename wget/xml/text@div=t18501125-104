                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Morris, a master mariner, of York-square, Stepney. On 26th June I employed the female prisoner to take care of the house—on 29th July I left town—I returned on 1st Aug., remained at home till 10th Aug., then left home a second time, and returned on 27th Aug.—next day I missed some tea; a day or two after<lb></lb>wards I missed three dozen willow-pattern plates and ten dishes—on 2nd Sept. I missed six dozen sherry—I dismissed the female that even<lb></lb>ing—next day I searched and missed twenty bottles of claret, some bottles of constantia, a sheet, five table-cloths, eighteen tumblers, twenty<lb></lb>four wine glasses, six bottles of chutney, six bottles of cayenne pepper, six bottles of currie powder, six jars of preserves, and six pounds of candles—I had not given her the right to use any of them—the cupboards they were in were open, and also the wine cellar.</p>

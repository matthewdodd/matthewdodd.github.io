               <p>the 19th of Jan., I went into a public-home opposite St. Andrew's church, Holborn, a few minutes before twelve o'clock, and had some wine—the prisoner, who was there, solicited me to treat her with a glass of gin—she followed me up Holborn close behind, at my elbow, and kept asking me to treat her, and in turning up Gray's Inn-lane she was more pressing than before—I said if I was so disposed it was too late—she said she could get it at any hour at a gin-shop down the court there, and asked me to go in that direction—I did so, and at the farther end of the court is a dark passage—she immediately turned round, and said, "Come on," was not I going to have a glass of gin—I expressed a desire to return, but she immediately put one hand into my right hand waistcoat pocket, and thrust her other hand forcibly into my fob, and extracted from it a small paper parcel well bound round with thread containing eight sovereigns—it was done momentarily—I had put them into the parcel at twenty minutes past nine that night—I immediately accused her of robbing me, and got hold of her hand containing the parcel by the wrist—she made no answer till I repeated the charge, and at that same moment my hat was knocked off my head—I turned to the left, and taw I had a man to contend with—he put his right hand behind me, and the prisoner dropped the parcel containing the sovereigns into his open hand, which was beyond my elbow, so that I could see it—I still held the prisoner by the wrist—she said something to the man in a language I did not understand—I immediately collared him, at the same time holding the prisoner with my right hand—I called "Police" repeatedly—nobody came at the moment, but five other men came from the opposite side of the court the instant I hallooed, and commenced a furious attack on me with their fists right and left, and succeeded in libe<lb></lb>rating the two prisoners from me—the prisoner said something to the men which I did not understand, and they immediately set off running out of sight—she followed them, and I followed her—a policeman came and took her at the turn of the court—at the station I missed my pocket-book from my inside coat pocket.</p>

I thought he wanted to go up George-yard, and made way for him. He snatched my watch from my fob, I saw it in his hand. He ran off and I lost him, as three others pushed me into the road. I had a good view of him from the gas-light, and am certain he is the man. I gave information to two officers. I heard three persons were to be examined at Bow-street on the Thursday following. I went there, and saw the prisoner in the office as a spectator, and desired the officer to take him. I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Are you sure of him - A. I had a full view of him, I cannot be mistaken. I knew him directly I saw him in the office, and said so as soon as Jefferson came in.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took three men the day the King was proclaimed, and sent for the prosecutor to see them. The prisoner came into the office, as his brother was in custody - he came forward to bail him. The prosecutor said he was the man who had robbed him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever see a man very like the prisoner - A. Yes, as much like him as two peas. I believe that man was once in Newgate for stealing a watch. I knew the prisoner to bear a good character.</p>

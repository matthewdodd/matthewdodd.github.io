               <p>I am servant to Mr. Livies; on the 30th of December, my master lost eight silver table spoons , value 3 l. they were in the back parlour; the green grocer came with some potatoes, and told me, there was a basket that had been left a few days before; I went down stairs with the potatoes, to bring up the basket, but I did not see any; I ran up stairs again, and I saw the prisoner at the bar running along the passage, and putting his hand under his coat-like; with that I got the glimpse of silver; so I thought he had been about no good, as he had no business in the house; I left the green grocer at the door when I went down stairs, but he was gone to the opposite side; I cried out, Stop thief! and ran as hard as I could; and I heard something fall; I instantly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150066"></xptr> came up to it, and found eight table spoons, my master's property; I left the green grocer in pursuit of the man; he took him, and I carried the spoons home, and took the prisoner to a justice: I am sure of the man; there was nobody between him and me: I did not see him drop the spoons, but I heard them drop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You gave evidence before the justice, I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you or not there say, that you saw any thing like silver about him? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Or did you say, that you apprehended you saw something white about his coat? I said something of the glimpse of silver.</p>
               <p>You did not see him dispossess himself of any thing? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>What did you do with these spoons that were found? - I carried them home directly.</p>
               <p>Where did you put them? - In the room they were taken from.</p>
               <p>You did not carry them that day to the justices? - No.</p>
               <p>Were you asked for them? - I was.</p>
               <p>What account did you give? - That I could not be positive to them all, but to one I could, it was more battered than the rest.</p>
               <p>(The spoon produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I am a green grocer; I saw the prisoner run out of the house, and the last witness came out after him; I pursued the prisoner and took him; I did not see the spoons dropped; I saw them lay on the ground, and the last witness pick them up.</p>
               <p>- RUSSEL sworn.</p>
               <p>Did you see the two last witnesses in pursuit of the prisoner? - Yes, I was standing on Monday the 29th of last month, at my mistress's door in Portland-street, taking some things from a mantua maker; I saw the prisoner come round; and there being a cry of Stop thief! he made a bit of a stop, and threw something down; I saw it white in the end; the first witness was just at the corner, and he put his hand on the rails, to keep himself from falling; I saw the prisoner part with something from his hands; there was no other person between the prisoner and the servant; he took them up in the very same spot, in less than half a minute, and then I saw that they were spoons: I did not see that they were spoons, when the man dropped them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Nor what it was that he put down, you could not tell at that time? - No, only that it appeared white.</p>

               <p>I was walking along up Portland-street, by the chapel; I heard a cry of, Stop thief! I walked, not ran; but walked on, and I was stopped by two men, neither of them were these gentlemen; one said to the other, this is not the man; and they asked my pardon, and quitted me; I walked on very easy; then these gentlemen came up, and said, they should stop me; and I was brought before a magistrate; but neither of these men stopped me; but the men that stopped me, acquitted me, because several people said, I was not the person.</p>

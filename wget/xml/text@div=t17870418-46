               <p>I was coming along Cheapside, on Friday the 13th of April, about half past eight, or rather more, between that and nine, I stopped by chance to look in at Mr. Eagleton's window; and a man came to me with a bag across his shoulders, and said to me, that teas are much cheaper than they were, he was in the street, I did not take notice of him before; I looked at him very hard; and he said, do you think you should know us again? I looked round towards the door of the shop; and I saw the prisoner standing at the door; and a man a little further on with a knot across his shoulders, then I watched them; and I crossed the way, and went a little way further down towards Bow-church on the other side of the way, then I turned again, and came almost opposite the shop, when I got almost opposite the shop, I saw the prisoner coming out with a parcel of tea, he came to a man about three yards from the door, who had a knot, I suppose him to be the same man I saw before with the knot, he returned into the shop, and came out again with another parcel, when he was coming out, there was a man and a woman selling nuts and oranges, I spoke to the man and told him; by that time they were both turned down Pread street, and were gone, the man that was selling nuts blamed me for not speaking sooner; however, in two or three or four minutes they all three came again, the prisoner walked backwards and forwards several times, at last they all three came across the way, the prisoner I believe bought a half penny worth of nuts, the other bought an orange, the man I spoke to fixed himself up against one of the houses, then they all three went over directly; and they all walked backwards and forwards two or three times; and the prisoner went into the shop again, and brought out another bag, then the man that sold the nuts and me both took hold of him, a mob got round us, we never quitted him, we seized him while he had the bag in his hand, we brought him into the shop, the bag was put into the constable's hands, the bag that was delivered to the constable was the same I took from the prisoner.</p>

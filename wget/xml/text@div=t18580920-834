                  </hi>. I am a traveller, and live at 7, Worship-street, Finsbury. About half-past eleven o'clock on 2d September, I was in Bishopsgate-street, and saw the prisoner there—I was returning home; I called at a public-house at the corner of Acorn-street to have a glass of ale—whilst there I noticed the prisoner standing in front of the bar, and another woman near to her; they went out, and when I had finished my ale I walked outside, and the prisoner and the other woman were standing outside—they asked me if I would treat them; I said "No," as I was going home—the other woman pushed me, and immediately she did so the prisoner put her hand in my pocket—I felt her hand come out of my pocket, and immediately seized hold of her, and found the purse in her hand; I called out "Police"—I had seen one on the other side; he crossed over; previous to his coming over, about 7 or 8 persons surrounded me; the prisoner caught hold of my whiskers, I gave her in charge—I had some loose silver in my pocket, perhaps to the amount of 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the purse contained 2 half-crowns and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which was my own, the other belonged to my employers—I took the purse from her hand, and gave it to the officer—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the purse.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not from the other woman's hand you took it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, from this woman's—it was not the other woman that put her hand in my pocket; the prisoner was in the act of handing it to the other woman, when I caught hold of her hand—I said so before the Lord Mayor. I am a commercial traveller, I travel in London and suburbs, about 8 or 10 miles out of London—I travel for James Bates, of Norton Folgate, tobacco and cigar manufacturer—I have been travelling for him for some time; I had been so that day—I went into the public-house to have a glass of ale—there was no one else there, in the apartment I went into—I first saw the two women standing in front of the bar—there</p>

               <p>was not one word between us in front of the bar—I will swear that I said nothing whatever to them—immediately I went outside the door, they were standing outside the door, and they asked me if I would treat them; I said "No," I wanted to go home; that was the first time that any conversation took place between us—I had not taken my purse out while I was inside the house—I had some loose silver in my pocket, and there was no occasion to take my purse out—I sometimes mix my own money and my employer's money together; I very often have to give change—it was my own money in the purse; that in my pocket was perhaps some my own, and some my employer's—I generally do carry my own money in my purse, but I have to give change perhaps 20 times a day, and if I have not change of my employer's, I take it out of my purse—I dare say plenty around us saw the purse in this woman's hand—I don't know whether any of them are here; when the policeman came they all ran away—I heard her say at the station-house that she never had my purse—I think the first time I heard her deny it, was at the station-house; I am not quite sure; perhaps she might have told the policeman, I did not hear any<lb></lb>thing about that—I will swear that she did not say so the moment t the policeman came up, in my hearing—there were perhaps 6 or 7 people got round me immediately—I don't know what became of the other woman; she went away, I suppose, when she saw the policeman, as the others did—I had been in about 3 public-houses from about 6 o'clock, and had a glass of ale in each of them—I will swear I had not been in more than three—I cannot swear how many I bad been into in the day, because my customers are in public-houses, and I have a number of public-houses to go into; but I have no occasion to drink in all; sometimes I go to as many as 30 public-houses a day—I will swear I had not been in 30 public-houses that day—I might have been in ten—I don't believe I was in fifteen—I can't say how many I had been drinking in—perhaps I might have had something else besides ale that day; I cannot distinctly say; all I know is, I was quite sober at the time the purse was taken—there were 2 half-crowns in the purse—I put them in some time during the day or evening, and left the other loose in my pocket—some of it was my employer's, I cannot under<lb></lb>take to swear it was all my employer's—I always keep my own money in my purse, unless I require it for change—I did not see the prisoner searched; I believe she handed the policeman the money immediately she went inside, from what I have heard—the other woman must have gone away, or I should have charged her.</p>

On 2nd September about half-past 11, I was in Bishopsgate-street—I saw a crowd collected—I went up and saw the prisoner and prosecutor struggling together; she had got the prosecutor by the whiskers holding him, and he had got her by the arm; I asked what was the matter, he said she had robbed him—I asked him how, in what way; he said she took it out of his pocket, and he seized the purse in her hand, and he took the purse from her hand—he had the purse in his hand when I came up, which he had taken from her—he handed the purse to me—she said that she had not taken the purse—I took her into custody—she had nothing in her hand—she put her hand in his pocket</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

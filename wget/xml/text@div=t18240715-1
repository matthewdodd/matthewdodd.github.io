On the 10th of June, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went to the table drawer and took out my keys, and found I could not unlock the drawer of my writing desk, but upon pulling it it opened. I found it was unlocked; I had left it locked. I had left three 5 l. Bank notes there, and missed one. The prisoner was my servant; I called him up stairs in five minutes, and asked if he knew the key of my writing desk - he said he did not; I said I could swear that it had been opened, and a 5 l. note taken out; he said he knew nothing at all about it. I said nothing more at that time, but went to town on business, and took the two 5 l. notes with me. I returned next day, and on the road to the barracks met him going to Hounslow - he had been sent for my luggage - he saluted me and went on, and on getting to my room Hunt stated something, and when the prisoner returned with my carpet bag, I asked if he recollected what I had told him the day before, respecting my desk having been opened, and losing a 5 l. note; he said he did - I asked if he had never opened the desk, and seen any 5 l. notes; he said he could not read; I said,</p>
               <p>"How can you tell such a falsehood, knowing as you do, that you have opened my desk, and have seen the notes" - he said he had forgotten to mention that circumstance to me the day before. I said, then probably he had forgotten something else, and had better recollect himself. He went to Hounslow that evening, and next morning, after having seen him, I went to Hester, the publican, and there saw a 5 l. note, No. 4752, which is mine, and one of the three which I had received from an agent; I know it by the number; they were not running numbers. I returned to the barracks, and told him I had discovered that he had changed a note with Hester - he seemed confused, and said nothing - he was then confined. I produce the note.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. You gave me a 5 l. note to get changed - A. That was on the 9th of May. I had originally received four 5 l. notes, and on the 9th of May gave him one of them to pay Hunt 1 l. 0 s. 8 d.; he brought me back four 1 l. country notes - and on the 17th I paid another of the notes to one of the officers. Between the 17th of May and the 7th of June I received another 5 l. note from an officer of the regiment, and put it into the drawer with the other two.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long before the 10th of June had you seen the three 5 l. notes - A. I cannot say my Lord. I think the third note was paid me about the 25th or 26th of May - the other two were safe then. I had no occasion to take either of them out afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You gave me a second note, and I brought you four sovereigns and silver in change - Witness. I gave him only one, and received no change but what I have mentioned.</p>

            . I wash for the prosecutor, and clean his room. One day in April, about a month or five weeks before the note was missed, I was in the room; Robinson came in; he took the bunch of keys, and opened the desk - he tried several keys before he could open it - I believe he took the keys from the table drawer, but cannot tell; he opened the desk at last, and called me to look at the notes - I saw some 5 l. notes, but how many I could not tell; there was more than one. I begged of him to put them up again; he did so, and locked the desk as I thought. I mentioned this to Mr. Dawn when the note was missed. I did not see him at the desk at any other time.</p>

            . I keep a public-house at Hounslow. The prisoner came to me on a Saturday in June - it was a day or two before I saw Mr. Dawn; he came for change for a 5 l. note; I was very busy, and said I could not give him change, not having time to go up stairs - he asked me to give him part, and he would call for the rest on Sunday; I gave him 20 s.; he left the note, and had the rest on Sunday. I put the note into my desk; I had other 5 l. notes there, and do not know that from any other, as I had given a serjeant change for a 5 l. note on the same day, and cannot distinguish the two. Mr. Dawn came and enquired about it a few days after - I fetched him down all the Bank notes I had. I put three down; he said neither of those was his; I then put down two, one of which I received from the prisoner, and the other from the serjeant. I had put these two by separate from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150004"></xptr>the others, but I do not know which of them I had from the prisoner. Mr. Dawn claimed one of them - he had a paper with three or four numbers on it.</p>
               <p>MR. DAWN. Here is the note; it is one of those I received, and I believe it is the one taken from my drawer.</p>

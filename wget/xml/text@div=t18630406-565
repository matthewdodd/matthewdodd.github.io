                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Forrester, of 4, George-street, Locks-fields, Walworth—on the night of 12th March, I was going along Tower-street with Mrs. Wright—the prisoner Shee rushed out of a public-house, and acted in a very indecent manner towards a man—I passed a remark upon it, and she followed and struck me, and then ran into a public-house—she called to Sweeney, who came out and struck me—the two of them then knocked me down on the ground, and Shee stabbed me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186304060026"></xptr>
               <p>in the head with a knife—I bled a good deal—the policeman took me to Guy's Hospital—I became insensible in the public-house—when Shee stabbed me, my companion, Mrs. Wright, was struggling with Sweeney to keep her away, or she would have done the same, and she bit Mrs. Wright through the arm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Sweeney. Q.</hi> When you and my sister were entangled with each other, did not you cling in her hair and pull her down on the ground, and were you not biting each other, and I came to separate you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not attack them at all; Mrs. Wright only pulled her off me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Shee. Q.</hi> What did I stab you with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A knife; I did not swear that I saw the knife, but Mrs. Wright did—she is not here—I felt the effect of something sharp in my head, and I have the doctor's certificate—I was not taken into the hospital; the doctor dressed my head, and allowed me to go home—the wounds were not very serious—there were three—they bled very much.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 563). I was called on about 11 o'clock on the night in question, hearing a cry of police; when I arrived at the door of the King's Head, I found the prosecutrix bleeding very much from the head—I asked who did it—the prisoners were not there then, but in a minute or two they made their appearance, and Shee said, "I have given it to her"—the prosecutrix charged them with stabbing her in the head—I held them for a short time—Shee got away from me, and a brother constable brought her back—I did not find any knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see what sort of wounds they were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; my brother constable took her to the hospital—he is not here—she was bleeding a good deal; her forehead and the side of her face were covered with blood—I saw Mrs. Wright.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Sweeney. Q.</hi> Did not I give the prosecutrix in charge to you, and did not you say, "I will not take her; I have you this time?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> you did propose to give the prosecutrix in charge, but seeing the marks of violence upon the prosecutrix, I said you must all go to the station—I did not see any marks of violence upon either of the prisoners—I saw that you had a black eye in the morning—your things were torn by my holding you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Shee. Q.</hi> When did you first bear about the knife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard that she was stabbed when I took you into custody—I did not hear what it was with—Mrs. Wright said, at the station, that it was with a knife—I said to the policeman who let you go, "You fool, what made you let her go?" but he did not let you go willingly; you slipped from him, and ran into the public-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner Shee in her defence stated, that the prosecutrix had insulted and struck her, upon which the fetched Sweeney to take her part, and they struggled together, but used no knife.</hi>

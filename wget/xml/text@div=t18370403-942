                  </hi>. I am butler to Lady Ann Isabella Noel Byron. The prisoner was her housemaid—on the 14th of March I had information that the bad a quantity of soap concealed in her box—I wrote to Lady Byron, and had directions to examine her box—I believe the box was hers—she first owned it, and then said it was not hers—I found a quantity of soap—the policeman has it here—it is the sort of soap that is usually given out by the housekeeper for the use of the town-house—I have reason to believe that it is Lady Byron's soap, but I cannot swear to it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-serjeant T</hi> 19.) About six o'clock in the evening, of the 20th of March, I went to Lady Byron's house with the prisoner, to search her boxes—I asked which were hers—she pointed ont two—I searched in one, and found the 1/2 lb. of sugar—in the other I found nothing—there was another box close by—I asked if it was hers—she said no, it belonged to the kitchenmaid—I was rather suspicious that it was, here, and while I was searching it, she said it was hers—in that box. I found the soap produced—she began to cry very much, and begged the butler to forgive her, she said the had taken some part of it, which she had given to the washerwoman to wash her clothes, and the other part was given to her for the house.</p>

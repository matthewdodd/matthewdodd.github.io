                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, in Ingram-court, Fenchurch-street, and trade under the name of Richard Simmonds and Son.

Sim<lb></lb>monds to be sued on this bill—my father is not alive now—I signed my name to the dissolution—the prisoner has not since claimed to be a partner—there are no outstanding debts now that were due when he was a partner—I know of no circumstance by which the prisoner could have supposed he was entitled to use my name—I have not quarrelled with him—we have always been on good terms as brothers—there is no Thomas Read, jun.—I am quite sure that I had nothing whatever to do with this—he was never authorised to make any purchase for us up to July, 1850—he only looked to the books, and took orders—he used to receive money, and pay anything I told bim—I paid him nothing—he has never drawn, endorsed, or accepted bills for us—my partner is not here.</p>

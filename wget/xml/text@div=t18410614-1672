On the evening of the 16th of June, I was in Fleet-street—I felt myself bustled, turned round, and missed my handkerchief—I saw the prisoner Harris behind me, and taxed him with having robbed me—he denied it, and at the same moment my handkerchief dropped from behind him—I stooped to take it up, and at the same moment he ran off—there was a cry of "Stop thief," and he was taken by the officer—there were two behind me in company—I could not be quite positive of Elliot being the other—Harris's hand was behind him at the time the handkerchief dropped.</p>

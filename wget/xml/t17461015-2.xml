               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Hendley. I went up, Sir, into the House to take my Hemp to put about me to work, and the said

               <p>Q. What was the Consequence of letting off the Gun ?</p>
               <p>Heddley . It was the Death of the Man; the Man dropt at his Feet.</p>

            .) What have you to say against the Prisoner at the Bar with Respect to the Fact?</p>
               <p>Baker. As I was going into the Rope-Walk, I saw a Stranger bring the Gun in; Mr. Wallis takes the Gun to look at it; it was a Gun that unskrew'd . The Man pulled the Rammer out of his Pocket, for there was no Place in the Gun to put the Rammer in; so he folds it together again, and puts it into his Pocket. I watch'd it all the while, as he was turning of it about. The Man that owned the Gun stood with his Back to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it levelled at any body?</p>
               <p>Baker. I believe the Deceased had his Face near to it. The Prisoner is a Man that bears as good a Character as any Working-Man whatever.</p>

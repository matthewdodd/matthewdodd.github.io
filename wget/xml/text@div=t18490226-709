                  </hi> I am the wife of George Chandler, who kept a beer-shop, at Beckett's-place, in the parish of St. Mary Abbott's, Kensington. I kept my cash-box locked on the sideboard in my bed-room—on 17th Feb., I went to it at about twelve o'clock in the day, and took a shilling's worth of halfpence from it—I noticed a peculiar halfpenny there, put it back again, and locked the box—there were two sovereigns, one half-sovereign, fifteen shillings, two fourpenny bits, seventeen pence in halfpence, and some arti<lb></lb>cles besides in the box—I left it on the sideboard—I had occasion to go to it again about-five—it was then safe as when I left it at twelve—when I left I shut the door, but I cannot say whether I locked it or not—I went up to bed at about twenty minutes to eleven, was going to put some money into the box, and found it was gone.</p>

On 17th Feb., between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was talking to Ryan, and she called my attention to Price—he went across the road towards Lord Holland's gate, passed there towards Hammersmith, then turned back, and went up Lord Holland's-lane, which is the new park—he had something under his coat, but 1 could not see what it was.</p>

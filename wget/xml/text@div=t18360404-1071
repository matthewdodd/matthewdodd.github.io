               <p>Islington. On the afternoon of the 2nd of March, I was at the top of Park-street, Islington, between half-past five and six o'clock—I saw the deceased stooping in the gutter, on the right hand side of the way—not the side on which a carriage should drive which was coming down the street—I observed a dray by one horse, coming from the Back-road—it turned into Park-street, and was coming at a fast trot, on its wrong side—the child was in the gutter, and knocked down either by the horse or the dray—the boy's back was towards the dray—he would not have any notice that it was coming—when the dray had passed, the boy's legs were in the gutter, and I picked him up—he was standing about ten yards from the top of Park-street—the drive was sitting on the cross-bar, in front of the dray, on his left side—he bore towards the left—he had the reins in his hand—he did not appear to have the command of the horse; and, in consequence of that, the horse bore towards the improper side, the right, side—I picked up the boy, and took him to a surgeon's at the end of Park-street—all the child said was, "On"—that was after the dray had left him—I remained at the surgeon's few minutes, and the boy died before I left him—I did not notice whether the horse went at the same pace after this—it did not stop; but I did not notice at what rate it proceeded—the prisoner was brought to the surgeon's—the surgeon said something to him, that the had killed the child—I do not recollect that the prisoner said any thing to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a writing clerk, and live in Richard-street, Is<lb></lb>lington. About half-past five o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, the 2nd of March, I was in the Back-road, and saw a dray just as it entered Park-street—I saw the driver sitting on the left of the dray, on one of the cross<lb></lb>bars, I believe the shafts—when the day had passed, I saw a child laying in the road, with a basked, and I believe, a loaf of bread—the dray had passed over the child—when I first noticed the dray it was going at a sharp trot; but after the accident from the sound of the horse's hoofs, it must have been in a gallop or canter—it did not stop at all—the witness was in the act of taking the child up, when I came to him—the boy was knocked down on the right-hand side of the street—that was the wrong side for the dray to have going.</p>

               <p>the deceased boy opposite my house—i afterwards found him in the arms of Cooper he was stunned at the time—I observed the dray, drawn by one horse, going down the street, at about six miles an hour, about the pace of an ordinary carriage—i called to the driver to stop, but could not make him hear—I do not think he heard me—he got to Cross-street, which is about a quarter of a mile, before I stopped him—I followed him immediately—he appeared to have no difficulty in stopping the horse when I made him hear—there was another carriage before him at that moments—the prisoner was the driver of the dray—I told him he had run over a child, and desired him turn back—he rather refused at first—he was not willing to come back—he afterwards went to Mr. Burrows, at the corner of Park-street—as we were going along, he said he would serve me out for it, for stopping him—the boy died while we were at Mr. Burrows'—the prisoner appeared tipsy—he did not express any regret in my presence—i did not hear it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Park-street, Islington, and in a surgeon, Between five and six o'clock in the afternoon of the 2nd of March, a boy was brought to my surgery by Cooper, insensible, and in a dying condition—he died in about a quarter of an hour, in my surgery—I examined the body the next day—his death was caused by two fractured ribs on the right side; the lower portion of the right lung was broken, from which had run out twelve ounces of blood into the cavity of the chest—those appearances were quite sufficient to cause death—there was not suf<lb></lb>ficient external contusion for the wheel of the dray to have done it—I think it was from the foot of the horse on the back of the child—its face was covered with dirt, as if pressed downwards—the prisoner came in before he died—I asked him his name—he said his name could be of no consequence, and he would not tell it me—I asked him if the dray was his—he said it was—I said, "I rather doubt it, who is your master?"—he said, "My master can be known as well as myself"—I said, if he did not tell me, he must tell some other person, and I should give him in charge of the police—I sent for a policeman, and one came—the prisoner said if I had asked him for his name in a proper manner, he should have told me—I had asked him very civilly—he was tipsy—I have no doubt he was quite tipsy—his eyes flushed, and his countenance and manner indicated he was under the influence of strong drink—the boy was identi<lb></lb>fied in my presence, by Soall, the father.</p>

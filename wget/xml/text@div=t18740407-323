                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 80, Cornwall Road, Lambeth—about the beginning of February I let my back room first floor to the prisoners—they told me they were brothers, and said they were night printers—they brought two boxes and occupied the same room—on the night of the 21st February, my daughter called me and I went into the prisoners' room—I found the drawers broken open and everything in the shape of wearing apparel and linen removed—the drawers had all been locked, with the exception of one small drawer, which I gave them for their things—the value of the property which I lost was about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sent to the station, and Davis, a detective came—Johnson returned about 12 o'clock, when the officer was in the house—I said "You cruel young man, you have robbed me"—he looked at me and said "Me robbed you, I have not robbed you, I would not do so, for you have been so kind, and what my brother has done I can't help"—the officer spoke to him then—the officer had been into the room and searched the boxes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness—on the night of 21st February, Simpson came and paid me a washing bill—about 8 o'clock I heard somebody walking about in their room—I can't say whether it was before or after he came and paid me—I heard someone go into the hall and return to the room, and afterwards I heard somebody go out of the street door about 9 o'clock—about 10 o'clock I went to the room for something I wanted, and found it all in confusion—I called my mother.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Simpson. Q.</hi> How long was it before I came and paid you the washing bill. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think twenty minutes at least—you were in the house about 7.30, and you went out sometime after 8 o'clock—after you paid me the washing you may not have been in the house a quarter of an hour, but you were in some time before you came down and paid me—my mother allowed your brother a key—I never let you in.</p>

I was called to Mrs. Mitchell's at 10.30., on the 21st February—I went to the first floor back room and saw two boxes containing house-breaking implements—I produce them—there is a lantern, two screw-drivers, and a chisel, and these skeleton keys were found between the bed and the mattress—these two knives were found on Johnson—I waited until he came in, about 12 o'clock—I asked him which was his box, he said "I have no box here"—I called his attention to the two boxes in the room, he said "Those are our boxes"—prior to that I found that every chest of drawers had been forced open and ransacked—I told him he would be charged with stealing a quantity of linen from Mrs. Mitchell—he said "I know who you are"—I took him into custody—I found a box on him containing one small match.</p>

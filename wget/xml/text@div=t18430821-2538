                  </hi>. I deal in glass, and carry on business in Rosemary-lane. The prisoner was my journeyman—the glasses which are the subject of this charge were kept up one pair of stairs in the glass-room—he would have ready, access to that room I put great confidence in him—on the 17th the had to go out with some pattern glasses—I ordered him to get his patterns ready, which he did while I was at breakfast—when I returned he had got his basket ready—I told him to wait a minute, and to get two old patterns of blue cups and saucers to take to another person—while he was doing that I put my finger into his basket, and found there was something—I said, "Never mind that, we shall have some more"—I went to the end of the shop, and called out, "How many patterns have you got?"—he said twenty-nine—he then left, and I followed him—when I got to North East-passage, Wel<lb></lb>close-square, I saw a policeman—I desired him to go and stop the prisoner—he stopped and asked what he had got in his basket—he said, "Nothing but some patterns"—I felt in his basket, and said, "You may take him to the station"—when we got there I examined the basket, and found twenty-nine patterns, and these eighteen publicans' dram glasses—he said it was a trick, that any of the men in the house would hang him, and some of them had put them there—these are the glasses—there are three different sizes, six of each—they were at the bottom of his basket—he could not have put the twenty<lb></lb>nine patterns in without knowing these were there.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Botolph. I went to the prosecutor's premises on Tuesday, the 14th of July, at a quarter past seven o'clock in the morning - the adjoining house was empty; I examined and found an opening in the wall, so that a boy or man could get through - the partition had been bored by a centre-bit, in the first instance; there were about three holes made in the wooden part of the partition, and then I think it must have been cut by a knife - I think I could get through the hole myself; the wall was first cut away, and then this wooden partition bored and cut with a knife - I found there a small jemmy, a gimblet, a chisel, centre-bit, and stock; knife, a dark lantern, an old key, and an apron - they a were on a shelf in the empty house, over the hole, which was quite large enought to get the property through.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I take it for granted you made diligent inquiries in the neighbourhood to discover the thieves? A. I made no inquiries - I did not find a man named Vaughan in the empty house; I only know he was at Worship-street - I believe he was charged with stealing the fixtures of the empty house, but I do not think I heard the charge; I was in another room - I heard him examined on suspicion of being a swindler; I did not examine to see if the fixtures of the empty house had been taken away - I know Vaughan and Wear had taken that empty house before, but only from information- I do not know of their being charged with this robbery; I was not in the office - I was in the room, but do not know what the charge was; I was only called to give evidence of what I found, and know nothing of others being charged with the robbery.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Botolph. Mr. Wilson's premises are on my beat; I was on duty early on the morning of the 14th of July - I know the prisoner Chick, and saw him that morning, between half-past four and five o'clock, standing with his back towards Mr. Wilson's premises, and near it there is a gateway within one house, and he was near the gateway, as near as I can say fifty paces distance; I suppose he was within three or four yards of Wilson's premises; I did not see him do any thing, he was standing still when I first saw him, and at other times walking he walked towards me - when I saw him start for walking: he passed quite close to me - we passed each other; the gas was not alight, it was quite daylight, a bright morning between half-past four and five o'clock; I have not the least doubt he is the man I saw.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you known him? A. I did not know him before the 14th of July - I never saw him before to my knowledge; I do not know Vaughan; I do my duty as well as I can - I looked after the empty house that night the same as the rest of the premises; I saw it was fast - I have no box - I have a seat within fifty paces of Mr. Wilson's; I go out of the street to the back and front of the premises on that side, and that is all I have to do; I do not know a person named Wear, and do not know of the empty house being taken - I did not see any body go in there that morning, nor ever said I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you swear deliberately that you never said before the Justice the person you saw with his back to the premises was Vaughan? A. I do not understand you; I never said I saw Vaughan, or that I believed it to be Vaughan, or that I would not swear it was Chick; he was in my sight five minutes from my first seeing him till he passed me - he went towards Crown-street and I towards Mr. Wilson's; he was standing still when I first saw him - there were other people passing and re-passing that morning, but not at that time to my knowledge; I do not recollect seeing any body from half-past four o'clock till five; I saw Chick, he was the only person on that side of the way - I had seen other persons pass in the night; I came on at three o'clock, and saw several people going to market.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you observe Chick particularly? A. Yes; because he observed me - he looked me full in the face as he passed, and of course I looked him full in the face; I have not the least doubt of him - I knew him as soon as I went into the office.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know who the empty house belonged to? A. No; Mr. Collins, the butcher, had the letting of it - I do not know that it had been let.</p>

            . I am single. On the 14th of July I lived with Mr. Grimsell, at No. 2, Sun-street; I got up about a quarter-past five o'clock that morning - Mr. Wilson's house is nearly opposite ours; I was opening the parlour shutters, and observed a man passing on Mr. Wilson's side of the way - the street is about thirty feet wide; I observed the person distinctly, and believe Chick to be the man - when I first opened the shutters he was passing Mr. Wilson's house; as he passed the next house to Mr. Wilson's some other man came out of the empty house; I have a recollection of that man's person, it was not the prisoner Elliott - Chick passed the empty house, and the other man followed him directly - they went towards Bishopsgate-street, one following close to the other; they did not appear to be talking; I saw them go not quite to the end of Sun-street towards Bishopsgate; I then lost sight of them - I afterwards saw the same persons again coming down in the same direction towards Wilson's house; I am quite sure they were the same two persons - I saw them go into the empty house, and while they were in there a cart drew up to the door of the empty house - I saw four large bundles put into the cart by the same two men, and they drove away directly; there was a man in the cart, he did not get out - the cart went towards Bishopsgate-street; I have no recollection of the driver's person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It has been said you have sworn to Chick? A. I have not sworn to him, I cannot, but I believe him to be the man as far as I know; I had never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100060"></xptr>seen him before to my knowledge; I have seen Vaughan and Wear at Worship-street in custody - I saw one of them in Mr. Wilson's shop; I do not know where I saw the other first; I think not more than five minutes elapsed from the time I saw the man I suppose to be Chick, till the two men returned to the cart; the watchman was off his beat at the time - it was a fine bright morning; I had seen Vaughan and Wear bargaining for the house one evening, it was too dark to discern much of them; they were not charged with the felony in my presence - it was for removing the fixtures of the empty house that I saw them in custody; they were not removed till after the 14th, for they moved into the house after the robbery; I saw them bargaining for the house on the Friday before the robbery - they did not move in till after it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. In consequence of information I went to a house. No. 28, Vincent-street, Bethnal Green, on the 17th of July, with Garton and Attfield, between twelve and one o'clock in the day; I went into the parlour by breaking the door open, and found in that parlour Chick and his wife and a woman named Dobson - I knew Chick before, and am certain of him; on a table in the room I found two pieces of silk serge, which I produce - also on the left side of the room six pieces of different coloured silk, mostly for waistcoats; some were on the floor, and some on a yard measure - Garton found some pieces of ribbon and ferret - we made a further search; Attfield, in my presence, found in a cupboard two skeleton keys, and in the table drawer a quantity of small files, a centre-bit and screw-driver - he has them in his possession; the outer door was open - we did not ask leave to go in, but broke in, that we might enter without giving notice; Attfield asked Chick how he came by this property - he said he should tell somebody else about that, or words to that effect; we took them all in custody - Dobson was afterwards discharged; between six and seven o'clock the same evening we went to No. 26, Vincent-street, and found the lower room open - nobody was in it at the time; it is next door but one to Chick's - I know it was Elliott's house, for I saw Mrs. Elliott afterwards, and asked if that was her room, the parlour; she said it was - they were not there when I went in; Attfield found some silk there in a bonnet-box, and Vann, who was with us, found some cloth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Chick was asked how he came by the silk, and said he should tell somebody else? A. Yes; I have a full recollection of what passed - that is all the conversation I took notice of; I had known Dobson for three or four years, and often saw her before - I cannot swear how she gets her living.</p>
               <p>Q. When Attfield asked Chick how he came by the silk, did he not point out Dobson as the woman who had brought it in, and that within ten minutes of that time? A. No, he said nothing of the sort in my hearing, I swear; he could not have said it without my hearing it. I never paid Mrs. Dobson any money in my life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You went to Elliott's six hours after Chick's, from whose house you had taken property? A. Yes, in bundles; the street was full of people when we brought the property away; it was well known in the neighbourhood that the officers had taken property from a house two doors from Elliott's- no opposition was made to our searching Elliott's, for nobody was in the room; we searched thoroughly - there were three of us; I have heard Mrs. Elliott is a dressmaker - the silk was in different pieces, as if for dresses, and in the progress of making up - it was cut, and part of a body made; the first examination had been that day - it was over when we went to Elliott's; we had not got information about Elliott till after the examination - I believe Attfield left word for Mrs. Elliott to attend the office on the Saturday; there was no examination on Saturday - I saw Mrs. Elliott at the office on Saturday, but did not see her husband; whether a message was left for him to come I cannot say; Mrs. Elliott was not detained - the next examination was on the Wednesday following; Mrs. Elliott was told to attend, and she did so - I did not see her husband there till I saw him at the bar of the office; that was at the second examination.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On Friday, the 17th of July, in consequence of information, I went with Brown to No. 28, Vincent-street; Garton came immediately after - we burst open the door, and found Chick, his wife, and Dobson in the room; I found a mallet, a hummer, a pair of pincers, seven or eight files, a latch, two skeleton keys for an inner door(Mr. Wilson gave me the centre-bit); some silk and ribbon were found by Brown - we went to Elliott's between four and five o'clock that afternoon, and in a sort of hat or bonnet box in the back part of the parlour I found about sufficient silk to make two gowns, and Vann found some cloth at the bottom of the same box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where did you find the silk and ribbon at Chick's? A. About the room, in different parts; some on the table and some on a measure - I knew Dobson; they are weavers by trade, but what else she does I do not exactly know; she was brought to the office, and held to bail; Vaughan and Wear were at the office, but I know very little of them; I only knew of their having taken the house from hearsay- they were charged on suspicion of being concerned in this robbery, and examined twice; they were charged with taking away the fixtures of the empty house, I understand - I cannot say whether they were in possession of the empty house on the night of the robbery; after I had done searching, I said to Chick, "How came you in possession of this property?" Dobson was in the room; his answer was, "I decline giving any account till I go before a Magistrate;" he looked round when I asked how he became possessed of it, and said, "The piping dues are on," meaning somebody had been giving information, and they would get paid handsomely for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about Mrs. Dobson? A. I am not certain that he did - I never heard him state that she had brought the silk in a bundle a few minutes before I came in - he asked me if there was any reward; none had been offered to my knowledge; I know nothing of 10l. having been given to Mrs. Dobson - she lives in Cock-lane, Bethnal-green; all that neighbourhood is a common resort for thieves.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100061"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you happen to know Mrs. Elliott is a dress-maker? A. From what I have heard; I found the silk partly made up; I saw Mrs. Elliott in a neighbouring house some time after we had taken the property out of their room, she was crying; I had left a message for her to come to the office next day, and she did; she was desired to attend another examination, and did; at the last examination but one she was attending, and was ordered into custody; her husband was there on the 22nd, which was the last examination but one; he came voluntarily - I was sent to the public-house; I went and called Elliott. he came to me directly, and I took him into custody; I asked Mrs. Elliott how she became possessed of the property on the very night when I saw her crying; she was alone; I asked her how she came by the silk found in her room; she said Mrs. Chick had given it to her to make up into dresses, and I believe she has told that story ever since - I do not remember her husband saying he had been dining with his club on the night of the robbery.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever heard of piping dues before? A. Never; it was a new term I thought - he said it a little time after I asked how he came by the property; Mrs. Dobson was let go by the Magistrate; she attended again, and gave bail to appear at the Session if any indictment should be preferred.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was it Dobson that explained the meaning of piping dues to you? A. No, nor Chick.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I went to Chick's house, and afterwards to Elliott's; I found this cloth; it is cut for two coats, two pairs of trousers, and two waistcoats; it is not cut out into any pattern, but it is a sufficient quantity for that - I found a quantity of mortar, or lime, on this piece of black cloth -Mrs. Elliott said she was a dress-maker, and had the silk given her to make up by Mrs. Chick; she was then asked who brought the cloth, and said, "Mrs. Chick;" she was asked at the office who brought the cloth, and said, "Mr. Chick;" she was then ordered to be detained.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You imagine them to be coat lengths by the quantity? A. That is all; they might make a woman's or child's pelisse - it is a very small part of the property; she said Mrs. Chick had brought the silk when I first saw her, and that she had brought the cloth also - about a week after she said Mr. Chick brought the cloth; I had seen Mr. Elliott at the office before he was in custody; I heard no account where he was on the night of the robbery.</p>
               <p>MR. WILSON. I have seen the property at the office; the whole of it is mine, I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Have you noticed the property found at Elliott's? A. Yes; I should judge that to be worth about 5l. 10s.; the cloth was all in one piece when I lost it; it has been cut since; there was no lime or mortar on it when I left my house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was this property loose on shelves or drawers? A. The cloth was on shelves, and the silk in drawers, which were not locked; if the cloth had been taken through the hole it would be likely to get marks of lime or mortar.</p>
               <p>Richard Chick's Defence. When the officer entered my house I was handcuffed; they asked me who brought the property there - I said I should make no reply till I got before a Magistrate, but requested them to go and take Mrs. Dobson, and to go and search her premises - they took her, and searched her premises; Mrs. Dobson and one of the officers went into my back yard; a lodger, who is ill in the workhouse, overheard her say to the officers, "You have come too soon - you ought to have let me go out before you came in;" at the first examination the watchman stated that he could not swear to me positively - he had seen a tall thin man very much like me, but could not swear I was the man - at the final examination he came and swore I was the man. On Thursday night, about ten o'clock, on the 16th of July, I and my wife were going to Shoreditch to purchase something for supper - we passed Mrs. Dobson's house; she was at the door; she came after us, called us, and said to me, "You make yourself very strange;" I said, "Why, I know you are a neighbour, but I never had any conversation with you;" she said, "Well, the reason I called you was that I have some silk and cloth that I can let you have - I have enough to make your wife three dresses, and yourself a suit or two of clothes; they are my husband's - he buys and sells silk and cloth on commission, and he is a weaver;" I said I thanked her, and would consider of it, I would call in and let her know when I came back - I went into her house, and asked her to let me look at some patterns; she showed me several -I said I should like to have two yards and a half of drab kerseymere, two yards and a quarter of olive, and a yard and three quarters of black cloth, three quarters of a yard of brown cloth, and enough silk to make three gowns - I had eleven yards of fawn, twenty-two of brown, and a small piece of figured silk, and a piece of black to make my boy a waistcoat; she said if I would call in the morning I could have it - I went in the morning, and received from her the cloth produced and the silk found at Elliott's - they live next door but one to me; his wife was in the habit of making up dresses for mine for four years; I called, and told her Mrs. Dobson had sold me the silk, and she should have the making up of the dresses; in the morning I and my wife went and got the goods - I went out; my wife sent in for Mrs. Elliott, and gave her the silk to make up; I had asked Mrs. Elliott if she knew of a good tailor; she said she knew a gentleman who made clothes for a friend of hers - I said I would get her to show him to me, and when my wife said she had given her the silk, I took the cloth in, for Mrs. Elliott to show me where the tailor lived; there was a female in her house; I laid it down in the bundle handkerchief now produced, and said I would come in presently - I went out, and was in my house about half an hour, when in came Dobson; she said, "Mr. Chick, have you put out the silk and cloth to make;" I said I had - she said, "I know a person who can make it up good and cheap for you;" I said I had put it out - she said, "I have a quantity of silk and ribbons which I wish to measure - it is going to a silk-mercer and draper's on Ludgate-hill, who I have served for some years, and having converted my house into a brothel, I have so many people coming in and out, I don't like to measure it there;" I said by all means she could bring it to my house to measure, as she had been so kind as to let me pay for these goods at 2s. a week - she went away, came back in five minutes, and said she must bring some brown paper in - she had forgotten the yard, which she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100062"></xptr>fetched (that should be produced, for I believe it has her name on it;) after she went out for the paper, in about five minutes, a little girl, who I believe to be her daughter, came in with a book yard, and said her mother would be there directly; Mrs. Dobson was a long time, I thought it strange; in the course of three quarters of an hour she came into my house, confused, with the paper - I had taken hold of some of her silk after the yard was left, and measured some of it; I said I dare say it was right - she said she dare say it was; she was so confused she could neither look at me nor my wife, but I had no idea of the villany and trepan-game she was going on with; she asked if we had a bottle to get some gin - I said I had not: she asked for a pen and ink; I said I could borrow some - a pen and ink, and a bottle was brought, and in five or ten minutes in came the officers; she began to abuse them scandalously. calling them Mr. Bounce, and every thing she could think of; when they asked who brought the property, I said I should decline giving an answer till before the Magistrate - I requested them to take her and search her premises; she went out with the officers - whether they searched her premises I cannot say; I and my wife were taken before the Magistrate - the officers stated they brought me and my wife on suspicion of a robbery recently committed in the City; and he said he found part of the property on as - the Magistrate said he should remand us; I said, "Your Worship, what is the reason Mrs. Dobson is not brought forward, she is the woman who brought the property to my place;" I think it was Garton said she was in custody - they went out and brought her in; she said, "What do you want with me?" I said, "You base hussey, you have brought goods to my house, knowing them to have been stolen;" a little whispering went on between the officer and Magistrate, and Mrs. Dobson was let go - at the final examination she was bailed to answer any indictment, but she is not produced here; as to the watchman, every man, on the examination, was ordered to put their hats on - I being placed individually at the bar, and pointed out to him; if I had been with other men I should not have been pointed out - he was asked if he had seen the man since; he said No; he was shewn me, and said he believed me to be the man, but would not swear it; but at the last examination said he had no doubt I was the man - I have not the least doubt the officer persuaded him to say I was the man; Vaughan and Wear were produced at the examination, and I believe the servant swore to Vaughan being the man. - My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, You now behold before you an unfortunate individual, brought to the tribunal of justice for an offence of which he is innocent: I now avow myself innocent, but it is for you to decide and act impartially; this trial is a base attempt on my life. and supported by that guilty individual, Mrs. Dobson: I hope you will consider the awful situation I stand in, should you find me guilty of this offence, of which I am as innocent as a baby unborn: I have a wife and large family which I support by honest industry; I leave myself to your merciful consideration, and should your verdict prove against me, it will cause distress to a large family, and myself an ignominious death. I say and avow again, that the lamb that never leaped the grass, was never more innocent than I am.</p>

            's Defence. On the 17th of July I was at work by half past five o'clock in the morning till ten at night; I came home, and finding my wife with a deal of property, I asked what was the cause of it; she said she had taken in work for Chick: I said, "My dear, I hope you have spoken the truth, and the truth will never be blamed;" she said she had, and she was to appear on Monday; she went up on Saturday; I went up to the office; she was let go till Wednesday; I went there on Wednesday, and took hail there for her appearance; I had not been there long before an officer came into the adjoining public-house, and called Elliott; I went to him, and was taken, and committed till the following Wednesday; I knew nothing of the property being brought, or any thing of the kind; on the Monday before the robbery I was dining with my brother tradesmen at a feast - I came home and went to bed.</p>

               <p>Mary Elliott's Defence. On Monday we were at White Conduit-house till half-past one o'clock in the morning, when the person of the house let us in, and fastened the house, and before we were up she came into our room - we know nothing of the robbery; the silk was given me by Mrs. Chick, and the cloth afterwards by Mr. Chick; the officer came to my house between seven and eight o'clock - I was not at home; they saw me afterwards, and said I was to be at the office in the morning - I went; Brown came and told me I should not be wanted till Monday, when I went, and was detained; my husband was there all the afternoon - Vann said he dare say I should be bailed on Wednesday, and when he came on Wednesday with bail they detained him; he was not at home from five o'clock in the morning till eleven at night, when the property had been taken from my place.</p>
               <p>MR. WILSON. The value of all the property found is about 36l.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you a clock in the house? A. No - I know the hour by the watchman going by, and I asked him; I do not lock the door and take the key up every night, but I did it particularly that night, as he seemed anxious to go out again for drink, and it being late we wished to keep him in - it was the key of the front door; I had also the key of the back door - I am certain I knocked at his door for a light in the morning, and Mrs. Elliott said, "Walk in;" they do not burn a light, but Mrs. Elliott was up, getting breakfast, and had a fire - she opened the door, gave me a light, and I saw him in bed; the room the officer found the property in was their's.</p>

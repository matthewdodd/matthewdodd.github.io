            . I am a silversmith, and live at No. 338, in the Strand. I have lived there nine years. The prisoner is a working <rs id="t18221023-47-deflabel259" type="occupation">silversmith</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18221023-47-defend506 t18221023-47-deflabel259"></join> - I have known him as one for six or seven years. He worked for his father before he went into business for himself, and was well acquainted with the trade. In the beginning of the year 1821, I gave him a general order for goods, which he brought in at four different times. I produce the bill of parcels of the goods delivered by him; it is in his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>This bill was here read - it contained various items, among which were the four gravy spoons stated in the indictment. There was a charge of 4 l. 15 s. 1 d., for duty on the whole weight of the goods.</p>
               <p>He found the silver himself. His charge on the bill is merely the fashion, the weight of the silver is at the bottom, and the price not charged.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you understand from this he meant to state he had paid for duty 4 l. 15 s. 1 d. - A. Exactly so. I paid him that sum including the duty. He delivered the gravy spoons on the 2d of March - I produce them. When I ordered them of him I had no other gravy spoons in my stock, nor have I had any since. I am sure they are the same he delivered me on the 2d of March. I afterwards delivered them to Mr. Miles, the inspector of stamps. This was a fortnight or three week ago. I marked them first.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other article now in your possession included in the bill of parcels, besides the gravy spoons - A. Yes; here is a soup ladle. I bought two. Sometime after I received them, he came to me, and wanted to borrow one for an order he had in a hurry, and I lent him one - about a week afterwards he returned it; I cannot say it is the same I lent, but both came from him. The weight was cast up, and I paid him part in cash and part in a bill at two months - the total sum of the whole order, which was in four deliveries, was 41 l. 8 s. 1 d., the amount of fashion, and duty is 8 l. 10 s. of the first bill. The amount of the whole silver was 73 l. 18 s. 7 d. I had a transaction with him in February, and have a bill of parcels of it. It contains six French dessert spoons - I paid him for duty on the whole delivery 3 l. - it was included in the total amount. I produce the six dessert spoons; the other things are sold. At the time I had these dessert spoons from him, I had no others of that description in my stock, nor have I had since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have been speaking of transactions eighteen months ago - A. Yes, my business is not very large - I only employ one working silversmith, besides him. I dealt with his father, their business is not very large, I believe. I believe the prisoner delivered me the goods himself - part of them I can speak positively to. I never entered the goods I bought of him in any book, because I always paid him money when he brought them in. I am perfectly certain that these goods came from his hand. He has a brother or two, and his father used to come sometimes. I might have received some goods from his apprentice; workmen and apprentices have brought goods in some cases. These goods have been in my possession ever since; I am sure he brought them himself. I have one young man who has the care of my stock, he has been with me three years - he and my wife are the only persons having access to my stock; the shop is locked up at night. We weigh them, and put a private mark on them, but no mark to distinguish from whom they come; I trust to the maker's initials, which are punched on the stamp. Until within the last three weeks, I had no reason to direct my attention to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230033"></xptr>them. I have no other goods of the kind in my possession. I never lend plate out. I have not dismissed any servant since March, 1821. I believe the bill of parcels is in the prisoner's hand-writing - the back of it is, but I cannot speak to the body of it, because I did not see him write it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Judging of his hand-writing, do you believe it to be his; suppose you saw a Bill of exchange drawn in that hand, as by him, should you have accepted it - A. Yes, I should.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Is the back of the bill, which is the particulars of the whole transaction, his writing - A. It is, I saw him write it, and gave him the money; my private mark is on the spoons to denote the weight - I put that on perhaps a day or two after; they are the identical spoons.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said you had one other person employed to manufacture for you, what are his initials - A. I have some from Wintle, I don't know his Christian name.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you never entered the prisoner's work, because you paid him money, now one of the bills of parcels amounts to 8 l. 10 s. 1 d. which relates to various articles, and on the back of it is different duty and amounts, you did not pay that till the 2d of March - A. I added the bills altogether, knowing he would bring them in, in a few days.</p>

            . I am a silversmith - and live in Broad-street, St. Giles's. I have had dealings with the prisoner; about the latter end of November, or beginning of December, 1820, I ordered some tea-spoons of him, which he supplied me with. I produce his bill of parcels - (read, dated, the 16th of December, 1820, amount 1 l. 12 s. 7 d.) - The spoons were delivered on the 9th of December. I produce them - 12 s. 6 d. is charged in the bill, as the duty on 80 z. 7 dwts. - I paid him the account on the 16th of December - when he brought me the bill, dated the 16th, which was for other articles, among which is one tea-spoon to match some others - 9 d. was charged for duty on that spoon; I paid that - but I have not got the spoon now. I paid him for the whole of the two jobs on that day, (the 16th of December, 1820.) I paid him cash, 1 l. 12 s. 7 d. for manufacture and duty; I gave him silver for the weight. I produce the 12 spoons which I received on the 9th, and am sure they are the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This occurrence was two years ago - A. About that time. I cannot say whether he delivered them, or whether it was his father, or brother; his brother was a workman, but the father had given the business up to the prisoner - but resided with him, and assisted him a little. The apprentice might have delivered them; but I received them from the prisoner's house. I have an apprentice. I think I received the goods myself, because I gave back work - but am not certain. I had two apprentices at that time; they are both with me still. I may have lent plate to accommodate a friend - but never lent tea-spoons on any occasion in my life. The bills and pattern of the spoons, enables me to speak to the circumstance - but I have a recollection of the circumstance. I am obliged to keep the pattern, but it is not often enquired for. I dare say every shop has that pattern. I have not turned any apprentice away. I have one whom I have a suspicion about - but that does not relate to duty, it is quite unconnected with it.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. Are those the spoons described in that bill - A. They are; I am certain of it; they have my private mark on them, which corresponds with the weight in the invoice - which enables me to say they are the same described in the bill. The prisoner himself received the money, the duty being part of it. He put his initials to the bill at the time I paid him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Of course the duty charged in the bill, refers to the goods in those bills - A. It does; the duty charged never relates to goods not charged in the particular invoice.</p>

            . I carried on business as pawnbroker, in Blackfriar's-road. Mr. Kirkham succeeded me, and took all the stock; the prisoner worked for me as silversmith, from about May, 1819, until September, 1821. He made three skewers for me, which I parted with to Mr. Kirkham - (looking at two) - my firm belief is they are the same that the prisoner made for me; but I cannot positively say, they have been so long out of my possession. I have no private mark on them; I believe them to be the same, from the make and shape; he never made me any before; his initials are on the stamp; I noticed that, when he brought them to my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long ago is it, that he made them - A.(Looking at a memorandum), January the 18th, 1821; they were in my possession till the 11th of February, 1822; I have not seen them since; my full belief is, that they are the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that skewer, there is no initial on that - A. I remember once remarking to the prisoner, that the initial was not quite legible - and he said it was owing to the stamping.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had plate manufactured, or that came through the hands of Wintle - A. Not for many years - I think I had none within the last two years.

            . I am a silversmith and pawnbroker, and live in Shoreditch. I dealt with the prisoner. Early in December, 1820, I ordered some butter ladles of him; he brought them home on the 8th or 9th, with a bill of parcels, which I produce - (read, charging the butter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230034"></xptr>ladles and several other articles, weight in all 12 oz. 2 dwts., duty 18 s. 2 d.) - the duty is charged 18 s. 2 d., which I paid him in the general account.

            . I am an inspector of silver plate stamps, and have been so about thirteen years. The prisoner has been for some years a working silversmith. The plate is brought to Goldsmith's Hall, with the initials of the maker impressed on it; it is then assayed to try the quality of silver, and if correct, the Goldsmith's mark is impressed on it; also the mark denoting that the duty is paid. The Goldsmith's marks are to certify it is correct in quality, that is the lion and the leopard's head; and the King's mark is the King's head. I have the punch here; there is a letter impressed, which varies on the 29th of May every year; wrought plate is never delivered from the hall until the initials of the manufacturer's are stamped - (looking at the skewers) - I should not have stamped plate marked as these are. On the 26th of September, I was present when the prisoner's premises were searched; I found a steel punch on his premises, with his initials, which I have here - it is the regular punch which he should have as a working silversmith. The initials are H. D. (Looking at two gravy spoons the subject of this indictment,) we should not have suffered these to pass with the initials in the state these are now in. I have seen them before. The stamp of the King's head is forged on each spoon - the lion and leopards' heads are also forged. I have compared the prisoner's punch with the marks on the spoons; the initials on them correspond with the punch; the letter D. corresponds. The punch could have punched that letter. It appears by the gravy spoons that the punch has been first applied one way, and then in the reverse direction, and is completely confused. I have made some impressions with his punch, which I produce. (Looking at twelve tea spoons sold to

            ,) These marks are forged on all of them, and there is the same imperfections in most of the initials. We should not have stamped them with such initials. (Looking at six dessert spoons sold to J. Jones,) They are forged in all respects, also the stamp on the soup ladle. The initials on this are struck double, and on the skewers; we should not have passed them. (Looking at the butter ladle and fish knife,) The stamps are forged on both, and the initials on both are struck double - this makes it more difficult to discover the real initials. The variable letter on all but the butter ladle is E, which letter came into use on the 28th of May, 1820, and ceased on the 27th of May, 1821. The letter on the butter ladle is D, which was in use the year before. We should not have struck that letter in 1820.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you any thing to do with stamping the plate - A. At times I do, but very seldom; I have not ceased to be a stamper. There are ten persons in the office, only four of them are stampers. I never heard of a stamper being dismissed for misconduct; nobody in the office has been discharged, or complained of for irregularities; mistakes have happened at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Genuine stamps have been mistaken for forged - A. Never in any instance that I ever heard of in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of an instance as it regarded Mr. Carteledge - A. Yes; that was no mistake, it is said to have taken place, but did not. After plate is stamped, it has to undergo a polishing; it is always sent in as forward a state as possible, that they should pay the less duty. The finishing does not make the stamp the less perfect than when it is done at the hall, if it is done with skill. I have seen marks as perfect as when it came out of the hall, and have seen some less perfect, but never so as to render it at all difficult to say whether the stamp is genuine or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there been presented to you pieces of plate, which at first, with common observation, you have hesitated about - A. I have hesitated certainly; if it is much obliterated I pause of course before I give my opinion. I know of no instance of a genuine mark being mistaken at our office for forged. I only know two manufacturers whose initials are H. D. We take an impression from the manufacturer's punch, and send it back to him; so that we see whether the punch mark corresponds with the impression we have; it comes to us with the manufacturer's mark punched on it; we do not enter in any book, who brings it; it is accompanied by two tickets, to denote from whom it comes; we take a receipt from the master or servant to whom it is delivered back.</p>
               <p>Q. A manufacturer may be imposed on by the bearer of the plate, by substituting other plate - A. Yes. Our office is confined to the London district; but if plate came from any part of the kingdom, we take it. How many there are in the kingdom whose initials are H. D. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. Do you receive any plate from any person who has not a punch mark registered at your office - A. No; it is sent to the hall in as forward a state as possible, because the duty is according to weight, and polishing lessens the weight.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230035"></xptr>Q. Have you ever seen any plate immediately after polishing, in which you could have any difficulty in knowing the mark - A. No, after it has been worn and got into use, it may become more obliterated; the letters on the other persons punch, whose initials are H. D. are a different size; this plate corresponds with the prisoner's punch mark, and not with the other. None of the plate produced, has been stamped at Goldsmith's Hall.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The plate comes to you unstamped - A. Yes, we send it out stamped.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother. I have worked with him about three years and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, about the latter part of 1820, and some time after that, what state of health he was in - A. I recollect he was ill, and confined during that month.</p>
               <p>Q. What month - A. During the latter part of February.</p>
               <p>Q. What year are you speaking of - A.1820. I mean when it -</p>
               <p>Q. Attend - give a correct account; your brother was ill when - A. In December, 1821; he was exceedingly ill before that, and his life despaired of for four months before. I do not mean that he was ill for four months, but four months before, he was labouring under a stricture, and in December and January following he had a relapse. He was not able at times to go out. I transacted his business for him. He was ill about three weeks after that, and went to Herefordshire for his health, and staid there seven or eight days. His business was then done for him by other persons.</p>
               <p>- CARTELEDGE. I am a silver spoon maker. I had a transaction with the Goldsmith's Company when a mistake occurred - it was last August twelvemonth. Mr. Miles and two marshalsmen came to arrest me, and take me to the Mansion House, on the ground of stamped plate being forged; and when I got there, the mistake was found out. They had seized the plate as forged - it was given up - I have witnesses to prove it. It was not returned to me - it belonged to a box of Mr. Garfield's - it was not my property. I cannot say whether it was sent to its proper owner; I was not brought into trouble about it, but did all I could to bring the parties to justice.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. Was the plate returned by the Company - A. I have never had it returned - it was detained because it was among others that were forged - it was not mine. I do not know whether my employer ever had it back.</p>
               <p>Q. The evidence against you was not sufficient, and you were discharged - A. Yes. I can swear, and prove that the mark was not forged. Garfield was not taken up with me - the plate was not in a box belonging to him - I know nothing about him. He was not in my business, nor was he at the Mansion House.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was the plate marked with a genuine stamp - A. It was.</p>

             re-examined. I have an impression of the original stamp - the original is destroyed. There was no mistake in Carteledge's business. The plate was detained at the King's warehouse, as seized by his Majesty.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the King's head on it forged - A. It was.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Does the plate come to you sealed up - A. It does not - the initial punch is kept by the manufacturer, and he only can use it.</p>
               <p>Fifteen witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a tool-maker to Messrs. Bateman; they are silversmiths in Bunhill-row? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing, and what? - A. I believe it was the 12th of March, on Tuesday; I was looking out of the back window which looks to the North, I was looking there two or three minutes, turning aside from my board; there was something attracted my sight; I returned back, and turned my head again, and looked more steadfastly towards the window, and by the reflection of the sun I could see some round pieces, but I could not tell what they were; the window where I saw this was in the one pair of stairs, and I was in the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know who lived there at that time? - A. I did not; I turned my head, and saw that, and I made it my business to look more minutely into it, and I saw several pieces lying on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240030"></xptr>the table, but I could not distinguish what colour they were, but apparently they were white; the window was very dirty; that was the first day, about half past twelve; the business was carried on between eleven and one. On Wednesday I happened to look again, as I had suspicion, and I saw the same business going on; the different pieces apparently were shillings and sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was these shillings, as you supposed them to be? - A. Laying on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with them? - A. The prisoner at the bar; he was sitting at the side of the table; I saw him rubbing them with something, but I could not tell what; he appeared to be rubbing these pieces.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see him on the 12th and 13th, so as to see he was employed? - A. Yes, each time I saw him, and every time after he had done he washed himself, and scoured his hands a great deal indeed. On Thursday I saw the same process again, and rubbing and washing his hands, and two basons and a phial stood upon the table, and also the pieces were on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he rubbing then? - A. Yes, I saw him rub them between his finger and thumb, and after that I saw him shaking the pieces in something, but I could not tell what; I saw the phial on the table, and I saw him pour part of the contents of it into a bason that stood on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the pieces? - A. They were put into a bason, and shook about; they were after that taken out of the bason, and put into a cloth, and they were shook about.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they shook about in the bason, or in the cloth only? - A. In the cloth only; this was on the Thursday, and I think it was on that day that he washed himself very minutely, I believe all over.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you observe at all the colour of his hands? - A. No; I could see the soap on his hands when he was getting the dirt off; on the Friday there was much the same process, and he engaged in the same way, and on Saturday likewise. On the Saturday I communicated to my master what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did you communicate what you had seen to any Office? - A. I did, to Mr. Moser, the Magistrate, in Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that communication, did you go with the officer afterwards? - A. The officer appointed a house to meet me afterwards, and Ray was with me at my own shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this that Ray was with you at your shop? - A. On Monday, I took Ray up with me to my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see on Monday the same as you saw before? - A. I did; the business then did not begin till past one o'clock; I saw it after Mr. Ray went; on Tuesday, Mr. Ray came up into the shop, and he was satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. On Tuesday did you see with Ray what you had seen before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Ray was satisfied with what he had seen? - A. Yes; then the officers went; I was in the room just after the prisoner was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. You shewed them where to go? - A. Yes, they went backwards, over the premises of my employer; two of them did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have said there was some dirt about the window; was there enough to prevent you from seeing the colour of the pieces? - A. Sometimes the window was open; then I could see distinctly the white pieces of some substance or other.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. On Tuesday, the 19th of March, the information I had from the last witness led me there; about half past eleven o'clock in the day, I went into the work-shop with the last witness, Ware; I was looking out of the window up two pair of stairs, and I had a full view of the prisoner's room, which is only one pair of stairs from the ground; the first sight that I had of the prisoner was on his coming to the window with a bason, and something in it, which he threw out of the window, and then pulled down the window, and he went by the side of a table, I saw that very plain; I then saw him with something in a coarse towel, which he was shaking backwards and forwards; sometimes I saw him put it down on the table, and it seemed to me like round pieces of metal; he opened the cloth, and looked at them, and what was in the cloth appeared to me like round pieces, resembling shillings; he then put them in the cloth again, and kept on shaking them backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long might this last? - A. About four or five minutes; when I saw that the second time, I was satisfied; Armstrong, Vickery, Mason, Bishop, and Kennedy, were in waiting very near to the prisoner's apartment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you point out to them what you had seen? - A. I went and communicated to them what I had seen, and they immediately repaired, some to the front of the house, and I and Bishop went through the back of Mr. Bateman's place, to the back of the prisoner's house, and we got over the place; Armstrong had got into the front before we got into the back part of the premises; the prisoner was secured, and then the other officers proceeded to search; I secured the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing took place on securing the prisoner? - A. That the other officers will explain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Was there any other person in the house? - A. Not in that room; in the house there was a shoe-maker, at the bottom part of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240031"></xptr>house, at work; I am positive of the man, I knew him before.</p>

             sworn. - I and Vickery went up one pair of stairs, and I put my shoulder to the door, and opened it; I believe Vickery had his foot in the room before me; when I got into the room, the prisoner stood with his back rather sideways; I went round, and caught hold of his hand, and said, Mr. Field, is it you, and I secured thirty counterfeit shillings and nineteen sixpences in his hand only. When I called him Field, his hand opened, and some of them dropped, and I picked them up, I have them here; I then put them on the table, and wiped them, they being wet, in the presence of the prisoner and the officers; they seemed as if they had just come out of liquid.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe of what nature the liquid was? - A. I could not; I then desired the officers to look particularly to his hands, and I did so too.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the appearance of his hands? - Exactly in that state as if he had been using aqua-fortis; it colours the fingers ends; the nails will turn yellow, and the flesh will turn black.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen hands at first after using aqua-fortis, so that you know it produces black on the flesh, and yellow on the nails; had it that appearance? - A. Yes; I then looked to the fireplace, and by the fire there was a pitcher of cold water; by the side of that laid a phial, which had been recently broken, some of the pieces laying on the hearth, and some on the fire-place; I then went, and searched the other parts of the room; the prisoner said, Armstrong, you have got all; he made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to see what liquor it was that was spilt? - A. I did not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You went with Armstrong to the front of the house? - A. Yes, I was the first in the room, the door was on the latch; I believe the prisoner was standing with his hands behind him, and with his back to the fire; Armstrong caught hold of him by the left hand; he looked in his face; I took him by the right hand; and when he said, Field, at that time five of the blanks dropped on the floor, directly he let his hand go; Armstrong called him by name, and he took this money from him; he had nothing in his right hand. I proceeded to search, and I found this piece of rag, it has been opened; here is a bit of woollen cloth, and a quantity of base metal that was in it, twelve counterfeit shillings and four counterfeit sixpences; three of these shillings appear to have been quite finished for circulation; on a shelf close to the back of the prisoner was this piece.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a shilling of another kind? - A. It is entirely brass, it is a blank; upon the same shelf I found another shilling in this piece of paper; it appears to be finished for circulation; in another part of the room, from behind a picture, this dollar fell; this has been recently finished.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It is a counterfeit dollar; is that coloured in the same way? - A. Yes, by the same process; this apron he had on, with the wet marks on it; it is mouldy now, but it had white places on it, as if he had been using cream of tartar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else? - A. Yes, this cloth was laying, part in a pail and part out, close to where the prisoner was standing, and there were visible marks, where blanks had been shaken in this bag with cream of tartar; there were places that was quite wet, of a whitish colour; there was a phial that had been broken by a fall, and there were some pieces laying on the ground, and I saw one piece by the fire, that was the neck of the phial; I saw Bishop stoop, and taste that on the fire, where there were parts of the broken phial, and by the side of the fire stood a large stone pitcher of water, and a bason of water on the table, which tasted saltish; it was either salt water, or salt used in it. After we had secured the prisoner, he begged that his landlord might be sent for, and the landlord was sent for to come up into his room; he desired Armstrong to take his keys out of his pocket, and to take half-a-crown out of his chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the landlord? - A. I believe his name is Sword; he said that we had got all; he was perfectly civil, and did not make the least resistance in the world.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. When I went into the room, I observed a phial had been broken on the hearth; I put my finger to it, and tasted it, and I found it was aqua-fortis; I took up a little bit of glass likewise, and tasted that, and that was the same, it was a strong acid; the prisoner said it was only a gin-bottle that had been broken there; I know aqua-fortis both by taste and smell, I have no doubt of it; on the shelf I found this horn, which contained some blacking; in the cupboard I found a punch, with the impression of a star; in the same cupboard I found this sand-paper, or scouring-paper, and a piece of cork; in a little box in the cupboard, I found two papers, each containing cream of tartar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not bring any part of this before the Magistrate, to prove that it was aqua-fortis? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Armstrong.) Look at the sand-paper? - A. It is a thing that is always found under these circumstances; cork, blacking, and cream tartar, is always used; the aqua-fortis always brings the white colour first; the cream of tartar is used after the aqua-fortis and the blacking; they are all such things as I have found in these places</p>

               <p>Q. What is the use of aqua-fortis; what does the operation of aqua-fortis produce upon the blanks? - A. It destroys the base metal, leaving the silver particles on the surface, and it is that by which the colour of silver is produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us what is the use of cream of tartar? - A. In cases of this fort it removes the blackness which remains, and the acid of the cream of tartar takes off the aqua-fortis that is left there, and fixes the colour.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is performed by rubbing them in a cloth? - A. That is to dry them, after they have been immersed in this sort of pickle; after they have been coloured, they are put in cold water, and after the aqua-fortis has done its office, they remove what is left by washing.</p>

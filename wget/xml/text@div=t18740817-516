                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of 40, Chancery Lane—on 1st July, 1868, a bill of complaint was filed by me on behalf of England—this is a copy of the bill under seal of the Record Office—I conducted the suit up to the decree—property was recovered under it—in September, 1871, I took proceedings against England for my bill of costs—he verbally agreed with me upon terms of payment—a judge's order was drawn up in pursuance—this is the order—it is an order for the payment of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>: 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be paid down, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the next day, and the balance in ten days—he gave consent to that—he only performed his promise as to part, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was left—in consequence I proceeded to obtain a charging order from the Court of Chancery—this is it. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 16th January</hi>, 1872, <hi rend="italic">and ordered a sale of premises in Unicorn Yard, Ossulton Street, and the payment of the proceeds into Court</hi>). My costs were afterwards taxed, and this is the certifi<lb></lb>cate of the Taxing Master for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—the property was put up for sale on 11th April—I was present at the sale—Mr. Levy was there acting for England—on 10th April this notice was served, it is signed by the defendant—it is a protest against the sale—at the sale I saw some documents produced by Mr. Levy—I did not actually read them—there were three documents—Mr. Levy described them to the auctioneer—I am not quite certain whether England was there, I believe he was—I think it was three agreements that Mr. Levy produced—I cannot identify them, because I did not actually see them—I saw them held up in his hands, and he said they were documents relating to tenancies of these premises—Mr. Levy told the auctioneer that he could not sell, that was the substance of it, because there were agreements affecting them—the pro<lb></lb>perty was sold for 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a Mr. Carter—I think 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid on deposit—that was paid into Court under the order of the Vice-Chancellor—in the protest of the 10th April England complains of the order being made in his absence—he did not appeal against the order after the notice, he did before—the order had been previously made by the Chief Clerk, then there was an appeal to the Vice-Chancellor, who confirmed it—at the time he made the protest of the 10th April he had gone through an appeal to the Vice-Chan<lb></lb>cellor—a notice was afterwards served in the name of Barnes, this is it—I think this came either the day of the sale or the day after—I cannot recollect now—it was no doubt received on the 10th—it is marked by one of my</p>

               <p>clerks as received on the 10th—I may not have received it till the 11th, it purports to be signed by William Barnes—there were no other notices at that time from any other supposed tenant besides Barnes—after the sale I received from Mr. Carter's solicitor a requisition of title, the ordinary requisition, as to what the tenancies were, what agreements there were, and so forth—it is here—I could not answer that requisition without having information as to the nature of Barnes agree<lb></lb>ment—and in consequence of that, I obtained an order on 14th June for affidavits of documents—I caused a copy of that to be served on England—this is it, and this is the original order—by the terms of this order he was to file his affidavits within four days—he did not do so, not for months after<lb></lb>wards. (<hi rend="italic">The affidavit of 17th October, stated that he had not in his possession or power any documents, except two leases of premises in Unicorn Yard.</hi>). Those were leases prior to the decree—they were handed to me for the purpose of instituting the suit—there was an assignment to England of those two leases—on 4th November, I obtained a second order from the Court, upon an affidavit of myself and Mr. Reed—this is an office copy of the affidavit, alleging that the defendant's first affidavit was not sufficient; and it is recited in the order of 4th November—it refers amongst others to Barnes agree<lb></lb>ment—this is the order of 4th November, directing that within fourteen days he should file a full and sufficient affidavit, setting forth whether he had or had had in his possession any such documents—on 6th December he filed the affidavit upon which the first perjury is assigned—this is his signature—the sale was still uncompleted at that time—I was waiting for compliance with the requisition—it was necessary to obtain information as to the tenancies and tenants—on 16th December, this third order was made, and upon that the defendant filed this affidavit of 11th January, upon which there is a second assignment of perjury; this is his signature. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had granted certain assignments in reference to the property in question to Barnes, Partridge, Clark, Smith, and Ladd, and that he had no drafts or copies of either of them, and never had in his possession or power any docu<lb></lb>ments relating to them.</hi>). After that I took out a further summons before the Chief Clerk for a further affidavit—I am not certain whether England attended or his solicitor—Mr. Lind was his solicitor at that time, repre<lb></lb>sented by Mr. Edward Lawrence Levy—I was not there; but I know he was represented by Mr. Levy, because I met him on many occasions in the matter—I had ultimately to return the 120/. to Mr. Carter, it was paid out of Court by order—no sale was effected, and I have never received any portion of the monies that I am entitled to—I first discovered a week or two before I took out the summons at Bow Street, that during the whole time of these affidavits being sworn, there were documents under his con<lb></lb>trol, or in his possession—I was endeavouring in the meantime to find out where they were; upon discovering it, I proceeded to Bow Street, and took out a summons, I had no knowledge of what Mr. Edward Lawrence Levy would state when I summoned him to the Police Court, except that he had some documents in his possession—I was not aware of the evidence he would give until he actually gave it.</p>

I really mean that—I took out the summons knowing that he had some of these documents in his possession—I did not know what he had, I knew he had some—I went to Mr. Levy, I cannot fix the date, except that it was two or three weeks before I took out the summons—I cannot tell you now what day that was; it was a long</p>

               <p>while after the affidavits, not two years; it was in this year—the last affidavit upon which we charge perjury is 11th January, 1873, the date of the summons is 4th June, 1874—I went to Mr. Levy, I should think two or three weeks before that—I did not know that Mr. Levy had quarrelled with Mr. England—Mr. Lind was concerned in an action in which he was concerned for the plaintiff, and I for the defendant, and we began talking about these matters—I did not know at that time that there was any dis<lb></lb>agreement between him and Mr. Lind—I have heard it since—what I wanted to get was the agreements or incumbrances in respect of this property—at the sale some papers were produced, which were asserted to be agreements for tenancies—I think Barnes' name was mentioned, but there was such a hubbub—I don't think Partridge's name was mentioned—I did not hear it, or Smith's; the only name I can remember hearing was that of Barnes—I don't know that other names were mentioned—I saw three documents, and I heard that the name of one was Barnes—if other names were mentioned, I don't remember hearing them—I can't recollect whether Barnes was pointed out; I won't swear he was not—I can't recol<lb></lb>lect now—some other person spoke, but I don't know his name, he spoke from the middle of the room, and said he knew there were some agreements for a tenancy in existence—I am familiar with the practice in Chancery—I could not have got a summons against Barnes to produce his lease; there was no bill filed in this instance, it was an interest to me to sell this pro<lb></lb>perty free from incumbrances—I had not been to counsel about it—I did not file any bill against these persons to substantiate their claims, or summon them to produce the documents they held—I did not go to Mr. Levy to ascertain what the claims were—I rested on the affidavits—that is the usual course—I have taken the proper steps—I have not summoned Barnes, that would not be a proper step—I never heard of Barnes till long after the charging order—I asked for an affidavit of the defendant—I never went to Lind or Levy—I could not have got an' order to cross-examine England upon his affidavit, there being no bill—there was a bill originally, but that suit had terminated—the order was made on a summons, not on a bill filed—I took the usual course, to get an affidavit of documents; that is the first thing done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It is not possible to get an order to cross-examine on a summons—I could have done so if I had filed a fresh bill—I could not get a charging order unless the Vice-Chancellor was satisfied I had recovered property under the original order—I never heard of Barnes till after the order was made.</p>

               <p>brought me some papers and on the following day England came with the others—I then had in my possession a copy of Barnes' agreement, and the originals of Smith's, Clark's and Partridge's—Ladd kept his own, I did not see that then—I kept possession of them for a short time—an opinion was taken with regard to what could be done—Mr. York at first took an opinion—England was not satisfied with it, and we were to see Mr. Townsend as to whether a bill could be filed—I had an interview with Mr. Barnes before that, and I then got the original of Barnes' agreement, I think from Barnes—I don't know whether it was from England or Barnes, they were both there—I don't know which handed' it to me, I think it was-Barnes, but I won't be certain—I had not got them in my possession on 14th June, the time of the order for the affidavit to be filed—they had gone back to England—there was some question, I think, some sheriff or something was coming in, and they wanted the agreements for something', and he asked me for them back again—I returned them before the first affidavit was sworn—this affidavit of the 17th October was prepared in my office—there is a schedule of documents; that was prepared by Mr. Lind—there is no reference made to either of these agreements, because he said he had not got them—I had conversation with England with reference to his affidavit and these docu<lb></lb>ments—I said "You must discover every document you have got, or any copies, where are the original agreements?"—he said "I have returned them back to those to whom they belong"—I said "Have you any copies?"—he said "No, I have not, they were prepared off hand, I have got no copies"—I said, "You must set out everything you have got"—he said' "All I have got are those which were put in the schedule afterwards; two leases—I no doubt had the order of 4th November, I have not got the copy, I produced it at the police court I think—before the swearing of the affidavit of 6th December I had heard the copy affidavit of Stokes and Reed read before the Chief Clerk—that affidavit was prepared in the office; part of it is my writing—the affidavit itself is mine—before it was sworn I told England that an affidavit had been made by Stokes and Reed that some of these' documents were in existence, that that had been brought before the Chief Clerk's notice, and said they must be put forward, he must get them—he said he could not got them, they did not belong to him and he had nothing to do with them—I don't know whether I alluded particularly to Barnes' agreement, I alluded to them all; I said "Cannot copies be got and set' out?"—this affidavit of 11th January is a copy of the other, With the exception of the last paragraph, which was not in the previous one, and therefore the Chief Clerk held it to be insufficient—I put in that last paragraph from a book of forms—the Chief Clerk said it must be put in—I told England that some conversation had taken place before the Chief Clerk, and it would be better, as he had the opportunity of amending the affidavit, to put' in the documents if he could get them, because other proceedings would be adopted—he said he could not get them, and he had no copies and could' not get copies—I was with him when he was sworn to the affidavits before Mr. Smith on 6th December and 11th January—he had previously read them, they were done while he waited in the office, he had them to himself to read—the draft was read over to him before we engrossed' it—I had pre<lb></lb>viously, on both occasions, explained to him the necessity of an affidavit with regard to the agreements with these different persons—I think he was' present on one occasion before the Chief Clerk—I think it was on the occa<lb></lb>sion when the affidavit of Stokes and Reed was received, the second</p>

               <p>occasion, I won't be certain—he was present with me when the subject was under discussion in the Chief Clerk's office—I subsequently saw some of those agreements with Partridge and others some days after the last affidavit had been sworn, they were brought to me by England—there was a copy of, I don't know whether it was an equitable deposit or a mortgage from him to a Mr. Gearer, and these agreements were brought at the same time—I have produced them all, they all come from me—I produced at the police court the original of Barnes' and a copy of Barnes', I produced Partridge's and Smith's—I could not produce Clark's, because he took it away from me, there is a copy of Clark's, the original he took away, he came in as I was having it copied, and when it was being copied and being examined he took up the original, and said "I shall keep my own document," and walked out of the office with it—England was there at the time—by reference to my diary it was on 22nd January that England brought me the documents—when he gave them to me I said "Where have you got these from"—he said "I have got them back again, what do you want with them?"—I said "I never asked you for these, I only asked you for Gearer's"—he said "Cannot these be put in as well, Gearer claims all the property, and he will claim these under the mortgage as well"—I told him I did not want them, he had better speak to his son upon it, because the copy I had got was only a mortgage on the three properties that Mr. Gearer was claiming against the Building Society—Gearer is a son-in-law of England's—that was the matter upon which I wanted Gearer's mortgage—we were filing a bill—I said "As you have got them, you recollect the affidavit you made; you had better let Mr. Stokes know you have got them and I will apply for leave to file a minute affidavit"—he said he would see him d----d or b----y well in hell first before he should have them, or some such expression—I retained the documents from that time until I pro<lb></lb>duced them at the police court—there was some dispute with Clark and England at one time, Clark having received some rent of a house in Union Street, and Clark gave me notice not to part with his agreement—I told England of it and he said "That don't belong to him, it is mine, as well as the others are mine"—I was not to give it up to Clark—that was how Clark got it, by snatching it away—I can't fix the date of this—it was after the last affidavit—I ceased to act for England somewhere in February or March, 1873—I never produced the agreements until I was compelled to produce them at the police court—I attended there upon a subpoena when England was charged—all the papers described in this receipt of England's came to<lb></lb>gether with the agreements—they were all fastened up together—I don't know whether I had a copy affidavit of Stokes and Reed—I had the opinion of Mr. Ince, that is it, and also the copy agreement of Barnes', minutes of order, and the bill of costs, and the bill in Chancery of England <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Grant—these papers mentioned in the receipt were only in my possession a few days.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. There is an agreement of Barnes, Partridge, Smith, and Clark, and a copy of Barnes'—I don't know how many are charged in the indictment—I got the original of Barnes some days prior to the 30th April, 1872—I don't think I saw Barnes at the sale on the 11th—I do not recollect—I did not know him at that time, and I don't know whether I should know him if he stood before me again—I don't recollect whether Barnes' name was mentioned as a person claiming, there were so many persons talking—I don't think Smith was claiming at the</p>

               <p>sale; there were some persons claiming—Partridge, was the only one I knew before the sale, I am sure of that—I got them about the 19th or 20th April, a few days before the 30th—Smith did not bring his to me—I think Barnes came with Mr. England, and whether he or England gave it to me, I could not tell—I got Clark's at the same time I got Smith's, about the 23rd—there was a bill in Chancery being filed, and I got them for the instruction of Mr. Townsend, and here is the draft bill that Mr. Townsend drew—Clark gave me notice not to part with his, I think in February or March, 1873—if was about the middle of February, or perhaps the end that he took it away—Smith did not take his away—I never saw him about it or Part<lb></lb>ridge—I never saw Barnes after we found that the bill in Chancery would not be successful—I gave these up about a fortnight or three weeks after receiving them, there was some question about the property, some execu<lb></lb>tion or something coming on—about the middle of May, I gave them all to England; whether Mr. Ladd was with him or not, I don't know, he gene<lb></lb>rally came with Mr. Ladd—I gave them all to England—I can tell you for why they were given—England gave me Partridge's agreement—he brought Partridge down—I gave that up to England also without consulting Partridge, because it was brought to me by England—they were brought to me again on 22nd January, 1873—I did not see them between May and June, 1873, not any of them—I did not give up the case and the opinion, that was Mr. Yorks—I held it for him—I had that all the time, not Barnes' copy agreement, I gave that back to England—I returned the agreements to him all together, Barnes' copy as well—I never saw any of them till 22nd January—I have not my diary of that date here—I have had no notice to produce it—the subpoena was left at the office in my absence—I did not read it—I have not seen Mr. Lind here to-day—I am his managing clerk—I have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and any business I introduce, I have a third of the profit—the business is not chiefly provided by me—I am an attorney—I was admitted in 1848—I practised up to 1866—I then ceased—it was not then suggested that I had taken a liberty with somebody's name—I got into difficulties through speculations at the opera, and other places, and I left England, and after that a charge was made—I did not before I left England sign the name of somebody else to a bill; I swear I did not—I was not charged with doing so, not before I left England, I was telling you, but you stopped me; I got into difficulties, I did not wish to be made bankrupt or insolvent, and I went away, and while I was away a charge of forgery was brought against me, and I was brought back, and tried before his lordship, and acquitted—I was charged with the forgery of the name of Mr. Lazarus for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were not other names besides, not that of Mr. E. T. Smith, I swear that—I was not charged with writing his" name—I had a very fair practice up to 1866—it was in 1866 I took myself off to the Continent—the charge was made against me after I left England that I had committed forgery before I left—I did not hear of it for some time afterwards, three or four months, I think it was, I was lying ill at Switzerland at the time; I did not come back directly, I came to Liverpool in 1868 or 1869, I forget which, not two years after<lb></lb>wards—I did not go to Mr. Lazarus—I passed by the name of Lindon at Liverpool, I remained there a short time, five or six months—I endeavoured to get into the employ of a Mr. Turner, an auctioneer there—he did not charge me with getting into his employ by false pretences—he never made any charge of the sort against me—he made an affidavit against</p>

               <p>me, which was sent up to the Law Institution, that I had gone by another name, and not my own—but he made no charge that I had been guilty of anything—I set out in my affidavit what I had done since I left England, and to every one of those the Law Institution sent round to get affidavits to see if it was true or not—Mr. Turner did not dismiss me—I did not remain there—I left him—in 1870 or 1871 I applied to be re-ad<lb></lb>mitted as an attorney—I was refused—I applied again—my first application was made through Mr. Huddleston, it was opposed by Mr. Garth, on be<lb></lb>half of the Law Institution, and refused—the next application was four or five months afterwards by Mr. Huddleston—that was not refused—the Lord Chief Justice was not on the bench, and the Court said as he was not there they thought it was too early to renew the application, but I was not put under any time at which I was to make it—I was at liberty to come up at any time to make it—I made it again in a few months after, in the fol<lb></lb>lowing January, 1873—that application was made by Sir John Karslake—it was not' refused—it was referred to the Master on my own application—it is before him now, and I believe I shall succeed—the Master has admitted, that the charges brought against me are not proved:—he has said that—before the Master other matters were inquired into, about Mr. Prentis as to the alteration of a fee in a brief—that was the ground on which I was opposed—those were the affidavits, and I answered them—those are not new charges, they are the old charges—the assertion, was that Mr. Prentis' fee had been received and not paid, and that it had been altered from 12 to 15 guineas—the matter about Mr. Turner was not inquired into, because the Court had adjudicated upon that, and that had passed—the matter about the forgery was not inquired into, the Court had had the whole of the evi<lb></lb>dence printed before them when I made my first application, and if you read the remarks of the Lord Chief Justice you will find what he said—it was in 1870 that I was tried for the forgery in the other Court before his Lordship and acquitted—that was not Mr. Lazarus' charge it was the bank a charge—it was in respect of Mr. Lazarus case—the money had not been paid, not a farthing, either at that time or, to my knowledge, since—there was possibly an action of Ladd <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Cooper entrusted to me by Mr. England—there were a lot of actions—he did not pay me upon that action 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. To be paid into Court, or to Mr. Lind—he did not make any charge against me that the money bad not been paid into Court, but into my own bankers—nothing of the kind—he did' not charge me with receiving money from him for a specific purpose and putting it into my own pocket.—I will explain to you what it-was, if you will allow me—the trustees of a building society sued Mr. England for something like 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I got it referred—they, then brought an action of ejectment against the tenants to recover, the property. I went before Baron Martin, and he referred the matter to the Master—we went into the matter, and consented to an award of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10 guineas costs—the money was to be paid at a certain day; in the meantime I got hold of one of the society's books and found that something like 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more was charged than ought to have been charged against him, and I said if he had let me have these documents we might have saved more money; he said. "What is to be done," I said "You can do nothing;" he said "Oh, suppose I have got a mortgage of the property, can't I get out of it that way;" I said "Who is your mortgagee?" he said "My son-in-law, Gearer;" I said "Have you got an agreement?" he said "I will get it." His son is a solicitor, and I said to him "Why not do this Chancery suit?"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187408170025"></xptr>
               <p>he said "No; I don't wish to be mixed up with it. I don't want to be seen in my father's affairs"—then I advised that a bill should be filed on behalf of Gearer—when, the matter was about being settled, Mr. Philip England, the son, came to me and said "We have got to pay 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; now about the 149<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd." I said "What do you mean, who is to pay all the costs," he said "Oh, you must trust my father, he will, pay you."—I said "Certainly not." The 149<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was kept by me to pay the costs. England said "Let me have the money, and I will pay your bill afterwards." He did find fault when he got it all settled, and when I had saved him 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. It was prior to that that I left off work for him—there was a case of Smith against the London Omnibus Company tried at the end of Hilary term last—you conducted the case for Mr. Huddleston—I was not in Court—I did not conduct the case—I may have written a letter at the commencement of the case—I was not near the Court—I swear that—the day prior to the trial I was in the Lord Mayor's Court office, and I" left there and never went into the Court—Mr. Lind was there conducting the case—an affidavit was made by Mr. England for a new trial in that case—affidavits have not been made that I suborned witnesses to commit perjury—the case now stands for argument in the Common. Pleas—I have had a copy of the affidavits, and have read them—I am willing to explain what was in them—an affidavit was made by Mr. Philip England, who told me that I should rue it one day for not being a witness in the case for him, that he had been told that I had agreed to give 40 to a "person to be a witness, and that affidavit has been, answered—I believe there are two other affidavits—there was not an affidavit, by the principal witness re<lb></lb>pudiating what he had said, and stating that I induced him to swear it—I was asked that at the Police Courts and. I told you the same, and they said they would search and find it, and they have not—there, is no such affidavit on the file, and I challenge them to produce it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The matter of Smith and the Omnibus Company was before I was a witness at Bow Street—my attendance there had nothing to do with that case—I believe Ladd is Mr. England's man—he has witnessed' bills of sale—he is always willing to serve process; and actions are brought in his name—he is the same person who was one of the supposed tenants—I think he lodges in the Caledonian Road—I have had nothing whatever to do with bringing this charge of perjury against England—the allegation about Mr. Prentis' fee was that twelve guineas was altered to fifteen by the clerk, and the clerk said it was done by my knowledge, and that the fee had not been paid—the Master said with regard to that that he was satisfied there was no charge against me—I produced the receipt—with regard to Mr. Turner I gave a statement of what I had done, since I left off practice; I mentioned everybody's name where I had been, and they' went round to every one—Mr. Turner made an affidavit; it came before the Court and; was adjudicated upon—he never made any charge, against me, he only made the affidavit for the Law Institution—I was acquitted of the charge with regard to Mr. Lazarus—I have been summoned for an assault that it was said I had committed since this business of Mr: Eng<lb></lb>land's—Mr. England was there, and the whole of my conduct has been sifted upon my application to the Court, and nothing has been brought against me during the whole time I have practised—this is the agreement of Richard Smith that I spoke of—I can't tell you who Smith is—I', have seen him with England, he goes about with him—Clark has signed that</p>

               <p>agreement; that is the same Clark who took away his agreement—Barnes is a relation of Eugland, I think his nephew—Partridge, I think, minds the stables for England, he is the ostler I think—I don't know who Clark is, he is always with England.</p>

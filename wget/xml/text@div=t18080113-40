               <p>Q. Do you remember last month buying any sheep at Smithfield market, part of which you afterwards lost. - A. On the 28th of December I bought seventy four sheep between me and Mr. Swain.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your partner's name - 
               <persName id="t18080113-40-person437">A. Robert Swain</persName>
            .</p>
               <p>Q. After these sheep were brought, where did you put them. - A. They were brought to my house about half after three o'clock, or four to the outside, No. 5, Sharp's-alley, Cow Cross. After they came to my house, I eat a cold dinner; it might be four o'clock when I took them from my house to a field which I rent of Mr. Bennet, at <placeName id="t18080113-40-crimeloc231">Battle Bridge</placeName>

I took seventy three to that field; there was one tired, we were obliged to kill it. I left them in the field and fastened the gate; it fastens with a catch staple; I put a bit of stick into the staple.</p>
               <p>Q.Were any of the sheep marked - A. There were twenty marked across the nose with dark ochre; the were bought of Mr. Ebb, a salesman; they had no other mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they wethers or ewes. - A. There were about three wethers in the twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the others marked, the other fifty three that were in the field. - A. There were twenty five of them marked double across the loin with ochre; they were all ewes; there were twenty three marked on the shoulders with ochre; they were bought in two lots, thirteen in one lot, and ten in the other. The other lot were G branded on the near hip, I believe; there were six of them; I believe they were ewes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave them in this field. - A.Just before five o'clock, I could just see to put them in. I went on Tuesday, the next morning, about nine o'clock, to the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find them all there. - A. No, I did not; the gate was open.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sheep were gone. - A.Twenty five; I found forty eight in the field; we missed ten of the twenty that were marked over the nose, seven of them that were marked double on the loin, one with G branded; the others were them that were marked on the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. That is seven that were marked on the shoulder.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130037"></xptr>A. Yes. I found the sheep on the same night, about half after eight o'clock, on the Tuesday night; I found them at the prisoner Rudd's house at Pimlico; I believe it is in Chelsea parish, close by the Union Tea Gardens. I found five of them dressed in his shop.</p>
               <p>Q.Is he a butcher. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know these five in the shop were your sheep. - A. The first I took hold of, I was sure by the mark on the nose; they had not took the skin off clean; the head is here now. The other four that were hanging in the shop were not marked in the same way; we found the skins and the sheep we found eight dead in all; we found five in the shop, there were seven of them killed with the mark across the nose; when I went in I asked how many he had got of them ewes; he said that he had got nine. I asked him where the remainder of them were; he went into the back place, where he was working, there were two dressed there, and one not quite finished, about half dressed; that made eight dead ones.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that the two that were dressed were yours. - A By the skins, all the skins were in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these skins any mark over the nose. - A. Seven out of the eight had.</p>
               <p>Q.I thought that you told me in the shop were five sheep, one you knew by the mark on the nose, the skin not being taken off clean from the head. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether the skins of the four sheep that you saw afterwards, were in the shop. - A.They were in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw two dressed in the back place, where were the skins. - A. They were in the back place, where he was at work, and five skins were in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. The one that was half dressed, how was that marked. - A. On the nose, the skin was upon the sheep in all the four quarter, that I finished myself, he could not finish it. I asked him where the other one was; he said he had nine at first; he answered he had got no more; upon that I lifted up a bit of cloth, that was hung before them on a rail, and there were three live ones. One of them were marked G, brand, and the other two were marked over the nose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any more any where else. - A. I was left in possession of the things; the officer took him to prison; after the officer came back they asked the woman and the boy for the key of a stable he had got; the wife and the boy said they had no stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they get into the stable. - A. They did, I believe, by force; they broke it open. I went afterwards to the stable to help take the sheep out; there were there fourteen sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe what they were. - A. It was so dark, I did not take any particular notice; Mr. Swain did.</p>
               <p>Q. That makes twenty five. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. The sheep were found on the Tuesday; they might have been some time in the house, because you found some of them killed. - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Court. When you went in the house what did you say. - A. I went up to the door, I asked him for a pound of mutton chops; when I went in he held the candle in his hand, and dropped back, he seemed suprized; I laid hold of this sheep; I asked him how many he had got of them; he said nine, I asked him where he had bought them; he said at Smithfield on the Monday; I asked him of whom, he said he had bought them of Mr. Ireson; I told him he could not, Mr. Ireson was not up that day, which he was not. That was the whole of the conversation that I had with him before the officer came in.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he say he had bought them on the Monday or the day before. - A. The day before, I understood him.</p>
               <p>Q.What time was the market over at Smithfield. - A. Some people will stay at this time of the year till almost dark; I believe Mr. Ebb was the last that was there. I believe it might be near five o'clock when he went; I was not there, I went to the field with the sheep.</p>

            . Q. You are in partnership with Mr. Bunnell. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at Smithfield market on the 28th of December last. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time the market finished that day. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you buy that day. - A. I bought seventy four sheep that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How were these sheep marked. - A. There were twenty I bought of Mr. Ebb marked across the nose; the other fifty four I bought of Mr. Billing; there were twenty three marked red shoulder, thirteen and ten, they were in two lots; there were twenty five marked twice over the loins, and there were six G branded between the hip, they were not particularly nearer one hip than the other; that makes fifty four of Mr. Billing, and twenty of Mr. Ebb, is seventy four.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to the field at Battle-bridge. - A. I went part of the way; I was going out to spend the evening with my mother.</p>
               <p>Q.What time did you go to the field. - A. Near four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go the next morning to the field first. - A. No, my partner went first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Rudd's. - A. Yes. I went there between seven and eight, on the next evening; I was called in, and the officer and Mr. Smith the butcher then went in; Mr. Bunnell went in first, then I was called in, he said he had found the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon going in what did you see. - A. I saw the five sheep hanging in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know they were some of them which you had bought - were there any marks upon them. - A. Yes, there was one left with the mark on, about the nose; there were four more with the marks almost left on, but the marks were not so much to be seen as they were on the other one; the skins were not quite taken off; there were two more hung backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the skins in the shop. - A. I did not take particular notice, but when I looked over all the skins, they were all nearly together, close to the door that goes to the back place.</p>
               <p>Q. There were two more in this back place. - A. Yes; they were finished dressing; they had marks on the nose, he had not skinned them clean. There was one more half finished dressing; the mark was on the skin.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the skin separated from the sheep. - A. No, it was on, half way down the back; the last sheep I am not positive whether it was one of Mr. Ebb's sheep or not, they had ochred them afresh to disfigure them, but I am positive that he killed seven out of Mr. Ebb's.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130038"></xptr>Q. Having found these three, at you described them, did you find any more afterward. - A. Yes, three more live ones.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that part separated from the others that they were dressing. - A. There was a cloth hung down before the rails that went across; these three had been disfigured, two of them were Mr. Ebb's and one Mr. Billing's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that of Mr. Billing's a red shoulder. - A. Yes; but they had been ruddling it down the back to take the mark out.</p>
               <p>Q. Any of these three with a G brand. - A. No, neither of them; there was but one G brand lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find any more. - A. In a stable, about an hundred yards up the town, we found fourteen there; some of them were marked twice over the loins, and some red shoulders, and there was one of Mr. Ebb's marked all down the back to disfigure it, and one G brand; that I took particular notice was in stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say anything about them. - A. I went with him to prison, I asked him where the remainder of the sheep were, we only found eleven at the house; he said he had no more I asked him to tell me how he came by them; he told me that he got them of a person that sent him them to kill. I asked him if he could not inform me his name, he said he could not; then I asked him whether the person sent him them or brought them himself; he said that a drover brought them. I asked him the drover's name, he said he could not tell; that is all that past.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you clear that they were part of the sheep you had bought, and that these were the sheep you had lost. - A. I bought the sheep myself; Mr. Bunnell was with me at the time I bought them, and I am very clear to these being part of the sheep that I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the skins and the head here. - A. Yes. She skins stink very much; I have both the skins and the heads.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Are you at all able to six the time when the sheep were lost. - A. I cannot be positive, I cannot say the time; this is one of the heads bought of Mr Ebb, there is red a cross the nose.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is very plain to be seen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Swain. Here are four heads marked the same. This is another, he has disfigured the appearance of the skin; this head was marked across the nose, it was one of Mr. Ebb's, he has marked this skin down the back to disfigure it. This is another skin, he has been putting the mark on the back; this had the reddle on the shoulder, that is one of Mr. Billing's; they have put the additional mark on the nose to make them all look alike.</p>

Most of the questions that were put to him were by the keeper of the house of correction; he was asked whether he knew any thing of the sheep belonging to Mr. Bunnell and Mr. Swain; he several times declared that he knew nothing of it; the governor then said as that is the case lock him up again; one of the turnkeys was going to take him away; when he was going out of the office, he acknowledged that he was one of the men that did drive the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us the very words he said. - A. He said, I did drive the sheep, I was one of them; that Moore and himself were engaged to drive them for the other prisoner, he said, for the butcher; he did not mention the name of Rudd; and Moore was engaged to pay him, and he thought he had done no hurt. After that he mentioned which way he drove them, that was up the New-road to Hyde Park corner, through the turnpike, and there he enquired which was the way; he drove them to the butchers; he had seen Rudd then at Queen-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the conversation all at one time. - A. No, it was not. When he said Moore was engaged to pay him, he drove them to the butcher's, he thought he had done do harm, that was at Queen-square; Rudd was taken there and I took Donnovan there. It was after he had seen Rudd he said he was the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say why he enquired the way. - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood that he and Moore drove them. - A. I did. He saw 
               <persName id="t18080113-40-person441">Moore</persName>
             the next morning; he asked him if he had lost any of the sheep, as it was a dark night; he said he believed he had not. I believe the publican will testify them words.</p>
               <p>MR. CARPENTER. Q. You keep a public house. - A. Yes, at Pimlico. It is called the

Nothing but the questions I put to him when Mr. Swain and Bunnell were looking at the back part of the premises; I questioned him how he came by the sheep, he said he bought them at Smithfield yesterday, of Mr. Ireson; I broke the stable door open and found the fourteen sheep; he afterwards told me that two men sent them to him to be slaughtered, just as I was carrying him to prison.</p>

             of Islington brought me the twenty five sheep, in the road near Bagnigge wells, to deliver to Mr. Rudd at Chelsea; I drove them there, and Rudd received them of me; he asked me where Moore was, I told him; he told me he was gone to Smithfield to settle his books. The next day I went to Rudd's to see the sheep were safe delivered. Moore paid me, and I knew not that the sheep were stolen, or else I would not have drove the sheep; I was in no ways concerned in this transaction no more than being willing to earn a few shillings. On the next day I saw Moore, he is a master drover; he gave me part of a pint of beer and some beef steaks; he parted with me; I did not know they were stolen. I trust you will restore me to my family of infant children; I am their only support.</p>

               <p>Court. Are you sure it was the other man that you saw. - A. Yes, I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Rudd called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>[The COURT, after recapitulating the whole of the evidence, added] -</p>
               <p>How RUDD could suppose that a man like Donnovan could have come possessed of these sheep to bring them to him to slaughter, we must judge from his conduct. When asked by the witness where he got them, he first said he bought them in Smithfield market of Mr. Ireson; he might have called him to prove it. He is afterwards asked how he came by them, then he says he got them of some other person to kill; who that person was, he could not tell. He is asked if the person brought them himself - he said a drover brought them; who that drover is he cannot tell. He is asked whether he had any other sheep besides these seen by the witnesses - he said he had no other sheep. - When these fourteen sheep were found in his stable, being called on for his defence, he tolls you he did not know they were stolen, they were brought to him by Donnovan; therefore he would have you suppose that Donnovan stole them.</p>
               <p>DONNOVAN's case stands upon his own confession. He is asked, after he was apprehended, if he knew any thing about the sheep - he said, over and over, he knew nothing about the sheep. He would have said, if he had been an innocent man - yes, I know who employed me. When he is ordered to be locked up, he then said he drove the sheep, and he had them of Moore to take them to the butcher. That there was a connexion between these two men Mr. Carpenter has proved. On the Monday Rudd was at his house in the evening, and the boy told you he was sent for him between seven and eight o'clock, and he saw Donnovan at the place where his master kills the sheep. On the 29th Mr. Carpenter has told you these two persons were in his house for about an hour, they were together; there it a connecting proof of these two prisoners being together about the time the offence was committed.</p>

               <p>The case against RUDD is - he is found in possession of the sheep, and the false and contradictory account how he came came by them.</p>
               <p>Against DONNOVAN is - he drove them there, and his denying he drove them. His defence is - he thought the person who brought them came by them honestly. - Donnovan's confession can have no weight but against himself. - You will consider the evidence against one prisoner distinct with respect to the other, and judge how far either of them, or both, are innocent or guilty.</p>

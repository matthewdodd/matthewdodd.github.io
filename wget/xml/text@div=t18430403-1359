                  </hi>. I live in Dalgeish-street, Limehouse. I know Captain Mitchell, of the ship <hi rend="italic">Graham</hi>—he sailed last April, and entrusted me to receive 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month to send to his parents, at Hull—I had a note from Mr. Weldon to the owners of the ship at the counting-house in Cheapside for the money—I received it four or five months, on account of Captain Mitchell—I gave the advance note to Mr. Rowe, the clerk—I have known the prisoner since he was a child—he said he would take the trouble to receive the money for me, as he passed the door of the counting-house every day—he received it for me up to the month of March—he brought it me the first time—I asked him how it was he did not bring it any more—he said he sent it away—I said that was very well—I always asked if he had sent it—he said, "Yes"—I asked him about it in March—he said he bad not got it, as there was a little bother about the ship, but he said, "I will get it to-morrow"—he then did not come for three or four days; in consequence of which, I received a letter from him—I know it to be his writing—it said he was going to remove—I became alarmed about the money, and went with an officer in search of the prisoner, and found him in Norfolk-street—he told the officer he had sent it away by post—at the station he said he had not sent it, but made use of it.</p>

Captain Mitchell is captain of the <hi rend="italic">Graham</hi>—he is entitled to draw a monthly note in favour of Mr. Weldon—this note was left with Fairbairn—Mr. Finlay leaves the money for Mr. Weldon, and Fairbairn had to receive it for Weldon, the chief officer of the ship—I paid it to the prisoner in March, for Fairbairn—I should have paid it to her if she had come—she was not well when she came the last time, and I said, "Leave the note with me"—she said, "I will send some one for it"—I said, "Leave me the name," and she left, "Napier"—I put the name in the corner—when the prisoner came he answered the descrip<lb></lb>tion, and I paid it him—when I paid the money I parted with the reeponsibi<lb></lb>lity—Mr. Finlay had no other responsibility about it, nor any share in it—if anything, it was the property of Fairbairn.</p>

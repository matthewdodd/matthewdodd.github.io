I sat up, and missed my coat - the landlord and I went out in search of the prisoner; we went to Church-street, St. Giles': a woman there gave us information.</p>

We went on Thursday and stopped the prisoner in the street, going to the workhouse; we got an officer, and she was taken -I asked if she had left us for good; she said No, she was going back that night - Norton's wife then said, "How came you to serve me as you did?" she began to cry, and said, "Don't knock me about, but take me to the watch-house;" I mentioned to her that we had lost a blue coat, a silk handkerchief, and a case of razors - she said, "I am guilty, but don't knock me about."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep the Queen's Head public-house, at Pinner. The prisoner lived with me three months, as servant—she left on Monday, the 18th of May, and left her box behind to be called for—I sent for a policeman on Saturday—her box was corded, but not locked—she was to have removed it that day—on opening it, I found some of my property—there was an ostler and pot-boy in the house, and lodgers—I baa missed some of the articles for some days—they were taken from my drawers—her box was left in the passage.</p>

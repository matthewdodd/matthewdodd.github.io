I being ignorant of any thing of the king, unfortunately took up the four shillings; and the constable came and said, we must go over to the justice immediately. When I came back again I presented the four shillings to him, and he said he would not take it back again by any means.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you search her? - I did. The prosecutor was very violent in his charge, persisting that she had got a guinea from him. I made a search as far as decency would permit, and I could not find any thing. He then exclaimed violently that then she had gorged it; I thought he meant she had swallowed it; I said, if she has swallowed it you must not expect to have it; he said, perhaps she has put it in another place; and I said, you may search her, I will not; and he did; he said, it is here, and pulled it out. When<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280013"></xptr>he presumed to search her there, she says, why you have been there before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That gentleman put his hand into his pocket and gave me a guinea or a shilling, I don't know what it was, and he said he had given a guinea, and he would have it back; I said, I could not give him back; I said, I could not give him back what he had given me; and then he said he would give charge of me for robbing him of a guinea. I have witnesses of the four shillings that he received.</p>

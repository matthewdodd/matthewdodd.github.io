                  </hi>. I am a shipwright, and live in Burr-street, Lime-house. On the the night of the 4th of April, I met the prisoner in Mile-end-road, from a quarter past nine to ten o'clock—she asked me to go home with her—we walked up and down Mile-end-road a long while—I found she had no place to take me to—we went into a public-house and had a pint of porter—she then came out—we walked about, and she took me into a bye-place and took the watch from my pocket, and my money, likewise—two half-crowns I can swear—I think there was other money—I cannot say when I had seen my watch—it was near twelve o'clock when I missed my property—we had been in the bye-place some time, and then I went after her—she was crossing the road, I asked her for my watch, and she gave it me immediately—I had given her nothing—she had asked for nothing—we only a pint of porter.</p>

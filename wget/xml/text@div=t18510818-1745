                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-serjeant, M</hi> 35). On 9th Aug. I saw the prisoners standing talking together in Dock-head, about a quarter before 9 o'clock at night—they went down Thornton-street, and into Free-school-street—I fol<lb></lb>lowed them, and in going I saw White put his hand into Jones's hand, as if he gave him something—Jones crossed over and went into a baker's shop—White stood nearly opposite—I followed Jones into the shop, and he was taking up a penny loaf—I asked the baker what money Jones had given him—he said, "This sixpence"—pointing to a sixpence which he took up, and said it was a bad one—I told him to detain Jones—I went out to White and asked him what he had about him—he did not say anything—I commenced searching him—he got his hand in his right-hand trowsers-pocket, took his hand out, and something fell out, which I saw was a sixpence—it was picked up by a byestander—I lost sight of it—White then got his hand in his pocket again—he took it out, and something fell out of his hand, which I saw was a shilling—I saw it picked up by a stranger, and it was given to me—I tried it and it was bad—White struck me three or four times in the face, and attempted to get away—I received this sixpence from Mr. Kegan, at the station.</p>

               <p>I am a publican. On October the 9th, in the evening, between the hours of seven and eight, a man came into my house, in Coppice Row, and said, Ellis, I believe there is a man knocking up forae pewter in such a house in Coppice Row; it is a shell of a house, the corner of Bowling Grden Lane, Coppice Row. I went to the window of the same house, and when I came there, the man made his escape out of the door; I pursued him, and took him in Baker's Row. The prisoner,

               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him? - No. From that I collared him, and brought him to my house, and set him down in the bar. He had pots in his apron, and he had something in his packets, which I did not take from him. I gave charge of him to a couple of patroles, who took him down to St. James's watch-house, Clerkenwell. I have got the pots here, two quarts and a pint; he had battered them with a brickbat the same way as they are now.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my pots. I can almost swear that they were scoured the same day as he took them. There is my name on them all.</p>

               <p>Mr. Ellis sent for me to take the man into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at the White Hart, Battle Bridge. I know the house perfectly well; if I am not mistaken, one Mr. Hamilton keeps it. I went there at one o'clock; I had a sheep's heart drest for dinner, and it being a rainy afternoon I stopped there till half past six o'clock that evening that these three pots were found on me. I believe I can prove I was there at half past six, and coming from the White Hart home to Mr. where I lodge, I found these pots and the bundle I am like wise charged with, altogether. It was in a place where there was a pump, and a little house there. I found the pots; I did not endeavour to nine them; I brought them in my apron along the road; I might have come many different ways not to have come through the town; and in the house that was opposite Mr. Ellis's I went to ease myself, and my foot slipped, and the pots made a noise, and that was what they heard. Whether they was bruised so in the fall, I must leave your Lordship to judge. However, that gentleman comes out to me when I got out again into the road, and said, what have got there? says I, I have got some pots, and he said, whose are they? I said, I did not know, and if they had watched me out, they might have found out whether I was the thief, and most likely the people that were the receiver of these things. I did not make any obstruction to being taken; I went very quickly into the house; he asked me if I would drink some gin? I was then intimidated, not so much for any thing, as for fear of going to prison to be ironed; a circumstance I never experienced before. However, I was taken by two watchmen; I did not appear that they gave any charge against me; I was then put backwards, it was three hours before I was searched; I then had time to ruminate, and consider of the unhappy circumstance. I knew there was a great deal of guilt Implied in having stolen goods in my possession. I had a bundle with me, and there was a hole in the wall, where I might have made away with the bundle, but I did not, but however, after that I was searched; I was taken to the magistrate's, at Hatton Garden, I believe, but before we went into court, they proposed to me to enter on board some of his majesty's ships, or to go for a soldier, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280045"></xptr>I absolutely must confess, that I was willing; they told me there was no fear if I was agreeable to do that; I told them it was not for fear of guilt, but for fear of being in a prison. I told them I was willing to go, and in any corps that they might think proper, but when I came to have the examination I was denied that.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

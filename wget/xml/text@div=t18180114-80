On that morning, when I came down stairs, I missed the articles stated in the indictment - I had seen them at half-past eleven the night before in the bar cupboard; the prisoner had not then left the house; I did not know that he was then in the house, but thought he was gone to his place. I heard of him the Friday week following-(looking at a letter)-it is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>ANN SMITH. I received the letter by the two-penny post, it is directed to me-(read)-"I write to inform you that I am in Horsemonger-lane; I hope you'll come and see me. I expect to come out on Monday. Come and see me, and I'll tell you all about it - You know what I mean-HENRY HALL." - I went to him, as I had some linen to wash for him, and asked him what brought him there? he said it was for making a riot in the street; I said, "No, it is for Mr. Stone's property;"he asked me how I knew any thing about it? I told him that Mr. Stone told me the officers had been there; I asked him where the property was? he said he sold the six tea-spoons to Mr. Bland, of Norton-Falgate - I asked him where the sugar-tongs were? he gave them to me out of his breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HALL. I took the prisoner into custody at Mr. Hase's shop, in Blackman-street, Borough, offering the tea-spoons for sale. I took him to Mr. Stone's - I neither threatened or promised him; he said he came down stairs about half-past three o'clock in the morning, opened the bar sliding-window, and took the spoons and sugar-tongs out; that he sold the six tea-spoons for 15s., and that he had the sugar-tongs about him. When I searched him I found a snuff-box, which he said he paid 3s. for, and he had 11s. left, and a comb, which he had bought with the money.</p>
               <p>JAMES BLAND. On the 20th of November the prisoner sold me the tea-spoons; he said they were his mother's, who was ill, and could not come out - I gave him 15s. for them, which is the full value as old silver. The tablespoons and sugar-tongs weigh five ounces and three-quarters, and are worth 30s.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have neither father or mother.</p>

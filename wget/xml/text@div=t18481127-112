                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 1, Rosemary-lane. On Saturday night, 3rd Nov., I was with Birch in the Prince Albert public-house, Tower-hill—as I went home, within twenty-five yards of my house, the prisoner, who is my daughter, came to me—she is about thirty-eight years old—her husband is a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man—she got into the house with me in spite of me, as I was taking the key out of the door—I could not get her out—I was ill, and threw off my coat and waistcoat to go to bed—I had eleven sovereigns and two half-sovereigns in my waistcoat—I counted it then, folded the waistcoat up carefully, put it down, turned round, and saw her with it under her arm—she threw it down—I went to it, and found nothing in the pocket—I called to my son, and sent him after her—she left her pattens and umbrella behind—she had followed me out of the public-house—I had given her and others some drink, and then walked out at one door, and she at the other.</p>

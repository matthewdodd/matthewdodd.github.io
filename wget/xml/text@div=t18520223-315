                  </hi>. I am an eating-house keeper, and live in High-street, Woolwich. In Dec, 1849, I was midshipman's steward on board the <hi rend="italic">Fire<lb></lb>brand</hi>—she was lying off Basica Bay, at Greece—the prisoner was gun-room cook on board—I had some money, bank-notes, and a Government security, amounting in all to 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—amongst it was the half of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, of the Ports<lb></lb>mouth branch of the Bank of England—I believe the number of it to be 23945—I made a memorandum, but having sent the other half away, I did not trouble myself any more about it—I had transmitted the other half to my father, at Portsmouth—I missed this money from a drawer in my berth, in the after part of the ship—the prisoner could not have access to it, that I am aware of, in the course of his duty; but I was in the habit of going away, and leaving the door open, and it was during that time the money was abstracted—on the occasion on which I was robbed I had left the keys in the drawers—after missing the money, I mentioned that I had been robbed of 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told the prisoner so—in about a month or six weeks afterwards the prisoner was invalided home—I arrived in England in July, 1850—when I</p>

               <p>got here, I caused a man named Robinson to he taken into custody for this offence, and he was tried and convicted at the Old Bailey—he was a man on board the vessel—the prisoner had been looked out for previous to my arrival in England, and on my arrival I was on the look-out for him—I charged both him and Robinson with the offence—I found the prisoner last Thursday three weeks, in the parlour of the Mitre Tavern, at Woolwich—I called him by his name—he looked round at me, and said, "Is that you, George Rice, who was in the <hi rend="italic">Firebrand?"</hi>—I said, "Yes;" and I said, "How about the bills you robbed me of?"—he said, "Come outside, and talk to me about it"—I refused to go out, and gave him into custody—the half-note which I lost was the right hand half—it was the half without the "Five" on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the porters on the South Western Railway, and live in Holies-street, Wandsworth-road. I have known the prisoner about three years—he came to me about two years ago—I could not say as to the month—he came to me at the railway—(he had previously sent me a note to say he was coming)—when he came I spoke to him, and we went outside to an hotel—he told me he had come away in such haste from Rochester, that he had left the half of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>-note behind him, and the other half he had unfortunately lost on board his ship—he told me he was cook or steward, and he had cut a note in half to send home to his friends in Rochester, and when he had cut it the bell rang for him, and he was called to go to the cabin, and while going a puff of wind <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> it out of the port-hole—he had come up to me to stop with me for a few days, and he told me he wanted me to go with him to the Bank of England to be answerable for this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, to stand surety, to be bail for him—I said I would, if he would write home and get the half-note—he did write before my face, and I sent a man with the letter to post it—an answer came the next day, about 9 or 10 o'clock—the letter came to the railway, it was directed to my care—the prisoner was with me at the time—I took the letter from the policeman at the gate, and gave it to the prisoner—he opened it in my presence, and produced the half note out of it—I took notice of the note—I could not swear to the number, though I looked at it several times—he</p>

               <p>asked roe to go to the Bank with him—I went with him, to be answerable for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—I offered to become security for him, but they would not take my security, as my name did not appear in the "Directory"—they wanted two they told me—I got a gentleman, named Groom, to be security for half the note—I was answerable to Mr. Groom, because he passed his name for me, knowing me so long—I had to pay him the money.</p>

            . I am a pencil-maker. I received information from Mr. Fitzgerald, and went down to Bristol on Tuesday, the 25th of October, in search of the prisoner; I went on board the James Cropper, bound for America, laying in the Bristol channel, and saw the prisoner, who I had known some time - I said, "I want you;" he said."Oh, Mr. Middleton, I am glad to see you, for it is the happiest moment I have had since I left home;" I took Smith, an officer, down with me - we did not hold out either threat or promise to him; we took him down to the cabin, and handcuffed him - he was a cabin passenger; he begged me to intercede that he should not be handcuffed. but I said he was in custody; he was searched, and a gold watch and chain found in his possession - I believe a bag of gold was found on him, and a musical snuff-box; in the course of the search we found two bags of gold - I observed to the prisoner that I thought the weight of the gold was not so much as he had; he said, "By G - d, Middleton, that is all I have got;" I requested him to give an account how he had spent the money, as I understood there was 455l. in gold missing; he said he would do the best he could to account for it, which he did - I have a paper in my own writing, taken at the time from his account - (reads) "We found in the two bags of gold about 312l. 10s. - he said he had paid for his passage 20l., musical snuff-boxes about 5l., a silver snuff-box 2l. 15s., travelling from London to Bristol, and contingent expences about 5l., a gold watch sixteen guineas, a gold chain 3l., the price of which was 10l, but he gave an old watch and 3l. for it, tailor's bill 5l. 13s. 6d., shaving-case 1l. books 1l., linen 2l. 7s., and portmanteau 2l." - that is all the account he gave.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he said at once he did not wish to disguise any thing, and would restore all the money he had? A. Yes, he made all the restoration he could.</p>

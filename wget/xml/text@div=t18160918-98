            . On the 5th of August, I left the Bull in Bishopsgate-street at about seven o'clock in the evening of the day in the indictment, I had been drinking there but had my property safe when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180067"></xptr>I quitted it; I was intoxicated. When I came from the Bull in Bishopsgate-street, I found I ought to have gone to the Bull in Aldgate; and I went on for that purpose. I missed my way, and fell asleep, and when I was awakened, I was told I was in the <placeName id="t18160918-98-crimeloc514">Islington Road</placeName>

I know I had my notes in my pocket book when I left the Bull; there were the notes stated in the indictment in it, and several papers and memorandums; I am quite sure they were safe. When I was awakened I missed my property. When I arrived at the Bull in Aldgate I had a two-penny flash note, which I had had for five or six years.</p>

             consequence of information I received, I wished to know how he came possessed of the property; he said his brother had given them to him, and his brother had found them. We insisted on knowing how he came possessed of the property, to discover if we had been robbed of goods or anything of that kind; then he acknowledged that he had met with a sailor at the Ball in Bishopsgate-street, and led him as far as Crown-street, Finsbury Square, and had taken his pocketbook, containing about thirty pounds; he afterwards met with Wiggins and divided the property. According to his account, Wiggins was not present at the robbery; I know nothing of Wiggins. The prisoner Gray had none of the property about him.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the last witness. On the 6th of August about ten in the morning, I understood that the prisoner Gray had found seventeen pounds; I saw the book and the notes; there was a ten-pound note, a five-pound note and two ones, I asked him where he found them, and he said opposite Shoreditch church. There was no leaf, memorandum, nor anything of that kind in the book; every thing was torn clean away. I informed the last witness. The constable took three pounds and a silver watch out of Wiggins's pocket; he said that watch he had bought.</p>
               <p>HENRY MACKRILL. I am a constable. Wiggins admitted that Gray gave him the property that was found on him, but he said he did not know Gray had stole them. I found a ten-pound note in the Kingsland Road, and the two-penny flash note, I got from Gray's mother.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COOPER. I am a weaver. I live at the prisoner Gray's masters; Gray came to me on the 8th of August, and told me he had found some money, and he gave me a ten-pound note, to ask me to take care of it for him; and I put it into my aunts lean is for safety; that was afterwards given up to the last witness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Her Majesty's Customs, and have been so six years next August—I am stationed in the port of London. On Tuesday evening, the 9th of May, about nine o'clock, I was in company with Davy and Allen, two other officers, at the top of Swan-lane, and observed the prisoner John Hackett coming in the direction of Fresh-wharf, towards Swan-lane—he turned round, looked in the direction in which I was, and started off immediately, down Swan-lane, running as hard as he possibly could—I followed, accompanied by my brother officers, from the top of Swan-lane to the bottom, fifty or a hundred yards—I raised a cry, and he was stopped by two policemen—I came up almost immediately—as he was run<lb></lb>ning he was unbuttoning his clothes, as I imagined—when I got hold of him I found his trowsers all down—I caught hold of him, put my arms round his loins—he began immediately to lay out with his hands as hard as he could at me, right and left—while struggling, he took the bottles out of his trow<lb></lb>sers, and threw one of them violently down on the ground—one was removed out of his trowsers—they were large glass bottles—the contents were emptied on the ground—I immediately stooped down, got a handful into my hand, tasted it, and found it was French brandy—there was a crowd assembled—the two policemen, and Allen, and Davy, were there—they proposed to take him to the station in the neighbourhood—we had gone scarcely a yard, when I received two or three violent blows on the right side of my head, which knocked my hat off—they were not given me by John Hackett—I had hold of him—he had struck me several times on the ribs and chest, from the effect of which I am labouring now—he said he would do for me if he was to be</p>

               <p>taken by us—he was so violent, I tried to handcuff him—I could not succeed—he got my finger into his mouth—the blow on the head was from a person I did not see—it made me stagger and reel about for a minute or so, before I could recover myself to turn round and see who struck me—it caused me to let go of John Hackett—the others took hold of him—in a few seconds after I recovered, I saw George Hackett at my back, in the policeman's hands—he was also taken to the station—as we were going, John was handcuffed, with his left hand to George's right hand—he made several attempts at blows at me in the coach, but was prevented by Allen—he said he would knock my b----brains out, making use of a very desperate expression, saying he should not always be in prison, and when he got out he should know where to meet us, and he would see my b----brains when he came out.</p>

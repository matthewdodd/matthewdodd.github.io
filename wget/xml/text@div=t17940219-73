               <p>Q. How do you know it was Whalley's house? - I enquired several days before he was taken into custody, and I saw him go in there and come out; and I found in possession of these articles James Simpson; I took Simpson and searched him, and found in his left hand waistcoat pocket forty-nine guineas; Simpson told me he knew nothing of Whalley.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Though you found them in a house that you was informed was Whalley's, yet you found the goods in possession of Simpson? - It was so; Simpson lodged there; Simpson came down naked and let me in himself.</p>

I told him I was a lodger in Mr. Whalley's house, and I gave him up the key of my box, and he searched me, and in my left hand waistcoat pocket he took out forty guineas; I told him what I had got, I bought them, and I would find where I had bought them. I lodged with Whalley, I lived with him for five weeks to this day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Green. Look at these goods produced by Fenner? - There is no marks on them, but there were three pieces of that colour came in the day before; the seal is cut off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Might not your fellow servant sell them? - He never sells.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you are out of the shop? - I never am out unless Mr. Mason is at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Other warehousemen and manufacturers have some of the same kind? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How would you distinguish it from that taken from any other warehouse? - I know it by the colour, that was the same, I cannot swear to the callimanco, I lost two pieces, but I cannot swear that these are the two pieces, but we missed such.</p>
               <p>Simpson. The night before that I was taken up these things were brought in to Mr. Whalley, by Mr. Mason's man, Mr. Mason's man complained that Whalley would not give up the full money, but always let money be behind, and I offered to let Mr. Whalley have some money to pay Mr. Mason's man. These are the same goods; but Whalley used always to cut the marks off the callimanco; he has brought in different pieces before, but I do not think any thing of this kind. I was taken the Friday morning the 7th.</p>
               <p>Court. These two pieces were brought in on Thursday? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Castle say where he came from? - I knew perfectly well where Castle lived, I knew him to be Mr. Mason's man.</p>

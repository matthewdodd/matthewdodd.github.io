               <p>Coming down Cow-lane, I met this woman and a child; the child was crying, and saying that was not the way home; I immediately went up to the woman, and asked her whose child it was; and she said it was her brother's; the child had no frock on; I asked the prisoner for it, and she made no reply; it was in her lap; and I gave it to the constable, who was coming past.</p>
               <p>(The frock shewn to the prosecutor by the constable.)</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this is laid to be a linen frock, and it is proved to be a cotton one, therefore you must acquit the prisoner under this indictment: but as I think this is a most aggravated crime, and little short of murder, this practice of stealing children and stripping them, which occasions such dreadful distress to parents, who feel, perhaps, as much for their children being lost, as if they were dead; I shall therefore order the prisoner to be detained,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150126"></xptr>and tried again when the indictment is properly laid.</p>

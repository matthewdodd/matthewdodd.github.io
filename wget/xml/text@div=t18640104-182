                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer's labourer, and live at 3, George-street, St. Giles—on Thursday night, 24th December, I was at a public-house, at the corner of Pancras-street—I was by myself—the prisoner was there—I left the public-house about 11 or a quarter-past—I was not tipsy, and I was not sober; I had a drop taken—I came out of the house by myself—the prisoner followed me out, and followed me <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the corner of Mortimer-market, the next corner to the public-house—he then tripped me, and knocked me down, and when I was down he kicked me in the hip, and my hip has been very queer since—he collared me, put his hand in my pocket, and took 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from me; there were two half-crowns, three two-shilling pieces, two shillings, and one sixpence—a constable came up and took him into custody—the prisoner was drawing his hand out of my pocket when the constable caught him—the money was safe in my pocket when I left the public-house. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

I am a coachman, and live 3, Market-street, Fitzroy-square—on Thursday night, 24th December, soon after 11, I was standing in Mortimer-market talking to a friend, and saw the prisoner trip the pro<lb></lb>secutor up—the first time he fell I did not take any notice, I thought they were both tipsy—they came on quite opposite me—I was not more than three yards from them when I saw the prisoner trip him up again, put his left arm on to his neck, and put his hand into the prosecutor's right-hand trousers pocket, and draw it from it—they were muddling together—Hickey tried to call "Police," and could not—the prisoner then jumped up and ran away—I followed him till the police took him into custody.</p>

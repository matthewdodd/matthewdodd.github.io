                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Green Gate, in the City-road. I was there on 19th May—the prisoner came between 8 and 9 o'clock—he asked for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of rum, and gave me a half crown—before I took it up I perceived it was bad—I called the head waiter, and he asked the prisoner if he had any more about him of the same sort—I gave the half crown to the waiter, Forder, and the prisoner offered me a good half crown—he went away, and the waiter followed him—on Wednesday, 21st May, he came again—I served him with 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of rum, as before—he gave he a bad shilling—I gave him change, and then recognized him as the man that had given me the half crown—he had got a little way out—I called the potman, and he followed and took him—I gave the shilling to Young, the potman.</p>

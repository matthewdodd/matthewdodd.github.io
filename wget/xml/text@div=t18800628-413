I am manager to Mr. William Heigham at the Hope and Anchor beerhouse, 9 Earl Street, Lisson Grove—on the 10th of May I closed my house at 12.30—I received information from the watchman—10 minutes previously to that I had seen the prisoner—he is a customer—he has not come to my house since the 10th of May—in consequence of what the watchman told me, I went with Inspector Clark to the first floor—the window on the landing was open and a pane of glass broken, by means of which the latch could be raised, and anybody could get in the windows and the staircase—a dung-cart was outside the window through which a person could get out of the bagatelle room—it is a lead flat—they could walk straight to the window—the blind had been pulled down—found it on the stairs—it was about 10.25, and about 5 minutes after I received information—I did not miss anything—I had seen the prisoner about 10 minutes before that time.</p>

I am a private watchman to Mr. Spencer, of Lisson Grove—on the night of the 10th of May I saw a man jump from a ledge at the back of the beerhouse on to a dung-cart in our mews, at about 10.20 p.m.—it is a flat roof which covers the kitchen—I ran after the man—he was carrying his boots in his left hand, and running on his stocking soles—he ran into Duke Street, through Devonshire Street and Exeter Street, where I lost sight of him—from his stature and build I believe the prisoner to be the man—I made a communication to Mr. Hill and I saw him go upstairs with the inspector.</p>

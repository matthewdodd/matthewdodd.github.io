               <p>Q. Did he appear to be in liquor. - A. He was very much intoxicated indeed. There were no other persons in the shop, but me and the prisoner at the time; I saw him with the plat leads cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. What is a plat lead. - A. It is what we use in our business; it is what we hold the reins down; some are a pound, and others more. I told the prisoner he had cut the plat leads off the tackling; he said he was drunk; he laid himself down on the ground by the plat leads, there were several cut off the looms; two looms were entirely stripped; and when I was going to carry my work down stairs to my master, I saw the prisoner coming from a loom that I had tackled the day before; he was putting something into each of his coat pockets. There were ten looms in the shop; he had cut the first and the last all the leads off.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he appear to you to be in liquor. - A. Rather so, he knew what he was about. I asked him if he had taken any thing out of the shop; he said, he had not. I put my hand to his pocket and found something heavy in it. I took him back with me; going through the yard, he put two of the plat leads out of his pocket on the lid of the window; I picked them up and took him into the warehouse; I searched his coat pocket and took ten more out.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this twelve pieces of lead. - A. Two shillings.</p>

I looked at them - he then said he had just had them from the Bank - he went away. I showed the money to my cousin, and then put it on the drawers in the parlour, separate from any other money. In about two minutes he returned, and said if I would let him have another frock, for his companion, at 3 d. less, he would have another - I agreed. He said</p>
               <p>"Give me 9 d., and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150047"></xptr>will give you 5 s." I went and took his own sixpence, which he paid me before, gave that to him with 3 d. and put the five shillings with the other four - nobody but my cousin had access to it. I paid two of the nine shillings away in the course of the day. Next morning my attention was called to the remaining seven, and found they were all bad, and quite new; he was apprehended next day. He told the officer he found them by his watch-box.</p>

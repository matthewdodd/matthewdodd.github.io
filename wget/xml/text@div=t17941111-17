               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to your house the 22d of September? - Yes, I do, she had a pint of beer, I had been out after the pots and it was eleven o'clock when I came in, she had been in before that, she went to go out, and I told her she had not paid for the beer; she said she had paid my master; my master was in the cellar, I called down to my master, and he said she did not pay him; and she went out, and I followed her out, and brought her to the rails, and I said, sir, has this woman paid for the beer? and he said no; by that time he came up; then she paid him for the beer,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110044"></xptr>and my master said she has got something sticking out of her pocket, see what it is; then I put my hand down to her pocket, and I said, sir, it is one of your pots, and he detained her till a constable came, I marked it in two places then, and it has been in our house ever since; I put two P S on it, one is at the bottom and the other on the side, I marked it with a screw; I can swear this is the same.</p>

S. on it; and I have had it under lock and key ever since; I have not mixed it with any other.</p>

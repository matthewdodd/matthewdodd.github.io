I called Stop thief! he was pursued, and in about half an hour I heard the man and the watch were taken. I cannot say the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . I live at Kensington. I saw the prisoner running across a grass field by the road, about half-past eleven o'clock - he jumped over a fence into a ditch, and ran along the ditch - I stopped him, he took hold of a tree, and got out of the ditch; I seized him again, King came to my assistance, and as we were taking him back he slipped his arms out of his jacket, and got away. We took him again. Gallon found the watch in the hollow tree.</p>

            . I heard the alarm, saw the prisoner come out of the ditch, and go to the tree. Gray secured him, he got from him, but was taken again directly. Some men came up, said he was not the man, and called out to knock the man down who held him. Three men went towards the tree, I followed them, one of them had his hand in the tree when I went up; they said the watch was not there, and wanted me to go to the next tree, but I shoved them away, and found the watch there.</p>

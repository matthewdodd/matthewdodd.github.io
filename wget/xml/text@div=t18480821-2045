                  </hi>. I am a short-hand writer. On Friday even<lb></lb>ing, 28th July, I was present at a meeting at the Chartist-hall, Webber-street, Blackfriars-road—I got there a few minutes before eight—about 150 persons were then assembled—the number afterwards increased to the extent of between four and five hundred—they consisted of mechanics—the defend<lb></lb>ant presided as chairman—he was not in the chair before I got into the room, but a few minutes afterwards, as the numbers gradually increased, the chair<lb></lb>man and other parties appeared on the platform—he took the chair without being moved in—he addressed the meeting in the first instance—I took a note of his speech, and have it here—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"Ladies and Gentlemen, we have met this evening to give utterance to sentiments of sympathy in behalf of a people who have suffered the first shock of the tyrant's vengeance. Whether the intelligence that was received, and generally circulated yesterday, is correct or incorrect it still requires some time to elucidate; but it is very evident that the excuse, and the lame story told by Sir George Grey last night in the House of Commons, tallies very ill with what appears this morning in the papers. A newspaper when it receives intelligence from its correspondent at a distance, know whether to place confidence in the man or not; and it is not likely that so many correspondents would put their heads together to send one and the same story to this country by express, and then the next day contradict every word of it. They must. have stated, the correspondents themselves must have acknowledged, this morning, that they were gross liars, and it is not very likely that they are going to do that for their employers; or else they must have stated that they fell asleep from over fatigue, and dreamt all about it. However it is very evident something is going on in Ireland; what it is we do not exactly know, but it is quite evident this Government is afraid of what is going on in Ireland—(cries of "let us go on here, now is the time)—Gentlemen, if I am your chairman this evening, I hope you will keep order, and if any gentleman makes use of expressions in the body of the Hall, I hope none of you will pay any attention to him, for depend upon it that Gentleman has not any good intention towards your cause, for it is the way in which all Govern<lb></lb>ment spies attempt to get up a disturbance in public meetings; now be upon your guard, I beg of you, for it is quite evident they are sent on purpose to do such things—(a voice, "they ought to be kicked out")—if you are not satisfied with <hi rend="italic">this</hi> meeting, and if you have got anything to say, I shall be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210226"></xptr>
               <p>happy if you will come on the platform and say it, and all the company besides. I beg of you to have a little patience; do not mind the interrupt<lb></lb>tion, pay no attention to it, that is the best way to get over it—there can be little doubt, as I was stating to you, there must be something doing in Ireland of an extraordinary nature, because even in this day's paper, in the organ of Government, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, it mentions the fact that 400 war<lb></lb>rants have been issued against the confederate leaders, by the Lord Lieutenant, in one day; that does not look amicable, or as if things were going on peaceably and quietly. It is stated how many forges were ringing with the manufacture of pikes, in defiance of the police and the authorities. Troops have been leaving every morning from London and other parts to go to that unhappy country, as I must call it. But nevertheless, it is evident that whatever has been done, they have stood the shock very nobly, if shock it has been. There can be very little doubt the sword is drawn and the bullet is flying on the other side of the channel—(Loud cheers)—our rulers may attempt to disguise the fact, but the truth will ultimately come out. There can be no question about it at the present moment, that we are in a very precarious situation: it is for us, however, to remain quiet, and not commit ourselves in any way; and I trust any gentleman who comes up here to say a word this evening, will be very careful of his language, because a very good authority; and we, the Chartists, have great confidence in his authority on law; informed me to-day that this was, according to the new Act, a seditious meeting. However, Gentlemen, I have not withdrawn from what I promised the learned counsel, and that was to take the chair this evening, although he informed me it was seditious; but I trust none of you will allow me to answer for your crimes, it is quite enough if I answer for my own, and all the words upon this Bill I hold in my hand, and all the expressions I have given utterance to I have no objection to go into a Court of Justice and defend, without the aid of Counsel. I do not want any attorney to pick out a flaw in the indictment, or any forensic oratory to get me off; I stand by the principles mentioned in the Bill; I stand by the words I have used, but I hope and trust you will be careful in what you say, for I am answerable for everything you say this evening, the same as if I spoke it myself. With these remarks, Gentlemen, as there are several resolutions to come before this meeting, I trust none of you will overstrain your language; no doubt many of you are warm and enthusiastic in it, and perhaps might feel the spirit rising as it did in Douglas, and you might perhaps say you 'longed to follow to the field some warlike chief, but you must not say that here. With respect to that unfortunate country, Ireland, there can be no doubt also that our Government has sent some of the very harshest—to give it the mildest term—the harshest of their Generals. The last new importation, the oriental slaughterman has been sent over; that gentleman has been sent over, no doubt, for the purpose of slaughtering our Irish brethren, doing it in a Sikh fashion; but it is to be hoped that he will find even a tougher foe than the Sikh was. That General, not to call him by a more harsh name, that human butcher, was in the habit of tying his red bandanna to his bloody sword, and waving it in the air as a signal telegraph to his troops to go in and cut down women, men, and children who came in reach of the weapon. Is he gone to Ireland to do the same thing? He is gone, but whether for that purpose or for a more amicable one we have not the opportunity of knowing. With these few remarks, Gentlemen, I will sit down, and call upon your old friend—and I also beg to state, before I sit down, that it may create no confusion hereafter, that as we are only working people who have got up this meeting—you know a meeting of this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210227"></xptr>
               <p>description cannot be got up without expense—and therefore there will be a collection this evening for the purpose of defraying the expense. I hope we shall hare many such numerous meetings as we have now, and as peaceable as the last time we met in this Hall. With these remarks I will sit down, and call upon your old friend and warden, Mr. Keene, to propose the first resolution; and he will also read you a letter from an individual you will be happy to hear would have attended this evening, were it possible; and also, I may state that even the Government hirelings of this country are beginning to use the victims at present in their possession rather harshly; although the Defence-fund has paid for the maintenance of Mr. Vernon in prison, to exempt him from labour, nevertheless he has been forced to pick oakum until his fingers were blistered. This is no flying report; I have had it to-day from the lips of Mrs. Vernon herself; and also I have seen a letter from Dr. M'Douall, which you will soon have the miserable pleasure of reading to<lb></lb>morrow in the 'Star.' That gentleman was thrust into a cell through which the hot water pipes passed, for the purpose of conveying hot water to other apartments of the prison, and there they kept him stewing, I cannot give it any other name; for hoars, until he refused to complain, because it only gratified them; and this gentleman was obliged to take off his coat, waist<lb></lb>coat, and trowsers, and stand up in a corner of the cell to keep life, soul, and body together—(Loud cries of shame). That is the state of your Govern<lb></lb>ment, and the resolution therefore calls upon you loudly to sympathize, par<lb></lb>ticularly with your Irish brethren, who no doubt are suffering similar acts of outrage and violence."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was that speech received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With cheers—a person named Keene then spoke—in the course of his speech he said: "Mitchell saw the misery his country was suffering under; Mitchell knew he must be a sacrifice, but he was willing to be a sacrifice, if by—that sacrifice he could rouse his countrymen to a perfect knowledge of what their rights were"—(three cheers for Mitchell were then given)—the resolution that was proposed by Mr. Keene was, "Resolved, that this meeting views with feeling of distrust and alarm the measure adopted by Her Majesty's Government, and sanctioned by the Im<lb></lb>perial Parliament, for the repression of public opinion in Ireland, as tending to the final severance of all amicable relations between the two countries; and this meeting is further of opinion that the Irish people are fully entitled to a free and independent parliament, and therefore resolves to render to their patriotic brethren in Ireland their cordial sympathy." After Keene, a person named Pedley spoke—the following is a passage in his speech: "I believe, Mr. Chairman, the fact is this, that Ireland is in arms; that they are fighting there; I trust they will speedily gain a victory, and God speed them in their cause!"—that was received with cheers—the resolution was then put by the defendant to the meeting, and carried unanimously—Shell then spoke—I took his speech—Mr. Counsell also took it—we each took the meeting throughout—Shell proposed the second resolution—it was this: "Resolved, that this meeting do solemnly protest against the base and unconstitutional act of the British Legislature, as committed by them in the suspendin? of the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland; and, further, do hereby tender to Feargus O'Connor, Esq., M. P., and to those gentlemen who supported him, our best thanks for their manly and patriotic conduct on that occasion; and, further, that we do hereby solemnly pledge ourselves that we will render in the hour of trial our full aid and co-operation to our Irish brethren"—I did not take that part where the defendant introduced Mr. Rooney to second a resolution—I have Rooney's speech—he said, "Mr. Chairman, Englishmen, and Irish<lb></lb>men too, I don't know that I am in my place to-night in seconding this reso<lb></lb>lution;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210228"></xptr>
               <p>I only come among you as a visitor, but I wish to ask you one or two questions, and I take the opportunity of seconding the resolution to ask to ask you—I wish to know, has organization done its duty among you?—are you satis<lb></lb>fied, Englishmen, that the troops of Britain are sent to slaughter your fellow<lb></lb>men in Ireland <hi rend="italic">I</hi> Are you satisfied? We are not satisfied, and we are come to the determination, and let the reporter hear me, that sooner than any shall leave London for Ireland, they must leave it across our corpses (cheers); I made a vow a month ago that I would never say anything at a meeting again; but you must pardon me to-night, for the future nothing but action is required for men; I beg to second the resolution"—there were some words at the con<lb></lb>clusion which escaped me—Mr. Counsell's note is fuller than mine—after that the defendant spoke again—he said, "I rise for the purpose of answering the two questions Mr. Rooney has required to have answered. One was, whe<lb></lb>ther we were organized or not? You are aware we are organized, and that all the acknowledged Chartists belonging to this Hall are organized, and under the proper officers; but every individual who comes into this Hall is not under organization, therefore we have no control over them. The other ques<lb></lb>tion was, whether you were satisfied with the present abuse towards Ireland.? '(cries of 'No!') and whether you would co-operate, and whether you are willing, that is, the organized part of you, because the others are of no use to any party, whether those who belong to the organization are willing to co<lb></lb>operate with the confederates (cries of 'Yes! ') It bas been said some time ago, that the confederates would not come over to us, and that we must go over to them; but this evening is a contradiction to that statement, for the confederates have come to you, and they are willing to co-operate; and I trust Mr. Rooney, when he returns to his club, will inform them that the organized Chartists of the South Lambeth locality, are willing to go hand in hand with any scheme that the confederates have for the amelioration of Ireland"—immediately after that Rooney said, "I beg to tender the best gratitude of the John Mitchell Club, for your sympathy with their unfortunate countryman, and I hope"—there was an interruption there—something was said about a nod being as good as a wink to a blind horse, but I did not write it down—Mr. Counsell has it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. You have mentioned that I took the chair without any cere<lb></lb>mony? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear you proposed into the chair—you seemed to me to take it as a matter of course, as if there had been some previous arrangement—no one interrupted me in taking my report—I asked for accommodation as soon as I entered the room, and stated the purpose for which I came—I took, the whole of the meeting verbatim, not merely the heads—there was so much confusion, that if any proposition was made for you to take the chair, I did not take it.</p>

But with all these disadvantages, I do not despair of being</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210230"></xptr>
               <p>able to show you that the part I took in the political sympathy with my brother democrats was nothing more than a justifiable right, inherited by all freemen; nor are you to suppose, because I stand before you unassisted by counsel, that I do so for the purpose of creating sympathy in my behalf I do it from a conviction that any one of you, similarly situated, and having the least regard for your word and honour, would have acted the same; neither are you to suppose that my political associates have abandoned me to my fate; on the contrary, I was no sooner arrested than professional aid was tended and refused, on the ground that however learned the advocate might be or how<lb></lb>ever conversant with the intricacies of his profession, conviction would follow conviction, until once that class of society out of which juries are composed become convinced that to coerce the working classes is but the steppin-stone to their own political and social degradation. I have no doubt that most of you have presided at a public meeting during some period of your life, and, therefore, you are aware that some warmth of language is required on the part of the chairman, that the audience may be made acquainted with the nature of the motives for calling them together; and if I, on the 28th ult., while acting as chairman, gave utterance to language con<lb></lb>trary to law, it was nevertheless dictated by views of humanity. We had received the day before, by public intelligence, a brief account of Irish dis<lb></lb>turbances; and as that people were struggling for political freedom, with<lb></lb>held from them by the same power that kept us in political thraldom, it was but natural we should tender our sympathies at such a crisis, and particularly when our grievances were so closely allied; and I do not think there was anything dangerous in the reply I made to Mr. Rooney, that we were willing to co-operate for the amelioration of the Irish people; common courtery required me to say as much, seeing that that gentleman headed a deputation of fifty members from the Mitchell Club; and certainly, had I returned a less favourable answer, there can be little doubt that a disturbance would have been the consequence, because there were a great number of policemen in disguise, in the room at the time, and they had made several attempts to disturb the meeting during the evening, and a greater number outside fully armed and ready to act at a moment's notice, fully determined to break up the meeting if possible prematurely. I was aware of their intention both inside and outside the room, for I had just received a note from one of those sent to watch their proceedings, telling me to endea<lb></lb>vour to keep order if possibly could, because, said he, 'the butchers outside," this is the policemen, I do not disguise the fact, "are evidently bent on: slaughter, and all they want is a pretext to begin." That the police are capable of doing such things you are all very well aware, from the late in<lb></lb>vestigation into the Bishop Bonner's-field police onslaught. It appears, however, that I conducted the meeting to its close without the least approxi<lb></lb>mation to disorder. Then as for putting the public into great alarm, as the learned gentleman has stated, with respect to the Life and Property Protection Society, I can only tell him that such things are very common, and I should suppose he had seen similar societies in this country and other parts of Europe: it is certainly called a Life and Property Protection Society, and that was by the advice of counsel, and also by the advice of the Mayor of Nottingham, and the society founded in the city of Nottingham was approved of by the Mayor of that city; and our rules are the same. It has nothing to do with the Chartist Association, and in fact that society does not exist at the present. time in any locality that I am aware of, because it was assumed that the Chartist Association was sufficient to answer all the purposes. As for the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210231"></xptr>
               <p>organization that is merely an arrangement, as to the internalmanagement of the society, and the documents referring to it, can be purchased at any of the political booksellers for a halfpenny. With respect to Mr. Vernon and D M'Douall, if I had been allowed to have the documents in I could have shown you the very words I read in my speech—or I might have sent for Mrs. Vernon, who no doubt could prove that her husband has sent word to that effect; for she stated in the presence of several other people besides myself, that he had been compelled to pick oakum, and that Feargus O'Connor had been sent to about it. As for Mr. Keene's speech, I can see notthing that very material against me; the fact is, he had had intelligence which is confirmed by another gentleman, Mr. Cope, who belongs to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, that Ireland was in a state of disturbance; and surely it was no great harm to repeat at a public meeting, that which appeared in the newspapers. As for the witness Bywater, perhaps there is nothing very objectionable in his evidence, he found the trunk containing these papers unlocked; many of them are not my writing, nor has there been any proof that they are the minutes of any particulars produced at any meeting. With respect to the sympathy we held with the people of Ireland, it is quite clear they were in a state of disturbance at the time I presided at this meeting: and are we on this side of the channel to be deprived of the rights of humanity, and be come amenable to the laws for sympathizing with those on the other side? for who among you, if he has not drained his veins of the milk of human kindness, would not sympathize with an oppressed people, standing on the threshold of civil war, and unable to say how soon the same horrors might surround your own dwellings? Does it not make your blood run cold, when you think that the maladministration of our internal affairs has driven the people to such a course, leaving them no other choice than open insurrection or unregretted starvation? But do not imagine that the coercive measures lately enacted were framed for the purpose of suppressing the spirit of free<lb></lb>dom that is rising in the bosom of the honest mechanic will be laid aside when a few convictions have been obtained; on the contrary, when you have occasion to complain of ministerial oppression, and I do not think that many of you will say that the present Cabinet are doing that which is best calculated to promote contentment and prosperity in the country, that moment will you become subject to the same persecution, and those Acts of Parliament that have been framed to suppress us, will be unscrupulously used for your oppression; you may read a lesson of your future fate in the subterfuge which the present ministry resorted to on 10th April last, when the working classes of the metropolis attempted to exercise what has never been disputed to be a constitutional right,—the right of meeting and going in procession with the petition of their grievances to the Legislature. But, though they were determined to make no concessions, they were aware that there were sample reasons for complaining, and they felt no hesitation in raking up an obsolete act,—an act that had been consigned to oblivion for more than a century and a half, and one that had only been passed to prevent a debauched monarch from being interrupted in his royal revelries by the con gratulations of his loyal subjects;—I allude to the act of Charles II., which suppressed a constitutional right possessed by the people at that period: what are you to expect from such men as these, when you will no longer allow them to rob you with impunity? do you imagine that if Lord John Russell succeeds in suppressing the present discontent among the working classes, which is very doubtful, that he will next Session withdraw his bill for an additional income-tax, merely because it is not consonant with your</p>

               <p>wishes, or will he consult the necessity of ministerial extravagance and bring you to compliance by statutory and military coercion—every thinking man in this country follows some political creed, the principles of which either accord with his pecuniary interest or coincide with his con<lb></lb>scientious belief; and I have no hesitation in saying that I believe the Charter to be the best political creed that has been brought forward for the consideration of all classes. Its points are easy of comprehension, and its principles are honest. It does not offer concessions for one class of men, and refuse them to another; nor docs it involve the ruin of one set of men, as the necessary basis upon which another set are to flourish. Can there be any sedition in demanding for every man of sane mind, untainted with crime, and at the age of maturity, a voice in the election of the national representatives? Can it be sedition to demand security for that voice? Is it seditious to require the people's representatives to give an account of their delegation at shorter periods than they have hitherto done? or will it appear seditious to demand that a man of talent, without property, should have an equal right to a scat in the people's parliament which the man with property, but without talent, now possesses? Is it seditious to require that that man shall be remunerated for his labour? Or can you call it sedition to demand that each division of the kingdom be as nearly as possible equally repre<lb></lb>sented? Yet such, Gentlemen, is the sum total of all the points of the Charter—the meaning; of the principles of this new philosophy, which has frightened the Sovereign, alarmed the Ministry, maddened the aristocracy, and distracted the middle classes, but now reigns paramount in the minds of the people. Depend upon it, Gentlemen, when the people understand and adopt a line of policy, neither scaffolds, nor dungeons, nor shackles, will arrest their onward career; nor will unprincipled oppression annihilate their power. You may do as Castlereagh did, thirty years ago, with the Radicals in the west of Scotland, when he emptied the gaols and bridewells of their criminal inmates, and set the felon free, that he might make room for honest Reformers: and although he brought some to the block, and sent some few into exile, yet radicalism prospered, and at this day stands high in the estimation of political reformers.</p>

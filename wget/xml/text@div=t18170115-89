I am the wife of the last witness; we were walking up Great Russell-street, about eight o'clock at night, I did not see the man till he came against us; I pushed him with my hand, thinking he was drunk; and my husband said, he has got my watch; I cried out stop thief! and ran after him down a dark street, I think, it was Holborn, I did not pursue him farther - I will not swear that the prisoner is the man; but I have no doubt of his being the man. When he was at Bow-street I picked him out from among several more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I told the magistrate I could not swear to him. It was five days after when I went to Bow-street. He was not pointed out to me, but I went there under the idea of seeing the man who had robbed my husband.</p>
               <p>Court. How many were by when you picked him out-A. I should suppose a dozen; my husband pointed out another, but I said the prisoner was the man.</p>

I am an officer; about a quarter past eight o'clcok, on the 8th of January, I was crossing Long-acre, opposite Bow-street, I saw the prisoner, with four others, they were coming from Hanover-street, and passed me quickly, towards Drury-lane, and at half-past eight o'clcok Wilkins gave information at the office, describing the prisoner, and said there were three or four other with him at the time, I apprehended the prisoner the next day; he was committed till the Monday following; I told Wilkins to stand in the room, and that the prisoner should be in the office - I took him there with five or six more, when Mrs. Wilkins picked the prisoner out. He was not pointed out by any person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was past eight o'clock. I should suppose that Russel-sreet is a quarter of a mile from Long-acre. The prisoner was taken the next day.</p>

               <p>Q. How near the office, called the Library, was the office Robson was in? - A. It is all on the same floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the care of it? - A. No; he had access to it, but not the care of it.</p>
               <p>Q. In this room you call the library, the marine accounts and log-books are usually deposited? - A. Not the marine accounts; the marine accounts are usually deposited in Robson's room. The logbooks, when they are bound, and a vast many other papers, are deposited in the library.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any occasion lately to get some papers in the library? - A. I had occasion about six weeks ago, from the present time, to go there.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the search which you made for some papers, did you find some deficiency of the papers? - A. Yes, in the library, and after they were taken up, I found a deficiency in Robson's room.</p>
               <p>Q. How many chests did you find empty? - A. I first understood thirty-seven; I suppose there were twenty-five or twenty-six; I did not look in all these chests.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiry of Robson respecting them? - A. On my missing the letters, I questioned Robson where they were; he said he did not know, but he would endeavour to find them; he said the papers in the library had been moved about by an alteration made in the opposite floor; I enquired daily for about a fortnight; he told me he did not know where they were; he told me one of the carpenters had removed them to a floor below; after a fortnight elapsed he went from the office; he was ill; I saw him about a week after that; he was requested to go into the board-room, there he was questioned whether the account of burning the letters, given by Collins, was correct.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Collins give any answer about the letters? - A. About three weeks after the papers were first missed, Collins said (he was desired by Robson to say), that he and Robson had burned several papers; I asked him what was the quantity, pointing to a bundle of letters; he said none were burnt but those that had burst in throwing down; he answered, there might be five or six of them bundles. I told him there were no bundles to be found from the year 80, down to the present time; he said they carried them out in baskets, and perhaps they might fill five or six baskets; I told him that could not account by any means for the quantity of paper lost; the next morning I was present; Robson was with Mr. Nelson, the Secretary; he was asked whether that account given by Collins was correct; he answered it was; he conceived there might be five or six baskets, and two more burnt by Collins and Newman; I asked him how many times they were employed in burning papers; he said four or five times; I asked him what time he said it was previous to ten o'clock in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present any other time that either Robson or Collins was questioned upon the subject? - A. Not any other time.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were taken up, you appeared at Bow-street. Did you hear the examination at Bow-street? - A. Yes; but I do not know any thing material that was said by either, only they were criminating each other. Robson, upon his examination, offered to appear against Collins, and Collins offered to appear against Robson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long has Robson been in the office in the present situation? - A. Thirteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not a great part of the property lost before he came in the office? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150044"></xptr>Q. Are they dated 93? - A. Some of the letters are dated 63 and 90, up to 93.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. Collins charged Robson with knowing nothing about it himself? - A. No; he never said he knew nothing about it himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not it in your knowledge that Collins voluntarily resigned himself up? - A. It is not in my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Were you present when this letter from Collins was given to the Board? - A. I was not; I never saw Collins's hand-writing.</p>

Yes, he had a room on the same floor with the library, and in his room the marine papers were kept in boxes; I cannot tell how many boxes he had.</p>
               <p>Q. On looking in Robson's room, have you found some papers missing? - A. A great many papers between the years 56 and 95; there were a great many papers missing and taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing belonging to Robson in any of the boxes? - A. There were in one of the boxes an American paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When was it you made your examination? - A. I did not take any particular notice of the day, it was very lately.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you had not made any examination a great many years before? - A. No, I do not think I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Robson came into the office in January 1803? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you say, for several years before; you made no examination? - A. No, not for several years; I have had frequent recourse to those boxes, but not lately.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, it is impossible for you to say in what state they might be in two or three years ago - now, in respect to the boxes, they were not immediately under his care? - A. Not immediately under his care; Mr. Robson had the care of that room where he was employed; it was called Robson's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Other people had access to it as well as he? - A. To be sure they had.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Collins say any thing respecting the paper? - A. Yes, he came in, and heard what passed; he said, what would I give a pound; I said, two-pence or two-pence halfpenny; I had not kept shop long; I gave him two-pence halfpenny; I said, shall I bring a bag, and take it away; Collins said, he would send it me; in the course of that day Greenwood brought it me; there were fifty pounds, more or less, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, at the time that Greenwood brought it, did either Robson or Collins come? - A. Yes, Collins came.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. We have proof that there was sold about half a hundred weight, worth ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Collins's defence. I never did any thing but under the direction of Mr. Robson.</p>
               <p>Robson's defence. In the present situation that I am now placed in, there are matters that I am now burdened with; my mother and sister died on the present account, and my father is unacquainted with the business, and my friends have not been with me all the time; I am left alone to your mercy.</p>
               <p>Robson called one witness, who gave him a good character; Collins called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Robson, GUILTY, aged 32.</p>
               <p>Collins, GUILTY, aged 35.</p>

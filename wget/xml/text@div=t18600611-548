                  </hi>. I am house surgeon to St. Bartholomew's—Mary M'Gettigen was brought there on the afternoon of 15th May with two cuts, one on the back of her left hand, injuring one of the leaders, and the other on the forefinger, dividing the leader in that situation, and opening the joint—it was a clean cut, and might have been done with some sharp cutting instrument; a knife would have done it—she will probably have a stiff finger for a considerable time, even if it eventually gets well—there were two severe bruises on the side of the head, one just behind the ear and another higher up, and there was a slight cut by the side of the neck, which, if it had been deeper, would probably have divided the jugular vein, but it was quite superficial; it was a clean scratch—she is still an out<lb></lb>patient.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 247). I took the prisoner on 16th May, on a warrant—I told him I wanted him for assaulting his wife, and cutting and wounding her with intent to do her grievous bodily harm—he said nothing; he was drunk—a few minutes afterwards his wife came out and began to quarrel about something which had occurred some little while before, about his living with another woman—I took him to the station and searched him, but found nothing—I do not know where the woman is, I have tried to find her—he was not so drunk as not to under<lb></lb>stand what I said; he could walk—he quarrelled with his wife as if he understood what she said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The woman has been in the habit of drinking a good deal lately; she had me arrested and I was sent to Holloway for a month's imprisonment: when I came out I went to ask where she had applied for relief. I would not live with her as she was addicted to drink. I went to her and she caught hold of my coat and tore it and, said that I wanted to bring w—s into the place. She struck me with a child's saucer and it broke in two, and her finger caught in it; if she was here she would tell you the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor—I carry on business at Marsh Street, Walthamstow—the prisoner was my landlord—on 24th June I left my shop at 6.30 in the evening, fastened up as usual, all the doors secured—I went to my shop at Forest Hill, and afterwards went back to Walthamstow, and got there about 9 o'clock in the morning, and went to my shop—I entered by the back door—as soon as I entered the parlour leading to the shop, I discovered the parlour window thrown up, and saw the prisoner helping himself to my goods, and putting them into a bag—I said "Mr. Bofiee, this is too bad; I have often been robbed, now I have caught you in the very act"—he looked confused, and said "Come let me out"—I unlocked the door leading from the parlour into the shop, and he came into the room—he came from the shop into the parlour—he said "We can settle this matter"—I told him I could not accept of any settlement at all—I looked into the shop again, and saw all the things about in disorder—I returned—he was still pleading for me to let him go—I said I could not do any more, but that I intended putting the matter in my solicitor's hands—he then seized me by the back of the neck, clutched his fingers under my throat, caught my beard, pulled me to the ground, and hit me a blow on the head with the door-keeper or some hard instru<lb></lb>ment—he said "You b——y b——r, I will do for you"—I said "Pray don't"—he said "You b——r, I will do for you"—he then hit me on the head once or twice, and put his hand into my mouth, caught me with his nails under the tongue, and loosened all my teeth—I screamed out "Murder!"—he gave me another blow on the nose and lip—I called till ex<lb></lb>hausted—my next door neighbour, Mr. Judd, came to the front door, a glass door—he could not get in there, and went round to the back premises, and just as he entered the prisoner made a violent blow at my temple—he disabled my left-hand, separated the ligaments of two fingers, and rendered them useless—he ran off when Mr. Judd came—I raised myself, and asked him to go for aisiatance.</p>

               <p>I said "See what Boffee has done," and pointed to the blood on my hand and face—I did not say a word to him about the robbery—the day of the assault was quarter-day—my son helped me in business—he was my partner, and he has taken goods from my premises, thinking they were at much his as mine—he is twenty-three.</p>

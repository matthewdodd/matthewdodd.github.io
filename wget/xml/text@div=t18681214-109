                  </hi>. I live at 104, Portland Road, Nutting Hill—I have a son named Walter Henry—on 12th November I was sent for, and found him sitting in a chair, in the parlour of 172, Portland Road, bleeding profusely from a wound in his back—the floor of the room was completely covered with blood—I said to the prisoner, who was in the custody of a constable, "Why have you stabbed my son? why have you done this unkind act of stabbing my son, after his kindness to you?"—he said, "I am very sorry; I obeyed the impulse of the moment; I do not know why I did it"</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, who is a broker—on 3rd November I levied a distress on the prisoner's goods—my father condemned them on the 9th, but I agreed to give the prisoner time to pay—he promised to find the money on the same night, and on the 12th he paid 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the balance was 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he promised to give me an I O U for that—on the same evening, the 12th, I called at his place with an I O U, and asked him to sign it—he said, "I shall sign no I O U, and I shall not go"—I said that I should know what to do with him—he rose from his seat, where he was reading, and as I turned to come out I received a stab in the back—I saw a knife in his hand, but there was no knife in his hand when I asked him for the I O U—when he stabbed me he said, "Take that, there is the signature to your I O U."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. What was the amount distrained for? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. £1; we arranged to allow you to take the things at the condemned price, which was a very low amount, and give an I O U for the balance of the expenses, and pay 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, as you liked.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman X</hi> 141). On 20th November, about 3 o'clock, I went to 172, Portland Road, and saw the prisoner coming from the house—I stopped him and asked him what was the matter—he said, "I have stabbed a man, in the heat of passion, I am very sorry for it, I am going to the station to give myself up"—I said, "You must come back with me"—I took him to the house, and saw the prosecutor bleeding from a wound near the shoulder—I asked the prisoner where the knife was—he said "Up stairs in my room," and gave the key to a woman, who brought it down; and he said, "That is the one."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 87, Clarendon Road—on 12th No<lb></lb>vember I examined the prosecutor and found an incised wound on his back, just over the inner and upper corner of the shoulder blade—an artery was severed, which was bleeding profusely—it was a dangerous wound, just over the lung, but the lung was not wounded—he has been under my care ever since—he will recover perfectly—it could be inflicted with this knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Were you not asked if the wound was dangerous, and did you not reply that it was not? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Yes, I did; I was justified in doing so, when my patient was bleeding and exhausted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. The prosecutor was put into my room for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

He refused to give any explanation, but said, "I shall know what to do." He picked up something from the floor and said, "I shall take all I can now, and distrain again." I had my knife in my hand, working on a boot, and I said, "Take that!" He cried murder. I did not intend to injure him to the extent I have done. I did it in conse<lb></lb>quence of his provoking way, and not arranging my affairs. I did not deliberate it, and had no idea a minute before that such a thing would occur.</p>

               <p>Second Count. For stealing the same lamb.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GIDDINS sworn. - I am a wheelwright at South Mims; I rent a little land besides; I had a ewe lamb that I kept down in the field; I missed it on the 27th or 28th of January; I had seven or eight lambs in the whole; they were marked on the side with 
               <persName id="t18030216-40-person256">T.G. </persName>
            my name; I found the skin on Mims Common, adjoining to my ground, about a mile off; I knew it be my skin; I have sold it since to a neighbour, Thomas Stanley, a butcher, in the place; I found the skin on the 31st of January.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Can you tell from the skin whether it was an ewe or wether lamb? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.You don't know whether it was a ewe or wether? - A.No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CHESTER sworn. - I am a constable; I searched the prisoner's house, and found a fore quarter of lamb, a leg, a blade-bone, and windpipe; I knew it belonged to an ewe lamb by the leg; the leg and quarter were behind an old bedstead up stairs; I asked him where he got it; he said, he found the leg, loin, and fore quarter; afterwards he said he found the whole sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to induce him to tell you about it? - A.No; he said the windpipe belonged to a sheep's head he bought at Barnet; by the size I knew it to be a lamb.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You call them lambs under two years old? - A. No, under one year old.</p>
               <p>Q. You have knowledge enough to distinguish whether it was a ewe or wether? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>CHARLES ALLEN sworn. - I searched the prisoner's house with the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you tell whether the joints belonged to a ewe lamb? - A. Yes, they did; he told us he had found the sheep, or a part of the sheep, in a sack, about two hundred yards from his own house; he first said he found a part of it, then the whole.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I found this about six o'clock going to my work; they asked if it was a whole sheep; I said, no; besides, it had not the head on.</p>

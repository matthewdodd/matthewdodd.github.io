            . I am constable of Hammersmith. I received a note from Mr. Burrage, and went to watch at his shop on the 19th of April - he deals in marine-stores. Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning I saw Hewitt go into the shop with a sack - Burrage went in after him; some time after I saw Minter go by, on the other side of the way, with a sack - I went over and took him; I took them both into custody at Burrage's shop, and saw both sacks emptied - they contained lead - I heard them say they found it that morning, while bird's-nesting - I went and saw the lead fitted to the top of Mrs. Humbert's house - it matched exactly - I have known Minter a long time, and have seen Hewitt before.</p>

            . I deal in marine-stores, I directed Edgson to attend my house on the morning of the 19th - at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon of the 18th the prisoners came and sold me an axe and spade; one of them asked if I bought lead - I said Yes; they said, "What do you give?" I said, 12s. 1cwt. - one of them, with an oath, said, "In the Dover-road we can get 16s." - I asked who from; they said, with some hesitation, "Mr. Homer, a lead-melter;" they went away, and at half-past seven o'clock in the evening they came with another person, and asked if I would give any more; one of them said, "We heard there was a stoppage at your shop;" I said that was immaterial to me, if the property was honestly got, there was the money; next morning, about seven o'clock, they came and said, "Master, we have got 1cwt." - I asked when they would come; they said, "In about an hour;" I said"Make it nine" - I then informed the officer, who came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. What is lead worth? A. I sell it for 14s. per cwt. in the market - my house is a quarter of a mile from Mrs. Humbert's.</p>

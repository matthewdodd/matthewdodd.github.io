            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Old-street. On the 20th of December, about one o'clock in the day, the prisoner brought a ring, and asked me to lend him 3 s. on it. I asked whose property it was; he said it was his own - that he bought it at Port Royal, in Jamaica - that his wife bought it, and he believed gave two dollars for it. I sent for an officer and gave him in charge. It is a brilliant diamond ring, worth from 50 s. to 60 s.</p>

This ring is mine, and was locked up in the drawer in my bedroom, at the top of the house. I also lost a garnet ring, worth 11 s., which I have not recovered. I always kept the key of the drawer myself. On the 17th, 18th, and 20th of December the prisoner was working at my house as a bricklayer's labourer, and went through that room to get on the roof - they left on the 20th; and on the 21st the ring was brought to me - I had not missed it. I found the drawer still locked - it must have been opened with a false key. I had worn the ring on Sunday, the 19th.</p>

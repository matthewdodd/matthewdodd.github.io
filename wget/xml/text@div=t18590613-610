                  </hi>. I am a cab proprietor of 7, Warwick-street, Golden-square—on 7th May, Rouse entered my service as driver, and on the 9th about 6 o'clock in the evening he went out with a cab and horse belonging to me—his time to return was 6 next morning—he did not return, and I did not see him till I found him in custody on the 15th—the cab, horse, and harness, were worth about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the cab in Rosemary-lane I think on Monday 16th—I went down to Stratford that day with an officer, and saw Through good at the Three Pigeons—the officer asked him if he had purchased a horse; he said that he had not, but he had exchanged a pony and given 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to boot—he afterwards took me to a field and showed me my horse—I saw Jackaman the same afternoon, and told him that he was wanted inside—he came in and the officer asked him if he had bought any harness, he said yes he had, and a pony of Rouse, and he asked him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the harness, that he knew nothing himself, but if we wanted to find out, we were to go and get somebody to find it out—I afterwards took him in custody.</p>

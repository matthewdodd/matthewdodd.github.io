                  </hi>. I am single. On the 24th of July, about ten o'clock, I was on the Lea-bridge, in Essex, going home—my father lives at Waltham<lb></lb>stow</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on the road to Waltham<lb></lb>stow, in the parish of Layton—I came up to the gig—the prisoner was walking towards London, and the gig going in the same direction—he was walking behind the gig, but doing nothing—when I came up to the gig it stopped, the gentleman got out, and the female was crying out—the prisoner was not near enough to hear what passed—in consequence of what was said, I turned round and took the prisoner into custody as soon as he came up—the female was close by, and said, "That is the man, take him, take him"—I took him into custody and asked him how he came to insult the young woman—he said he had not insulted any one—the young woman said he had attempted to rob her, in fact he had robbed her of a shilling—he said nothing to that—I took him to the cage at Woodford, and kept him in custody—the young woman was very much agitated at the time.</p>

I left my house at about seven o'clock in the evening of the 9th of December, perfectly secure in all respects; the window shutters were fastened on the inside. I returned at about a quarter or twenty minutes before eight; when I unlocked the door, the windows were strongly thrown open, and a man jumped out. I found the window<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100030"></xptr>open. He ran the extent of about fifty yards; I was never three yards from him; I cried stop thief, and a young man named Hunt caught him in his arms. Hunt and myself brought him back to my house, and sent for a police officer. We searched him; but found nothing on him, nor did I miss any thing out of the house. There was some dirt on the chair, under the window. I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. I am positive I put my shutters to, and fastened them; I can't say what makes me recollect that I did that night; but I am certain I did. The officer and I have had no conversation about what the reward is upon the conviction for burglary; I have heard that there is a reward. The prisoner jumped out of the window with his face towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there no place in any part of your room where the prisoner might have been concealed before you went out, without your knowledge - A. There might be, as under the bed, or such a place.</p>
               <p>Q. If such a person had been in your house, he might then have bolted out of the window in the manner you have stated - A. He might so, certainly.</p>

            . I was standing at my own door, in Long-alley, and I heard the cry of stop thief; I ran, and immediately caught the prisoner round the waist in my arms. The prosecutor was about two yards behind the prisoner. I delivered him into the custody of the officer.</p>

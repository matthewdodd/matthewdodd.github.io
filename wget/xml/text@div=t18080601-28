On Saturday morning the 14th of May I had been walking out; on my return home about seven o'clock I passed through the cloisters of the Bluecoat school, where I saw the two prisoners with two or three people standing by; when I came up to them Mr. Shaw, who was speaking to them, asked me if I knew any thing of the piece of linen, it was there present; I looked at it and instantly discovered it to be my own; I asked them how they came by it; Tyrell answered that a woman gave it her; I asked her if she knew that woman; she said she did not; not satisfied with that answer, I took charge of the linen and the two prisoners, and requested Mr. Shaw to fetch an officer; he did; I delivered them into his custody; the linen was in its proper place the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you left the shop - A. About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed from between five o'clock and the time you got home, you cannot tell - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>JOHN SHAW. On the morning of the 14th of May, about seven o'clock, from information that two girls had gone down the Bluecoat-school, I went after them. I found Simmons in possession of a piece of Irish linen, I looked at it and found it was not mine; I asked her how she came by it; she said a woman gave it her; as I was asking her these questions Mr. Trundle came up; I asked him if he knew that piece of cloth; he owned it; I marked the cloth with the initials of my own name, and gave the cloth to him, and went for a constable.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Trundle. On Saturday the 14th of May, about a quarter before seven in the morning the two prisoners came into the shop, they asked to see some shawls; I shewed them several, but none of them suited; the box of Irish linens were near them, with the lid off; the prisoner Tyrell looked at the shawls, and the other sat herself on the box of Irish linens; I found they were not likely to become customers, I declined shewing them any more.</p>
               <p>Q. You suspected them, did you - A. No more than I should other strangers; they walked out; there were three of us in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you observe any thing on either of the prisoners - A. No, I did not observe any thing of the kind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of the Eastern Counties Railway, and live at Stratford, in Essex—I have charge of a factory at Marsh-gate-lane—the prisoner assisted me there some months ago—I missed some articles, got a warrant, went to the house, and found nine pieces of canvas, a bucket, a lantern, some rope, wood, and other things, the property of the Company, which had been in the factory—nobody but him and I had access to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was the brand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between these two hoops—I cannot see where it has been cut out—I cannot say how deep it was—this lantern has the same initials on it as was on the bucket, "E. C. R."—I found this in the prisoner's house under the stairs—he never used this to light himself home on a dark night, to my knowledge—I will swear I never lent it him—I last saw it in the latter end of last year or the be<lb></lb>ginning of this—when I missed it I accused him of it—nobody was pre<lb></lb>sent—I have taken things of the Company with their knowledge—I never took anything without permission.</p>

               <p>accusation against the man—whether it was false or not is yet to be proved, but my master did not appear, and I believe that was the cause—I took the roan in the act of stealing a coil of rope—I was a witness in the case—I swore against Rickards, not against Peffard—Rickards was dismissed, and Peffard brought an action because master, Mr. Braithwaite did not appear the day he was to appear at Lambeth-street—it was before the Magistrate at 11ford—I believe he was held over to bail, and is under bail at the present time—it is six or seven months ago—he was bailed in cut the Company wanted him—I was never in the Excise—I have been in the Customs, and was superseded for being a few minutes absent without leave, after being there sixteen years—here is my certificate, and what I was discharged for—(<hi rend="italic">the certificate certified that he was discharged for being absent from a vessel without leave</hi>)—I have been in the navy—I was never tried by a court-martial—I have been punished for drinking, but never for anything like mutiny—here is a basket—there is no mark on it, but I am positive of it—I know it by the handle—I have handled it for months—I found that under the stairs, stowed away with the other things—I had seen it two or three months before finding it—I accused him of taking it, and asked him for it—I sever went to his house to search before—I do not know what the basket is worth—I do not suppose I could get a new one for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I never gave it him—I never told him any of these things were my perquisites—there is some wood that was cut up for lighting the coke ovens—I found that in his house—I never told him he might have it as old wood—this canvas had been carriage-covers, and was still used—we have cut some carriage covers up for screens, and this is part of it, but we have so much I did not mist it—I found it under the stairs—here is a tin can—I know there is no mark on it—I cannot swear to it—the lantern and pail were not in use—he resided about half a mile from the railway.</p>

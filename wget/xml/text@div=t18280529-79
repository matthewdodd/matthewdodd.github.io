I missed a jacket from the tap-room on the 30th of April, 1827, in the evening, when I wanted to put it on; the prisoner used the house, as a customer; he came there once after this, and when he saw me he got out at a window.</p>

            . I was employed at the Poulterers' Arms- I was there on the evening in question, and saw the prisoner take the jacket off the back part of the seat - he was intoxicated, and I thought he did not mean to steal it; I told him to take an old sailor's jacket which laid there, but not this one.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother; he came to my house to dine on the day he was taken - he sat down to dinner; the prosecutor came into the room with a constable; he pointed to my brother, and said, "That is the man;" I said, "What is the matter?" he told me, and held out his hand to my brother, and said, "Never mind, William, all I want is satisfaction for my jacket;" the constable sat down, and said, "We will wait till three o'clock;" we sent out for something to drink in the mean time; I said to the constable, "I never knew they allowed a cripple to act as a constable;" this offended him - he got up and collared my brother; I said, "As it is the Sabbath-day, let him go;" he did, and sent for Mr. Cousins, who came; the prisoner went away quietly, and was locked up. I never sent to the prosecutor, but he came to my room, and there, in the presence of three witnesses, said he was sorry for what he had done - he would not have entered the room for the world, and said he would freely give 100l. to get him released; he then went to a public-house, drew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290058"></xptr>up an agreement, valued the jacket at 10s., and said he would take it at 2s. a week; all this was voluntarily from himself: the agreement was signed regularly, and then he asked me to go to the watch-house, which I did; he shook hands, and told my brother if possible he would get him out that night, if not, he would in the morning; he said to the watch-house keeper, "All I want is to get that man discharged - I am satisfied, and if Mr. Cousins comes tell him to let him he discharged;" he said, "I am going to look for him;" he came to me again, and said he came to give us consolation, and said he had done wrong; he came again to my brother's wife, and said he was obligated to come forward against him - that he had been fetched from his work. I have seen the prosecutor once since - he said he believed it was only a frolic - he did not think he meant to steal it. I saw my brother that evening dancing to an organ in the tap-room, and I believe he might have taken it, not knowing whether it was old or new.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR. I saw the prisoner's mother, and she was so frightened that I said I would have given 100l. rather than have done it: I did value it at first at 10s., but I did agree to take it at 2s.</p>

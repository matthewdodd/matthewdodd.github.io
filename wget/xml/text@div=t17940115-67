             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a butcher, I live with William Lindus. About a quarter after six Saturday morning, I went into the shop to reach down a rump and surloin of beef, and when I came out I instantly missed a buttock of beef.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your shop? - In Whitechapel, High-street, as soon as I came out again I missed the buttock and avtch bone of beef off from the stall, and I ran after the prisoner and see her drop it herself, she was walking away as soon as she dropped it, and I went up to her and secured her and brought her up to the shop, and picked up the meat, I could swear to it by the appearance, to be my master's property. I have no doubt about it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman say any thing? - She said nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should have known that piece of beef if you had seen it ten miles off? - Yes, I should have known it any where.</p>
               <p>Q. To Lindus. When you came home what did you know about it? - I was not come down stairs, I heard a noise while I was dressing; when I came down the man had got the woman, and I sent for an officer, and she was taken to the office in Lambeth-street, the beef was produced there; the man said that he went in doors, and came out, and saw this beef was gone, and he went down the alley to her to the slaughter house door, and there he saw the woman standing, and he went and took her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that was your beef that the woman took? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing to it? - She said she did not take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150177"></xptr>Prisoner. I was coming along between six and seven in the morning, my business is, that I deal at Billingsgate, I saw a little man coming along, I saw him take the piece of beef off the stall, and he ran down the alley, and he throwed it down, and as I was coming along the young fellow that was there he said it was me, the man seeing of that, he took to his heels and ran away; the young fellow took me and called his master down, and his master came down with his stockings about his heels, and his clothes all lose.</p>
               <p>Court to Slade. Did you see a man running? - There was a man in the alley, coming up with a pipe in his mouth, he was walking along with another man, there were two of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner I never meddled with the beef; I have not any witnesses in London; my husband is in India.</p>

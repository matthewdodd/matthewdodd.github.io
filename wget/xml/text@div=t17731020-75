About twelve or one at noon, on Sunday the 29th of August, she was roasting a joint of meat; she went into the yard; my daughter called me, and told me there was something the matter with the prisoner; I went to her and accused her with having had a child; she said no she had not, nor knew nothing of one; I taxed her several times; I got her up into her own room; I sent for Mrs. Holmes, that recommended her to me; I went up stairs; I bid her confess what she had done with the child; she again declared she had had no child. Mrs. Holmes then went up stairs to her, but I did not go with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she had had a child or not?</p>
               <p>Pleydell. I saw some circumstances in the kitchen that convinced me she had had a child; after that the child was found. Mrs. Holmes staid up stairs with her very near half an hour. The overseers sent

               <p>Q. Did you ever hear the prisoner say any thing more about it?</p>
               <p>Pleydell. No; I never spoke to her afterwards; she went away immediately to the workhouse.</p>

               <p>Q. How old is the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Q. She always bore a good character I believe?</p>
               <p>Pleydell. Yes, and was very diligent in her business, but very ignorant; I question whether she knows how long a woman should go with child.</p>

            . I am a midwife: the beadle fetched me on the 29th of August to Mrs. Pleydell's; I went up stairs; I found the prisoner sitting up in a bed in the garret; I saw from circumstances something was the matter; I asked her what was the matter; she said nothing; I told her I suspected she had been delivered of a child; she said she had not had a child.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Holmes there then?</p>
               <p>Bowman. I believe she was; directly upon that, the daughter of the woman of the house said, the prisoner had owned it was down the necessary; I told them the necessary must be opened; it was opened and the child was taken up; I saw it about a quarter of an hour after it was taken up; it was a fine child; there were no marks of violence upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search it narrowly?</p>
               <p>Bowman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe it's neck?</p>
               <p>Bowman. I did observe every part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose it is a possible thing that a woman might be surprised and delivered at a necessary?</p>
               <p>Bowman. She said the child came from her at the necessary, and it was possible to be so; I knew an instance of a married lady, in great credit, very near like it; she desired to go to the necessary; I objected to it; she did not suppose herself so near delivery; she went there; she was taken very bad, and the child dropt before I got her to the bed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had he been with you? A. A year and a half, or two years; my receipts did not increase from the time he came into my employ - I did receive a pig from the prisoner's family, but it was not in part of payment or composition of this felony; and I received 1l., but that was on a former account - he was indebted to me 230l. previous to this, and I had forgiven him three times; that was in part of payment of some money he had embezzled previous to this - I cannot recollect the day, but it was in February, and before I had him taken up; I did not send a witness to tell him to abscond - I did not send Tomlin to him; I sent to inform him an officer had instructions to take him, and I told him to get out of the way till the morning, as the officer was not to call on me till the morning; I received the money a day or two before I had him taken -I think it was yesterday week that he was taken; it was from a feeling towards his wife that I sent him word - I know he slept at his own house that night, and was taken up going from that house, about half-past six o'clock in the morning; I sold the pig that was sent me for 28s. - the trough I have still by me; I should be glad to sell that for 4s. - I never said it was worth 12s.; I did receive 1l. besides - I did not tell the prisoner's brother, or his sister, that I would receive 3s. a week from him, nor that I did not wish to injure him, and if he gave me 2s. or 3s. I should be satisfied; his brother had agreed to give me 2l. two or three days previous to my taking him - it might be a week before; I got 1l. from him - I did not blame him for not bringing the other pound, nor appoint to meet the prisoner myself, or send for him; I did not say if he gave me 3s. a week, I would give him a character to another place - I would not do such a thing; I have forgiven him three times before to a considerable amount -I did afterwards take the pound; I sent him word to keep out of the way, as I did not wish to have him taken till the morning.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When was the first examination? A. I think on Friday week; I repeat the reason I first assigned for sending to him, that I did not wish to lock him up a night longer than was necessary.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer of 10, Cambridge-road, Hackney-road—on Sunday night, 20th November, about a quarter to 11, I went to bed—I fastened up all the doors and windows—something aroused me in the night, about half-past 3, but I did not get up till 7 in the morning, when I went down to let my man in, who worked in my shop—I did not then discover that the house had been entered—I went up stain to dress myself, and then came down about 7 or quarter-past—I found the back kitchen window open, and my parlour in a state or confusion—the ground was covered with papers, and clothes, and work boxes, burst open and all about the floor—I missed a coat, a hat, a pair of boots, a silk handkerchief, a pair of gloves, and a pair of spectacles, worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) is the hat I lost—I am sure it is my hat, and that it was safe that night, with the handkerchief and gloves in it—I saw the prisoner about the Thursday before the burglary, at the side of my premises—my private door is about forty or fifty yards from the road; and I saw him at the shop door—I saw him again on the Sunday, the day of the burglary—he was then at the corner, by the shop door—I was going to chapel at the time—he was standing there, and another man was on the opposite side, standing in the same way—I did not see the other man on the Thursday.</p>

On 24th October, I took this boot off the prisoner's foot at the station, and went to the prosecutor's house and compared it with some marks upon a chair in the back parlour—the chair was covered with Morocco, and the mark upon it was the mark of a muddy boot—there was a plain mark on the chair till you got to a certain part, that was the tip of the boot, and there there was a peculiar lump of mud—I found that the size of the mark corresponded with the boot—I took it into the street and wetted it, and then placed it alongside the mark on the chair, and it made a similar mark, till it came to that portion where the small piece of mud had dropped, and that corresponded also.</p>

The articles stated in the indictment were delivered him to polish - the tea-set was plated, and all the rest silver. The urn and silver tea-pot were delivered him on Monday, the 12th of August; he was to return them on Friday, the 15th. As he did not come I went after him, but did not see him till the 28th of November. I have not found the property. I searched his house; his tools and every thing portable was taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. When he was apprehended how much money was found on him - A. Very little. I delivered him the goods myself; it was all my own except the plated tea service. I was brought up a Jew - my ideas now are solely a belief in a Supreme Being. There are parts in the Old and New Testaments which I do not believe. I entertain doubts of any Revelation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150010"></xptr>being made by the Supreme Being to man. I believe we shall be punished for our deeds hereafter.</p>

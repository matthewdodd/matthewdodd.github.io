               <p>Henry Green. On the 2d of Nov. I got up in the Morning to see my Brother out of Town. I took half a Guinea out of my Drawers, and left fourscore and ten Guineas in a green Silk Purse.</p>
               <p>W. M. Prisoner. How came you to swear to but 68 Guineas you old Rogue you?</p>
               <p>Court. Did you swear to but 68 Guineas?</p>
               <p>Green. No, I swore to 88 Guineas and 4 half Guineas. The Prisoners were my Lodgers. They had the next Room to that where the Money was taken: There was a Hole in the Partition, so that they could see all over my Room. He pretended he was married to her at the White Horse in Fleet-lane, but I believe it was only a Pretence.</p>

            . My Husband had a poor Brother come to see him out of Northamptonshire, and he was to go out of Town that Morning, and I being dubitons that my Husband should give some of his Money to this poor Brother, I hided the Purse with 90 Guineas in it under my Child's Bed, in the Room next to the Prisoner's. I heard them walking about the Room at the same time, and I suppose they might see what I was doing through the Slit in the Wainscot: Then I lock'd the Door and went down Stairs, and my Husband and his Brother went out together. By and by, one came in for a Hat and Waistcoat that were left in that Room, and I sent my Boy up for it; and when he came down again, he told me that they came into the Room while he was there, and took something from under the Bed.</p>

               <p>Thomas Green. (Aged 16) when I went up for the Hat and Waistcoat, she came into my Room with a Bundle, and says, Tom, take care of this; and then he comes in and says, Give me the Bundle; so he took it away, and came in again, and went to my Bed, and said, this is a pretty Feather-bed. Then he turned it up, and felt under it, and took something out; but I did not think it was Money, for I knew nothing of any Money being there. Then they both went away directly, and bid me tell my Mother they would certainly come at Night. There was no Body else in the Room but these two end my self.</p>

M. from the White Horse in Blackman-street, to Islington Turnpike, and there he put his Head out of the Coach, and ordered me to drive to the Black Horse in the Hay-Market. When he came there, he got out of the Coach, and went into Moll Harvey's, and said he had lost 68 Guineas and a Watch there, and he would have 'em again. Moll desired him to be easy and quiet, and said he should have his Watch: He swore he would have his Money too, or he would go to Justice De Veil and get a Warrant; and then he ordered me to drive to Justice De Veil's. But Moll Harvey going out, and a Woman saying she was gone to Justice De Veil's, and would be there before him, he then ordered me to drive to Justice Lambert's. It was the same Day that he was taken up. Justice Lambert called for me in, asked where I took him up ; I told him, and then I was ordered to withdraw.</p>

               <p>- Banford, Constable. A Man came from the Cow and Calf Ale-house by Islington Turnpike, to me at next Door, and said, there was a Woman who had robb'd her Lodgings. I went and found Mr. Green and the Prisoner Murphey there. He charged her with robbing him. How can you say so? says she, I never wrong'd Man, Woman, nor Child; and if I have any Gold about me it is yours. We searched her, and found 7 Guineas, 5 s. and 6 d. and a Gold Ring in a Housewife in her Pocket: So she was sent to New-Prison. The Man of the Alehouse came to me again about 10 at Night, and said there was a Man at his House who enquired for Mrs. Macloughlane, and he suspected him to be concerned in the same Robbery. I went thither, I found the Prisoner W. M. but he said his Name was

I was at Mr. Chamberlain's House when Mr. Banford came in, and said there was a Man at the Cow and Calf, who was suspected to belong to the Woman that was taken up there that Day. I went in, and spoke to him in the Irish Brogue (for I had been a Soldier in Ireland). I ask'd him how he did, where he came from? He answered me in Irish, and said, he came from the North of Ireland, near Dundee. Sure I should know you, says I: What is your Name? My Name, says he, is Will. Maclonghlane. I asked him how long he had been in England? He said he had not been long come from of France. Parlezvous Francois, says I. Ouy Monsieur, says he. I found he could speak so much French as I.</p>

               <p>Eliz. Soams. I went to Green's for a Pint of Beer between 8 and 9 in the Morning. A Soldier came down Stairs and call'd for a Pint of Beer, and paid nothing for it, and then went out. Then the 2 Prisoners came down, and Green said he had lost some Money, and would have them searched ; upon which they were affronted, and threw down a Shilling, and said they would come no more into his House.</p>
               <p>H. Green. I neither searched them, nor saw them when they went, for I was gone out with my Brother.</p>

And that Day as Green was robb'd, Green came to my House and ask'd if the Prisoner was there; no, says I, but he was here Yesterday, and I paid him 16 Guineas. Tell him, says he, next time you see him, I am sorry I affronted him by searching him, for now I understand it was a Soldier that robb'd me; and if he'll let me know where the Soldier is, I'll give him 5 Guineas.</p>

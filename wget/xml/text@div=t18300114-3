            . I am a constable. A little before ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner and two others, one a little boy, thirteen or fourteen years old, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140005"></xptr>other about nineteen - he was a head taller than the prisoner: in consequence of suspicion I watched them - they went from Cornhill towards Cheapside; I missed them for a minute, and then saw the prisoner looking into Mr. Bult's window - at the same time I saw the boy come out of Mr. Bult's shop; I did not see the third one then - the boy put his hand to the prisoner, and as I suppose gave him something; he appeared handing something to him - I crossed the road as quick as I could, being on the opposite side - the prisoner ran away from the window, down Ironmonger-lane, which is eight or nine doors off: I passed the boy, pursued the prisoner, and twenty or thirty yards down the lane, as I was going to put my hand upon him, he turned round, saw me, and threw something across the road - I picked it up; it was a copper bowl - it had snowed the night before, and I could see no gold; I secured him, and then picked up the bowl - I looked about, but could see no gold; I took him to the shop, went back to where he threw it down, and found some gold - I did not pick it up myself; it was produced at the Mansion-house, and returned to Mr. Bult.</p>
               <p>MR. BULT. I have it here; I saw several grains picked up - the gold in the bowl when I left it on the counter was worth 18l. or 20l. or more - I had left that quantity of gold in it four or five minutes before; nobody had been into the shop after the customer I served from it - the gold now in it is worth 24s. or 25s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went round the City to look for a situation, having been out of work three days, and passing this shop it drew my attention to look in; I stood there half a minute - two young gentlemen came by; one said to me, "I will give you 3d. to take this to Ironmonger-lane;" it was in two bits of whitey brown paper - I had hardly got round the corner before the gentleman seized me by the collar, and knocked it out of my hand.</p>

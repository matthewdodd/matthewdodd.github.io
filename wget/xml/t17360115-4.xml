            . These two Prisoners brought them to my Shop to be valu'd; I was not at home, but my Wife seeing the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173601150004"></xptr> Crest rubb'd out, sent for me, and I stopped them. I can't say which of the two laid them down, but White pretended most Claim to them. Collard said nothing about them. I asked the Reason of the Marks being taken out? and I think it was White that said there was only 3 Letters upon them, but I cannot be positive. I said I would stop them, and I think it was White said, she would send the right Owner for them: The Prisoners were taken in Moor-lane.</p>
               <p>Defence of the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>White. I was just come from Market, when I heard Collard's Husband wanted to speak with me. I went to him, and he told me he had a Friend's Spoons and Forks to borrow Money upon; I asked him what he came to me for, I did not know what to do with them; I won't pretend to borrow any thing upon them, till I know the Value of them. Nan, says he to his Wife, go along with her, and see what they are worth: She was not willing to go, but he threatned to kick her if she did not; so we went to this Gentlemans in Barbican, and desired to have them valued, because there was Money to be lent upon them: He was not at home, but his Wife was. Very well Dame says she, taking up the Things, and carrying them into the Kitchen backwards. Madam, says Nan, won't you please to weigh 'em? She told us, she wanted a two Ounce Weight, and we must stay 'till her Husband came, for she had sent for him: When he came, they went into the Kitchen and talked together; and when they came out, she told me they must stop the Things, and bid us go home and fetch the Man we had them of. We went home, I to my Goods, and she to her Family, and we heard no more 'till the Constable came to take us up. We neither of us fled, when the Constable came.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner White call'd several Witnesses in her Behalf, who gave her the Character of an honest and industrious Woman.</p>
               <p>Collard's Defence was to the same Effect; she said her Husband had brought these Things home with him, and when she was taken into Custody, he sold and pawn'd all they had in the World, and has never since been heard of.</p>

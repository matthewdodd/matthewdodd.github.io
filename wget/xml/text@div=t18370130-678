                  </hi>. I am foreman to John Field, of Greenwich. On Monday morning, the 30th of January, it was the duty of the carters to go from Billingsgate to Shooter's-hill—on Sunday morning, I gave Kingston four bushels of chaff and two of oats, not mixed, to feed his four horses, on Sunday night and Monday morning—it was his duty to have used all that, except a little to take out with him in the middle of the day, to have fed them on Monday—this is the com and chaff—it resembles that we have About the premises, and what I give out there—here is about a bushel.</p>

JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had Kingston lived with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ten years—he always had a good character—I think there is a bushel there—it is rather dirty—it has been blown over by the horses, and they would not eat it—I said it was not worth 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., because it is very seldom another horse will eat it—I knew nothing of this till the policeman took the men—my master was rather unwilling to prosecute—I should have thrown it on the dunghill if the horses would not eat it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant R</hi> 8.) On Monday morning, about half-past six o'clock, I went opposite Mattison's house, in consequence of information I had received—I saw Kingston come with a cart and three horses—as he came facing Mattison's yard, he spoke to him—Mattison went behind the cart, and took out the sack—I followed him, and took him emptying the contents into a basket—here is a bushel of oats and chaff—I took him into custody—he begged me to let him go—I said I could not do any such thing, for it was not the first time—he said it was the first time—the constable Crawley was on the spot—I directed him to go after the carter, and take him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you asked Mattison what he was to give? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at that time; but I did ask him, and he made me no answer—he did not say he was to give nothing for it—I was certain be heard me—I went to the prosecutor's to get his assent to come to the Magistrate—I did not see him—Edwards told me, afterwards, that his master did not mean to prosecute—there is no profit in this—I get two shillings a day besides my regular pay. but it costs me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get my dinner.</p>

            . I was in the one horse chaise with Mr. Chisholm; the prisoner came up to the chaise, presented a pistol, and demanded our money. I took notice of his person; he had a slouched hat and a brown great coat; I went back with Mr. Chisholm when I heard the man was taken; we overtook him at a place called Longford; a gentleman had him before him on horse back; he had hold of him. I am sure he is the person; I saw him put his hand in his pocket and take out the pistol; it was between four and five o'clock.</p>

            . I am servant to Colonel Phillips: Mr. Chisholm stopped his chaise, and told me he had been robbed by the prisoner; the prisoner was then in fight; he was going towards Longford on foot; he was about 100 yards from the 11th mile stone; we rode gently on and the prisoner walked gently on. A Mr. Bullion came to us, and asked if the gentleman in the chaise did not tell us he had been robbed; I said yes, and that is the man that robbed him, we are going to him; we came up to the prisoner; I asked if he saw the chaise robbed; he said no; I said you did you scoundrel, and are the person that robbed it. and have a pistol in your pocket; he said he had not; I said he need not make any resistance for we would see; he then made a run; I rode after him and struck at him, and knocked him down, either with my whip or horse I cannot say which; we took him to Cranford-bridge; I took the pistol out of his pocket, and drew four slugs out of it; I searched the lining of his coat and found this knife in it (produces the knife and the pistol).</p>

I know nothing of the robbery no more than the child unborn. I went down into a ditch to ease myself, and found this pistol; I did not know whether it was loaded, or what the use of it was.</p>

            . I am a chair-maker: the prisoner worked for me five years; he was a very honest sober man as ever worked in a shop; he was at work with me within a day of his being taken up; he went out to make holiday; he is a very sober lad as ever worked in a shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any way of accounting for this strange conduct?</p>
               <p>Bullin. No, none at all; I was very much surprised to hear of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he had any connections that had involved him in debt?</p>

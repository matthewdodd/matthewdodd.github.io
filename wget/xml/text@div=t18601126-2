                  </hi>. I am a butcher of 9, Queen's-buildings, Knights-bridge on 31st October, I went to Newgate Market and saw some shoulders of mutton on Mr. Frost's stall—I offered 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—I did not buy them—I afterwards met the prisoner as I was coming towards my cart—I told him I had offered 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Mr. Frost for some shoulders of mutton, and for him to go back and see if Mr. Frost would serve me and if not, he was to give a farthing a pound more for them—that would be 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to my horse and cart, which was standing at the Old Bailey, and the prisoner afterwards came up to me with the shoulders of mutton—he shoed me a ticket, and said he had paid for them—upon that I gave him the money—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said "I did not think you were worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" and he said, "Well, I am not so bad off as that, thank God!" and that took me off my guard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am sorry it occurred; I received the money, but had not the least intention of doing anything dishonest; I had been up all night and fell asleep in the tap-room, and unfortunately lost my money; as soon as I found it was gone I sent my wife to Mr. Shopland and acknowledged to it, saying I would repay it in the course of a fortnight, if he would allow me.</p>

One of them laid hold of me on one Side, and another on the other, and one behind me pulled me into the Entry. They took me into a Place on the right Hand Side, but fearing I should make too much Noise there, they carried me up one pair of Stairs, When we came there, there were four or five People besides the two Prisoners; and Cooper bit me a Knock on the Face first, and took my Stick from me. Then they began to try for my Watch, I therefore kept it in my Hand, and twisted the String round my Finger; but they bit my Fingers to make me let it go, and then I put it into my Bosom. Upon this they threw me upon the Bed, and with the Assistance of 2 Men, took the Watch from me.</p>

            , Constable. On Sunday Night about a quarter after 10 o'Clock, I came into the Watch-house, and the Prosecutor told me he had been robb'd in Thatch'd-Alley. I took two Watchmen with me to the House, and when I came into the Ground Room, there was a sick Child there. We went into the upper Part of the House, and met with no body, but when we came into the Ground Room again we saw the Prisoner Cooper. The Prosecutor no sooner saw her, but he said she was one of the Persons who assisted in taking his Watch. Accordingly we laid hold of her; - there was a Man in the House whom we likewise took to the Watch-house, but the Prosecutor not swearing positively to him, I discharg'd him. When Cooper was brought in, she desir'd that we would go and search on the Bed for the Watch, and we accordingly did, and found it under the Coverlid of the Bed.</p>
               <p>A Watchman. I went along with my Master Ward to Carter's House, - the Prosecutor shew'd us the House, and we found Cooper in the Ground Room; and in the one pair of Stairs Room we found the Prosecutor's Stick. There was a Man in the House, and my Master order'd me to take Cooper out while he examin'd him; and then Cooper said it was hard she should suffer, for she was Innocent, and she asked me if we had look'd on the Bed, for perhaps the Man might drop the Watch there. My Master and I afterwards found it on the Bed under the Rug.</p>
               <p>Pris Carter. Ask the Prosecutor whether I brought him into the House?</p>
               <p>Dudley. No, I believe Mrs. Carter was not concern'd at first, but came into the Room afterwards: - She came about the middle of the Fray, when I had four upon me; and she held my Hands, or did something that Way, as the rest did.</p>
               <p>Carter. Ask the Watchman whether I keep the House?</p>
               <p>Watchman. It always goes in her Husband's Name; they live in the lower Appartment; I can't tell whether they have the whole House.</p>

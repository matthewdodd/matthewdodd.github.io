            , Esq; upon the 28th of December my master's doors were locked very safe; the goods mentioned in the indictment were stole out of the room over the stable adjoining to the dwelling-house; I was at the play: I came home about ten o'clock; I found every thing safe then; when I went up into the room, between seven and eight o'clock the next morning, I found my box broke open: I lodged in the house; the door of my room was standing open, the tiles were pulled off, and a lath cut. I met the prisoner accidentally on the second of January in Piccadilly with my cloaths upon his back; I never saw him before; I took him before justice Wright, I found these things upon him (producing a pair of stockings and a handkerchief) I have recovered besides, seven pair of stockings, two shirts, three neckcloths, a pair of breeches, a waistcoat faced with blue sattin, which things he told us of at justice Wright's, and that another man took some of the things; we went to the prisoner's lodgings, and he attempted to jump out at the window; we found the breeches in Monmouth-street, where he had sold them, and the man said, he had sold the coat; the prisoner told us, he had sent the rest of the cloths to a Jew; I never recovered them.</p>

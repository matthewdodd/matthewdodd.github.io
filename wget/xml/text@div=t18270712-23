On the 12th of June, between twelve and one o'clock, I locked my room door, and went out - I returned as the clock struck one; I found the window had been lifted up and this property taken. Mr. Jackson keeps the house, and lives there. I lodge in the kitchen - there are several lodgers.</p>

            . My aunt lodges in the second floor of this house. I went into the area for some water, and saw a woman get out of Drewett's window, with her lap full of clothes; she told me the woman was not at home - I did not know who lived there, as the people had just come in. She went into the street; I went and told the lodgers, who went out to look for her - I never saw her before.</p>

            . I live next door to Jackson. On the 12th of June I saw the prisoner go down to the area. I knew her before, and thought she might be going into the yard - I went in doors. I came out in a few minutes and she was gone; she had nothing in her lap when she went in. I saw her in Lisson-street, between four and five o'clock, with a bundle; I called Mrs. Jackson - we watched her into a house in Little James-street; she threw a lap full of things on the floor. I fetched Smith the officer.</p>

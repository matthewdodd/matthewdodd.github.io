                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live In Grange-roatd Bermondsey. On Monday, 7th May, my husband came home very. tipsy about twelve o'clock, and my brother put him to bed—I afterwards went up to his room with my brother; I asked him to go with me—when I got tip, he was lying on the bed—he got off the bed, and began smashing the things—I did not see what he did it with, I was by the door—my brother said he did not like to see him break the things, for he would be sorry, for it to-morrow, and he tried to prevent him—I went in, and received a blow from my husband with the poker on my head; it cut my head, and it bled—I became senseless—a doctor was sent for, and I remained a week in bed.</p>

On 7th May I was with the prisoner at the Castle and at the King John's Head—we left there about six o'clock—I accompanied. him home, and pot him to bed—his wife went down to her aunt's, and came back between ten and eleven, and we went up staira—the prisoner jumped off the bed, and began smashing up the chairs and ornaments on die mantel-piece with the poker—I tried to hinder him—my sister came in, and begged me to, keep away from him, and, as she was standing alongside of me, he made a blow at</p>

I am a greengrocer, at Queen's-road, Bermondsey—I live in the adjoining room to the prisoner—the partition is so thin that I can hear what passes—the prisoner came home about eight o'clock, and between eleven and twelve I heard him request his brother-in-law to go out of the room and go home—he would not do it—they got to words and fighting—I afterwards went with the police into the room, and saw the pro-secutrix lying on the floor, and her brother had the poker in his hand—the brother said it was a serious job, and the prisoner said, "Yes, I wish it had been you instead of her"—I went for the doctor.</p>

On 7th June I was called to the prisoner's house, and saw the prosecutrix in bed, bleeding from a wound in the head, which had probably been inflicted by a blunt instrument—a poker might do it—there was not much contusion—I attended her ever; day for a week; the wound soon healed.</p>

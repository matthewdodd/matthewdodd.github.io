                  </hi>. I am a Greenwich pensioner, and live at the College—my wife lives at No. 13, Bond-street, Lambeth—it is my dwelling-house—I went with my wife to Epsom races on the Derby day, the 17th of May—the night before I gave her seven 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank notes, which she wrapped up in a paper bag, and put into the tea-caddy on the top of a writing-desk in my room—we started about ten o'clock next morning, and locked up the room—we returned at ten at night, but I did not go home till near one o'clock—the money was then gone—the prisoner had come on the 20th of May with a man who she represented as her husband, and took a furnished lodging of us—they said they had just come from Southampton by the train—they were there the morning of the Derby day—none of the notes have been found—a small bunch of keys was taken as well—I saw the prisoner after she was taken, and as she was going to the station she turned round, and said, "Mr. Hall, all I received out of the money was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and she repeated it a second time—the man has not been found—the prisoner had said he was going out in the <hi rend="italic">Mercury</hi> to Calcutta, and he would remit money to support her when he got to Dover—he took the key of their door away, which would open my door, but I did not know that then.</p>

I went to Mr. Hall's on the Derby day, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner standing at the door very heavy in liquor—I had never seen her before—I asked why she was standing there—she said she was waiting to see some one, she was a lodger at Mrs. Hall's—I said I was very sorry to hear that, for I was afraid they would have no room for me—she said, "Oh my hus<lb></lb>band</p>

               <p>will not return, come and stay with me till the morning, and then you can seek for a lodging"—she went up stairs, and said, "My husband has got the key"—she called to a little boy for some keys—he brought two, and nei<lb></lb>ther would open the door—she asked him to go over the way and borrow a screw-driver, which he did, and she broke open the door—she went in, made some tea, and went to bed—she asked me to come to bed, which I refused, as I wished to see Mrs. Hall first—before that I saw her count over three half-crowns and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw no notes—she said her husband was gone to Cal<lb></lb>cutta, that he was going on board the <hi rend="italic">Mercury</hi> at twelve o'clock that night, that he had left her sufficient money for the week, and would remit her more when he got to Dover—I heard a noise at twelve or one o'clock, and said, "What a noise that is in the house, they have lost something"—she said, "Oh what is the matter?" very loud—I said, "Keep yourself still"—she said, "I must jump out of the window, and get over the back way, what do you say about that?"—I said, "Oh dear, that shows you must be very guilty indeed"—she then got up, dressed herself, and went to Mrs. Hall, very trembling, and her teeth chattered very much—she said to Mrs. Hall, "I have not committeud the rob<lb></lb>bery, I know nothing about it"—when we were talking very busy together she slipped down stairs and decamped—she came back again on the following Saturday, and said she was come at her friend's desire to know what was lost, and she was then taken into custody.</p>

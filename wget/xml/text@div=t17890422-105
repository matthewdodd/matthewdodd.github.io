               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Wilkins, on the 9th of February I had two parcels from my master to carry to a Mr. Heath; I was going up Ludgate-hill, and I was met by the prisoner at the bar; he asked me, where I was going? I said to Mr. Heath's, a hosier; the prisoner at the bar said, he was going to my master for those things from Mr. Heath; I had the parcels under my arm, I did not see them packed up, my master gave me the parcels to carry; he gave me another small parcel, and said, I must give it to my master; he said, there was a letter in the inside, he desired I would take it to my master, and it was to be forwarded to Mrs. Brown immediately, he took the other two parcels from me, he walked on slowly, and went towards the Old Bailey; afterwards I had rather a suspicion of him, I ran after him as far as the Old Bailey; I asked him, if his name was Mr. Heath? he said, yes, it was, and I left him then; I did not get the parcels back; I can swear positively to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You had never seen the prisoner before in your life? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a fishmonger; on the 9th of February, I was going with some fish to Mr. Shaw's of Bridge-street, Black-friars, it was between one and two o'clock, going down Ludgate-hill, I saw the prisoner standing at a pawnbroker's near to the Bell Savage; I saw the boy coming with two parcels under his arm; the prisoner

             came from the pawnbroker's to the boy with a parcel in his hand; he stopt the boy, and they were in discourse together for about two minutes, then the boy delivered the parcels into the prisoner's hands, and the prisoner gave the boy his parcel; the prisoner then walked towards St. Paul's, the boy then ran after him, and said something else to him; then the boy came back, and I told him he was cheated out of his parcels; says I open the parcel, and you will find it so; he says it is nothing to me; it is Mr. Heath, I know Mr. Heath; when he came into Bridge-street, he opened the parcel, and in it there were two dishclouts; he took them out of the parcel, and fell a crying; he told me he had stockings in his parcels to the amount of 5 l. I knew the person of the prisoner before; I took the prisoner about a month afterwards; the alderman told me to take care of the parcel, with the dish-clouts.</p>
               <p>What relation are you to Newman the constable? - I am his brother.</p>
               <p>You was going to Mr. Shaw's with some fish? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you left Mr. Banks? - About three years.</p>
               <p>What made you leave him, was it not about some boots? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - Yes, Sir, I will.</p>
               <p>This man you suspected immediately? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Why did not you stop him? - The boy would not open his parcel.</p>

               <p>You did not see him afterwards for six weeks? - Yes, Sir, I did, I saw him about a fortnight afterwards at about nine in the evening, but I was by myself, and I did not like to stop him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wayte. The boy came back about two hours after I had sent him out; he had been before to Mr. Heath's; I do not know whether he knew Mr. Heath personally.</p>
               <p>The prisoner's Counsel objected, that it was not a felony, but obtaining goods by false pretences, and the case was reserved, and sentence respited, for the opinion of the Judges.</p>

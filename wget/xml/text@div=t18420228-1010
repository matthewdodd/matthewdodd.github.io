                  </hi>. I am a trunnell-maker, living in Silver-street, Rotherhithe. I was at work at trunnell-making at Mr. Hammond's yard in Mill-wall—I went to Mr. Liver's beer-shop about four o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st of February, and saw the prisoner come in—he had the things which he sharpens his saws with, in a basket—he sharpened a bow—saw for Mr. Liver—I sent a boy for my saw from Mr. Hammond's, and I gave it to the prisoner to look at—he gave it me back, and then I put it behind the settle—I looked for it the next morning as soon as the house was open and it was gone—there were two spots of pitch on on the handle about two inches apart—I have never seen it since.</p>

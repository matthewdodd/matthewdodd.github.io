                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Police Constable</hi>). On the night of 12th April I was on duty in Wood Street, Cheapside, in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner there; he was coming out of one of the doorways in Wood Street—I saw him go into another one, and, having suspicion of him, I watched him—I saw him go into several doorways; I got into a doorway myself—I saw him put his hand into a letter-box—I further watched him into Cheapside—I then saw him put his hand into the letter-box of Mr. Fos<lb></lb>ter, wine merchant, at the corner of Bread Street, Cheapside—I watched him from there down Cheapside to Bow Lane—in Bow Lane I saw him go into two doorways—I could not see what he did there, because it was dark—I followed him down Bow Lane to the corner of Watling Street—I went up to him and told him that I was a police officer, and I should take him into custody on the charge of attempting to steal letters from letter-boxes—he said nothing—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him a rough draft of a will, a power of attorney, and a letter directed to Mr. Muter, 17, Pinner's Hall, Old Broad Street—he was asked how he come there—he said he was waiting for a young man named Walker, who worked at Sturt and Sharp's, Wood Street—I found on him some circulars of Beard and Son, 17, Pinner's Hall; he said they were his father's—he was asked by the inspector to give an account of the power of attorney—he gave no account of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant clerk to the Lord Mayor—I took the depositions when the prisoner was examined on this charge on the first day—after the examination had been taken, Alderman Carter was about to remand the prisoner; it was suggested to the Alderman that he might perhaps give some explanation, and I think the Alderman said, "Should you like to say anything? I am about to remand you"—I took down what he said—I am trusting to my memory, and I believe I have a good one to trust to—he said, "What I stated to the officer is quite correct; there have been four letters wrongly addressed, delivered at our place lately; that post-letter is one of them"—a remark was then made by the Alderman about the papers, and the prisoner said, "I purchased the deed of a man in the street for half a crown, observing that it bore a five-shilling stamp, and thinking it was of greater value."</p>

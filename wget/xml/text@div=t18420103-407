                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at Uxbridge; the pri<lb></lb>soner was in my employ. On Friday, the 10th of December, he went out with a quantity of bread to deliver to various customers—Mrs. Adams was one of my customers—on Saturday he again went out with a quantity of bread, and on that Saturday night he accounted to me how he had disposed of the bread—he said he had delivered six loaves to Mrs. Adams on the Friday, and six on the Saturday, and that she did not pay for either—Mrs. Adams was generally a ready-money customer—if he had been paid, he should have given me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., twice 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop at Cowley. About four o'clock, on Friday, the 10th of December, the prisoner delivered to me six loaves of bread, for which I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was a customer of Mr. Homewood, and I paid it on his account—about five o'clock, on Saturday, the prisoner again left six loaves with me, and I expect I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I cannot exactly say what I paid him—I did pay him, I expect—I do not know to the contrary—I always did pay him, and I expect I paid him then—I have a perfect recollection of paying him on the Friday, and I expect I paid him on the Saturday, but he was late with the bread, I was very busy, the children were teasing me, and my husband was ill in bed—I did not refuse to pay—I never had a bill or receipt from Mr. Homewood since I have dealt with him—it was my practice to pay ready money.</p>

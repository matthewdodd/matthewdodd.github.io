On the 11th of November, the prisoner came for some needles, and looked out some, which came to 3s. 6d.; he then selected another parcel, and said,"Lay them by, and I will call presently" - I looked into my drawer, and missed a number of needles - I went after him about a mile, and as I returned saw him go into a public-house: I followed him, and asked if he was coming back about the needles - he said Yes, when he had had his beer - I asked for those he had in his pocket - he said he had none; I collared him; he then produced them on the table, and said, "Will you forgive me?" I went to the table to look at them, and he ran away - I followed and secured him: he said, "If you won't take them up, I will;" he then went to the table, and pulled out a great many more, which belonged to another person.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

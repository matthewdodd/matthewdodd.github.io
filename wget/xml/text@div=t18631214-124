                  </hi>. I am a commission agent residing at 115, Rotherfield-street, Lower-road, Islington—from information I received from a Mr. Knight, I went to the Alhambra in Leicester-square, and paid to Mr. Wyld a sum of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and received from him a piece of paper—I afterwards saw the prisoner, spoke to him in reference to it, and gave it him back—I said it was informal in consequence of its having been written on an erasure, and the stamp damaged—the prisoner said he was sorry for it—it was of no consequence—he would get another from his friends, the Marquis of Anglesey and the Earl of Uxbridge, he being on the most intimate terms with them—he made an appointment with me to meet him at a public-house in Bush-lane, a highly respectable place of refreshment—he there gave me this other bill of exchange (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—(<hi rend="italic">this was dated 17th October</hi>, 1863, <hi rend="italic">for the sum of</hi> 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">payable three months after date, at Messrs. Hoare's, Fleet Street, signed Uxbridge, and countersigned Anglesey</hi>)—I took that bill to Mr. Anthony of St. Martin's-lane, a highly respectable solicitor of many years standing, and of wealth—I did not tell the prisoner that I was going to take it to him—from something Mr. Anthony said I took it back to the prisoner, and told him that bill was also informal, the figures, "17th," having been written on an erasure—he said that he regretted it; that the Marquis would owe him an apology for having made the mistake, but it was only an error, which he would remedy, and I was to meet him again on the following day at the same public-house—I did not meet him there—I think the day following, Knight, who had introduced the matter of the bills for dis<lb></lb>count to me, was arrested—in consequence of something that was said I met the prisoner at the Bell, in Basinghall-street—he then said he should not like to ask the Marquis and the Earl for the stamps, but if I would get the stamps he would take them up to the Junior United Service Club, and get the bill accepted—I procured the stamps, and went with him to the Junior United Service</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City detective officer—from information I received I went with Sergeant Funnel and Inspector Tanner to the Bell public-house, in Basinghall-street, on 23d—I there saw the prisoner;—I addressed him as Captain Heatley—he said, "That is my name, quite right"—I said, "I am a police-officer, and I shall apprehend you for uttering several bills of exchange, purporting to bear the signatures of the Marquis of Anglesey and the Earl of Uxbridge"—he said, "Quite right; I had them from Captain Massey, better known as 'Redan Massey'"—I said, "Have you any more of those bills about you?"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "Be certain on that, as I shall have to search you"—with that he took from his pocket this bill of exchange for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and handed it to me—I said, "Where did you get this?"—he said, "From captain Massey"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "At the Junior United Service Club-house"—I asked him when—he said, "Last night"—I then took him to the police-station, and he was charged—several papers were found on him—amongst them was this envelope, with a list of bills of exchange on it, in which those produced are included—(<hi rend="italic">the bill of exchange found on it prisoner was for</hi> 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">dated</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th October</hi>, 1863, <hi rend="italic">payable four month after date, at Messrs.

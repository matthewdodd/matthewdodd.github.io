            . My husband's name is Rowland. On the 14th of April, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, and found them again with the prisoner at the bar; she had the buttons in her hand, and the cloak was in a closet in the house where I found her, in Cross-lane, by Newtoner's-lane: she owned to the taking the things, and directed us to the pawnbroker, where she had pawned the apron.</p>

               <p>E. Wilstead. I took her as a <rs id="t17640502-42-deflabel236" type="occupation">servant</rs>

            . On the 14th of April, I was at the prosecutor's house: Mrs. Wilstead sent the prisoner up to make the bed; she went up. Soon after, Mr. Wilstead went up, and returned and said, the girl and things mentioned, were missing; she desired me to go to a young fellow that the girl kept company with, to enquire for her. I did, and was informed she was in Cross-lane: we went there, and found her; she had the buttons in her hand, the cloak was found in a closet, and the apron was pawned: she seemed to be pretty much in liquor: all this was in about an hour after she and the things were missing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I had been with Mrs. Wilstead three weeks: I got up on a Thursday morning; she came down, and we had words; she gave me warning to go away. I gave her 1 s. 6 d. for the cloak, the apron she gave me; as to the other things, I know nothing of them.</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Wilstead. Is what the prisoner says true?</p>
               <p>E. Wilstead. It is all false: I did not give or sell her any thing.</p>

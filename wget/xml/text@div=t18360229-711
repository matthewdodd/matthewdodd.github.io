                  </hi> I am a goldsmith, and live at No.6, Greek-street, Soho The prisoner had been in my employment for about seven months, as a chaser—I gave him in charge last Saturday week, in consequence of having found some gold on his person—I missed some ear-rings, and a great quantity of gold—the officer came, and I charged the prisoner with having stolen the property—I made him no promise or threat, nor did the officer—the prisoner said the property which he gave out of his pocket was mine—he took out a small ingot of gold, about an ounce—he said there was more gold in a cup, in his lodging, in a cupboard, and that was also my property.</p>

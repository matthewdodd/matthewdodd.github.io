               <p>Examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. I am a pawnbroker, I know the prisoner at the bar: On the 23d of March, in the evening, he came to our house, and offered to pledge a piece of white dimity; I asked him whose it was? he said, it was his own; I asked him how he came to buy so much? he said, he was a carpenter, and he and his two fellow-servants bought it to line some waistcoats; he said, it cost a shilling a yard, I knew it was under the value, and I told him I thought he did not come honestly by it; he said he bought it in Cloth-Fair, and he ran away, and we called out "stop thief;" and, at the bottom of Basinghall-street, he was stopped by a constable; he was taken to the watch-house, and some porters there knew him to be Mr. Parkinson's man; he had been at our house before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account of the goods when he was examined? - A. He was examined at the watch-house, but I cannot speak to what passed there, I was so much flurried.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH sworn.</p>
               <p> I am servant to the last witness, I know the prisoner at the bar: On the 12th of February he came to our house with a piece of printed jean, which he pledged for seven shillings and sixpence; (produces it); On the 12th of March he pledged a remnant for five shillings; (produces it); and, on the 22d, he came with a piece of dimity, when he was stopped.</p>
               <p>JAMES PRIOR sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Jackson. I am a constable: On Tuesday, the 22d of March, in the evening, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house, and Mr. Crouch gave charge of him, on suspicion of having some stolen property; that he had brought some to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060054"></xptr>his house, and ran away upon being questioned. I searched him, and found nothing but a small key; I found that he lived with Mr. Parkinson and Wilson, in Bow-church-yard; I sent for them, and they said he was their servant; and from thence we went to Mr. Crouch's, there we saw some goods, which he said he believed was his; we went to his lodgings, and, with the key which I took out of his pocket, his wife opened his box; and, in that, I found three duplicates, one dated the 12th of March, for a piece of jean; another of some cotton, pledged at Mr. Purse's, London-wall; we went to Mr. Purse's, and Mr. Wakefield said, we should have the goods produced to us; Mr. Parkinson said, it was his; and Mr. Walkefield immediately said, the same man has been here to night with some jean; when I came back to the watch-house, I asked him how he came by the jean? he said, he had it at his master's warehouse.</p>

            Did you say any thing to him to induce him to confess it? - A. No; I asked him if that was all he had? he said no, he had the whole piece, that he had cut in his master's warehouse; I asked him, as he had pawned only three yards and an half, at Mr. Crouch's, what he had done with the rest? he said he had given it to a man in Bow-church-yard.</p>

The prisoner came and took one of them and put it on the table; after that he took it up from the table and was going to go off with it. As I was going to take him, my coat buttons hit against a chair; he heard it, and threw the raisins on the table again. Then he stopped behind the crane room, and staid there some time. I having no body to assist me, I was afraid to take him by the water-side. There came a merchant's watchman out of an alehouse, then we went and took him upon the wharf, about five or six yards from the place where I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know no more of it than of my dying day. After this they brought a man up, and the raisins. I believe the constable was bail for that man, and they let him go.</p>
               <p>Long. When I came back from carrying the prisoner to the Compter, the frail of raisins was gone from the table, and it was found in a boat. A man, called Battersea Jack, was coming with his sculls, and I said, Is this your boat? He said it was. I said, How came that frail of raisins in your boat? He said he did not know. I went to call the constable and watchmen, then Battersea Jack had put the frail out of his boat into a luggage boat, and was going away. I said, You had better come back, or I shall send for you. He did. I took him also before a magistrate, but not bringing the person that saw him put the frail in his boat, he was discharged.</p>

            . I live with the prosecutor: I saw the prisoner in the warehouse, with a bottle of wine in his hand, the ninth of this month, between candle-light and day-light; I told him he was as safe as if the d - l had him, and locked him in; he broke out into a corn-chandler's yard, and got away.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176410170008"></xptr>Q. What answer did he make you?</p>
               <p>Spelman. He did not speak a word: he came in about half an hour after, of his own accord, and the constable secured him. When I spoke to him, he threw the bottle down and broke it; here are some of the pieces: (producing part of a glass bottle.) the constable found two other bottles of wine in the coal-hole after he had made his escape; they are full of red port. (Produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is the place where you saw him a light place?</p>
               <p>Spelman. There are rails over the door, and the place is very open at the top; I could see him as plain as any thing in the world.</p>

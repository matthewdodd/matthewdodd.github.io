            ; I was sitting in our compting-room (towards the dusk of the evening) which has glass windows to it, and commands the warehouse door, so that nobody can either come in or go out without our perceiving it; our servant was shutting up the shutters to the warehouse windows, and my sister alarmed me, and told me there was a gentleman in the warehouse that wanted, she thought, to speak to me; we were all in the compting-house, my brother and my two sisters; I rose up immediately, and I saw a person in the warehouse, he walked across the warehouse; I was told he had some goods under his arm, and I looked, and saw him go out with goods under his arm; I immediately sprang from the compting-room, went forward to the door, and before he had reached the other side of the way I was at his heels, he went on a little farther, and some of his comrades I believe gave him the alarm that he was pursued; the street is very narrow; the upper end of <placeName id="t17890225-79-crimeloc365">Aldermanbury</placeName>

               <p>Was it about the time you generally light candles? - We were forced to light candles, because I was writing, but it was sufficiently light enough for me to see him run across the Bury.</p>
               <p>Was not it about the time that you usually shut up shop? - It was rather before, because our servant had shut up without our attending to it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>A man came to me, and asked me the way to the Golden-Cross, Charing-Cross, while I was telling him, I saw my master come out of the warehouse, and on the other side of the way I saw a man cross, and somebody said at that very time, run for it, and he ran a few yards, and then I saw him drop the goods; I was in Milk-street, just about five yards off I picked up the goods.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing him so as to know him again? - Yes, I was close to him when he dropped the goods, it was a wet night.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the person that was afterwards taken was the same person that dropped the goods? - Yes, I am sure of it, the very same person was brought to our warehouse.</p>
               <p>(The goods produced, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Dowling. These are our goods, one piece was bought from a neighbour to make up an order, we were in a hurry; I know those goods were on the compter, they were part of some returned from the country; I have no doubt at all but they were the goods taken out of our warehouse; there was another lad, who lives with Mr. Allen, in Love-lane, but he had not been running, there was nobody running across Aldermanbury.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say after you had laid hold of him, and brought him back? - I thought he had been a stouter person than I found he was; he was wrapped up in a great-coat; I struck him twice, he made no complaint at all of ill usage, he said nothing to the charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called five witnesses, who gave gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Dowling. Do you recollect how the prisoner was dressed the night you took him up? - He was dressed much like what thieves are in general, with a brown great coat on, and a red handkerchief about his neck.</p>
               <p>Had you taken notice of his dress at all when you saw him go off from the shop? - I saw a short person, with a hat on, and a great coat.</p>
               <p>Had you taken notice of the colour of his great-coat before he dropped the goods? It was in the warehouse, which is rather darker than in the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250104"></xptr>But when you saw him in the street, at the time he dropped the goods, did you see how he was dressed? - I did not remark how he was dressed.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. Did you take notice how the prisoner was dressed when you saw him drop the goods? - He had a silk handkerchief round his neck, and a brown greatcoat.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was the lad Lloyd dressed? - In the same dress he is now.</p>
               <p>Without a great coat? - Yes.</p>

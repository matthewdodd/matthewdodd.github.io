On Thursday, the 21st of November, I was coming from Kensington, when I came beyond the barracks I saw the lamp-lighter had began to light the lamps; and before I got out of Kensington Gardens the clock struck five, I then saw a man come out of the Park with some dead wood; it began to get a little foggy, I was very much timid, being by myself, my bundle was large, and I had a pain in my side; I could not get on so fast as I could wish, and when I came to a place where some stone-masons were at work by candle light, I saw these two men at the bar stand opposite by the trees where these men were at work; they stood before me, I passed them; their backs were to the light, I saw they were soldiers in their dishabil; I looked at them very much, and when I passed them I turned round to see if they looked at me; I saw them both look at me very hard; when I got behind the gate in Hyde Park, I heard somebody come running.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to go from Kensington in the road instead of the Park? - A. Because they had began to light the lamps, I was going to Cumberland Place or Street, No. 7, Oxford Road.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your bundle under your arm? - A. I had it in my gown, it was more than I could meet with each arm together.</p>

             sworn. I am shopman to Mr. Wright, pawnbroker, Tothill-street; I produce a silk cloak and two shifts: the two shifts I took in of Starkey on Thursday evening the 21st of November; I was in the shop at the time Starkey pledged the mode cloak for twelve shillings the same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Starkey.) Is that the cloak and the two shifts you pledged? - A. Yes, the prisoners at the bar had the duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom had you the cloak and the two shifts? - A. From the two men at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutrix.) Look at these two shifts and the cloak? - A. They are mine, and all the other things are mine, there is my mark on most of them.</p>
               <p>Hilson's Defence. I went to a cook's shop to have a bit of supper; there was that bit of cloth and two more little pieces laying in the street; I thought it was dropped by somebody going into a rag-shop; I saw it was a little bit of new cloth. I went up stairs, and put it in my knapsack.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That bit of cloth was in my bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Starkey, she swears you brought them there? - A. (Prisoner Hilson.) She is a common girl of the town, she will swear any man's life away, what can you expect of her.</p>
               <p>Vincent's Defence. I picked that handkerchief up going home, on Constitution Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any body to prove that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Hilson called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Vincent called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. What did they do?</p>
               <p>Biles. Then they took my Silver Buckles out of my Shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they throw you down?</p>
               <p>Biles. They never struck me, I stood all the Time; they took out one of my Knee-Buckles, and the other they made me take out myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these Buckles made of?</p>
               <p>Biles. Silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take any thing else?</p>
               <p>Biles. Yes, a Silver Lac'd Hat, and a Pair of Leather Breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was these Breeches on?</p>
               <p>Biles. They were on my Body, and they made me take them off and give to them.</p>

               <p>Biles. No, I can't say I know them, it was a dark Night.</p>
               <p>Court. So, this is all you can say in relation to this Fact?</p>

               <p>Q. What, did you rob with these same Pistols? In what Manner did you rob?</p>
               <p>Bray. We met him in the Five Fields and demanded his Money; he did not seem to be free, so we haul'd him out of the Road, by a little Gateway, into the Field, and

                  </hi>. I keep the Horse and Groom in the Walworth-road—I have resided there six years—I have known the prisoner nearly the whole time I have been there—about eighteen months ago he left a parcel at my house—I was not in at the time it was left—when I returned home I discovered the parcel—it is now in the possession of Mr. Haynes—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) this is the parcel and the letter that came with it—it was in the middle of the summer of 1844—I do not know the handwriting—it is directed to Mr. Thomas Jack<lb></lb>son—I saw the prisoner after the parcel had been deposited, on many occa<lb></lb>sions—I have once or twice told him to fetch the parcel away—he said the man would call for it—no one ever did call for it till after I named it to Mr. Haynes—a day or two before we appeared at the police-office—the prisoner came to my door in consequence of two men that I turned out of the house—whether they went and told him, I do not know, but he came and created a disturbance—words passed between us—he said I was a rogue, a thief, and a swindler; that I had robbed my creditors, and I had stolen goods in the house—I said, "If I have, I have only one parcel, that don't belong to me, and that is the parcel you left here; and if stolen, the sooner it is out of my possession the better"—in consequence of that I communicated with Mr. Haynes, and gave up the parcel to him—the prisoner never said anything to me about the letter, after I had communicated with Mr. Haynes, but while the parcel was still in my possession two persons called on me—I did not give the parcel up to them—I cannot tell whether I had ever seen either of those persons with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the A division of police. I received a communication from Mr. Wright and went to his house for these gloves—on the morning afterwards the prisoner came to Scotland-yard—he said to me, "I understand you were at Mr. Wright's last night?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I understand you have got a parcel of gloves?"—I said, "I have"—he said, "That is all right, I left them there; if you want me here I am"—I said, "I don't want you now, if you will leave your address, I will let you know"—he did so, and said, "I hope you won't want me on market-day?"—on the Tuesday afterwards I went into the neighbourhood of the prisoner's house, and asked for him—the landlord of the public-house I was at sent for him—he came, and said, "Do you want me?"—I said, "I don't to-night, if you will meet me to-morrow morning at Lambeth police-court, it will be suf<lb></lb>ficient?"—he said, "I will meet you at any time"—I said,"Meet me at eleven o'clock"—(he is a general-dealer, he attends Romford and other markets)—when he came to the Court I produced this letter, which was with the gloves—he said, "That is my handwriting"—I opened it—he looked, and said, "Yes, I wrote that letter"—this is it—it is dated the 13th of June, but no year—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"<hi rend="smallCaps">DEAR SIR</hi>,—The party returned last night—will look at the goods to-morrow if you think proper to leave, them; I have left them accord<lb></lb>ing to my promise. Yours, respectfully.—J. D." To Mr. Thomas Jackson.)—I had got this parcel of gloves in a bag—he said, "There is not near all the articles I left at Wright's; there were two dozen of silk stockings with them, and an invoice"—he said, "They were left at my house with my girl in my absence, and when I came home I took them across to Wright, to be left till called for—they have been left at Wright's two years ago on the 15th of last June."</p>

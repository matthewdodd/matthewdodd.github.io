On Sunday night I saw sixteen 5s. papers of pence and halfpence safe about eight or nine o'clock - I put them by themselves - I sleep at the market: the prisoner does not sleep there - I do not think he was there on Sunday evening; I went to the cupboard frequently on the Monday, and on Tuesday afternoon, about three o'clock, I missed four papers; the prisoner was not there then, but he had been there both on the Monday and Tuesday - he had lived about four years with me; I had seen it all safe about nine that morning - I applied to the officer, and told him who I suspected - the prisoner was on the premises most of the time from nine to three o'clock; I had sent him out at three, and when he returned I charged him with taking it - he said he had never done any such thing: the officer was waiting for him - he was not searched till he got to the watch-house; I went with the officer to his lodging, and found 10s. in copper in two papers, and some loose coppers - my son had marked the coppers; I saw the letter B. at one end of both the papers in his hand-writing, and have not a doubt of their being two of the papers taken from my shop - when they were found he cried, and said he was sorry for it; I had a good character with him, and always supposed him honest.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your son here? A. No - I was present when he wrote on the paper - I have trusted the prisoner several times to carry 100l. or 150l. for me to the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him at his lodging? A. I called him a villain when I found it out, and said he had a good master and I thought I had a good servant - I said I should not spare him; he said he was sorry for what he done - he never confessed taking any thing; he was sorry for being found out - he said he was sorry, and pleaded for mercy; I have often taken coppers out of one paper and put them into another when it was broken; the old papers might be picked up in the shop, but are not fit to put coppers in; the papers found had 5s. in copper in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170035"></xptr>each of them - he knew I knew where he lived; it has happened when I have sent him to the bankers' with change that he has returned me a few shillings which I have sent too much; I cannot say the sum - I should not have discovered it, but for his honesty.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the paper appear to have been removed from the coppers? A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner - Bays charged him with stealing four 5s. papers of coppers - he denied it; I afterwards went to his lodging, and in a drawer I found two papers of halfpence with each a B written on them - Bays claimed them; the prisoner then acknowledged his guilt - he said he was sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you mean by acknowledging his guilt? A. He said, "I am sorry for what I have done, and hope you will not be hard with me"- he certainly did acknowledge his guilt; he said he was guilty in Mr. Bays' presence - Bays was going out of the room very likely at the time.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 28.</p>

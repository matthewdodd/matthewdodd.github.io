               <p>RICHARD SMITH. I am clerk at the New-inn, Old Bailey. On the evening of the 21st of March the prisoners came there with a cart - I went into the yard and asked them what they had got for us; they said ten chests of tea - I said I would call a man to help them to unload; they said I need not trouble myself, but I called a man - they gave me their bill, but said they had not their book; and while they were unloading I went into the counting-house and entered them - I signed 1s. 8d. on the bill for ten chests; when they had unloaded, one of them came to the door, and said, they had but nine chests, and they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110065"></xptr>would bring the other in the morning - I said I must alter the bill to 1s. 6d., and I gave them the note, but I did not strike off the ten; they then went away - the chests were to be sent to Cooksey, of Southampton; one of the prisoners paid me the money, and the chests were sent by the waggon - I did not observe what name was on the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Which of them paid you? A. I believe it was Callow; they did not tell me they had an unchalked chest which they did not know what to do with - they were taken into custody the same night.</p>
               <p>PETER PALMER. I live in Greenfield-street, Commercial-road, and am a <rs id="t18330411-138-viclabel770" type="occupation">carman</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the cart loaded? A. No, but I saw it in the street; I did not see how many chests there were - it was at the Globe public-house, Crutched-friars, that I saw it; I asked Poole if they had got the right number, and he said Yes - it is very common to chalk the different chests, to prevent trouble in the inn yards; I did not see whether these were chalked - the chests ought to have been put into the cart by the yardsman, but he is not here; these ten chests were to go to Southampton - I understood the prisoners were stopped in Farringdon-street; sometimes we have mistakes in chests of tea, and I desire my men to take them to the Globe, and ask the landlord to let them remain there for the night - we have had mistakes before; I have made mistakes of the same kind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Will you explain what you mean by mistakes? A. I have taken wrong chests from the East India company's yard, and returned them the next morning - I do not know that I ever took one too many.</p>
               <p>JOHN BARRS. I am porter at the New inn, Old Bailey. I was called to unload the chests of tea from the cart; I unloaded nine, one of the prisoners, (but I do not know which) pulled them out of the cart - they said they had ten to deliver; they delivered nine, and said they should bring the other the next morning - I saw they had other chests in the cart, and asked where they were going with them; they said one was to go to the Magpie and Stump, Newgate-street - I do not know where they said they were going with the others, but they stated how many they had to deliver; I asked what they were going to do with that one - they said to take it home - I said I supposed it was one that they had made for themselves, and if they made one a week they would make a good berth; they said no more, but went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did they not tell you they had ten to deliver to your master? A. Yes; I did not examine them to see if they were properly chalked or not - I forget the other places where they said they had to go, but they might have to pass Farringdon-street - I do not know how many chests there were in the cart, but there was one more than they said they wanted; they might have told me they had one more to deliver at another place than they had, and that would have accounted for all the chests, but that would not have agreed with the bill - I did not have the bill, but I saw it - they gave it to the book-keeper; there was nothing to prevent me from examining to the chests in the cart - I had not noticed them coming to the yard before; I have been twelve months in the place - I have not been drinking to-night.</p>
               <p>JOHN BLOMFIELD. I belong to the Rose Inn, Farringdon-street. On the night of the 21st of March I was informed the prisoners came to my yard with three chests of tea in a cart, and they left two of them - I saw the cart in the yard, and one chest in it - I took the King's number of it, 4468; it stood there an hour and a half - I told the street watchman to speak to them about it; they took it away about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you speak to them about the chest? A. No, they were gone to drink - I did not see them at all - but I went into the yard, and asked why the cart stood there.</p>

               <p>DAVID RICHARDS. I live at No. 6, North-place, Liverpool-road, and am a watchman of St. Sepulchre's. In consequence of what Mr. Blomfield said, I stopped the cart in Farringdon-street; I asked the prisoners what they had in it - they said a chest of tea, and they were going home with it; I asked if they had a bill of parcels - they said No; I said they must go to the watch-house and give an account of it; when I took them to the watch-house, they said they had ten chests to deliver at the New Inn, but this one was a wrong number, which often occurred in their business, and they were going to take it home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not stop them in the road from Farringdon-street to Crutched-friars? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN MARVELL. I live at No. 25, Sea Coal-lane, and am a constable. I produce the chest of tea, No. 4468, and these cards, which Callow delivered to me voluntarily.</p>
               <p>MR. PALMER. I believe this is one of the chests which ought to have gone from the New Inn to Southampton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not generally the case, that when chests are to go to a certain inn, that the name of the inn ought to be chalked upon them? A. It ought to have been done by Poole, but he is a stranger to the business - they might have left this chest in some place without taking it to the Rose if they had meant to have robbed me; it often happens, that the name of the inn is not marked on the chests; I have every reason to believe that this was a mistake.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Then you believe there is no ground for this prosecution? A. I believe it was a mistake; the cards which they have, generally have the number of the chests on the back of them.</p>
               <p>Callow's Defence. When I received the cards, I looked at the numbers on the chests, and I took this number for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110066"></xptr>4768, and when I got to the New Inn, I said, "This is a wrong chest;" the book-keeper was not out of the counting-house at all till he called the porter, but he did not unload them - I took them out myself; when he came down he counted thirteen, and he told the book-keeper ten.</p>
               <p>Poole's Defence. I loaded the cart with eighteen chests; I told Callow there was a wrong chest - it was an oversight; I do not understand the marks.</p>

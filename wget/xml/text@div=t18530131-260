                  </hi>. I am the sister of Grace Collins, who keeps a haberdasher's shop in Castle-street. On Thursday, 9th Dec, the prisoner came to the shop; I had never seen him before—he asked me for change for a crown—he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece in one hand, and I gave him the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the other hand—he went away with the change, leaving the crown piece with me—he came to the shop on 30th Dec. again for change for a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—my sister said something to me, and I gave her the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece that the prisoner had given me—I went to a grocer's two or three doors off, and he sent his boy for a constable, who came and took the prisoner into custody.</p>

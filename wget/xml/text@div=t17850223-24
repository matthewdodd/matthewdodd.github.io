             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Hoxton, I was robbed on the 18th of January last, a little before eight o'clock, by four men, who said nothing to me but pushed me across some logs.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you sober at this time? - I had been drinking, but not to hurt myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230074"></xptr>How far was you affected with the liquor? - Why, I cannot say I was affected very much.</p>
               <p>Did you know what you was about? - I did.</p>
               <p>Had you been at a public house in the neighbourhood there? - The last house I was at, was the sign of the White Horse; I did not stay above seven minutes, I had been at another public house about an hour; after they threw me across the logs, I was partly strangled with the blow, and one thing or another; a woman came along and saw me lay, and these four men were all standing together, the woman had a candle and lanthorn, she looked round, and hearing me groan, she squalled.</p>
               <p>Then you at this time was almost insensible? - Not insensible, but I could not speak.</p>
               <p>What deprived you of your speech? - Why some how or other, they gave me a push with a hand, or hit me a slap on the face, and my cough took me.</p>
               <p>Can you tell whether they did any thing to you after you was down? - I cannot tell what they did, nor for above a minute, the woman came and hallooed out, for God's sake, there is a man that is very much in liquor; then I put my hand into my pocket, and I missed my watch, and I said, I have been robbed, I then saw two of the men walking off.</p>
               <p>What became of the other two? - They stood by me, for the woman said, for God's sake, friend, help the man up, he is very much in liquor, and see him home.</p>


               <p>Did you get your watch again? - I never heard of it.</p>
               <p>When was the last time you had your watch in your hand? - At the White Horse, I put it in my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Did the chain hang out? - No, it did not hang out, for I was attacked at the door of the White Horse by two men who took hold of my chain there, that made me go in.</p>
               <p>What two men were those? - The men that went away, I went in there for safety.</p>
               <p>Did you feel who took your watch? - I did not feel it go at all.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoners or either of them? - These two men were in the gardens along with the other two, but which of the four took my watch I cannot tell; there was a woman there too which I did not see.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that these two men are two of the four? - Yes, these two men staid and helped me up, I believe it was almost dark.</p>
               <p>Then what have you to say against these two men? - I cannot say they took my watch.</p>
               <p>Do not you think it is more likely, that if your watch was taken, it should be taken by the men that run away? - Possibly it might, I do not know which took it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Council. The woman said, you was very drunk, do you mean to take upon yourself to say, that you never saw these young men before? - Never before that time.</p>
               <p>How did you describe one of these as dressed, before the Magistrate? - In a light coloured coat, not one of these, but one of the four.</p>
               <p>

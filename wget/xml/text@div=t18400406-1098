                  </hi>. I am a messenger and constable of the Provident Institution, in St. Martin's-lane. On the 7th of March, about one o'clock in the day, I met with a soldier, who was a stranger to me, but I treated him, and he took me to the Canteen in St. George's barracks—I there met with some more persons—Bennett was one of them—we went to a public-house, which I think was the White Lion, in Hemming's-row—we there met some other soldiers—they had two or three pots of ale—I did not drink—I am not certain where I met with Beard, but he was there—I then went with the two prisoners to Long-acre, to the Windsor Castle public-house—we had a pot of ale there—I cannot say who paid for it, as I was so much excited by their manner, and by their putting their hands into my pockets, when I told them not—they asked me to pay for beer—I said I had no money—I had had 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I went out, and all that I had spent in drink which I gave away, and had nothing but water myself—the prisoners felt me about—I wished them to desist, but I did not call out—there were some men and boys at another table—Beard at last robbed me of my watch by force, and at the same time Bennett took my handkerchief out—Beard told me he would go and pawn my watch, and he went out with it—I went home as soon as I could.</p>

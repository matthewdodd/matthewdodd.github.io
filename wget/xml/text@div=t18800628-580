                  </hi>. I am a licensed caiman and Custom House agent, of 4, Upper East Smithfield—I keep an account at the head office of the London and Westminster Bank—the prisoner has been in my employ as a clerk for some years—his duties were principally outdoor, collecting accounts, paying bills, etc.—he did not keep a petty cash book—he had to account for what cash he received—on 10th April I gave him notice to leave on that day fortnight—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my cheque-book—on 1st January last I commenced to draw a cheque, and put the date on the counterfoil, and then discovered that the cheque itself was missing—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I made inquiry about it of the prisoner and my son, and looked everywhere for it without success—on Saturday, 24th April, the men were paid, and practically the work of the office was done about 8 o'clock that evening—I was only waiting to have the petty cash settled up—the prisoner said, "You need not wait for the petty cash sir, I will come in on Monday morning and settle it"—I said, "Very well," and left—I was there between 10 and 11 on Monday morning, and found the prisoner there—I said, "Alfred, will you settle up the cash)"—he said, "No, I can't now, sir, I left it in my coat at Bow (that was where he lived), but I am going home to dinner and I will bring it up in the after<lb></lb>noon"—he did not do so—I understood he did call on the 27th, but I did not see him—I first saw this cheque on Thursday the 29th—the signature "Thomas Stones and Co." is not mine—it was not drawn by my authority—to the best of my belief the whole of the cheque is in the prisoner's hand<lb></lb>writing, with the exception of the signature, I cannot speak to that—after I had received the cheque I sent for the prisoner's father and showed him the cheque, and also this order-book in the prisoner's handwritings which he compared, after which he made a communication to me—on the following Monday the prisoner came to the office—he said, "My father</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This case was heard at Guildhall three times, first before Mr. Alderman Fowler, and subsequently before Sir Thomas White, and Sir Benjamin Phillips came in afterwards and Sir Thomas White con<lb></lb>ferred with him—the charge was dismissed—the counterfoils and cheques bear the same numbers—this one is No. 166,173—I did not stop the cheque at the bank—I sometimes carry a blank cheque in my pocket, and so does my son—it is part of our business to do so—I have always thought that the whole of the cheque except the signature was in the prisoner's hand<lb></lb>writing—when I was first examined before the Magistrate I said the date was in the prisoner's writing—on the second occasion I said to the best of my belief the words "forty pounds" were his writing, and the figures also—I did not then include the word "self"—I wanted to get away on the Saturday evening—I said before the Magistrate that I only showed the prisoner father the date of the cheque, that was for him to compare with the writing in the book—I said to the father that I would let the matter rest for 48 hours—I did not say I would settle the matter for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Will you give me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this cheque"—he declined to do so—my son kept the petty cash book—at times the petty cash was short—I have had to complain of it—the book is here—sometimes I filled up cheques, some<lb></lb>times my son, and the prisoner—I believe my son was in the habit of carrying the petty cash about in his purse—I have heard that he was sometimes in the habit of spending the petty cash for his pleasure—I did not know it then—I know it now; he has said so—the cheque-book was kept in an open drawer in the office—there were no other clerks—there was a little lad a messenger—there were persons to clean the offices—there was always some one there—the office was never left—Mr. Johnson was not in the office at this time—he was there some part of the time with the prisoner—the prisoner was between seven and eight years in my employ—I am not prosecuting any indictment against him—I am here as a witness—I have given no authority to prosecute him for embezzlement—there was no committal by the Magistrate on any charge whatever.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have nothing to do with this prosecution—the bank are prosecuting—immediately I found this cheque was passed to my dehit I communicated with the bank authorities, and they at once took the matter in hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness, and assist him in his business—on the afternoon of 27th April the prisoner came to the office—I spoke to him about some accounts, those of Harrison and Johnson, T. and D. Henry, and Austwick and Webb—I asked him if he knew anything about them—he said yes, he had collected them and paid them in on the 24th—I asked why they were not through the bank—I then had the pass book before me—he then said he did not pay them in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188006280005"></xptr>
               <p>on the 24th, it was the 26th—I then asked if he could explain why they were not through the bank then—he said he could not—I took down the accounts at his dictation on this paying-in slip—he then paid me the balance of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of petty cash—in consequence of what was said to me the pass-book was taken to the bank and it was returned to us, and I found we were credited with the 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the forged cheque was in the pocket and put to our debit—I believe the 27th April, 1880, on this cheque to be the prisoner's handwriting, also the word "self" also the word "pounds"—I cannot say as to the "forty" or the signature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have spoken to a little more to-day than I did at the police-court—I there spoke to the date and the word "pounds—I said nothing about "self" there—I say now I believe it to be the prisoner's writing—I won't speak to the "forty"—I have sometimes been short in my petty cash, about four times—I did say I thought it was six times—I said before the Magistrate, "Sometimes I carried the petty cash about in my purse, and the prisoner has taken care of the purse for me that I should not spend it"—I was sometimes so fearful of myself that I was obliged to trust some one else with my purse—the cheque-book was kept in the office accessible to all in the office—I sometimes carried a blank cheque in my pocket, not always.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an expert in handwriting—I have had this cheque and other documents placed before me by the bank authorities for the purpose of comparison—among other things this order-book—to the best of my belief the "27th April, 1880," on the cheque, is in the same writing as that in the book—I say that the whole cheque is in the hand<lb></lb>writing of one and the same person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I say that of the whole cheque, signature and ail—my belief as to handwriting has not always been right—I don't know that. I was wrong in Sir Francis Truscott's case—Mr. Netherclift and I have differed perhaps in one case out of 50—I have looked at the "f" on the top of the cheque and that in the book—they are not the same, and for a very good reason—they are written by the same person but in a different hand—the in "hundreds and these in "pounds" are as different as can he—these in "hundreds" is such ans as the defendant frequently makes—the 8 in "pounds" is the habitual 8 of the prisoner, exactly as he forms it—the handwriting of the cheque is not like the prisoner's—some of the letters are like his—the prisoner makes some letters like the prosecutor and his son, and he makes certain letters alike—with a little distinction there is a family resemblance in some of the letters, not in all—I do not think these is a letter in which there is a likeness.</p>

               <p>handwriting of the prisoner; I have also had acknowledged hand writing of the prisoner placed before me—taking the order-book as the basis, and looking at the cheque, I still say it is in the handwriting of the prisoner—I it is a very careful imitation of the prosecutor's handwriting; it has first of all been drawn in pencil, and must have been copied from a cheque written by the prosecutor—whoever wrote the cheque must have had possession of it for some time; it is a servile copy; every letter, every figure, is formed precisely in the same way as the prosecutor forms his, with perhaps one exception, the 7 in 27th April; I don't find a 7 formed in that way either by the prosecutor or his son—I find in the order-book several instances of a 7 like that, by the prisoner—then the "I" in "April," and the "d" in "pounds" has all the characteristics of the prosecutor's I and d—those are the things which lead me to give my opinion to the best of my belief—I cannot in such a case as this cheque <hi rend="italic">give</hi> an absolute opinion that it is the prisoner's handwriting, but I give it from certain minute particulars, and from the general handwriting in this book.</p>

               <p>evening—I met the two prisoners—one passed me on the right hand and the other on the left—directly they passed me they closed behind me, and pushed me against the wail—I suspected there was something the matter, and as soon as I got extricated from them I missed my pane, which contained six sovereigns, from my trowsers pocket—I seized both the prisoners—they struggled, and Fox got away, but I kept hold of Cormack, and I hallooed "Police!"—there was a crowd collected, and a man came up and said, why was I ill using the woman—I said I was not ill using her—he either pushed or struck me, and I struck him, and by that means I let go Cormack, and she got through the crowd and ran away—after I got from them, a boy told me something, and I went to a gateway, and there was Cormack—I took her into custody, and took her to the station—I then went with the policeman, and found Fox.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. Between 6 and 7 o'clock, on 9th Nov., I was coming up from St. Katharine Docks, near Rosemary-lane—I saw the prosecutor—he had hold of Cormack, and was screaming "Police!"—a young man came up, and said, "What do you want to do with the woman?"—I believe Mr. Wheeler hit him, and he hit Mr. Wheeler again two or three times, and Cormack ran away—a little boy told me she was gone down a turning—I went and saw her there—I said, "You have robbed that gentleman of six sovereigns"—she said, "I have not got the money; the other woman has got it"—I went and stood at the top of the court—the policeman came up, and we gave her into custody.</p>

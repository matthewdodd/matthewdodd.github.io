                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 344, Walworth Road—on 18th May, about half-past nine, I heard a noise in the passage, as if a man was trying to open a latch—I was in my consulting-room—I went out and saw the prisoner in the passage, with the door closed—it was light—there was a light over the door—he opened the door and ran out—I ran after him through the garden, which is twenty-five or thirty yards long; he turned to the right in the road and up Roney Street—I did not lose sight of him, and in the middle of Roney Street I saw his hand go, as if to throw something away—on his turning the corner some one stopped him and brought him to me—he and I were the only two persons running in the street, and I never lost sight of him—I went up into the spare back room and found marks of grease on the drawers as if of tallow, and I have not had a tallow candle in the house for three years, as there is gas all over the house—there was a little mark on one of the drawers as if a <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi> had been put to it—the drawer was not locked, but one of the handles was loose, and force was required to open it—a muslin curtain was hanging three-quarters of an inch out of the drawer—I had been in the room about an hour previous, and I know the drawers were not in that state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How long was it from the time you first saw me till you arrived at the station? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not more than ten minutes, if as much—I only went back to get a drop of brandy and water, as I was rather excited.</p>

               <p>went out on to the landing, and the steps made a sudden stop and turned down again—I heard a handle of a door go, on the first floor about a minute or two before I heard the steps—I heard my master go out about three minutes afterwards.</p>

I am one of Mr. Wright's servants—on 18th May, about half-past nine, I had been in the kitchen about a quarter of an hour, and heard the street door bell ring; I went to answer it—it was a new servant coming—as I was taking her box down I heard footsteps on the first floor—I waited a few minutes, but I thought it was only the nurse<lb></lb>girl—I then heard the postman come, and my master went and took the letter—I then heard the street door go as if it was the catch, and heard my master run out, calling "Stop thief!"—I saw a curtain hanging out of the drawer, and saw grease on the drawers—we never use candles.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 141 <hi rend="italic">P</hi>). I saw the prisoner running in a direction from Mr. Wright's house, chased by 100 people, and Mr. Wright among them—I did not see him stopped, but he was given into my custody—I told him the charge—he made no reply, but took from his breast a pin, and was going to throw it away, but I seized his hand and secured it—it has nothing to do with this case—I went to Mr. Wright's house and found marks of the toe of boots in the area, where somebody had got on to the dust-bin—the prisoner refused his name and address for a long time—he afterwards gave his name Wilson.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had something the matter with my toe, and took off my sock and boot against Mr. Wright's door. The door gave way and let me one or two steps into the passage. I was going to pull the door to, and Mr. Wright came out, and on the impulse of the moment I ran away. There are other persons in the house, and no doubt some of them had been to the drawers. Is it reasonable, if I had been in the house with a felonious intent, that I should leave without taking anything?</p>

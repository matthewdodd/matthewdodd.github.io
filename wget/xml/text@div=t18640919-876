I am the prisoner's wife, and live at 3, Victoria-street, Shadwell—he is a dock-labourer—on the night of the 13th September, about 12 o'clock, my husband and I were at home—I was sitting at needle-work—he was about to strike one of the children—I interfered, and he then struck me in the face—I did not see anything in his hand—I felt some blood—he was not sober—I went to the station, and had my wound dressed by a doctor—the prisoner is a very good husband when he is sober—he had been out of work for some time before this; he was in low spirits, and said he was tired of life—he had said that he had better end his life than live in such misery,</p>

               <p>of the 14th September, I heard cries of "Police!" and "Murder!' at No. 3, Victoria-street, and I Raw the prosecutrix at a chemist's shop, being supported by two or three other females—there was a wound on the right side of her face—I saw the prisoner about twenty yards off, and I took him in charge for stabbing his wife—he said he did not know anything of it—I noticed his hands were smeared with blood—I afterwards went to 3, Victoria-street, and found this knife in the fire-place—there was blood upon it—the prisoner was the worse for drink—he seemed regularly confused, as if he scarcely knew what he was doing.</p>

I asked my wife, and she would not tell me, and from words it came to blows, and I had a blow on the nose, which made it bleed, and caused the blood on my hand. I knew nothing else of it till I was taken into custody in the street.</p>

Flatau, with whom I communicated, and on the Wed<lb></lb>nesday following Mr. Jacob Flatau and I went to the shop, and asked to see some men's boots—I looked at the marks on the uppers, and knew that they were my own cutting—I had an officer waiting outside, and Mr. Flatow went to the door and beckoned him in—twenty-nine pairs of boots were then produced, the uppers of which I recognised by my own mark of the size.</p>

I am clerk to Abraham and William Flatau, boot and shoe manufacturers, of Leadenhall-street—I accompanied the last witness and an officer to Nathan's, in Victoria-park—some boots were produced, the uppers of which were made in our establishment, but the soles had not been put on by us—in consequence of a communication made by Nathan I went with the officer to the shop of another person named Nathan, in Duke-street, Aldgate—I saw some more boots there, the uppers of which were our manu<lb></lb>facture—we manufacture boots and shoes for the trade, and we sell uppers, but we keep no stock of them; when they are ordered there is a special pattern, and we have a special mark which these have not—these boots are not manufactured like ours—we rivet them, which means putting on the soles with brass brads—some of these are pegged; we never peg any—the</p>

Nathan, ladies' and gentlemen's boot and shoe maker, 31, Prospect-place, Cambridge-heath, Victoria-road;" that is the place where I went with Mr. Flatau, and first saw the boots—this is the other card, "Clark, wholesale boot and shoe maker, 90, St. John's-road, Hoxton."</p>

I keep a boot and shoe shop at 19, Duke-street, Ald<lb></lb>gate—I have known the prisoner five or six years—I was in the shop in June when Mr. Jacob Flatau and the officer came there; I was out when they called, but when they came back I saw them take these boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had purchased the upper leathers of those boots of Arnow two or three months before—I saw Arnow at the station, and stated in his presence that I had purchased them of him; he denied it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you charged with receiving these things, knowing them to have been stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was not guilty—on my oath I did not know that they were stolen when I received them—I gave half-a-crown for them—they were worth about four shillings and sixpence—I knew where Arnow was employed as a servant, and first of all I did not believe he came honestly by them, but he told me that he went to sales and bought job lots, and that satisfied me, as I believed it—he satisfied me directly after I bought them—I did not go to his employers—I do not keep books—I made no memorandum when I bought them—I have known him five or six years, but have not been buying of him all that time, because he went away at one time—he satisfied me that he got them honestly when he first sold them to me—I do not know whether he was then employed at Flatau's—I have known him to be employed there off and on, between five and six years, but he went away from there—I bought uppers of him then—he told me that he bought at sales when I first bought of him, and I never made inquiries afterwards—I did not see Messrs. Flatau or any one in their employment—I do not buy at sales—I never saw the prisoner in a sale room—when I went to the police-station I first knew that they were the property of Messrs. Flatau—I bought the uppers, not the complete boots—I have known of uppers being sold at a sale; there was a sale at Spitalfields, and I saw uppers sold there—I do not know whose property they were—it was not a bankruptcy—I have beard a good deal of uppers being sold at sales—I knew another instance at the West End, and I have seen sales in the paper, but have not attended them—I do not manufacture uppers—I have also purchased of Mr. Jones, of Bishopsgate-street—I give five and ninepence for the best quality—the cost to the manufacturer of those I give four and sixpence for would be about four and threepence, but you could get them up cheaper than you could buy them.</p>

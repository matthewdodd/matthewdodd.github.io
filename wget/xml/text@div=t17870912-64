             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live with Messrs. Hinchliffe and Hollyer, refiners; I bought some plate of Manypenny, this tea-pot is all we have left unmelted.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what the other articles were? - I think there was a quart mug and some spoons.</p>
               <p>Was any body with him? - No.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Hinchliffe or Mr. Hollyer at home? - I am not certain, but believe not.</p>
               <p>Did you know Manypenny before? - Yes, I knew he lived with Mr. Edwards, watchmaker and silver-smith in Cheapside, he brought it as from Mr. Edwards, and we bought it as Mr. Edwards's property, it weighed fifty ounces five penny-weights, at 5 s. 1 1/2 d. per ounce, that was a fair market price for silver at that time.</p>
               <p>Do you usually buy such articles as these to melt down? - It was as black as my hat when it was bought.</p>
               <p>That is nothing; you know a little plate-powder would clean it, now what could induce you to suppose that Mr. Edwards who is a silversmith, and kept a public shop, and who, I dare say, would not sell it to me under 7 s. 6 d. per ounce, should send such an article as this to be sold for 5 s. 1 1/2 d. per ounce? - It has been repaired since.</p>
               <p>But that makes no difference, it was easily done; what could induce you to suppose that Mr. Edwards should send his servant to sell you such plate at such a price? - No answer.</p>
               <p>Court. Your conduct has been highly reprehensible, highly criminal in buying this plate; I am happy to be informed that neither of your principals were concerned in this transaction; I tell you as a caution, that a silversmith of credit in the Strand, was convicted upon evidence not much stronger than this, and sent to the lighters upon the river Thames; he gave a better price by 5 d. an ounce for the plate that he bought, and, excepting the circumstance of denying it afterwards, it is much stronger in this case than in that; your's is a business extremely dangerous, and I would have you to be very cautious.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did Mr. Edwards deal with you at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How lately before this had Manypenny brought things to your shop? - On the 7th of July.</p>
               <p>Have the goods in the course of your dealing been sent by him without a note of the weight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He has no account with you? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Is it usual to have plate brought without any note, but sent by a servant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you never had a note from Mr. Edwards of the weight and price that he meant to sell it at? - No, I do not remember that he ever did.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Mr. Edwards himself upon this business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120105"></xptr>Did you enter this in your book as received from Mr. Edwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The boy had not lived with Mr. Edwards for nine months.</p>
               <p>Court. If after this, any thing of the kind should happen again, it will be the duty of the Court to order a commitment.</p>

               <p>Had not Mr. Edwards, in a year and a half, or two years, sent other servants to this place? - He might, but I do not know.</p>

               <p>Was that tea-pot one of the articles? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How long had you lived with Mr. Edwards? - I lived with him twice; I believe about two years.</p>

               <p>What was your employ chiefly at Mr. Edwards's? - I was errand-boy there, he used to trust me with a great deal of property.</p>
               <p>How came you to leave him? - It was in the lottery-time I left him, I did live at a lottery-office; the first thing was, I had an accident to lose some cases, and he wanted to stop all my wages, four shillings a week, and I would not; I left him to live at a lottery-office; I lived with Mr. Wetherall in Holborn, and another person since, but I had no employment at this time.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you took up the business for which you were committed.</p>
               <p>About six months ago.</p>
               <p>Where did you get the plate you sold to Cowie? - In Clare-street, Clare-Market.</p>
               <p>How long had you had it before you carried it to Cowie? - Between two and three hours.</p>
               <p>How did you get it? - Simmonds went up stairs and brought it down.</p>
               <p>Where was you? - Standing at the door.</p>
               <p>How long had you been acquainted with Simmonds? - Three or four months before.</p>
               <p>You are sure he was with you when you got this plate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did he get in? - The passage door was open, and he went up stairs, he brought the trunk down and put it behind the door, and I went in and took it and carried it as far as Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>How long was he in the house? - It may<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120106"></xptr>be five minutes; I cannot say to a minute.</p>
               <p>Did you see him put it behind the door? - No, but I saw him come out of the house; he told me there was a trunk behind the door, and I went in, and fetched it out.</p>
               <p>What time of day was it? - About three, or between three and four in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>How came Simmonds not to take it himself? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did he bid you take it? - He told me there was a trunk there; I knew what he meant; I took it on my head, and went a little way down the street, through an alley, into Bridges-street, Govent-garden; Simmonds and I took a coach there, and drove to Whitechapel, near Petticoat-lane; we took the trunk out of the coach, and went into a public house with it.</p>
               <p>Do you know the number of the coach? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever try to find that coach again? - Yes, but I believe I should not know the coach again if I was to see it.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen the coachman since? - I do not know, I might in the coach; we broke open the trunk with a knife.</p>
               <p>He or you? - I helped him.</p>
               <p>What did it contain.</p>
               <p>(Repeats the things mentioned in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Did you put the plate into the trunk again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you do with it then? - He went out, and bought a yard of tenpenny cloth, and I staid, and minded the trunk; he called for a pint of ale; he came back, and brought the cloth, and tied the plate up in it.</p>
               <p>In the public house? - Yes, we put the trunk before the plate and drawed the curtain.</p>
               <p>What public house is it? - I cannot tell, it was some where in Whitechapel; I think I could find it again, because there is a cobler stall under it.</p>
               <p>Should you know the landlord again? - I do not know, but I think I might know him if I saw him; he took the plate, and I took the trunk, and we went away from the public house.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the trunk? - We went down a great many turnings, for fear any body should be looking at us; we went into another public house, and had some gin and water; we drank it, and I took the trunk out, when we went up two or three turnings, I dropped the trunk in an alley.</p>
               <p>Did Simmonds wait for you? - No, he went on.</p>
               <p>Was any thing left in the trunk? - Yes, some candlesticks; I do not remember any thing else being in it; we then went straight on to Mr. Cowie's; I took the plate from Simmonds.</p>
               <p>What the whole cloth of plate? - Yes, I went in with it.</p>
               <p>Did you sell it all there? - No, there was a milk pot, a papspoon, and some tea spoons, and other things; Simmonds said he would keep them back a little, for there was plenty for one time; he put them in his pocket; they were kept out when we broke the trunk open before they were packed up in the cloth.</p>
               <p>In the first public house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Simmonds did not go into Cowie's with you? - No.</p>
               <p>All you carried in, Cowie bought? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Cowie pay for it? - Mr. Edwards had been there selling some plate, and there was some left that he had not paid Mr. Edwards, and he gave me the difference to give Mr. Edwards; he gave me two ten pound notes, and two guineas, and he gave me a note of it, which I left on the compter.</p>
               <p>How much was that for the plate you sold him? - About thirteen pounds two shillings I believe, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The rest he owed to Mr. Edward's before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you sold plate to Cowie often after you had left Mr. Edward's before this? - Two or three times, it might be four times.</p>
               <p>He always paid you ready money for it? - Yes, always.</p>
               <p>Where was Simmonds? - Watching for my coming out; when I brought him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120107"></xptr>the notes, he said I must go back, and get them changed; I went back, and told him that Mr. Edwards would be glad if he would change that for me.</p>
               <p>Did Simmonds send you in directly? - No, I kept out a little, till I thought I had time enough to go to Mr. Edwards's.</p>
               <p>Where does the refiner live? - In Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Did you get cash for the notes? - Yes, for one, and he said I must get change for the other; I got the other changed in Wood-street; I told them I came from Mr. Jones, of Hatton-garden; we then went home.</p>
               <p>Where is home? - Simmonds's lodgings, No. 34, Tash-street.</p>
               <p>Did you go with him? - Yes, but I did not stay long; I went home to my mother's after that.</p>
               <p>Do you know what became of the articles that were kept back? - Yes, he took them in a cloth, and said he would go to Hendon; we left them at a public house, in Gray's-inn-lane, as a bundle; he went and fetched them away on Monday, and carried them to Hendon, and I went down the next day, and came up the same night; when he came to town, he had spent all his money, and Mrs. Simmonds sold the milk pot, and spoons, and tea tongs.</p>
               <p>How came she to sell them? - Because I did not know where to sell them, and he said his sister knew a young man that would buy them.</p>
               <p>Did you go with her? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how do you know she sold them? - They both told me so.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - She said Dick, I have been to tell some spoons, and a milk pot.</p>
               <p>How came she to say so? - Because she knew very well that Tom and I used to be together.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether she knew how you got them? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>What was Simmonds? - A butcher I believe.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear him tell her how he came by these things? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any of these things in her possession? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>How long after did you hear her say she had sold these things? - I believe it was the same day she sold them.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what day? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>How long after the robbery? - It might be a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Did she say who she had sold them to? - Yes, one Mr. Jones in Fleet-street; there was a pap spoon he had in use a great while till he wanted money, and that he pawned; I do not know who pawned it, he told me it was pawned.</p>
               <p>Did he say where? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any thing else being pawned? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You never heard him tell his sister how he came by these things? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell her? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>You never told her any thing of this robbery? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have promised to tip me some of your gammon, have not you? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear you never said so this morning? - No, I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>However, I shall tip you some hock to your gammon; pray, young gentleman, whose lottery office boasts your education? - I lived at one Mr. Shergold's.</p>
               <p>You have been about six months a thief? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Regularly at the trade? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Besides dabbling a little before; in the course of six months, you have carried on a roaring trade? - Yes, I and Simmonds.</p>
               <p>In the course of six months, you and Simmonds have carried on a roaring trade at it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On the day you went to Clare-street, you were on the way to Parliament-street? - No.</p>
               <p>I thought you was going to dispose of the watch you did in Theobald's-road that day; was it not the same day? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>You know what doing a watch is? - I suppose it is stealing it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120108"></xptr>You did that yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you shall have the honour of it; now upon your oath, was you not on the road to Parliament-street, and seeing this door open, you thought it a good convenient opportunity? - No.</p>
               <p>There was one little circumstance you missed, though you have been very accurate; how much of this twenty three pounds you had for your own share; you welled one of these notes, did not you? - I do not know what that is.</p>
               <p>Then I will tell you what welling is, when you take twenty pounds, you put ten pounds in your own pocket, and divide the other ten; how much did you give Simmonds? - Of the first ten pounds note, he had five pounds.</p>
               <p>You did not well any that time? - No.</p>
               <p>It is about a twelvemonth since you spun your top into the area in Brook-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was before you was a regular thief? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You made forty guineas of that job? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You went and brought out forty guineas, how did you get that forty? - It was in a cupboard; the key was in the cupboard door, and I opened it; but my top never went down the area; young Mr. Sherwin used to take notice of me, and I used to go backwards and forwards to see him kill the sheep.</p>
               <p>And you thought that a good convenient opportunity to open the cupboard door, and steal forty guineas; and I believe Mr. Sherwin was fool enough not to prosecute you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You kept a lady or two of course? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Pray who were those girls that came to visit you while you was under confinement? - They were Simmond's acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been here before? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Have you never been up in the gallery to study? - No, never, I have been in that corner. (Pointing towards the door).</p>
               <p>Oh, that was the place of your study, the next place you will be in, will be there; (pointing to the bar) for you will be hanged in the course of two sessions.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the plate of the same colour when you sold it, as it is now? - No, it seemed as if it had lain by a great while.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you live last, before you was taken up? - I never was away from home.</p>
               <p>Did your parents know you was carrying on this trade? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you do with your money? - When Simmonds was out of money, he having a family, I used to lend him mine.</p>
               <p>Then you robbed for the sake of lending your friends the money? - We never used to rob when we had money.</p>
               <p>What are your parents? - My father is a cabinet-maker, and my mother a mantua-maker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I would have you take care of yourself, for I assure you, I will have you watched as soon as you are discharged; I will take that upon myself.</p>

             delivered in a written defence, which was read by the clerk of the arraigns as follows.</p>
               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen; I do not wish to deny, or even to disguise a single circumstance of truth; conscious that my innocence of any criminal intention in this unhappy business, will appear in the most satisfactory light. I stand before the Court a striking example, that the most perfect innocence may inadvertently become the subject of a criminal accusation, and that a life of honest industry may be tainted in a moment; my affliction is of a peculiar nature, and increased by the means which brought it upon me: for, though a common share of prudence might have furnished me with a sufficient degree of precaution against the artifices of a stranger; yet human foresight could not have suggested a possibility of danger from the snares of a brother. When I pledged the various articles laid in the indictment,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120109"></xptr>I entertained no suspicion that I was violating the law. The open and undisguised manner I did it, at mid-day, which has been proved to the Court, will, I trust, convince you, that I could be under no apprehension of guilt. My unhappy brother brought me the articles, and informed me, that a master with whom he had formerly work'd, was obliged to make up a sum of money, but did not chuse to expose himself, and therefore had requested him to do it for him; under these circumstances, I took the things to Mr. Jones in Fleet-street, to whom I had been known many years, and he offered me five shillings and nine-pence per ounce, assuring me it was the utmost value; it then occurred to me it would be a good opportunity to buy the tea-spoons and tongs, cheaper than I could buy them new, and I therefore took them myself at the same price Mr. Jones had offered me; but as I was not possessed of quite money enough to give to my brother, I left four of the spoons and the tongs at Mr. Jones's to raise the remainder: I accordingly paid my brother after the rate of five shillings and nine-pence per ounce. This, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, is the true simple statement of the transaction; under these circumstances, I have done nothing more than a common act of friendship, which I was credulous enough to think I might have safely done for an indifferent person; it is some consolation that I am able to produce unimpeachable testimony from respectable persons now in Court, of an irreproachable character; which, I hope, will have its weight. I trust you, Gentlemen of the Jury, will be satisfied, that I was drawn into the commission of the offence now charged upon me, without knowing that I was the instrument of violating the laws of my country. I leave myself in the hands of you, my Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, in full confidence, that as my conscience does not condemn me, I shall have the happiness to hear you pronounce me innocent.</p>

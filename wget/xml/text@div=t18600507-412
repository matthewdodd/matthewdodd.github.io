                  </hi>. I live at 32, Piccadilly—the prisoner was my valet and had been so about two years—I went to Gibraltar on 31st October last—on the day before I went I had left my purse on the mantelpiece in the drawing-room—I sent the prisoner to look for it, and he came down and said he could not find it—I left in the morning to go to Gibraltar, and I desired the housekeeper to send it to me when it was found—I saw no more of it till it was shown to me by a policeman after the prisoner was taken—this is it; here is a pencil-case in it which is mine—there are no cards here now—this pair of stockings are mine; they are marked with my initials—I believe my wife had a silver watch—I never gave these things to tie prisoner; I may have given him other things.</p>

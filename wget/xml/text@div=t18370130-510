                  </hi>. I am the son of Thomas Sharpe, of tailor, in High-street, Aldgate. On the 7th of January, about half-past ten or eleven o'clock, we had a pair of <hi rend="italic">trowsers</hi> just inside the door, where we usually place blocks and different articles—they were not outside—but almost be<lb></lb>yond this man's reach—he must have jumped up to get them, being short—we had half a dozen pair, and they were well secured up—they were all ton down, and we missed two pairs—a person passing by gave the alarm—I ran out, and when I got to Houndsditch I saw the prisoner running away with this pair of trowsers under his frock coat—I caught him in Duke's-place—as soon as I collared him he threw them into the mud and tried to escape—I held him till the officer came, and gave him in charge—these are the trowsers, I picked them up—here is our private mark on them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was coming up Aldgate—I saw a young man, nearly six feet high, run across the road, and he dropped a pair of trowsers—I ran and took them up and hallooed to him—I was walking towards my home—I bad the trowsers in my possession seven or eight minutes, and the prose<lb></lb>cutor did not see me running.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Gower-street, Bed ford-square—I purchased a house and business at Barnet, bat finding no business, I did not carry it on—there was property in the shop consisting of cloth, fixtures, woollen goods, and some furniture—I took another shop at Hadley, which adjoins Barnet—I fitted that up as a shop and moved my goods from the house I had taken at Barnet, to that house—the prisoner was in my employ previous to Christmas—he had does little jobs for the person I succeeded, and assisted me materially my business there—I staid at Barnet about two months—I left it about a fortnight before Christmas—the prisoner was left at the house at Hadley—I left my goods there in his care—I found trade was of no avail, and as he was so very much respected in the town, and his wife too, I said to him, "Beales, if you think you can get a living here, it will not answer my purpose; I will leave the thing as it stands; you may establish yourself as you can; and I will pay half of next quarter's rent"—nothing was said about the goods—I left them there for him, to make a respectable appear<lb></lb>ance—I afterwards received information about my goods, and went down to Hadley—I found the property removed from the premises—I have seen a great part of them since—they were returned to the house at Hadley one evening.</p>

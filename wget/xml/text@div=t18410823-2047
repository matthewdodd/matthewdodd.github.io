                  </hi>. I am a broker, and live in Caroline-place, City-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Sboreditch; it is my dwelling-house. On the 19th of July, at half-past ten o'clock at night, this oil-cloth was safe in the back cellar, which could not be got at without going through the front cellar—it has an iron grating, which I saw down safe at half-past ten—nobody could get to it without removing that grating—about eleven o'clock, as I was going to bed, I looked out of window, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner Ashmore coming from the pavement up to the shop front—I looked through the window, suspecting him, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the window up, and saw him take this oil-cloth, which was handed up to him out of the cellar—he walked away with it—I am certain he is the man—I continued to watch, and saw Mattingley come out of the cellar, through the grating—I went down, got out at the first-floor window, and followed, but did not overtake them—I saw them both together next morning, in Sun-street—Ashmore had the piece of cloth now produced, which was safe in my cellar the night before.</p>

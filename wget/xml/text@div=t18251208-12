On Thursday, the 17th of November, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I observed a barrel of anchovies on a different side of the warehouse to what it ought to be - it was concealed behind two casks. I took it out, and particularly noticed the marks on it; it had the letter W. and a small blemish on one of the staves. I placed it between some casks of the same size - the prisoner worked in the yard near that warehouse. I did not miss it until he was brought back to me. I had given 46s. each, for one hundred of them. Mr. Nelme was the broker - they were all one price.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you opened the cask? A. No; I only bought them in October - the barrel is marked in a peculiar manner; I know it from any others. I noticed the blemish in the stave - we may have sold eighty of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever employ the prisoner to take out barrels? A. We sent none out that evening - we do at times make allowances for damaged barrels.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Friday, the 18th of November, about nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in Wilson-street, Shoreditch, with something in a bag on his shoulder. I went across, and asked what he had got; he said a barrel of anchovies - that he bought them at Billingsgate off the quay for 25s. I took him to the watch-house, and asked where he was going to take them - he said to Brick-lane, Spitalfields, and that he had brought them from St. John's-street, Goswell-street-road. I asked where in Brick-lane he was taking them to - he could not tell. Mr. Messenger saw the barrel on Monday.</p>
               <p>MR. MESSENGER. We missed it on Saturday, when we took stock of them; I saw it safe on Thursday; it is worth much more than 25s.; the prisoner had a guinea a week.</p>

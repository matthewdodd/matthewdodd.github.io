               <p>night—when I left I went along the left hand side of St. Peter's Street—when I turned to go back some man came to me, he caught me round the waist and said "Give me some tobacco "—I said "Leave go of me; please; if there was a policeman here I would have you locked up "—he did not let go—he swung me round and I fell on my right side into the road—he struck me when I was falling, somewhere here on the neck—I have a mark there and on the right temple—he struck me several times about the head—I fell on my right side and he fell across me—In my left hand trousers pocket I had two 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I felt his hand about that pocket—I said "Leave my money alone "—he made no answer; he did not leave it alone—I believe he had it; it was gone when I got up—he got up and went away—I felt his hand at my pocket, and afterwards passed his hand towards my watch as though he was going to take it—I said to him" You have got my money; leave my watch alone"—he did not take my watch—he made off then—I saw two little girls, Willis and Cook, when I got up—I said to them "That man has got my money, can you tell me who he is?"—they were about 4 or 5 yards from where I fell—there was no shop near—they followed me down the street—I went home first and told my father—he then came back with me to the police-station—I have not the least idea who the man was but from the girls' evidence—I have only seen him before at St. Alban's Court—the man who assaulted me was about the height and build of the prisoner, shorter and stouter than myself, dressed in corduroy trousers, pilot coat, and soft felt hat—I have known the prisoner by sight about the town, and to the best of my belief he is the man——after going to the station I went with my father and constable Murray to a police-ser-geant's house, and then to the house of prisoner's father in Catherine Lane—they said he was not there, he did not live at home—on Saturday night after the robbery I spoke to the prisoner at the Ten Bells public-house,—after I had been to his fathers house—I said "Have you seen me before this evening?"—he said "No "—I asked if he had seen either of the little girls—he said "No "—they were not with me—I knew them by name—I asked him if he had seen a little girl named Willis that evening—he said "No"—he said he had not been out of the Ten Bells since 9 o'clock—if was after 10 o'clock, just after 10 o'clock, when I left the shop—I saw no one with the prisoner there—I saw his father, the prisoner was not present when I first saw him, but was afterwards at the Ten Bells—he said "It is my-son, Mr. Walklake; I don't want him to go to jail; try and make it up now, come "—the prisoner was present but said nothing; he appeared to be asleep, and we had to wake him up—I had stated what had happened; the policeman was with me.</p>

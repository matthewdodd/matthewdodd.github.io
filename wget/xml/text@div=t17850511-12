               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Jackson's Counsel.</p>

               <p>What did Jackson say to Ley? - He came to Ley, and asked Ley for the power, and said, he could do no longer without

            's power, Jackson had given it to Ley; he said, it did not signify to keep him any longer in agitation, for that he was drunk one night, and had lost that power, and some papers, and he would make him another as good; when Jackson objected to it, says Ley, you blockhead, I have done it several times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. I submit to your Lordship, that this woman is an accomplice; admitting her evidence to be true, she clearly was there from the first moment that that application was made, if she speaks truth, there was a power of attorney forged in her presence, with my Lord Mayor's name, and Bell's mark put to it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Keys. Had this money been obtained by Jackson, you was to have had part of it? - No, I want no money, nor I got no money, I expected no part of it.</p>

               <p>Did not Jackson acknowledge that he had given me a power of attorney, that had been signed by the Lord Mayor? - There had been a power originally signed by the Lord Mayor, he did mention that there was a power of attorney originally signed according to that date.</p>
               <p>Did he say, he had given that to Ley to come to your house to receive the money? - First it was an application of Jackson's, to know whether Ley had received the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. When were these prizes taken? - In December, 1777, and in April, 1778, no later than that.</p>
               <p>Court. After Jackson came the third time, do you recollect any person coming to your house to enquire for him? - Mrs. M'Carthy came, and was talking about Bell's prize money, and I asked her in.</p>

               <p>How far back would it be possible to search that? - We make entries of all, that would take a considerable time; Jackson and Ley both said, that the real power was of that date.</p>
               <p>Did he say what he had done with it after he had filled it up? - Jackson said, that he gave a shilling to pay the fee upon the execution of this power of attorney.</p>

               <p>Will you endeavour to recollect, whether afterwards, he said, it was a good power? - Afterwards, when they came to be examined before the Lord Mayor, he said, there had been an original one executed by the Lord Mayor, and that Mr. Ley had lost it, and had made them out that.</p>

               <p>Do you know the King's Arms public house on Tower-hill? - No, Sir, I know the Nag's Head, I do not know the King's Arms; I was at chapel along with my husband the Sunday before.</p>
               <p>Did you stay from ten o'clock all that time in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who is the landlady? - A fat lusty gentlewoman, she was in and out of the parlour, I suppose she might see us together.</p>
               <p>What did you do all that time? - I do not know, there were several people there, I was obliged to stay as he was so good as to say he would go along with me; I left it about three and went over Tower-wharf, and went to Wapping; I was examined before my Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know the Globe before? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know the King's Arms? - No.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was not the King's Arms? - The landlady was a shortish lusty woman.</p>

               <p>Court to Winspear. Stand up, look at that lady, is that the landlady? - It is not like the gentlewoman, she is quite an elderly woman.</p>
               <p>How was this man employed? - Several people came in and shook hands with him, and I saw him writing a power for a seaman, sometimes he came in and went out.</p>
               <p>Did he put his hand in his pocket, or give it to any body, when he had filled it up? - I do not know, I heard somebody call him out to the door, he did not stay long out with the gentlewoman M'Carthy; I saw him give something to the other man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jackson. I wish to ask this woman, if I did not go to No. I, Lower Gun-alley, to enquire for Mr. Ley, the Friday before the Monday, and she asked me what I wanted, and I told her he had a power of attorney of mine, and he was playing tricks; I went to this gentlewoman, in Gun-alley? - I do not recollect him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a poulter of 128, Old Kent Road—on Tuesday in the first week in May the prisoner came and asked if I had any tools to sharpen—he was a stranger to me—I gave him two saws to sharpen; he brought one back, but not the other—I saw him a week</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188006280148"></xptr>
               <p>afterwards, and asked him where it was; he hesitated a moment and I said "You must produce it, I shan't be played with; I shall im<lb></lb>mediately give you in charge unless it is produced or paid for"—he said he would tell me the truth, he got drunk, and it was at home; and if I would give him till 6.30 he would bring it, but I did not see that—he has never produced it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I gave you the second saw when you brought the first back—I don't remember whether you told me that the second one wanted setting—it was not worse than the other—the value was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 298). I took the prisoner on 11th May—he said that he took the saw away as it wanted re-setting, and if Mr. Hester would give him till 6.30 he would return it—I found on him a book of the National Penny Bank, Shoreditch, in the name of Walker, a pawn-tickets two files, a brush, and three purses.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I had not tools fine enough for the saw, and took it home intending to do it there, but got into bad company, drank too much, and next morning got up without a penny in my pocket, and borrowed 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the saw, intending to redeem it. I offered to bring it at 6.30 if he would spare me till then, but he called an officer and had me arrested.</p>

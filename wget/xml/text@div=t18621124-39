                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, of 4, Curtain-place, Camden Town—about half-past 11 o'clock on Saturday night, 1st November, I was driving a pony and cart near the Gipsy Queen public-house, Kentish town, behind another cart—Joseph Crisp and Pratt came up to me—I am sure they are the men—they asked me if I had seen a dog—I said, "No"—they went and stopped Wright's cart which w as before me—they got down, told him to go on, and then said to me, "Where is the dog?"—I said that I did not know what dog they meant—Pratt struck a blow on the side of my head, which knocked me down between some dirt where some houses were building—they each struck me—they struggled with me a few minutes, and a third man then came out of a turning, that was Thomas Crisp—I am sure he is the man—the one on this side told me to go up farther—I did so, and they kicked me on the back—I had then got up again—they kicked me again, and said, "You b—, take that to Hampstead"—they all three than threw me down, and tried to forage my pockets, but I buttoned them up, and my coat also—I had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, as far as I recollect—they did not get that—I halloed "Harder" and 'Police," and somebody came up and attacked them, and picked me up—they left me senseless, and when I came to they had gone away.</p>

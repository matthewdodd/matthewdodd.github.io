                  </hi>. I have one partner, and live at High-street, Stratford. On 19th May, about half-past 1 o'clock, the prisoner came and asked to look at some wedding-rings—I am sure she is the person—I never saw her before—I showed her a card, and asked her what price she wanted; she said about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took several off at her price and size, but she wished to see more—I produced the second card of the same price and size, and she then took rings off at a much higher price, and in consequence of that I watched her, and when I brought out a third card I counted those I took off; she had her hands on the counter, and I saw her take one and put it into her pocket, and I missed one by counting—she asked me if I had any more rings—I said, I thought I had shown her quite sufficient—she said there was none to suit her, and was about to leave the shop, when I stopped her and told her she had a ring belonging to me in her pocket—she denied it, and I sent for a policeman—the lad returned without one, and when she found I was determined to send a second time, she produced the ring from her pocket—I took her to the station—she begged for mercy, and said she would make me any compen<lb></lb>sation I thought fit—this is the ring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

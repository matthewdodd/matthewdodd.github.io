             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 13th of February, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in the Strand. She asked me to give her something to drink, I told her there was nobody up, and gave her a penny to get a glass of gin. She asked me to go and be concerned with her; she said she had not taken a farthing that night. I told her I had but a few half-pence in my pocket; she said she would go with me for those few half-pence. We went upon the <placeName id="t17800913-6-crimeloc39">Savoy Steps</placeName>

When I got on the Savoy Steps with her; I felt her hand in my coat pocket, taking my watch. Before I could get ready to pursue her, she got away down the Savoy Steps.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130007"></xptr>Were you standing up? - Yes. I tried to catch at her, but she had got too far; I ran round the Savoy-square to the sentry-box, she had asked the sentinel to let her in, but he would not. She hid herself among the barracks. I never found her till the Friday fortnight. I have never seen my watch since.</p>

               <p>I never saw him before he took me up. He took up two women before, and swore to one of them; and she was cleared before the justice.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. How long was you with the woman? - About a minute; we were directly under the lamp. I wrapped some tow about my watch before I put it into my coat pocket. I had not lain down with her at all.</p>

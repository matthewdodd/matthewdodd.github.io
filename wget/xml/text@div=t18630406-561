                  </hi>. I am A ribbon manufacturer, of 24, Wood-street, Cheapside—I was on the city side of London-bridge, looking at the preparations—as I passed through the archway, I saw the prisoner before me, and felt a touch at my watch, which I missed immediately—the ring had been broken away from the chain—I seized the prisoner and called out, "Police!"—a policeman immediately came forward—I then heard something and saw my watch at the prisoner's feet—it was worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you see it in my possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I caught hold of you directly I missed it—your back was towards me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 435). I was on duty on this day about twenty minutes to 6—the prosecutor said that he had lost his watch, and pointed oat the prisoner about two yards off—I got hold of him, and saw the watch fall at his feet—I picked it up, and took it to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could it have fallen from anyone but the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say; it fell two feet from him, just at his feet almost, but the crowd was very great—I cannot say from whom it fell—there were others from whom it might have fallen just as well as the prisoner.</p>

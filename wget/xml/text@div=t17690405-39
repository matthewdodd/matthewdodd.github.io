The prisoner came into my shop to buy a shirt-buckle: there was another man came with him. The prisoner took up one and put it in the hand of the other man. I thought by their behaviour they had a mind to rob me. I sent for Mr. Shotten, a neighbour, who came. I said they had got a buckle. The prisoner said he had it not. I put my hand in the cuff of his coat, and got hold of something, but cannot say what it was. The other man got out at the door and ran away. The prisoner laid hold of my hand, and forced it out from thence; but whether it was a ring or shirt-buckle, I do not know. After they were gone I found a diamond ring behind a chest in the shop. I missed a garnet shirt-buckle, which I never found again.</p>

            . I live near Mrs. Clark. On the 4th of April she sent her servant to desire me to come to her shop, as she thought she had two bad men in the shop. I went in. She said she had missed a buckle, and she supposed the prisoner had got it. A constable was sent for, and he was searched. He twisted his arm away from Mrs. Clark, and in a minute after we found a ring; but I do not know how it came there.</p>

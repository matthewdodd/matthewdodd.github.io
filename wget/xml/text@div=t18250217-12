            . I am a watchman. On Sunday night, the 30th of January, about half-past nine o'clock, I saw the two male prisoners in Maria Sheldrake's room, in Little Pearl-street - there were four fowls in the room, one cock and three hens; I asked the prisoners if they had lost any thing; they said No. I found a padlock key just outside the door, which I showed to them - they claimed it. There were other lodgers in the house. I asked where they had got the fowls; they said they had bought them down the lane, but did not say of whom. I took them into custody. I do not know whether the two men lived there or not.</p>

            . I am a constable, and was sent for to take charge of the prisoners on the 30th of January - I found the two men, but not Sheldrake; one of them said the fowls were bought in Petticoat-lane: the other must have heard what was said. I found three fowls in one cupboard, and one in the other, all alive - I asked the men if they lived in the room; they said No: I said they could have no business there, and took them to the watch-house. I afterwards heard Sheldrake say it was her room - she was brought to the watch-house about half an hour after, and said she knew nothing about the fowls.</p>

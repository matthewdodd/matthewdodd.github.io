            . I am the wife of George Thorpe, and live at Edmonton. I saw the prisoner once, two or three weeks before the time in question, but never spoke to her - on Thursday night, the 24th of July, about a quarter before twelve o'clock, I was at Stoke Newington - I wanted a lodging, having left London, and did not like to go on to Edmonton - I did not mind sitting up until daylight - I asked the policeman first where I could get a lodging - I saw the prisoner in the street at Newington, and asked her to tell me of a lodging, or tell me any where I could sit up for an hour or two - she said she would take me to her lodging - I went down the street with her as far as the Weavers' Arms, about a quarter of a mile - nobody was with me at all - very few people were passing - she knocked me down close by the Weavers' Arms in <placeName id="t18340904-6-crimeloc37">Newington</placeName>

               <p>Q. Had you been drinking with the prisoner that night? A. I cannot say but what I took a glass of gin with her - I had been drinking in her company altogether I suppose two hours - we talked together a great while in the street - I am separated from my husband at present: he allows me six shillings a-week, and that was the money I lost - I had seven-pence besides in my pocket - that was all the money I was possessed of; also a boot, and a duplicate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you ask me to tell you where I could get a lodging? A. Yes: you said you would take me to your lodging.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How far were you from the door of the public-house when she knocked you down? A. Close to it - the door was just open - the people were all turned out of the house, it being very late - there was about six persons standing by - there were five or six standing at the top when I got up - they were all her confederates.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was on duty on Stamford-hill, and heard a cry of "Murder!" repeatedly from the bottom of the hill - I ran to the spot, and found the prosecutrix lying on the ground - she said, "I have been robbed of my pocket and five shillings by a woman who has gone up the road" - I ran up the road, and took the prisoner into custody, five or six rods from the spot - she was walking away, and a young man with her - I brought her back to the prosecutrix - she said, "She is the woman who has robbed me" - the prosecutrix was then near where I saw her lying, close by the public-house, just down a little passage - I think the public-house door was closed then - there were two or three men outside at the time, and I think they had just been turned out of the house - they were within two or three rods of where the woman was lying - I took the prisoner to the station-house - she was searched in my presence, and 1s. 4d. found on her - I went back with a light, and found the pocket thrown over into the garden, four or five rods from where I took her into custody, with a boot in it; and on the foot-path close by I found a duplicate - I have had them ever since - I found nothing on her but 1s. 3 1/2d., and two farthings - when I took her, she said, "I never would rob a woman, but as for a man, I would not mind, a lying b-" - I think the prosecutrix was perfectly aware of what she was doing, but I think she had had a little to drink - I took the prisoner in the main road - there was nobody passing - I only saw the three men standing.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the prosecutrix sitting on the steps of a door, very much in liquor - she asked where she could get a lodging. I said I would take her to the Weavers' Arms - I asked if they could give her a lodging - they said, "No; not to strangers." On coming out, she asked if I would have any thing to drink; she paid for a quartern of gin, and she changed fourpence - in coming out, she asked if I had got my money, I said I had, I had one shilling and sixpence when I met her; she asked me to be two-pence towards the gin, I said I did not mind; I changed sixpence, and gave her twopence - two or three men came up, who knew her, and got into conversation with her- a man, that I knew, came up - I was talking to him - during that time, she was taken down a turning by the Weavers' Arms, and shortly after, I heard a cry of "Murder"- I went to her assistance; she was lying on the ground - I went to the top, and walked a little further - the policeman laid hold of me, and when I got up to her, she said I was the woman; but I am as innocent as a child unborn.</p>

            . I am a policeman. The pocket was found on the very spot the prisoner was taken; not at a distance - I was on the spot where she was taken into custody, at the extent of my beat - I went to the station-house with her - I was not there when the pocket was found, but Brett showed me where it was pushed through the iron fence, where she stood at the time, and took her into custody.</p>
               <p>T. BRETT re-examined. I showed the witness where I picked up the pocket, a few minutes after, before I left the spot. I picked it up several rods from where the prosecutrix was lying - I picked it up where I took the prisoner into custody - I took her to the station-house before I went and found the pocket - I knew the spot where I took her, it was an opening. <rs id="t18340904-6-verdict38" type="verdictDescription">

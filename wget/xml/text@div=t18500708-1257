The prisoner was left in charge of my house during my absence—I left town on 12th May, I returned on 21st, in the evening, and missed a pair of sugar-tongs, a scarf, and a metal teapot, which were there when I went away—these are them—I found three duplicates in the house, which I gave to the policeman.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, did any thing happen to you? A.They made a swing at me, and shoved one another against me - the landlord came, and told me to go out; I asked him what I had done; the pot-boy came, and asked if I wanted to fight - I said No; he said I must either fight or go out - he caught me round the waist, and shoved me into a passage, where the rest of the people followed - I was shoved down in that passage - as soon as I got up I went out into the mews; I saw Harrington bring the prisoner up - he asked if I had lost my watch; I put my hand to my fob, and said I had - he told the prisoner to give it to me; he did so - Clements has it; I know it to be mine by the maker's name - I delivered it to Stevens, the landlord, when I took it from the prisoner; I cannot tell whether the prisoner had been in the skittle-ground or not - I did not see him till Harrington brought him up; I did not perceive the watch go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You was thrown down, was your coat and waistcoat unbuttoned? A. My coat was, but not my waistcoat, except the two bottom buttons, which I always leave unbuttoned; my watch was in my fob, and I had a steel chain to it - the prisoner delivered it to me, and said he had picked it up; I made no disturbance at the public-house - we wrangled when the man would not pay me; he did pay me at last - I was no party to any disturbance there.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did the landlord order you out? A. He said I had not spent any money there, which I had not; he said I should not kick up a riot in his place - there was no riot about betting; they sneered at me, and began shoving one another against me - I should think there were eighteen or twenty people there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the prisoner's father lives? A.Somewhere in Carnaby-market; Harrington and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080087"></xptr>called at his house one night, after we had found the bill- that was the only time; he seemed very uneasy, and wished to know if it was a true bill or not; I promised to go and let him know, to save him the trouble of coming down.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to take Harrington with you? A. We were going the same way home, and he knew where his father lived, which I did not - that was my only object in calling; I never called before.</p>

            . I am a helper at Mr. Jay's livery stables, and have been so eight or nine months. I was coming by, and heard a noise at the Guinea; I did not go in, but stood outside, and saw the pot-boy catch hold of the prosecutor round the waist - he let go of him, and caught him round the waist again, to turn him out, I suppose - I heard nothing said; a man came and put his foot out before the pot-boy, and threw him down; I do not know the man - Williams was thrown down also, and was under the pot-boy, Williams said, "Let me get up;" they did so, and the man who put out his foot threw him down again, he caught hold of the collar of Williams' coat, and said he should not go out - while that man held his collar, Jones stood on his right-hand side, and I saw him, with his right hand, draw the prosecutor's watch out of his fob - he reached his hand across his body, put the watch into his right-hand trousers pocket, and went out at the door; he said to a young man, who stood outside,"Come along;" the young man said, "Stop a minute;" he said, "Come along" again - the young man made no answer, and the prisoner started off to run - I hallooed out, "Where's the man's watch?" the young man who stood by the prisoner's side said, "He has not got no watch;" I said he had, for I saw him take it out of the man's pocket, and hallooed out, Stop him! Mr. Billing's was coming round the corner of the mews, and seized him by the collar - I caught hold of the other side of his collar, and asked where the man's watch was - he said he had got no watch; I said he had, for I saw him take it - Billings said he had got it in his right-hand breeches pocket - he denied it again, and then we took him up the mews, and met the prosecutor - I asked if he had not lost his watch; he put his hand to his fob, and said he had - we took him as far as the Guinea, which was two or three hundred yards off, and there he (the prisoner) delivered the watch up to the prosecutor, who gave it to the landlord, and took the prisoner to the station-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Where does his father live? A. I do not know, any more than I have heard him say it was in Claremarket - I went this night to his father's house, with the prosecutor; it was last week, I think on Friday, but will not be certain - I do not know what the prosecutor went for; I did not hear what passed; he asked if his father was at home, and his mother said not; he said it was very wet, and he should not stand there - he left no message that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the same Harrington who once lived with Mr. Murle? A. Yes; I happened to get drunk when I went to see a friend, and lost my service - I was not so drunk as not to be able to drive my master's family if they had let me - I lived there three or four months; I have been drunk before, but it is not my habit; Billings is not here - I have not been to look for him; I was perfectly sober on this occasion; the watch was taken while the prosecutor was standing up.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell his Lordship you did not know where Jones' father lived, when you had been there within a week? A. I did not recollect it at the moment; I have not been there more than once, I am sure of that; I think it was Monday afternoon that I was before the Grand Jury- I walked home with the prosecutor; we went up Holborn with a young man named Brown - I did not call at Clare-market with him; we never went near Jones' father's house that day - I will swear I never went but once - when we were there the prosecutor was talking to a gentleman by the side of the house, and said he was out of employ - I do not know who the gentleman was - this was on the Friday; I have not heard what the prosecutor swore; Mr. Jones was standing at the door when he was talking to the gentleman; I have not seen that gentleman at Clerkenwell - he was a stranger to me; how he came by the house I do not know; he did not go with us - the prosecutor told him he had been out of place, but could have had one if it had not been for this case - I did not hear him say he was rather in want of money; I did not go with the prosecutor to the father's house after the bill was found, it was before.</p>

               <p>Q. Then if it has been sworn it was after the bill was found, it is not true? A. It is not - I heard the prosecutor tell the woman the bill was not found that day - that is all that passed, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know where to go? A. I went with the prosecutor, who took me there, not I him; I did not know where the father lived till he showed me - the father said in the hall that it was in Clare-market; the prosecutor asked him what number - the prosecutor said he should go to Clare-market, and let the father know about the bill, and we both went; I had heard him tell the father he should come down and let him know if the bill was found- if he has sworn he did not know where the father lived, and should not have gone if I had not taken him, it is not true - I did not go there the day the bill was found; I did not ask for money, nor did he, to my knowledge - I swear he did not, in my presence; it rained, and I went away from the door a little while, and was out of hearing - I suppose we were there five or ten minutes, but I took no particular notice of the time; Williams came away with me - I was quite sober; I do not think we could have been there three quarters of an hour - I was not in the public-house on the night of the robbery; this all took place in the passage - it was broad day-light; I did not see the landlord till he came to take the watch.</p>

            . I am the landlord of the Guinea. There was a disturbance in my skittle-ground; I wanted Williams to go away - he would not go, and I helped to turn him out in the first instance; there was a disturbance in the passage afterwards - I did not see the watch taken; it was given to me by Williams at the tap, while they were going to take the prisoner to the station-house- I did not see what passed in the passage; I gave the watch to Clements.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was the company in the house perfectly quiet and well-behaved till the prosecutor came? A.They were; he was the cause of all the dis<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080088"></xptr>turbance - I did not leave the house at all, and heard no thing of the robbery; Williams gave me the watch at the bar, and took the prisoner away, but did not tell me the charge - Mr. Billings is not here; he is a respectable man - I should have brought the pot-boy if I had been required; I was attempting to put the prosecutor out - the pot-boy took hold of him and shoved him back; he then said he would fight him - the prosecutor said he would not go out, and a crowd came.</p>

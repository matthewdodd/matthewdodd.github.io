                  </hi>. I am beadle of Covent-garden market. On the after<lb></lb>noon of the 2nd of Oct. I was employed watching Green, who was servant to the prosecutor, who keeps a shop in the market—I saw Green empty some damsons out of a bushel basket, at the prosecutor's stand, into a smaller sieve which laid on the ground—Weaver was close by—Green left the basket for some minutes, between Weaver's brother's stand and the prosecutor's—Weaver was near him at the time, and could see what was done—I made some inquiries of the prosecutor's daughter, then went back to the stall, and the basket was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in Covent-garden market, and live in Great Wild-street. On the afternoon of the 2nd of Oct. I watched Green by desire of Moore—he was standing at his master's stand—he turned, out, some damsons, and put them down, partly in his master's stand and partly in Wea<lb></lb>ver's brother's stand—he then spoke to Weaver—they talked together two or three minutes—after that Green went back to his work—Weaver followed him, and took the same damsons on his head to Duke's-court—he took the basket off his head, and put it into the passage, inside the door of No. 14—he came out with the empty basket—I saw Green taken, and heard Johnson ask him if he had authorized Weaver to take any damsons—he said no—he asked if he had authorized any one else—he made no reply—Johnson asked Weaver what became of those damsons he had taken up Bow-street—he said he had taken them to Green's house, by Green's direction—(Green lives at No. 16, and Wearer lives at No. 14)—I then went to No. 16, Duke's court, with Weaver—I heard him ask Green's wife where those damsons were that he took there a little while ago for John—she denied all knowledge of them—I am positive Weaver took them to No. 14—I stood in the court till he came out with the empty basket.</p>

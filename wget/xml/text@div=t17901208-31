On this Thursday morning I heard the watchman ring at the door; I did not perceive it was light; I came down about seven, within two or three minutes under or over; hearing the door open without being unchained and unbolted, I got up; I went into the maid's room, and she was not there, nor in the house; I was with the officer when he took her at her lodgings; she gave no intimation of her going; I heard my brother get up and open his door, which makes a noise; I heard nobody come down or go about the house, after the watchman wrang, and my brother went out.</p>
               <p>If the door had been opened, and the bolts drawn back between those times, should you have heard it? - I am sure I heard nobody; and it was dark when the watchman rang; my wife's mother was in the house, besides the people that have been mentioned; I did not open the door in the night; I found her at her lodgings; nobody was there but herself, from whence I conclude they were her lodgings; on searching her pocket I found a tin box, and to the amount of two pounds six shillings; we found nothing else that belonged to me; there were some duplicates, one for two shillings, the 26th of November; after we had taken her into custody, the officer and me went back to her lodgings, and found a tinder-box which I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You heard no question during the course of the night? - None, it was a remarkable dark morning, it was dusk when I went out; there was a brass kitchen candlestick standing behind the door, without any candle in it, or grease or ashes.</p>

               <p>The seam of it was unsoldered by the maid's setting a hot iron on it, and in consequence of that there is a little solder run down to the bottom.</p>

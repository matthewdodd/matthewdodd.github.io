On the 3d of July, in the morning, I missed two saddles and two coats from the coachhouse - they were safe the night before; I enquired, and one Hawkins, who has absconded gave us information, and the saddles were found in a ditch about three quarters of a mile from the house on the 5th, the prisoner was with me - I am not certain whether it was him or Hawkins that pointed them out, but he said he knew where they were; he was then in custody - the coach-house was fastened inside, they forced the bar up.</p>
               <p>LORKIN ELY. I live at Finchley, and have been a constable. I was fetched to the public-house - Hawkins there gave me charge of the prisoner - they were together - he told me that Mr. Collins's coachhouse was broken open, and the prisoner was the man who had done it - he did not deny it. Hawkins wished me to take him to Mr. Collins - I did so; the prisoner pointed out where the saddles were - he never denied being with the men who had stolen them.</p>

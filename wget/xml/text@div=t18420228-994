               <p>Beaumont, who keeps a coffee-shop in Long-acre. On the 26th of February, about two o'clock, the prisoner came in and called for a cup of coffee—he had a blue bag—I had seen him there before—I got on the dresser in the bar and watched—I observed him place the bag on the table, he then took off his coat, and placed it over the settle—he then got up, went round the room, and gathered up two newspapers—he sat down, folded then and placed them by the side of his bag—he then went round the room again, and gathered three more papers—they were the papers of the day before—he then rose again and reached an <hi rend="italic">Odd Fellow,</hi> which is a small publica<lb></lb>tion, and put that by the side of his bag—he rose, put on his coat, buttoned it up, and put the five papers within the breast of his coat—he then called to pay for his cup of coffee, and my sister went in to take the money—I went into the coffee-room—a gentleman said to me, "Is your brother within?"—I said, "No, I shall do just as well"—he said, "Search that man's bag"—I said, "I intend so to do"—I said to the prisoner, "Will you allow me to look in your bag?"—he said, "For what?"—I said, "My newspapers"—he said, "My good lady I have not got your news<lb></lb>papers"—I said, "You have"—he shrunk from me—I said, "You may just as well let me look in it at first as at last, as I will before you leave the room."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say you saw him put them under his coat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, five, but I did not know but there might be some in the bag—I told my sister to send for a policeman—the prisoner said, "For God's sake, don't give me in charge," and he let me search his bag, but there were no papers in it—I then said, "I must search you"—he said, "Don't give me in charge, I have a wife and family"—he said, "I am guilty"—I said, "I know you are"—he opened his coat, and there were my papers—the officer arrived—I said, "I give this man in charge"—in going to the office the prisoner offered me his watch and his purse—at the station they searched his bag and he begged of me not to press the charge—one of these papers has my mark on it.</p>

When I arrived I saw Emma Beaumont standing by the side of the prisoner with the papers is her hand—she gave him into custody for stealing six newspapers—he begged very hard, and said he hoped she would not give him in charge as he had a wife and family, and it would be the ruin of him—he put his watch and purse in her sister's hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the keepers at Mr. Cooper's establish<lb></lb>ment for insane persons, at Old Brompton. I had the prisoner in my care from the 26th of March till the 9th or 10th of April last—he was brought there by his friends—he was very melancholy, and moped about—if I asked him what was the matter, he would say, "I wish I was out of the world"—he used to pick up shoe-brushes and combs and dirty col<lb></lb>lars, and never own that he had them; and he would fold up the news<lb></lb>paper, and put it into his pocket.</p>

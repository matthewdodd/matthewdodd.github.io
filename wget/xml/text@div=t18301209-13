On the 4th of December I had one hundred and two sheep, at ten o'clock in the morning, when I counted them; they were on Mr. Essex's land, at Acton - I count them every morning, and next morning on counting them, I missed one; I looked about, and about ten yards from the hurdles I found marks of a sheep having laid down and struggled - there was no blood; I traced the sheep right up the field, and there it had been laid down and its entrails taken out, at the upper end of the field, in the ditch; I found its entrails and one kidney there - it appeared to me as if it had been opened alive; there was some blood, and I traced footmarks right up the field with a tipped toe, and four nails inside the heel of the shoe - inside the tip there stood four square nails; it was a turnip field, and ploughed ground; I traced the man's feet on the ground -

             afterwards measured the same foot-marks; I showed them to him - I went to the bakehouse, and from there to the Magistrate; I went with a warrant to the prisoner's house, about three o'clock - I found in a cupboard, or kind of coal-hole, under the stairs, a sheep's pluck hanging up; I then found a bag in the same cupboard, and in that was a sheep's skin cut into a great many pieces - I found my own mark on one of the pieces; that was a C. - the prisoner then went up stairs; I told the constable to follow him, and called out, "Here is my sheep skin, I will swear to it, take him into custody" - the constable called out."Here is the meat," and in a pan up stairs we found all the sheep, except the shoulder and head; it was pieces of mutton - we found no kidney, except what I found in the field; the prisoner was at home when we first went there - he did not object to our searching; the constable was with me - he was taken into custody; we took the skin, and meat before the Magistrate- Baker has had possession of the skin; the prisoner is a labourer, and works for Mr. Irons, at Heston - I knew him before very well; he has a wife and two children.</p>

            . I am a constable and shoemaker. I was present when the prisoner's house was searched - the prosecutor's account of what was found is exactly correct; I went with him to look at the feot-marks in the field, and took the exact dimensions of their length - there were marks of four nails exactly in the centre of the heel; I told Mr. Trimmer, the Magistrate, of this, and the prisoner's shoes were lifted up; the dimensions exactly corresponded, and there were four nails exactly in the same place, on the heel - I have the pieces of the skin; when found it was nearly warm, as if recently killed; I also found in the house this cord and apron, both all over blood and wet, as if they had tied the sheep - they were wet when I found them; his shoes appeared to be nearly a new pair.</p>

            . I am a labourer - the prisoner works at the same place as me. On Saturday night, the 4th of December, we were paid together, and came away from master's together; he turned into a gate for a necessary purpose, as he said - I did not see him any more that evening; I parted from him about a quarter of a mile from the field where the prosecutor's sheep were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left that young man for a necessary purpose - I ran after him to overtake him; there was a man before me with a parcel - he threw it down,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090014"></xptr>and ran away; I took it up, put it into a cupboard close to where my coals are kept, and there it remained - I took the meat out, put it into a small dish, and sent it away from my children, that they should not meddle with it; the constable came next morning to search my house - I said he was welcome to do it; I opened the cupboard door where the skin was - the meat was standing in a dish up stairs.</p>

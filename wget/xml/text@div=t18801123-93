                  </hi>. I am barman at the Feathers, Lambeth Walk—on 3rd November, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I saw the prisoner and two others in the bar—no one else was in that compartment—there was an empty rum cask there; it had no hole in it; it was put there as a table—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is the top of it—when the prisoner came in he had gloves on; he had some beer, and had of three-quarters of an hour afterwards he leaned over the cask and got a light from the gas jet, which was about a yard off—he was not smoking—he had no gloves on then—in about five minutes I heard a kind of hissing noise, and saw</p>

               <p>the prisoner and two others run out, and the cask exploded with fire and a bang, which blew all the staves out, knocked the ceiling down, and blew the window out, the woodwork falling all over the bar—this hole was not in the top of the cask before that I am aware of—he cut it while he was there, but I did not see him; I did not see anything in his hand—he had never spoken to me before this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He got a light, but not to smoke—they were drinking—I did not see what he did with the light.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Feathers—about 6 o'clock I heard the sound and went and saw the cask on fire—this hole was not in it before; it is not a hole which I should expect to find in a rum puncheon; it is not an ordinary bunghole—three men ran out of the house, and I believe the prisoner is one of them—one day, when he was drunk, I would not serve him, and he said that he would do for me and burn the house down—I had not spoken to him on this day, but I saw him there—his words were that he would set the house on fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I took the prisoner in the Feathers public-house on 3rd November, shortly after 6 p.m.—I said that I should take him in custody for wilfully setting fire to a rum puncheon—he said "All right, I will go quietly"—on the way to the station he said "I know all about it"—he told the inspector that he put the light though the hole into the inspector that he put the light though cask.</p>

I believe he said that it was an ordinary pipe light, a sort of splint—he used the expression "pipe light," I am sure—he did not use the word "match"—if I have said "He said to the inspector 'I put the match in the hole at the top of the cask,'" I cannot swear that that is correct; he said that he got a light from the jet with an ordinary pipe light, but he did not use those words—he said that he got the light from the little jet—I told the Magistrate he said "I put the match through the hole in the cask," that was after lighting his pipe<lb></lb>he told the inspector that he got the light from the jet and placed it through the hole in the cask.</p>

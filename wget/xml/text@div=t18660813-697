I am the wife of William Lawson, and live at 16, Little Albany Street, Regent's Park—I keep a lodginghouse—about the beginning of June the prisoner came there with two children—she said she was a married woman—there was a man with her for the first week, a German—she said he was her husband, but I never saw him after the second week—she lodged at my house for seven weeks, in the front kitchen—she was drunk and disorderly while she lived in my house, and neglected her infant very much—it was a month old when she came—the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and a physician—I am medical officer to the Strand Union—on the morning of 18th July, about nine o'clock, I found the prisoner and her two children in the casual ward—my assistant had seen her at half-past eleven the pre<lb></lb>vious night—I looked at the child, it appeared about three months old—I examined the prisoner, and came to the conclusion that she was a woman of dissipated habits—the child was in a debilitated condition, emaciated, and very dirty—one eye was gone, and nearly the whole of the globe of the other had sloughed away—it was somewhat glued together by an old discharge that had not been washed away—I did not examine its body at that time—the prisoner said she was a married woman, and lived in Rath<lb></lb>bone Place, and I allowed her to go out with her child that morning—I saw the child on the following morning, Thursday—I heard that the prisoner had again come in drunk—I then decided to take the child away from her, as I thought she was an improper person to have the cus<lb></lb>tody of it—I attended the child from that day, the 19th, to the time of its death, the 24th—I gave it into the hands of a responsible person, who was the nurse of children in the position in which this child was, and I relied on her and the matron to see it properly attended to—I saw it eat on one or two occasions—it ate freely and in the readiest manner, from a spoon, like an old woman—that is very unusual with children of that age—it indicates that they have been subject to considerable privation—I made <hi rend="italic">a post-mortem</hi> examination about thirty-six hours after death—I found no bruises—there were two unhealthy boils in the front of each leg—it was blind with both eyes, the result of gonorrheal opthalmia, either contracted at the moment of birth, or given to the child subsequent to birth, that I could not be certain of—the child weighed four pounds fifteen ounces, and measured twenty-one inches long—twelve pounds would be</p>

               <p>about the average weight of a child of that age—I examined the brain—it was healthy, a little firmer than I had usually seen—I attributed that to some slow form of inflammatory action, which had condensed its structure—the heart and liver were healthy, also the stomach and intestines—the lungs were healthy, with an exception of a slight bronchitis in the upper lobe, but far too slight to produce any deleterious consequences—there was extreme pallor of the body, and a total absence of fat everywhere—there was slight disease of the mesenteric glands, but not that amount that I have seen in other cases—I have made <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations of a great many children who have died of mesenteric disease pure and simple—it is an enlargement of the glands of the mesentery, brought on by irritating or improper food where children are brought up by hand or exposed to damaging influences in the way of foul air, or any vitiating condition—gin and beer would of course provoke such a disease—there was a total pallor of the whole body—I do not know that I ever saw a case of a child so pefectly and entirely neglected—I attributed it entirely to neglect, and I formed that opinion at the time without having any previous history to guide me—I did not mark any appearance about the heels—I did not notice anything particular about the lower part of the stomach—the child had been in the house a week at that time, and had been carefully looked after and attended to by the nurse—I came to the conclusion that the death was provoked by neglect—there was a continuous neglect extending over a considerable time—it had not a fair chance of life—that neglect consisted in the deprivation of food, and a continuous administration of improper food—the nurse told me in the prisoner's presence that the child was in a dreadful state of neglect at the time it was brought in, and that it took its food in the most ravenous manner, that it was pitiable to see it, and the same thing was repeated to me on the second morning—the prisoner made no observation to me, or in my hearing—it was in consequence of the representations made to me in her presence that on my mere notion I was disposed to give her into the custody of the police, with a view to her being punished.</p>

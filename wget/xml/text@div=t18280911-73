               <p>Q. Did you not say you did not know whether it was October last or the October before? A. I cannot swear about it - I do not know about it - I will not swear I did not say that; I said it was before Christmas, the latter end of the year - I never could have told the Magistrate I thought it was after Christmas - I told him it was before.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not tell the Magistrate you thought it was after Christmas? A. No, I will not - it was mildish weather; I told him it was not cold weather, it was calm.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to state that you had seen it before it was sold to you? A. Never; but I have seen it every week since, as I am in the habit of going there every week on business; that is not what makes me speak to it; I picked it out the next morning from among others in his shed; I cannot help seeing it when I go, as I go into his shed; I had seen the prisoner's face before, but not to know him; I cannot say where, but suppose it must he about the market - he was not taken for nine months after; I said at Hatton-garden that I was certain of him; I said he was the man directly I saw him in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said before the Magistrate that you believed he was the man? A. Not to my knowledge; I said directly I saw him, "That is the man I bought the cow of." I am positive I said nothing about only believing it.</p>

I had been looking for him for three months, not before; I was told of this six or seven months ago, and was desired to look for him, and did, but could not find him; I do not know how long he has lived there; I was at Hatton-garden - Lucas was there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You first went to look for him three months ago? A. More than that - it may be five months; I went to look for him immediately after I was told to do so - other people were looking for him before that; I went about five months before with one of them, but they had been before that: I went to the house about nine o'clock, it was getting dark, it was on the 26th of July; I do not know when the first time was - it was about three months ago that he escaped - I saw him going through the passage; I had seen him about before; I believe he has no family.</p>

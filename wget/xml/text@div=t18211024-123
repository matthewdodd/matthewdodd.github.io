            . I am patrol of St. Giles's. On the 21st of September, about eleven o'clock at night, I saw a man about ten yards before me in Cross-lane, Drury-lane, about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's house - he was carrying something on his head; I saw the prisoner a little further on, he came out of Charles-street also, with something on his head, I think they were in company, they both came the same road, in a direction from Findow's - I made towards the prisoner, he turned round on seeing me, and went into the passage of a house in Cross-lane, the door of which was open - he ran with the bundle, I sprang my rattle, and the watchmen came to my assistance - I heard a noise on the staircase, went up, and found the prisoner on the second floor; I asked what he had on his head, he said "Nothing," and that he lived there - some people in the house came out and said, in his presence, they never knew him, I gave him to the watchman - I then went into the yard of the house, and I found he had escaped, he was secured in five minutes - I immediately went back to the yard and found this piece of lead, I know he had lead on his head when I saw him, and this appeared the same sort - I took him before the Magistrate on Monday, and found the prosecutor out on Wednesday, and fitted the lead to his portico; it corresponded exactly every way, and fitted the nail-holes.</p>

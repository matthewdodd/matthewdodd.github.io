            , junior, sworn. I am with my father; he is a <rs id="t18060219-24-viclabel125" type="occupation">hardwareman</rs>

On Wednesday the 5th of February, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in the back part of our shop, I was alarmed by the violent breaking of a pane of glass; I immediately run out into the street, I found that one of our panes was broke, and I missed the article mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it. - A. A plated milk pot. As I was standing there to prevent any thing else from being taken away, a gentleman who is here, brought the prisoner back with the milk pot in this here (producing it) glove; it is a double glove, and seems very well adapted for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. He was brought into your shop. - A. Yes; it was not a cold day; it is not likely that a boy like him would wear a glove like that; I found the glove on the counter after the constable had taken him away.</p>
               <p>Q. It is two woollen gloves put together, one within the other. - A. Yes; I knew the milk pot to be our property, it has our private mark upon it.</p>
               <p>- BYNG sworn. I was going by Mr. Benyon's window on the opposite side; I heard the glass break; I turned round my head to the window, and saw the boy run off; he ran from Fenchurch-street; I pursued him for curiosity, I did not know what he had taken out of the window; I got hold of him shortly after, and when I laid hold of him he dropped the cream jug from under his coat or out of his hand, I am not sure which; I collared him and took him back, I held him with one hand and the milk pot with the other, and took him into Mr. Benyon's shop; I asked Mr. Benyon if he knew the milk pot to be his; he said he did. He took him into the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When he catched hold of me, he says, where is that milk pot; there was a mob came round me, and the milk pot was chucked on the ground, and the gentleman picked it up directly.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190029"></xptr>I am not guilty of the crime, you may depend upon it: I do not know any thing of it at all; I never did such a crime in my life; I hope you will give me hardly any punishment.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable, I produce the milk pot. I was standing about there; I saw two or three people about the window; while I was asking them what was the matter the boy was brought back, and Mr. Benyon gave me charge of him.</p>

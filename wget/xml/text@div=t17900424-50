               <p>What becomes usually of these old stones? - They are taken to the mason's yard.</p>
               <p>What might be the value of that stone? - About one shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Davis. Did that stone belong to them? - It did belong to them; I saw them take it off the ground, and put it on the boy's knot.</p>
               <p>Were there any stones there to your knowledge, that were not taken from the pavement? - None had any business there.</p>

               <p>These stones are found at the expence of that commission? - They provide the new ones, and have the old ones.</p>
               <p>Court. They are not provided by the city of London, but by the commissioners under the act of parliament? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there is an end of it.</p>

               <p>Davis, junior, called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Davis, senior, called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Burnell, junior. Was it a loose stone? - I saw Harrison take the hammer, and knock it up, and put it upon the boy's knot.</p>
               <p>At the time he took it, was it fixed as part of the pavement? - It must be, certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. This case does not come within the statute; the stone was part of the freehold.</p>

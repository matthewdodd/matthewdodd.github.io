                  </hi>. I live in Windmill-street, Finsbury, and am a grocer. On the 18th of February I went to my shop door, about six o'clock in the evening—I missed four bars of soap—they had been four feet within the door, on a cask—I had seen them safe just before—on the Friday following I heard of the prisoner being in custody, and received information from Archer.</p>

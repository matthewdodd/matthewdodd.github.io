                  </hi>. I am an invalid soldier, returned from India. The prisoner came home in the same ship—he slept by himself, in a room where all our boxes were, at a lodging-house—I had a watch-guard, with a silver cross to it—I took it off on Monday night, the 25th of July, and put it into my box, which I locked, but the staple was not down into the Jock—the next morning I observed my chest—I then locked it—I returned in the evening, and my chest was apparently as I had left it—I missed my chain on the Saturday following—this is my chain—I have not seen the crucifix since.</p>

                  </hi>. My wife is too ill to be here—the prosecutor called me into the room on Saturday morning, where the prisoner was lying on the bed, and asked me whether I had seen his watch-guard—I then asked my wife if the prosecutor had given it her—she said he had not, but she had got a guard and watch which the prisoner had given her, and told her not to let any one see it—I then asked the prosecutor if he would know the chain—he said, "Yes"—my wife then got it, and showed it him—he said it was his—the prisoner denied it, and said it was his own—after that, he agreed to give the prosecutor up his chain, and say no more about it; and then he agreed to give him the watch and chain, and counted out 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to give him for the crucifix—I would not allow him to do it—he said he had not seen the crucifix, and offered to pay him rather than have a piece of work.</p>

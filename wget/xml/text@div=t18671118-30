                  </hi>. I am assistant to John Augustus Nicolay, a furrier, of 82, Oxford Street—in September, 1865, this letter was handed to me; I read it in a hurry, and selected four or five sealskin cloaks, which I took to 17, St. Petersburg Place, Bayswater—some one, who appeared to be a servant, received the goods from me; she had rather a sallow complexion, dark hair, and a cast in one of her eyes—she took the goods into another room, and in a short time brought back four of them, keeping a circular cloak, value eighteen guineas.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Bedford Place, Rotherhithe—I first knew the prisoner at Binfield Place, Clapham, as Mrs. Somerset, and as Mrs. Morris at the same time—I knew Louisa Frost and Miss Bristowe, who lived with her as servants—Mrs. Frost had one of her eyes fixed, she was lady's maid to the prisoner, and lived with her—she was tall, and her complexion was dark—she lived with the prisoner from December, 1864, to June or July, 1865—I have seen the prisoner write; this letter is her writing, to the best of my belief.</p>

Q.</hi> Have you seen her write frequently? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not remember seeing the girl with the fixed eye write, but I know her writing, and will undertake to say that the letter is not hers—I have not said at Marlborough Street that their writing was so much alike that I could not swear which was which—I said so of one letter which was shown to me—I said that I was unable to swear whether it was written by the prisoner or by the girl with the fixed eye—there is perhaps a similarity between the two—I believe this letter to be the prisoner's—if it purported to come from a house where Frost was, and Frost only, and the prisoner had not been mixed up with it in any way, and I was asked, "Is that not the writing of Frost?" I should not answer in the affirmative—I will swear that I do not believe it is Frost's—I have known the prisoner as Mrs. Somerset since December, 1864—I have heard of her for a great</p>

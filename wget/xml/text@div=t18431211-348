I have the care of his premises—there was a wire pheasantry fixed at the back of the stable—I saw it safe on the 12th of Nov.—on the 13th I found part of it gone—the other part was taken on the 25th—I believe this to be part of the wire-work.</p>

The prisoners came to me on Saturday night, and asked me if I knew where they could get a pen and Ink, and paper, they wanted to write a note, for they had been to Chappell's with a piece of wire, the hen-house that was, and he would not buy it without a note from their father—they wanted to write a note to save them the trouble of going across the fields—I wrote this note—they told me what to write—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Sir,—Please to buy the wire of my two sons, as I am engaged, and you will oblige W.

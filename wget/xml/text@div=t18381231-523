I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday the 22nd of December—he said something to me—I did not threaten or persuade him—I am sure of that—on our way to the station-house he seemed inclined to communi<lb></lb>cate something—I cautioned him—I said, "Be on your guard, I am an officer, what you communicate to me, I shall certainly give as evidence against you"—he said, "At the banking-house, the clerk was attending to some person alongside of me, and the thought came over me, that I would appropriate the money to my own use, and I threw the strip of paper I received from Mr. Powell into the fire"—I am sure he said that after the caution I gave him.</p>

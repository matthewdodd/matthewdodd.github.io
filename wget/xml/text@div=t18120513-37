               <p>Q. Then you had not the sole use of the room - A. No. I left the room for two nights.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the day you left the room - A. I believe, about the 18th, on Friday morning. I was absent part of two days.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a box there - A. Yes. On Sunday morning I returned to dress, and then all was safe. I locked my box then. I left the room again on the Sunday, and left my clothes in the room with the key of my box in my breeches pocket, and when I returned on the Monday morning Mrs. Neal told me that I had been robbed. I went up stairs and found my box open; it was unlocked by the key, and on looking into my box I missed all the articles contained in the indictment. I had left them all safe on the Sunday. I saw my property at the Mansion House on the 20th of April, the same day. The prisoner was in custody then.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Dixon - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the last man that has been examined a lodger of yours - A. Yes, he had lodged with me about five months. Dixon came to lodge with me on the Friday night before the robbery was commited on the Monday; he slept in the same bed as Morris did. No other person slept in the room from the Friday to the Monday. On Sunday night the prisoner came in and went to bed; he slept there till half past six on the Monday morning.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mrs. Neal. You say he got up about half past six - A. Yes; I heard the prisoner come down stairs; being a fresh lodger I got up and let him out. I saw him take a bundle from the stair-case.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring any bundle with him when he came to lodge - A. None at all. I asked him what he had got tied up. I was fearful, otherwise I might have taken him myself. I ran after him to the top of the court. I pulled the things from him and gave an alarm. He was stopped by

            . I keep the house, No. 1, in that court. On the 20th of April, in the morning, I was alarmed by Mrs. Neal saying, you have got my sheets and pillows. I stopped the prisoner; he said he had no property belonging to Mrs. Neal. He dropped the bundle and got away from me, and made a run down the alley, and up Peter-street. I lost sight of him until I got to Peter-street. I am sure he is the same man. I never saw him before that morning. I took part of the property from him in Dunning's-alley; the book, the scales and weights, and the razor, out of his pocket. I have kept the bundle ever since. The things afterwards were claimed by Morris. This is the prisoner's coat that the things were put in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They offered to compound with me; I was destitute of money and friends; I had nothing to give them, and if I would give them five shillings a piece, I might go about my business. I hope your lordships will mitigate my punishment as much as you can.</p>

I was ordered out at five o'clock upon business, to wait upon a gentleman; it was not then quite dark. The front door opens into a passage, and I secured it upon the latch when I went out. I came back at about twenty minutes past six; I had left different pieces of cloth on the counter, and those pieces which I have lost, were on a shelf by the door. When I came back, I missed three pieces of cloth. I have never seen any of the three pieces, but the one I saw at Bow-street. I met the prisoner Rawley; he passed close on the flags, and I called out stop thief,and took him in Great Guilford-street. When I came back to my shop, I found three pieces of cloth missing.</p>
               <p>GEORGE VAUGHAN. I belong to Bow-street. I was on duty on the 15th of December, I saw the prisoners on the 14th, at about five o'clock in the evening. I was in company with Barrett, and saw Batts and Rawlay in Gray's-inn-lane. I saw them on the 15th; I watched them until they came to Mr. Poole's house; I saw the three prisoners in company with a forth person; I was in a house opposite the prosecutor's house; I was in that house on suspicion, because we had reason for it; my attention was awakened the night before; Barrett was with me. I went to the house of Mr. Poole,and communicated something to him. I observed the three prisoners, in company with a fourth person, come up the street; they passed by Mr. Poole's door. The one that is not here, remained about five doors from Mr. Poole's; the other three came down again towards Poole's house. Farthing went to the railing, and looked over, as it he were looking into Poole's shop; as soon as he had done that; he went towards the other two prisoners, and then Batts. went into the passage of Mr. Poole's house; then he came out. Rawley then immediately went into Mr. Poole's passage, as Batts had done just before.Batts then went in twice after that. Rawley first came out. and joined in company with Farthing at the door; then they went away from the door. Then Farthing took his situation, as before, and continued to do so as if he was looking into the shop. Then Batts went in a third time. I then moved myself from the situation in which I was, and saw him lay hold of the handle of the door, which door he opened; he came out, and spoke to Rawley, who was standing at the step of the door. Batts spoke to Rawley; Rawley went into the passage; I saw him go into the shop of Mr. Poole. In about three minutes he came out, with some cloth undes his arm. He turned towards the left, towards Brutfswick-square, in company with Farthing and Batts. I saw Rawley thrown down the cloth, which I picked up. When I came across the way, I found the prosecutor had got hold of Rawley; I am sure he dropped the cloth, for he was never out of my sight. I had seen somebody running, but I did not know it was Mr. Poole. Farthing was just by Rawley at the time he was stopped. Batts and Rawley had crossed to that side of the way.</p>

               <p>BARNABUS MERRICK. On the 12th of October, the prisoner called upon me, and asked me if I would let him my trunk; I let it him for two shillings the day. In the evening he came and paid me two shillings; he said, he wanted it for the next day, might he keep it in the shed belonging to the house, as he wanted it early the next day; he said, his name was

            , he lived at No. 61, Nicoll-street, Bethnel Green. After two days the trunk did not come home. I applied at the place where he gave me directions; there was no person of that name lived there; there was a shed to the house; I looked in the shed; my truck was not there. About a fortnight after, I met the prisoner; I asked him why he had not brought my truck home; he said, he would bring it home that afternoon; by what he had under his arm, I thought he was a weaver. I have seen my truck since, at a wheelers, in the New Cut, by Lambeth.</p>

            . I am a wheeler, in the New Cut, Lambeth. About a month ago, the prisoner came to me with a truck to sell; I gave him one pound seven shillings for the truck. This is the receipt I got of him. The truck was afterwards claimed by the prosecutor.</p>

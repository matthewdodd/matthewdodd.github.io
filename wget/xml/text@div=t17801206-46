             came in and asked for a pair of silver knee buckles; I had three drawers of silver buckles out, shewing these two men. While they were looking at them, Bailey came and asked to see some steel knee buckles. While I was serving the two men with the silver buckles; the one not present, said he had rather have plated buckles; I put the drawer with the silver buckles on one side, and took out a drawer with the plated buckles. I agreed with Madan for a pair of knee buckles at 6 s. 6 d. Then I agreed with the other for a pair of silver-knee buckles; they wanted each of them change for a guinea, which must have been to prolong the time; I sent the child out for change for a guinea; and by that time the middle boy turned out of the shop; I observed he had something in his hands behind him under his coat; I said to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060042"></xptr> Cheetham where is the person gone, I will serve him; Chteeham ran after him to call him and came no more back; and by that time the two men had got their change for the guineas. When they had got the change they all of them went out; as soon as they were gone out I saw a drawer open which was at the other count er, in which the four gold chains and thirty-six gold rings were kept; I went to the drawer and missed four gold chains and thirty-six fancy rings of different devices. Upon missing them I called the pastry cook's people opposite into the shop and pursued. We have never got any of them again.</p>
               <p>When did you last see them in the drawer? - Not a minute before the prisoners came in I had the gold chains in my hand.</p>
               <p>Did you see either of the three prisoners, or the other man go to the other counter? - While I was serving the men, Cheetham stood with his hands behind him and his back to the other counter.</p>
               <p>These people did not come in all together? - No; the man not present came in first; Madan next; and the two boys directly one after another; but they did not appear to know one another, except the two boys.</p>
               <p>How long might they stay in the shop? - About six minutes; we soon agreed for what they cheapened.</p>
               <p>Did any other person come into the shop while they were there? - No other person.</p>
               <p>Does your shop open into a back room or parlour? - Yes, a parlour.</p>
               <p>Was there any person in that room? - No; nor in the house.</p>
               <p>Were was the little girl while you was serving them, and Cheetham stood with his back to the other counter? - She was then gone out for change for a guinea; Bailey came up to them to see what they were a buying I did not observe him before; then Bailey went out of the shop. They all three stood before me and Cheetham was behind them at the other counter.</p>
               <p>What was the value of the goods you lost? - Between thirty and forty pounds. Madan looked at me, I suppose to see if I observed the boy; he looked at me more than he did at the things he was buying. As soon as they went out I missed the goods; it struck me they were all connected. They all went towards Leicester-fields.</p>
               <p>For form sake I must ask you whose property these goods were? - Mr. Story's; he keeps a shop for the sale of these kind of things.</p>

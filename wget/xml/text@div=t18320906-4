Last Sunday, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners in company, and kept my eyes on them; they separated; Trevillian and Fisher went away in a direction towards Mr. Girling's house - they were about fifty yards from it when they left Robins; that was about half-past six o'clock - I did not see where they went to; I saw Robins standing at the corner of the street - I do not know the name of the street; he was in the street in which Girling lives, and was standing at the corner of another street - he was in sight of Girling's house; I cannot tell where Trevillian and Fisher went - I saw them together again about seven o'clock; all three - I afterwards stopped them; they had then got about four hundred yards further; I stopped Trevillian, the other two were stopped in my presence by two Policemen - I searched Trivillian, and found nothing on him which Girling claims; I found nothing but a silk handkerchief and a tobacco-box on him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Fisher's mother lodged with you? A. Yes; she had no key - she went out about half-past three o'clock; I went out between five and six o'clock, and left nobody in the house; I have no servant - it was on Sunday; the shop door was shut, and fastened inside - Mrs. Fisher had no servant; I believe the prisoner is her son - I did not go into her room to see if any body remained there; it was not likely - she did not have many visiters; Fisher did not live there - he was there on Sunday morning; there are two keys to the private door, one for the lock and another for the latch; I have them both - I was at the public-house opposite all the while, taking tea with Orchard, the landlord, and had told Mrs. Fisher the keys would be there if she wanted to get in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any inner door unlocked? A. The door between the staircase and shop was opened, I suppose - I had left it locked, and found it locked when I returned; nobody could get at the property without unlocking that door, unless they got in at the window which was not open - if any body had got in at it I should have seen some traces, and it could not be opened from the outside - I lost a necklace, a pair of bracelets, two half-sovereigns, and about 2l. 17s. in silver.</p>

               <p>Trevillian's Defence.

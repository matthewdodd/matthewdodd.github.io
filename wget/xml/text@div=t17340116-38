Mrs. Cox said, Pray Sir be easy, you shall have what we have, and pulling out a red Silk-purse, she gave it him; but I don't know what was in it. I know she had a Queen Elizabeth's Six-pence, which she us'd to carry in that Purse, but as the Purse was not open'd, I did not see it then - The Coach glass was half up when he came to the Door, but he bid us put it down, and I did, and then, as I said, he demanded our Watches; Mrs. Cox told him she had none; and I said I had none neither, for I was but a Servant. He answer'd, God damn you, I saw your Watches in the Morning - When he had got the Purse, he look'd both Ways and went off. I cry'd, Stop Highwayman: Mrs. Cox's Servant rid after him - A Ploughman threw his Staff at him, and he was taken soon after - I am sure this is Mrs. Cox's Purse, and this is her Queen Elizabeth's Six-pence, for I have often seen them both, and am positive the Prisoner is the Man.</p>

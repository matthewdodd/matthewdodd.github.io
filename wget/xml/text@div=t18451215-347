                  </hi>. I am a carrier. On the 24th Nov. I received some goods from the Vauxhall-station, packed up in a bundle—I did not know what the bundle contained—they were directed for Edward Gillham—that direction is lost—I took it from the rest of the parcels, and left it in the stable at Nine-elms—it was directed to Camberwell—we did not take it—we expected the lad to call for it—when I went to look for it in the stable it was gone—I asked the prisoner if he knew where the bundle was—he said he had never seen it—I told him he must have seen it—he was employed by me, and had access to the stable—I left him, and returned in half an hour—I then found he had changed his shirt—I asked what he had done with the shirt he had on—he said, "I will tell you the truth; I did have the bundle"—I asked where it was—he pointed to a box in the stable, and said it was there—I went to the box and found these things, which Mrs. Gillham hat identified.</p>

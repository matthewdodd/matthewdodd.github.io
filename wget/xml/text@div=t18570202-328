                  </hi>. I keep a school at-Belmont House, Turnham Green. It is a large house—I have kept it twenty-three years—the defen<lb></lb>dant applied to me about Michaelmas last to fill the situation of general assis<lb></lb>tant which was vacant—I had no reference with him, he appeared very plausible in his manner, and being in immediate want of a master, I was induced to let him come—he gave the name of a school bookseller, who gave my name to him; he also gave me the names of two persons whom he had lived with before, Mrs. Dawson and Mr. White—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the rules of my establishment for the assistants to conform with—I gave it to him the first day he came, and he returned it when I paid him his salary—after he had entered my service, in consequence of something which oc<lb></lb>curred, I wrote to Mrs. Dawson—this letter which I received is in his writing: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>—"Mr. Clements, Belmont House, Turnham Green. 4, Cor<lb></lb>nelia Terrace, Barnsbury Park, Jan. 4, 1857.—Sir, As you have endeavoured to injure me in not giving those gentlemen who applied to you a satisfactory testimonial as to my character, thereby taking away my means of sub-sistence, I shall, for I feel it a bounden duty to do so, inform those parents whose sons are under your care, of the gross immorality of your establish<lb></lb>ment. I ask you, Sir, how can you put forth your lying advertisement in the Times from day to day when you are aware that it is a gross deception? <hi rend="italic">Signed</hi>, Henry Belcher.") This other letter was given to me by Mr. Duncan, the parent of two young gentlemen in my establishment—it is the defen<lb></lb>dant's writing: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>—"Mr. Duncan, Norwood—4, Cornelia Terrace, Barnsbury Park, Jan. 13, 1857.—Sir, I feel it to be a duty incumbent on me to inform you that the establishment of Mr. Clements, Belmont House, is grossly immoral, and that the education of the youth placed under Mr. Clements' care is scandalously neglected. The pupils receive very little instruct<lb></lb>tion, and that by the assistants. This latter fact may not be of primary im<lb></lb>portance, but the former is, and I call upon you to consider ere you send your sons where every virtue is blasted. Signed—Hy. Belcher.") I be<lb></lb>lieve the charges contained in these letters to be utterly false—he did not complain while in my house of immoral conduct on the part of the boys,</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to state on your oath that there never was, to your knowledge, any immorality in your establish<lb></lb>ment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do, and until it is proved to me I am of the same opinion—I believe there is no immorality existing in my house—a day or two ago I acted on information I received, and discharged a female servant—I can scarcely believe that several boys, who are now here in Court, were sleeping night after night in the servants' room with the servants—until proof is adduced, I am still staggered by it—I can give no further answer—until it is proved; I am still incredulous—I have taken every possible precaution in my power for the strict morality of the pupils, and therefore I am of that opinion—I have heard several of the boys confess it this morning, and I have received information from a parent in Court—I am married, and my wife lives with me at the school, certainly; I am surprised at the question being put to me—my wife has lived at the school twenty-five years; she has always lived there except when she has been away for her health, and when she has lived with my daughter for a short time out of town—I have a house about a mile away from my daughter, and she has some-times been there—she has not left my house for twelve months together—she has never left it at all—I have a housekeeper; a different one to the one that was there during the defendant's time—Miss Nutter was housekeeper then—she is now living in the neighbourhood of London with her friends—she left because she was not equal to it—she was there to assist Mrs. Clements generally—I was always at home except on the half holidays—I was not constantly put in the evenings—I have not come home so late as 12 or 1 o'clock for the last three months—I swear that, to the best of my belief—I have only been out on the hall holidays—I have never been absent but on school, business, or matters con<lb></lb>nected with the house—I have not been away from the school constantly, leaving it to my assistant; I have occasionally—it is extremely difficult for me to tell whether I have been away three times a week; when I have been called away it has been engagements—I have frequently letters from parties in town requesting me to call—there are two half-holidays in the week—I generally have thirty pupils, or rather under; the last number was twenty-six—I am a Master of Arts—I took my degree from Leipeic—I have not it with me, but I can produce it in two hours—I got it about thirteen years ago, by sending literary productions of my own—I do not mean that they purchased my literary productions by a degree, but they required proof as to my identity—the production that I sent was a Latin theme, which had to be identified in England as my composition, by documentary evidence—it was by writing a Latin theme, and proving it, that I got it—I cannot tell you what I paid—it did not come over by post; it came in a case—I made an application for it—it was not given me from any know<lb></lb>ledge that Leipsic had of me—my degree is M. A., and Ph. D.—I paid the usual fees for both of those—I do not know how many M. A.'s of that sort there are in the world—I was frequently called away from home by letters—I have letters at night requesting me to go to town next day; and I have letters to answer, and things to order, and bills to pay; but I am always in the school directing the teachers, and seeing that they carry out their instructions—I have two teachers: a Frenchman and an Englishman—the defendant was the Englishman—the Latin and Greek chiefly came to</p>

               <p>me; all the head classes came to me—I have heard of two boys who used to sleep in this woman's room—those were not some boys whom I have now—a boy named Bryerly was subpœnaed here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say that you would not bring him to-day because you had not received a shilling with the subpœna? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I brought him yesterday; I did not bring him to-day because I did not expect the case would come on, as there was a consultation between me and my Counsel—the defendant offered me an apology at the police-court; I did not ask him what he was to state—whether I have been perfectly willing to receive the apology, if I got a retractation of the charges, is a question which I cannot answer—I do not know that he has refused to state that what he said was a lie; because it was the whole truth—my impression is that he declined to make the apology—Mr. Duncan is here—there is another boy, who is in the same predicament as Bryerly, whom I have refused to bring to<lb></lb>day—I have not heard this from the two boys themselves that I have kept back, that they have frequently been in the habit of sleeping with the servants—I have not pressed them on the subject, and have not heard so from them—they have not stated so to me—this morning is not the first time I have heard anything from the boys on the subject; I called on a gentleman last night who informed me—I did not see either of the boys last night—that was the first specific information I received—I mean to say that I never heard of the boys sleeping in the servant's room till last night—the defendant has never told me that he saw the boys coming out of the girls' room—Watts is one of the boys—the defendant has never called my attention to the peculiar appearance of Watts, and told me that the habits he was pursuing were injuring his health; if he had I should have dismissed the boy—I should not have kept the maid; they would both have been expelled instantly—he has called my attention to Watts's appearance, that was at the latter end of the quarter, immediately after he had had a quarrel with Watts; he said that he suspected, from the appearance of his eyes, that he was in the habit of self abuse; he did not suggest that it was from connection with the woman—the boy is between seventeen and eighteen years old; I called him into the parlour and had a conversation with him—the prisoner was not present.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. T. ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe the prisoner had the control of the bed-chambers of the boys; what was his duty with regard to them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Here are the rules: "At 8 o'clock, to call the list, read prayers, attend the pupils to bed, enforcing absolute silence and order in all things"—after the boys had said their prayers up stairs and were in bed, it was his duty to lock the doors—there are bolts on each door, and his room is close to their's, so that if they require anything in the night, he would know it; if they got out of the room without his knowledge he must have grossly neglected his duty—I have reproved him before the scholars for striking them, and using improper language—the first time my attention was directed to this parti<lb></lb>culr fact about these two boys, was yesterday, by a gentleman now in Court, whose son was in the school—I wrote to his friends requesting them to withdraw him from the school at the end of the quarter, but, generally speaking, he has been a very good boy—I think I ought not to mention names—it was the son of that gentleman (<hi rend="italic">pointing to him</hi>)—there was no angry feeling towards the boy in the least—these other rules (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were hung up in the school room—(<hi rend="italic">These related to the conduct of the pupils in school.</hi>) <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN DUNCAN</hi>.

               <p>Belcher, and in a conversation which I had with him, I came to the conclu<lb></lb>sion that I should not send the boys back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you satisfied before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not generally satisfied on the point of education; I had one or two points to complain of; but on the score of morality I knew nothing—I cannot say that I thought their education neglected, but there was a want of practical application of theore<lb></lb>tical rules; they could go through a simple or long division sum, but they could not adapt it when I came to examine them—that would not have prevented my sending them back, because if I had called attention to it, it would have been remedied.</p>

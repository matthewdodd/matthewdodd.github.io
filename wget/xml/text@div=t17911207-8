I received my wages about two, and went first to the Salutation. I had eighteen guineas and a half in gold, three pocket pieces I bought in London resembling half guineas, and about thirteen shillings in money, the money was in a tin box. We were drinking together at the Salutation; I went down the town, and got some victuals, and saw the prisoner at the Running Horse, and asked him to drink a glass; I sat there some time; the prisoner was in company, and he took hold of me by the shoulder, and said, Come, shipmate, go with me, I will provide you a good lodging; I did not look at first; he made a stop at once. I asked him where he was going; he took me up a very narrow passage, gave me a sudden jerk all of a sudden on the shoulder, and took my tin box and money out of my pocket. He went away all at once. I went to the next house, and told them, and that he had only left me one copper. They searched my pockets, and sent for a constable. I staid there all night; it was a lodging-house; none of the people are here. The next morning I went to the Running Horses, and told the landlord, and seized the prisoner, who stood by the fire. He took out half a guinea for change; he swore many heavy oaths, and pulled out two more; they were my property: I gave a penny a piece for them; they were half-guinea pieces resembling half-guineas; one of them was found in the ashes. I understood the tin box was picked up by a schoolboy, who is here.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070008"></xptr>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Was the Salutation the first house you drank at? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had you been there? - Near an hour.</p>
               <p>What liquor did you drink? - Part of two pints of beer between me and two more.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay at the Running Horses? - The space of an hour.</p>
               <p>You drank there too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect fighting any body in the street after you went out of the Running Horses? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you so sober as to recollect all that happened to you? - Yes; I was not paid off when the ship was paid.</p>
               <p>Had you been at the Bull public-house that night? - At the Bull, Sir.</p>
               <p>Aye, recollect yourself; and recollect, there is less offence in a sailor's getting drunk after a long voyage than in swearing against a man? - I was in the Bull.</p>
               <p>And there you invited a young woman to pass the night with you? - I was in no woman's company any further than this, I saw a woman in a black gown; she asked me what countryman I was; I told her, I was of the West of England, and I asked her for a cook's shop; I went into the cook's shop, and asked her to sit down; she did not come in then, she returned again in five minutes; she came up through the street with me again; I went along with her to the Salutation, then the landlord asked her what she did there.</p>
               <p>She was a common woman? - I never saw her before; he asked her what she did there? she said, she came to drink a glass of something with me. He said, he would as soon see her backside as see her face; and I never saw the woman afterwards.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that after that you was not at the Bull with this young woman? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Why, you was not so ungallant surely as an English sailor to let her go out of the house by herself? - I never saw her afterwards; I was at the Bull before I went to the eating-house.</p>
               <p>What became of you after you had lost this woman, that would not have been a pleasant circumstance, you know? I went back again to the Running Horses after that.</p>
               <p>How long did you continue drinking there? You drank at the Salutation, then you got to the Running Horses, then to the eating-house, then to the Salutation again, and then to the Running Horses again; at all of which you took a little drop of a nip? - I staid at the Running Horses about half an hour after eight, and had two pints of slip; I did not drink it all myself; there was four or five of us.</p>
               <p>How far off did you pass your night from these running horses? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect fighting with any body? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>No man in a sailor's dress? - No.</p>
               <p>Now, after all this drinking, do you really think you was any thing like sober? - I was sober and sensible to know what I said and did.</p>

               <p>I keep the Running Horses at Brentford. I remember the prosecutor coming in; it was between eight and nine when he came in; he was not more than an hour; the prisoner was there some of the time. Bryant paid for three pints of liquor, that was all he had; they went out together. I saw a tin box in the prosecutor's hand, but what he had in it I cannot tell; nobody else went out with the prosecutor. He came in next morning, and the prisoner was there; he said, he had lost his money. I cannot tell what passed; but soon after the prisoner went out, and brought a piece of money to pay for what he had. The prosecutor did not stop him then. The prisoner's master is a pipe-maker. He produced me half a guinea to take my reckoning; I told him it was a counterfeit; he desired I would weigh it, and it was so; the prisoner said, it was his money. The sailor charged him in custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you observe whether he was a little in liquor? - I did not observe; they went out to get a lodging.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070009"></xptr>How long has the prisoner lived in your neighbourhood? - About six months; he frequented our house, and came there that morning, as he had been accustomed to do; he went out, and came in again some time after with this piece of money.</p>
               <p>He might have put it all into the pipe-furnace if he had been conscious of any thing of the sort?</p>
               <p>Court. Could the sailor have had a lodging in your house? - Sometimes we do let a lodging; my husband offered him half a bed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. The prisoner applied to you for one of these very half-guineas? - Yes; he came to me for one of the half-guineas to go back and treat Bryan at that very publick house. He has worked for me about seven months; I never saw any dishonesty by him; he bore the character of an honest man; I never missed or found any thing lost.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Violet. This man had worked next door to you for some months, what character did he bear? - I have nothing to say against him; I never heard any thing to the contrary of an honest man.</p>
               <p>Did Clamtree come in there? - Yes, some time after Bryan and the prisoner had left our house; they went out very good friends; he was to shew him a lodging. I saw him afterwards give Clamtree two of the small pieces; I did not see him give the other two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Clamtree. He gave you this money in the open tap-room, without any secret? - Yes.</p>

I paid for the first pint; I told him not to call for any more; I had no more money; he said, it did not matter, he had plenty of money, and he said, he had saved up 3 l. for the Christmas holidays, which he had in a pipe-clay box; and soon after that, I think it might be in the space of a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, in came the prosecutor, and declared he had been robbed of all his property, which was 18 guineas and a half, and some odd money; what, I cannot justly say; and that the prisoner was the man that robbed him, and he would have a constable. Soon after that the prisoner beckoned me into the back parlour, and I went, and he put his hand into the sob of his trowsers, and pulled out a guinea, and two half guineas, as they appeared to me, but whether they were half guineas or counterfeits I could not tell; he offered me the two half guineas, as they appeared, to take them and keep them, and say nothing about it; I did not take them; I went and told my master, who was in the publick house, and the landlord; and before they could get a constable they were demolished some how or other; they could could not be found. My master's name is Callaghan. He was searched by Mr. Cox, the constable.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I produce a tin box.</p>
               <p>Green. This is the tin box I found.</p>
               <p>Cox. Here is a certificate in it; I searched the prisoner, and found one guinea in his hand. (Produced.) This pocket-piece was on the table in the tap-room; the prosecutor told me to take it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Violet. I did not take notice of it, but the prisoner offered me such a one as this that morning.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my box, and my certificate and card. This medal is my property, part of what I lost that evening; here is a particular scratch upon the head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutor. How many of these medals did you buy? - Three, there was never another in his shop; there is a scratch on the King's head side.</p>
               <p>Do you mean a long one all down the crown? - It is not so very long.</p>
               <p>Does it reach from the top to the bottom? - Almost.</p>
               <p>And that is on the head side? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That you are quite sure of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So much for certainty; now it happens to be on the other side. When you speak of the head, you do not mean the tail? - No.</p>
               <p>(Shews him a guinea) Which is the head side of that? - (He points to the head side, and persists in the scratch being on the head side.) I saw him chuck this medal on the floor.</p>

            . That which you call the medal resembles the half-guinea? - Yes? I found it on the table in the taproom when I went in.</p>
               <p>Court to Bryant. When you went out of the publick house in company with the prisoner, you say you went to get a lodging, and in a narrow place, a sort of alley, he gave you a jerk, and put his hand in your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070011"></xptr>pocket, and took your property from you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any other force made use of? - He took me by the shoulder.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am sorry to trouble the Court. but they took one guinea, a sixpence, and a penny; the guinea I worked hard for I think I have a right to have: my defence is as this; I gave my master one guinea, and three pocket-pieces, a quarter before nine; I went out of this house with the prosecutor; the prosecutor had all his money at nine o'clock; the guinea and the three pocket-pieces I gave to my master before I went out with the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Court to Clamtree. What time was it? - It was near a quarter before nine that I received them of him at the Running Horses tap-room; I never saw the prosecutor till the next day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor was gone backwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner afterwards leave the Running Horses? - He went home after us, I understand; the prosecutor was not in his company then.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a very good character.)</p>

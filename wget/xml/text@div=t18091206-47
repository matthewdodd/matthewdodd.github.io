               <p>Q. He sailed to the Baltic. - A. Yes Sir, the very same evening that I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left you, what money and effects did he leave with you. - A. I am no scholar, I can neither read nor write; he gave me this money after the money, being paid to him out of the Commissioners' yacht.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he count the money out to you. - A. Yes, he counted out two hundred pounds to me, and for me to go home to Ireland to my children; he gave me a number of Bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he told you that they were two hundred pounds. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And bid you go home to Ireland to your children. - A. Yes; I came from Deal to Dover; I had three twenty pound notes, and four ten pound notes, and whether I had five or six five pound notes I cannot say, and six guineas and a half in gold, and a great many articles of my own wearing apparel, a black silk gown and petticoat; it stood me in very near six pounds. I had a green plaid silk gown, one of my husband's messmates made me a present of it. I sailed with my husband three years, I believe it was worth about three pounds. I had three dark cotton gowns, one cost me three and six-pence a yard, one gown cost me making and all thirty shillings. The three gowns, I can put them fairly at three pounds. I had four light gowns, they were worth four pounds. I had a dozen shifts, each of them worth six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. That is three pound twelve. You had several other articles. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These things you put up in a bundle. - A. Yes, all were together, and my notes.</p>
               <p>Q. And six guineas and a half in gold. - A. No; five guineas and a half in gold: I changed a guinea in Deal.</p>
               <p>Q. You came up to London. - A. I came to Charing Cross on a Saturday night; on Sunday morning I was to go upon the Liverpool coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does that set off from. - A. From Charing Cross, and at Liverpool; I was to go on board a ship to Dublin.</p>
               <p>Q. You slept at Charing Cross that night. - A. Yes, the waiter is here.</p>
               <p>Q. You slept in the house, and you took your bundle with you. - A. Yes, I did, and the umbrella. The waiter called me at four o'clock in the morning. They told me that the Liverpool coach was to go off at four o'clock. I got up, I was very cold, the gentleman of the house was not up, but the waiter; I took my bundle in my arms, and the umbrella. I went to a public house just by the turn of the gateway, to get a pint of warm beer, and some gin in it. It was just by the turn of the gate at Charing-Cross, I still had my bundle with me. The ostler came out, and told me the coach was going immediately; I followed him out; I met with this Dailey and another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, is that the man. - A. Yes, Sir, that is the man; I met him and another man just at the gateway. Dailey asked me, was I the young woman that was going upon that coach. I said yes, so they told me to go that way, it was better for me to come on and walk on the pavement, than to ride upon the top of the coach on the stones. They were going with me; they said, the coach had three places to stop at before it set off, and we had better walk to the last place, and they would go with me. I thought they were for my good, and they were wheedling me away, they took me up streets; I did not know where I was; I kept my bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought they were your friends, then they took you to a place where you did not know. - A. Yes, I do not know any place in London. They brought me to a public house in Drury Lane. They went in and had some gin; I stood outside of the door, and had a pennyworth of milk of a milk woman that was there walking along; she just stopped at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Now where was your bundle during this time. - A. I had it in my own possession, upon my arms. They came out, and brought me away to <placeName id="t18091206-47-crimeloc283">the Cock public-house in Dyot-street</placeName>

This young man that was with Dailey told me it was his brother that kept that house, he said his sister lived a little way off, they would bring me where I could have some tea. Then they began to curse and swear about spilling a glass of gin at the Cock in Dyot-street. I considered, and looked into myself, and thought I should not go out with them any more; then I called for a pint of beer and a glass of rum, to pay them for their trouble as I thought. I laid down my bundle on the counter; while I was putting my hand into my pocket to get the money to pay for this pint of beer, and glass of rum, I turned round and missed my bundle off the counter where I put it; says Dailey, is that your bundle gone out?</p>
               <p>Q. That was before you spoke. - A. Yes. Then Dailey said, is this your bundle that is run away with; I screamed out, and said, Lord have mercy, I am robbed; I did not know what I should make of myself, and I being in a strange place, as they had robbed me of all, I thought I might as well die.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, do not distress yourself, what did Dailey say. - A. He said, stop there for the course of an hour and I will bring you back the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Dailey go. - A. Yes, and he never came back, I stopped there an hour, very nigh, and never saw him any more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I heard her telling of lies. Did not I come back at last. - A. No, you never came back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When this bundle was gone, that woman and man were in at the Cock; I went in, and that woman and the man with her went in along with her; he was standing in the bar with the bundle in his hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. to Prosecutrix. Had the other man your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060029"></xptr>bundle in his hand while you were there. - A. No one had the bundle, I had it in my own possession until I laid it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the prisoner at the bar is the man that came to you at Charing-cross - A. Yes, he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. And carried you on this way. - A. Yes, I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. All along I had never been with you, any more than I have been with this house. Did not you come in the Black Dog - A. No; I never put my foot inside the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you pay a shilling; that man pulled out half a crown, you told him to put it up, and paid the shilling yourself - A. No; that is not true.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did come back to the Cock.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. You did not come back.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 19th of November last, do you remember seeing the prosecutrix there - A. Yes; a strange man, whom I did not know, and she came in together.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she seem in distress - A. Very much so; I said to them, that the strange man had not been gone out above five minutes, they had better go after him. The prisoner, another man, and Mrs. Wilcox, went out; the other man is here;

            . I was at the Cock taking a glass of gin, I was unwell that morning. I saw this young woman come in and a man along with her; she called for a pint of warm beer, I saw her lay the bundle on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner Dailey there - A. Yes, I did not see him come in. I do not know what time he came, he called for a quartern of gin, and put down a dollar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Dailey in the house before Mrs. Wilcox called for the warm beer - A. I cannot say, I took no notice. The other man clapped his hands under his arms, he set his back to the counter, and faced the door. Dailey turned round to him, and said, you are the man that spilled half a pint of liquor upon me a while ago. Mrs. Wilcox came up and said, my dear, do not let us have any row about it now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she speak to Dailey, or the other man - A. To Dailey: she took the beer up and offered the stranger the beer, who had his back to the counter. Dailey said, give him no more beer, he is drunk enough already. Then she offered Dailey the beer, Dailey said he would have none, he had a drop of gin just now. Then she came and offered me a drop of beer, she said she could not drink; I took a drop of beer. She heard me talking Irish to a woman; she asked me what part of Ireland I came from, and during the time that she was talking to me the bundle was gone. Dailey asked the young woman if that was her bundle that the man had taken out of the door; yes, she said, my dear, I am robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. She was in great distress - A. Yes. This young man and the woman in the house said, it was a pity that somebody did not follow them. Dailey jumped outside, he ran after them, and away he went.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it quite light at this time - A. Yes, sir; it was almost seven o'clock, the neighbours were all up. Then Mrs. Wilcox and I went out, and two or three women; we went out after him, and could not see any thing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come back to the house - A. Yes, when I took the knife out of her hand she came back: she drawed the knife in Broad-street; I took the knife out of her hand, and took her to the Cock, and then Dailey was standing just facing the Cock door, in the street. I and Mrs. Wilcox, and Mrs. Stracey, asked him if he had seen any thing of the man, he said, no. Then Mrs. Wilcox began to tear her head, and get mad-like; and Dailey said, as far as I could understand him, if the man has any honesty in him he may come back in the course of an hour. Then I took her into the Cock to get rid of her: then she demanded the knife of me that I took away from her; I gave her the knife, and she offered to stick herself again with it; she opened her breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Dailey was not in the house then - A. Not as I know. Then I took the knife away, and

               <p>Q. After you saw Dailey at the Cock door, did you ever see him again - A. Never since, until I saw him confined. I staid about five minutes at the Cock, and then Mrs. Wilcox came out with me; we stood in the street, and the crowd were about the house. I took her to my own place, she staid with me all night, and the next night I persuaded my brother to shew her the justices, for I am a poor labouring man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make enquiries at the public-houses after Dailey - A. No; he said he did not see the man. We never enquired after Dailey; my brother-in-law enquired at the public-house after the other man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I met you at the Cock door, then we went into the Cock - A. No, I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. I held one hand, and you the other - A. No; you were not in the room as I know of.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060030"></xptr>MARTHA BROWN. Q. What have you to say upon this business - A. I have only to say, that there were four or five watchmen called at the Black Dog, Drury-lane, on the 19th of November; they called in for three half pints of gin, it was between six and seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a woman with them - A. No, I saw no woman with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, do you recollect him - A. Yes; to the best of my knowledge he was one that was with them; they called for three half pints of gin separate, and they only paid for two. I think the prisoner was one of them; I took more notice of the prisoner than of the others, because he insisted upon it the third half pint was paid for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I paid you for one half pint; you got paid for the gin.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brown. I do not say you did not pay for half a pint; there was only two paid for.</p>

            . I live at the Golden Cross, Charing-cross. I recollect of her sleeping there on the Saturday night, and my calling of her in the morning; she had a bundle with her and an umbrella. I shewed her down stairs, and shewed her into the coach-office, and then left her, and saw nothing more of her.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not go by the coach that morning - A. So I understood.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM JAMES. I am horsekeeper at the Golden Cross, Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember this young woman being at your house that morning - A. Yes; she was going by the Liverpool coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way does the Liverpool coach get out of town - A. It goes up Tottenham-court-road to go over Highgate. I went to the public-house close by to call her to go by the coach; I just put my head into the house, I had no time to stop, I was helping to put the horses to. I holloed out, is there any body for Liverpool, she jumped up, answered yes; then I said you must make haste, the coach was ready and going directly. I returned back to the coach, expecting that she was following of me. I went back to the house again; as I could see nothing at all of her; I asked the landlord whether he had seen her, he said no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body in her company in the public house - A. Yes, there were a good many people in there, I did not notice them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, was he in the public-house - A. He was not in the public-house; I did not take particular notice of any one person there.</p>

            . I keep the Coach and Horses, St. Martin's-lane. Mrs. Wilcox, about twenty minutes before five, came in with a bundle in her arms, and an umbrella in her hand; not a soul was with her; she said she was very cold, she stood by the fire, I was making the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live near Charing-cross - A. I live close to the back-yard of the Golden Cross, she called for a pint of beer and a glass of gin, she stood by the fire and drank. I said, mistress, what coach are you going by? she said, the Liverpool; she said she had taken her place: presently after the horsekeeper came in; I said, Daff, will you call this woman, she is going to Liverpool; he said he would. About ten minutes to six he holloed out, who is for Liverpool? she said, I am; she took up her bundle and umbrella, and followed the ostler. I took no more notice of it, whether she went up or down the lane. There were other people in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, was he in your house - A. To the best of my knowledge I never saw him in my life, till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Friday the 21st of November, Mrs. Wilcox and another man, a sailor, came and said Mrs. Wilcox had been robbed by one Dailey, a watchman. I desired Mrs. Wilcox to meet me at half after nine at night, she met me about ten. I took her with me to the New Church in the Strand watch-house, I found he was on his beat, I went and took him off. Mrs. Wilcox knew the prisoner directly, and he knew her, he mentioned that he knew her very well, it was about the bundle that she wanted; he said that he could bring two or three watchmen to prove that he was at the Black dog drinking.</p>

               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. How came you to find that this man's name was Dailey - A. The man who took me home to his wife's place, Ragan, told me his name was Dailey, and that he was a watchman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Three weeks to-morrow night I had been on my duty till six o'clock. We went to the watch-house and hung up our coats, and four men and me went up to the Black Dog, Drury-lane, we went in and had half a pint of gin. This good woman came in and a man with her; the man that was with her put down half a crown, she would not let him pay, she put down a shilling. They went away, we stopped, we had more gin, every man went home, and I went out and went to the Cock, and this man and woman was there before me, and Ragan was there; he went along with this woman and the man that had the bundle in his hand; he began to spew up, he went out of the door with the bundle in his hand, and this man Ragan asked her whether that young man was her husband; she said, no. I said, does that bundle belong to you that he had? she said, yes; then we put our heads out of the door and looked after him. I went down to the bottom of Dyot-street and returned, we met one another at the Cock door. I know no more of this business than the child that is unborn.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ragan. That you were with him at the Cock is quite true. Were you with him in Drury-lane - A. No: I went into the Cock and had a glass of gin. I was not in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. The prisoner says that he was in this house in Drury-lane before you and the other man came in. I understood you to say, that you, the prisoner, and the other young man, had gone into this house together - A. No, sir. I never went into the house, I staid out. I was never inside of the house in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. But you say the two men that were with you did go in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two men that went with you to Drury-lane, the prisoner and the other man - A. Yes. They were the men that brought me away from Charing-cross; I swear it positively, they were the very men that conveyed me away, all the way.</p>

                  </hi> I am cashier in the service of Thomas Wilkinson Kershaw and another. They live at Greenwich; the prisoner was in their service—on the 5th of July I made a communication to my master, and in consequence of that six penny pieces, and twelve halfpence were marked—about four or five o'clock that evening I saw the prisoner serving a customer—he called for change for a shilling, and farthings—I took him five pence, one halfpenny, two farthings, and a sixpence—I did not see what he took from the customer—I think it was three farthings—he put it into the till, and went to another customer and sold her a yard of calico for 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he called for change for sixpence—I saw him take 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of the customer—I watched him—he only put a portion of it into the till—I could not see how much, but I saw part of it in his hand—he went to another part of the counter, put up some hose, put his hand behind him, and dropped some of the coppers from his hand into his coat pocket—I think it was more than one piece—an officer was sent for.</p>

                  </hi> I am in the prosecutor's employ—on the 5th of July I marked twelve halfpence and six penny pieces—the prisoner asked for change—the cashier left the desk and gave it him—I requested that he should come away from the till—I noticed the prisoner go to the till and drop something into it—he then went to another part of the shop, put his hand be<lb></lb>hind his back to his back to his coat-tail-pocket, and dropped some money into it—I com<lb></lb>municated what I had seen to Mr. Lowe—the prisoner was taken up stairs—Mr. Lowe requested him to put the money out that he had in his pocket—he did so, and there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—amongst it was one penny, and, I think two halfpence marked—Mr. Lowe accused him of robbing him—he said he had not—I pointed out the marked money to him—he made no reply—he had no business with that marked money in his pocket—he could not by right have put any money he received into his pocket.</p>

Q.</hi> How near were you to the till? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Within about two yards, and I was about the same distance from the prisoner when he dropped the money into his pocket—to the best of my knowledge that was the same pocket from which he took the money afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cow-keeper, in partnership with Mr. Spencer, and live in Goswell-street. The prisoner was six years in our employ, to take out milk, and receive money on our account—we have a customer named Lane, whom he collected from on our account—he has never accounted to us for money received from Lane at any time—he should account to me every night—he had no authority to retain any money for any purpose—on the 14th of October, I asked the prisoner the reason he did not give me the money Lane has paid him—he was quite confused, and began to cry, and hoped we should not hurt him—I was vexed at his ingratitude, having been a very good friend to him, and fetched an officer, and gave him in charge—the prisoner sometimes accounted to my wife and daughter for money received—they are not here—he told me he had made use of the money.</p>

I was called in by Mr. Wood, and saw the prisoner in the counting-house, crying—Mr. Wood gave him into custody for embezzlement; and on the way to the station-house, he said he hoped Mr. Wood would not be too hard with him, for he had made use of it to buy food for his wife and child.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner put in a written Defence, pleading poverty, and stating that his intention was to have repaid the money.)</p>

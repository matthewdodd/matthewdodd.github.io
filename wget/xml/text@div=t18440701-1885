                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. John Scrafton Thompson. On Monday, the 15th of April, I delivered fourteen sacks of potatoes to the prisoner to take to Mr. Day, in Spitalfields—I gave him a ticket, with "28cwt." on it—this is the ticket—it is now disfigured, which in a great measure prevents my seeing the contents—I am quite sure I gave him fourteen sacks of potatoes—I went into the counting-house and made him out a note—no particular directions were given him at the time—he had been with them before, and knew where to go—on Tuesday morning he brought me this return note, which we usually have back—it has got a blot over the figures—it is in the same state as when he brought it to me—when we came to settle accounts with Mr. Day, it was discovered there was something wrong, and the prisoner was afterwards given into custody.</p>

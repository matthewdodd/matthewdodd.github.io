                  </hi>. I live at No. 50, Baldwin's-gardens, Gray's Inn-lane. I am a porter—last Saturday night week, about a quarter past 12 o'clock, I was standing at the door of my house, talking to my brother in law, Samuel Goldsmith, and the prisoner came up—he passed by me, turned to the right, and gave my brother in law two blows on the face, muttering something, but what I could not understand—he then backed across the road—it is a narrow street—my brother in law crossed the road to where the prisoner was standing, and asked him what he did that for—I cannot say whether the prisoner made any reply—my brother in law said he would go to fetch a policeman—he went, but he could not find one, and he came back—while he was away, the prisoner had crossed the street, and gone up a court—after my brother in law came back, I saw the prisoner put his hand into his pocket, and I said, "Take care that he don't draw the knife upon you"—immediately after that he drew a knife, and was in the act of making a blow at my brother in law—I rushed in, and took him by the wrist, and he cut me across my wrist with the knife—I laid hold of him, kicked his feet from under him, and threw him on his back—I was cut a second time while he was lying on the ground, and I was trying to wrest the knife out of his hand—I kept him on the ground till an officer came and took him—there had been no quarrel between me and the prisoner, or between my brother in law and the prisoner, that I know of.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the same place where William Davidson lives, and am his brother in law; I am a seafaring man, but latterly I have got a situation in London. At a little after 12 o'clock, on that Saturday night, I was standing at the door, talking to him—the prisoner came to me from the opposite side of the way, and struck me on the right cheek, I believe once—he had not said anything previous to that—on his striking me, he crossed over to Garden-court—I went after him, and asked what he had done it for—he said something, but what I could not understand—I went for a policeman, but could not find one—when I returned he was in the same place—I said it was no use having the man locked up—the prisoner then drew a knife at me—my brother in law said, "Mind, he has a knife!"—he made a blow at me—my brother in law stepped in, and received it on his left hand—I helped to keep the prisoner till the police<lb></lb>man came, and he was given into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there any crowd? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were some few about the place—the prisoner was thrown down after he struck with the knife—he appeared to be agitated—neither I nor my brother in law gave him any offence—I heard whistling, but whether it was him or not I do not know—I did whistle myself, just to employ myself—I did not whistle just to mock this man—I was imitating the call which I heard on board</p>

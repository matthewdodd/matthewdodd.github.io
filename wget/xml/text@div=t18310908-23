            . I was in the Poultry on Tuesday, the 6th of September, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening; I could not, at that time, by the light of day, discern the features of a man's face; as I was passing I heard something fall, which appeared to sound like a box- I saw the prisoner throw something away; he was running, and several persons after him: while running he threw something away - I had not heard any thing before- I picked up what he threw down, and it proved to be a silver snuff-box, which I delivered to the officer at the watch-house; I do not know his name: I know the house of Mr. Weatherley; it was about forty yards from his house that the box was thrown down.</p>

I was on duty as private-watchman of the ward of Cheap, opposite Mr. Weatherley's shop, in the Poultry, on the 6th of September - it was near halfpast eight o'clock in the evening; I heard some glass, break, and instantly saw the prisoner run - I followed him, and did not lose sight of him till I had him in custody: I took him at the corner of the Old Jewry, and took him to the watch-house; he was close to the prosecutor's window when I heard the glass break.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. On the night of the 6th of September I received this snuff-box from Mitchell.</p>
               <p>MR. WEATHERLEY. This is my box; I know it by my own private-mark on it - my house is in the parish of St. Mildred the Virgin; I am quite sure that is the name it goes by - my shop door was shut, and I had some customers in my shop, looking at some articles at the time; the window was quite closed - he could not get any thing without breaking the glass.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was distress drove me to it; I had no place to lie in - I had nothing to eat; no clothes and could get no ship - I had been fourteen years in His Majesty's service; I did not know what to do for the best - I throw myself on the mercy of the Court; I was at the Battle of Navarino - no one knows me, but the officers who are now with the squadron.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. WEATHERLEY. Q. Did you see the man's face? A. No - I saw nothing but the hand.</p>

             - she had been to see me that day - she was seventy-two years old; she left my house about half-past eight o'clock - it was dark. She lived at Pentonville - I lit her out, and stopped at the door with a light in my hand; she was crossing the street towards a doctor's shop, which threw out a great light, and before she could get across, a cart came in contact with her; it was galloping - three men were in it. The horse or the shaft struck her down, and when she was down they called out; but before the cart went on, after she was down, they struck the horse with the whip; they pulled up directly. I was going to pick her up, but as several people went to her assistance, I run to take the number of the cart. Wier was the man who had the whip in his hand; he followed her into the shop, and said he was very sorry, and seemed so - he almost fainted away. The cart was going towards Shoreditch church. She was taken away in a coach, and died next day in St. Bartholemews Hospital.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. In what part of the road did it happen - A. Near the turnpike. The doctor's shop is on the left hand going towards Shoreditch - the cart was about six yards from the doctor's - there was a strong gas light from the shop. It was a small horse, not a pony.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Brick-lane. I was in Old-street-road; it was dark. Just as I got opposite the doctor's shop, I heard a cart running along at a furious rate - I turned round to look at it, and instantly saw the woman under the horses feet; I ran to her assistance. I had heard no cry for her to get out of the way; but when she was down there was a cry of Hallo! Three men were in the cart - I ran and took the woman by the hand, she apeared motionless. I assisted her into the shop - Wier came in, and said he was very sorry for what had happened, and she had better be taken to her own house than to the Hospital. I assisted her to the Hospital in a coach.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Wier said he would pay the doctor to attend her - A. I did not hear that; he was very anxious about her. She was about two yards from the footway.</p>

            . I am a carver and gilder, and live in Sutton-street. Clerkenwell. I was in Old-street-road - I had passed the doctor's shop, and saw three persons in the cart, driving at the rate of eight or ten miles an hour, between a trot and a gallop. I heard a scream, which I think was from the persons in the cart; it was after the woman was down - I assisted her to the shop. Wier<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090034"></xptr>seemed much affected, and said he would rather she went home. and he would pay the expences.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say the other two had nothing to do with it, that it was his misfortune - A. He did. The wind was very high, and blew in their faces. The doctor's glasses reflected a light, which dazzles the sight.</p>

            . I am a surgeon of St. Bartholemews Hospital. I saw the deceased immediately she was brought in; she was bleeding from a cut on her head, which penetrated to the bone, and the flesh had fallen down - I gave her to the care of another gentleman next morning. After death we found six ribs broken, and the collar bone also; she died in the morning. This injury was the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>WIER'S Defence. I drove to Soho, and met my fellow prisoners; we were perfectly sober - on returning at the rate of about six miles an hour home, the wind was high, and the rain beat in our faces, and when we got into the dark, we received a sudden obstruction. Gollege called out</p>
               <p>"For God's sake pull in;" I did so, got down, and found the deceased under the cart, and was much concerned. I offered to pay all expences, and went next day to ascertain her state, attended the Coroner's Inquest, voluntarily, and was committed here.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that, is that the letter that you opened? - A. It is, it contained two notes, No. 3195, and 3196.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing strike you particularly at that time, so as to lead you to examine the letter more closely? - A. No; the letter laid by for two or three days; we did not examine it minutely till after I had received another letter from Mr. Devonshire; there appears an alteration in the word two, and in the word twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the outside of the letter? - A. Yes; we examined the place where the wafer was; there appeared to be two wafers, not exactly one upon the other, but partly so, it appeared to have been opened and sealed up again; I examined the post-mark, and it appeared to me to be a little defaced; Mr. Yates made application to Mr. Robarts's Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two Bank-notes? - A.These were in the letter that I received on the 19th; they were paid into Bobarts's, with other notes, and some cash.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe the letter E is visible in that post-mark? - A. Yes; when I came to examine it more minutely; and it is now in the state in which I delivered it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have known this young man, I believe, ever since he was an instant? - A.I have known the family, as neighbours living within a few doors; I always thought him a steady and an industrious young man; they are a very industrious family.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. (To Ferguson.) Q. What does the letter E import? - A. It shews that it was stamped at the table E, and the day of the month.</p>

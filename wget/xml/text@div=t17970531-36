             got upon the other step.

             stood at the horse's head, with a pistol in his hand; the prisoner, Wale, began to search me; I told him I had no money; he then appeared to me to colour in the face; and then he put a red handkerchief which he had round his neck over the lower part of his mouth; he then searched me again, and put his hands in my waistcoat pocket, and felt upon my breeches and thighs, but did not find my money; I should have mentioned, that when he made the second search, he pushed me back in the chaise, and pulled my hat over my face.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that before or after he had put the handkerchief over his face? - A. Afterwards; he then reached over me to Mrs. Beresford, and tried to get the watch from her side, which he could not do, and be swore very much for a knife; and he began pulling her very hard, and by so pulling her my hat got from off my eyes, by which means I was able to see his face completely; at last he got the watch away, I saw it go.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it effected without some degree of violence on his part? - A. Very great violence; she then gave her purse to the prisoner, George Withers; he took the silver out, and a memorandum, which was in it, and gave to the prisoner, Aaron Withers, for the purpose of his looking at it; George Withers then returned the memorandum and the purse to Mrs. Beresford, and then said, go on, go on, and do not look back.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see either of them again? - A. I did look back, and I observed them go along the road towards Harrow; I went to a public-house and gave information that I had been robbed, and the next day, the 2d of May, I went and lodged an information at Bow-street; the prisoners were apprehended the same day in the afternoon, and I saw them the day after, on the Wednesday, at Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You say it was between eight and nine o'clock - had you a watch? - A. No; my wife had my watch, she had broke her own; I had seen the watch, and asked her the time, when we were at Brentford, and from the time I had been going, it must be about that time; it was a clear bright night, I believe the moon was in the first quarter.</p>

               <p>Q. That is in a direction that would carry them further from Townsend's house than where they committed the robbery? - A. That depends upon which way they went; if they went strait on it would, but they might have gone to Kilburn.</p>
               <p>Q. They were in a direction from London, when you looked back and saw them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. As to George Withers, you will not swear to him? - A. No; I believe him to be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I understand you right when you said, that as to Aaron Withers you never had a doubt? - A. Yes; I never had.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you certain of him at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you there say so? - A. Yes; me and my wife both said so; I always said he was the man that stood at the horse's head.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never said you had a doubt of it? A. No, never; I never spoke to

               <p>Q. He had cut him with a whip, I believe? - A Yes; Mr. Beresford told him, he did not mean to cut him; then Harry Wale demanded his watch, pocket-book, and money; he told him he had no watch nor pocket-book; but he began to rifle his pockets at the time; and all on a sudden, his coantenance seemed to change very red; he then drew his silk handkerchief, which he had round his neck, over the lower part of his face, it was a red silk<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310042"></xptr>handkerchief rather dirty; he then pushed Mr. Beresford back in the chaise, took his hat off, and pulled it over his face, then rifled his pockets again; and then reached over Mr. Beresford to me, and began swearing in a very violent manner, for my watch, which Mr. Beresford said he should have; he then put his hands to the pocket-hole of my habit, and took it out of a little pocket that I had tied round my waist, he swore very violently for a knife several times; I begged him to let me untie it, and he should have the watch; it was tied with a very strong string round my waist; he got it either by breaking the string or drawing it through the knot; he pulled so violently, that he pulled me almost out of the chaise; at that time, the pistol in George Withers's hand hit me on the temple; I was afraid of it's going off, and laid hold of his hand and a part of the pistol, and begged of him to take it away; I then gave George Withers my purse; I had ten or eleven shillings in silver, and I gave him them all; then there was a little memorandum, which he took out and gave to Aaron Withers; I looked very much at Aaron Withers the whole time; Aaron Withers gave it to George, and shook his head, and then

             is the man that stood on my side, and the other was the man that stood at the horse's head.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any doubt of their persons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The observation you made when they left the chaise, was, that they were all nearly of a height? - A. Yes; except that Wale was lustier, but you will give me leave to observe, that Wale has got much thinner now than he was then.</p>
               <p>Q. He was lustier than the man who is now nearest to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he has grown a little shorter too, since? - A. No; being lusty, it made him look shorter.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, and you will tell me if I am wrong, that you were extremely alarmed? - A. I was; and I could not have believed that it could have made the impression it did make on my mind; I looked very hard at them.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose as the men approached, and as they became violent, your fears did not lesson? - A. They came up nearly altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. But when they presented the pistols, your fright did not lessen? - A. I screamed very much for the moment; but I soon came to, and looked at them very hard.</p>
               <p>Q. Under this alarm, you observed a change of colour in Wale's face? - A. I was quite in my senses by that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You have now spoke of all three of them with great positiveness, did you at Bow-street, express yourself with the same positiveness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Not a belief, but positively swore to them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If that was the case, could you by any possibility, pick out a man that turned out to be none of these three, a man of the name of Barrett, who was one of the officers of Bow-street? - A. I looked at one, rather a dark man. I thought he was the man at first, and then I turned round and said, no, there is the man that stood at the horse's head, and the officer said, you are right, ma'am, that is one of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not, point to Barrett, as the man? - A. Yes; but I contradicted it instantly; I said, no, he is much like him, but this is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not suffer these words to escape you when you pointed to Barrett, this is one of them? - A. I might, but I contradicted it; it is most likely that I did till I saw the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not? - A. I cannot recollect; I dare say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say when you were pointing to Barrett, this is the man? - A. I cannot say; I do recollect pointing to him; I had my doubts at the time, though I pointed to him, and that made me look round again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any information at the turnpike, that you had been robbed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you had been robbed, was it, that you gave this account at the turnpike? - A. I cannot say, it might or it might not be a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Beresford was extremely frightened? - A. Yes; but he told me directly after that he knew the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect stopping at Townsend's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either you or Mr. Beresford mention that Wale was one of the men? - A. No; I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either Mr. Beresford or you mention Wale's name? - A. He said he could swear to the man's voice, and that he should know him again; in a very few minutes after, he said, good God, it is

               <p>Q. And he was always that length of time making water, ten minutes or a quarter of an hour? - A. I cannot say; he might not be above ten minutes; I am sensible he was not out above a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing Beadle at Mr. Darby's? - A. Yes; on Monday the 1st of May, I saw him as near as I can recollect, between three and four.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe him absent at that time? - A. I was absent myself, carrying out beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry out any beer? - A. Yes; I carried a pot of beer to the turnpike-gate, about a quarter after eight, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left the house, to carry out a pot of beer to the turnpike-gate, did you observe whether Wale was in the room, or not? - A. Wale was in the room then.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned from the gate? - A. I suppose I might stop conversing at the gate, about twenty minutes: when I came back I found Wale in the tap-room again; I was ordered to take another pot of beer to the turnpike-gate, which I did, in about five minutes after, and while I was at the gate, Mr. Beresford passed; I then heard the alarm of the robbery having been committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay any time at the turnpike-gate then? - A. Not five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned at that time, where was Wale? - A. In the tap-room.</p>

               <p>Q. It was not till you went for the second pot, that you heard of the robbery being committed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you orders to take the first pot to the turnpike, at any particular time? - A. No; it was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. It was nothing extraordinary for a pot of beer to be ordered on May-day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not recollect the delivery of any other particular pot of beer that day? - A. Yes; when beer is particularly ordered.</p>
               <p>Q. But suppose it is not particularly ordered, then you do not pay an attention to the exact time when you take out every pot of beer? - A. I know that it was just at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any clock in the tap-room? - A. No; there was one in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. But you had not gone into the parlour to look at the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you six any particular time that you delivered a pot of beer where there was not a previous order for it on that day? - A. I recollect perfectly well, that the eight o'clock beer had then gone out, and this first pot that I carried, went after the eight o'clock beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the other prisoners? - A. Yes, I do; both of them by sight.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - A. He came into the Red-lion, at pretty near ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he join the company of Wale? - A. I cannot say whether they drank together or not.</p>
               <p>Q. But you are sure he came into the tap-room before ten? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Beadle there? - A. I do not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose he had started that he did not come into the tap-room, he must be wrong, and you right? - A. He did come into the tap-room, and had a pint of beer.</p>

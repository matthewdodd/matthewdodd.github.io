                  </hi>. I am barman at the Stanley Arms, York-street, Wandsworth—on 16th September, about 8 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came for a glass of porter, which came to a penny—she gave me sixpence—I gave her change, and she left—as soon as she was gone I found it was bad—it was very soft—I tried it with my teeth, and then bent it in a detector, and gave it to Higgins, my fellow-servant, who broke it in two, and I gave it to a man to throw away—on 16th December the prisoner came again for a glass of porter, and gave me a bad sixpence—I jumped over the counter, and gave her in custody with the sixpence—I said that she was there the Wednesday before—she said that it was a mistake.</p>

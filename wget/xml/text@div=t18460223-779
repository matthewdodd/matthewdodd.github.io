                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop, at No. 9, Burdet-street, Westmin<lb></lb>ster-road, in the parish of Lambeth—on the 12th of Feb. I went to bed about half-past twelve—the window was fastened by a catch—I fastened it myself—that would prevent its being pulled up or down from without—there are two shutters outside the window which fasten by a bolt, and also another bolt to the window-sill—they were fastened—about half-past two I was alarmed by somebody calling me by name from the street—I went down stairs, and found the centre square of glass broken, to undo the button of the sash—there was sufficient glass removed to enable an instrument to be introduced, but not a hand—the top sash was pulled down level with the bottom—the shutter appeared to have been prised open by some flat instrument—there was the mark of an instrument between the shutters—I have since compared a hatchet with the marks on the shutter—I found my till, which is kept in the bar, standing on the top of the counter—I had left it locked overnight, and about 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of copper money in it—I missed some bacon from a cupboard in the bar, and china ornaments from the bar parlour mantel-piece—I saw the china ornament and the bacon</p>

I was on duty in Burdet-street, Westminster-road, a little after one in the morning, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner at the corner of Francis-street, Westminster-road, in company with another person—on seeing me cross, the prisoner said to me, "It is a cold night"—I said, "You had better go home out of the cold"—the other walked off—I did not see his face at all—the prisoner walked away in the same direc<lb></lb>tion—I went round my beat again—I afterwards saw the prisoner in com<lb></lb>pany with a woman, eight yards from the prosecutor's house—on seeing me, he walked quite away—the shutters were quite safe then, for I turned my lantern on them, but on coming round again, I found the shutters open, and marks of dirty footmarks on the window-ledge—I called Mr. Brown—the shutters were put to—I compared the marks on the shutter with a hatchet which was produced afterwards, and it corresponded exactly—I did not make a fresh mark with it.</p>

On the morning in question I was in the Lower-marsh, and saw two men on the opposite side of the road—I went over to them—one of them walked away—I stopped the prisoner, who had a bundle—I asked what he had there—he replied, "A piece of bacon"—I asked where he got it—he said he bought it—I asked where—he said, "At Westminster"—I asked where—he said, "At a shop"—seeing the bacon, and that it had not been bought at a shop from the appearance of it, I pointed to these China images which he had, and asked where he got them—he said he bought them altogether—I was taking him to the station-house, but he dropped the bundle and escaped—this hatchet fell from his coat—I took it from him—I followed him, sprang my rattle, and found him in cus<lb></lb>tody—the bundle contained three China ornaments, the bacon, and 2lbs. of sugar.</p>

On the 9th of September I was in the yard adjoining the packing—warehouse, examining some umbrellas packed for an order—one of them had a wrong ticket on it—I sent for the prisoner, and said, "Here is an umbrella with the best mounting with a common ticket"—he said, "I will get another"—he turned, and I saw in his pocket some dark silk with a light selvage—that raised my suspicion—I thought it was better not to lose sight of him, and told him to go to his dinner, and never mind getting the ticket—he went out into the street—I followed, and laid hold of him—he made some resistance, but I brought him back—the policeman searched him, and found on him these forty-eight yards of figured silk with a light selvage—twenty yards was taken from his coat pocket, and the rest from his trowsers; twenty-two carved ivory handles were taken from his breeches pocket, and the other handles were found on him.</p>

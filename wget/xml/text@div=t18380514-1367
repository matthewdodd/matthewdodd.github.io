                  </hi>. I am a constable. In consequence of information I apprehended the prisoner, on the 10th of May, about ten o'clock at night, Hollingsworth's beer-shop, which is rather above a mile from Hunt's—I found the watch on him—before I found it he said he would show me the an he got the watch from—we let him go.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Murray at Hunt's beer-shop on the 5th of April—I recollect his going out of the house—I remained in the house—I was sober—he went out of the house about ten minutes after six o'clock at night—I went to look for him about a quarter past six o'clock, and found him asleep in the privy—I cannot tell whether he had his watch with him or not—I shut the door and left him there—I went again in about half an hour, he was still asleep—I examined, and his watch was not in his fob, nor about his person—when I could not find it I awoke him—I took him back into the house—the prisoner was then in the house—I said in his hearing that Murray had lost his watch, that somebody in the house must know something about it, and before anybody went out of the house every man should be searched—the prisoner got up and said he would search me first—he did so, and then I searched him—I could not find it—every body was searched in the house—there were ten or twelve there, all men—the prisoner afterwards said he had three or four miles to go, and he would be there on the following night, and he left about half-past eight or nine o'clock—the watch was missed before seven o'clock—the search took place about a quarter of an hour after that—I had looked about the pre<lb></lb>mises before I searched.</p>

I had an old flap door to my cellar which had no fastening to it, in which the thieves got, and then broke through a partition, and took away the things mentioned in the indictment. The watchman knocked at the door about a quarter after 2, on the 9th of June, and told me the door was open, which was fast when we went to bed between 10 and 11; a kinsman of mine went down and shut the door, and the next morning I got up at 5, and missed the things.

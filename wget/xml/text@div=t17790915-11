Then they threw me down with violence and took two guineas from me; they said if I made any noise they would take my life. The prisoner is the person that took the money out of my pocket; I laid hold of her hand and desired her to give me my money; she said I ought to be killed because I said I had no money; they then opened the door and bid me get about my business, they had none of my money; and they ran away; a person ran after the prisoner and brought her back to me.</p>

               <p>Did you lose any aprons? - Yes. There may be two or three dozen; they had a room next to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you lost a dozen of linen aprons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Any linen shifts? - Yes; a dozen of them.</p>
               <p>Any handkerchiefs? - Yes; fifteen or sixteen in one parcel; half a dozen of linen frocks; there might be a dozen or two of linen shirts. I cannot say exactly.</p>

               <p>When did you see them in the warehouse? - About three days before they came to take this room. They had been in a fortnight on the Monday; he was to have gone away on the Monday he was taken up; on the Saturday I missed the things, and got a warrant, and went with Redgrave the constable to his room; he was not at home; his wife was. While we were in the room, a man came with a knot, and two penny cords to carry away a box which was in the room; we broke it open, and found in it a cradle quilt, four sheets, and many more things my property. The bills were on some of them when they were found, and some were taken away. Mr. Richmond owned before the justice, on the 30th of January, that the property was mine.</p>
               <p>Was there any confession taken in writing? - I believe so. When we broke open the box; I said to Mrs. Richmond, how could you serve me so? She showed me where he had broke down the partition, between the warehouse and his room, and had got in; both she and Mr. Richmond said they were mine.</p>
               <p>What is the value of your goods found in the box? - At the least, they cannot be of less value than five pounds.</p>
               <p>Describe how the warehouse stands. Is it in your dwelling-house? - Yes; up two-pair-of-stairs.</p>


               <p>JONATAN REDGRAVE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. I was sent on the 30th of January to execute a search warrant in the apartment of the two prisoners. I went up stairs; the wife was in the room; there was this box standing upright in the room. I said I had a search warrant, and must have the box opened; she said she had not the key. I told her then I must break it open, which I accordingly did, and the first thing I saw was a shift, with the pawnbroker's duplicate on it. The prosecutrix said, how could you rob me? She cried; the prosecutrix then asked her how they got into the warehouse, upon which she showed her the board he had occasionally pulled down to get in; I left the prosecutrix with her, and went down stairs to wait for his coming home; when he came in, I fastened the street door, and followed him up stairs, and told him he was my prisoner.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said to you by him, or by you to him? - No. I took him before the justice, and after a long examination, the justice got out of him where he had taken another room.</p>
               <p>Was there any confession taken in writing? - No; I believe not, nor any promise made that I know of. He said he had taken a room near the Horns, in St. John's-street; he did not say then that the things were the prosecutrix's property. We went to the lodging in St. John's-street and found another box, with some of the prosecutrix's goods in it. When we brought the goods from that lodging; he then said to the justice, I have sold some. The justice asked him to whom, and for what, and he said he had sold between five and six pounds worth to two Jews.</p>
               <p>You do not know what those things were? - No; he confessed before the magistrate, that he took them out of the warehouse and gave them to his wife.</p>
               <p>You are sure there was no confession taken in writing? - I do not remember that there was.</p>
               <p>(The goods found were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>

               <p>I had been out one day; when I returned I found these things in the room; my wife told me her mother sent them to her and asked me to sell them; she said they were her own property; I sold some and took some of them to my lodging in St. John's-street; I did not know who they belonged to.</p>
               <p>(The woman being the wife of the other prisoner was not put on her defence.)</p>

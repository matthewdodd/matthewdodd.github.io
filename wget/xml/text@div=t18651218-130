                  </hi>. I live at 4, Nassau-street, and am a prostitute—on the night of 6th December I met the prisoner outside the Blue Anchor, in Ratcliffe-highway—he went home with me—he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he jumped into bed with his trowsers on—I said, "Take your trowsers off"—he then opened his leather belt, which was round his waist, drew his knife, made use of very nasty expressions, and then made an attempt to cut my throat—I put my hand up to save it, and my finger was cut—I jumped out of bed, opened the door, and called for help—I had my fingers dressed at the hospital—I gave the prisoner in charge—he did not go away—there was a light in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Holliday, a sailor, and live next door to the prosecutrix—on this night I was sent for, and went in, and saw the pcosecutrix standing by her bedside, with her finger bleeding—the prisoner was sitting up in the bed—I asked him why he did it—he said he did not do it; she did it herself—she said that she saved her throat from being cut and had her finger cut—I saw a knife in the policeman's hands.</p>

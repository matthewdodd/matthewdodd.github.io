            . I am one of the City Police. I was sent for to Robson's on the 2nd of February; a bad crown-piece was given to me - the prisoner said he had no other piece of money about him; I searched him at the Compter, and found a good crown-piece concealed between his legs, secreted - he had no bottom to his pockets, so that he could easily put it there; it was placed between his legs, and must have been done by his hands - I saw it marked; when I found where it was, I made him shake it out of his trousers.</p>
               <p>MR. FIELD. This is a bad crown, and the other is a good one; the counterfeit one is cast.</p>

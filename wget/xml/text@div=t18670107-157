                  </hi>. I am eleven years old, and live at 8, Unicorn Street, Poplar—on Thursday, the 20th December, I was at the Rum Quay, West India Docks, with a barrow, selling pudding and pea soup—McCarthy bought a pennyworth of pudding, and gave me a shilling—I gave him his change, and then tried the shilling with my teeth, and found it was bad—I called him back, and told him so—he gave me back the change and part of the pudding, and went away—English then came and had a pennyworth of pea soup—he gave me a bad shilling—I gave it back to him, and he paid me with a good sixpence—I gave him his change, and they both went away together—I had marked the shilling I received from McCarthy, with my teeth.</p>

On the 20th December, from information I received, I took the prisoners—they were walking and talking together—I had watched them for half an hour—a man named Mutton assisted me—I asked them what they were doing on the road—McCarthy said, "Nothing," and dropped from his right hand a bad shilling, which I picked up—I searched him, and found three sixpences and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, good—I showed him the shilling I picked up, and asked how he accounted for it—he said, "I received that at Fresh Wharf yesterday, where I was at work"—I asked English what money he had got about him—he took this purse from his pocket, pitched it on the desk, and said, "That is what I have got about men—it contained one shilling, two six<lb></lb>pences, and a halfpenny, good—I then searched him, and found in his waist<lb></lb>coat pocket these four bad shillings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were then flat—I bent them in his presence, and said, "They are bad"—I asked him to account for them—he made no reply.</p>

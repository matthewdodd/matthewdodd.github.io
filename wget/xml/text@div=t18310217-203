            . I am a Police-constable. On Wednesday, the 2nd of February, I was in Tottenham-place, about ten minutes past eleven o'clock at night; I saw a coach coming to the end of Tottenham-place, and saw the prisoner coming out of Southampton-court, and another man about ten yards in front of him - they were going towards the coach; the prisoner had the articles here produced - I asked what he had there; he made me no answer - I caught him, and pulled him round - the other man, and the coach then disappeared; I again asked the prisoner what he had there - he said pictures, and that the man in front of him had given him 6d. and a glass of gin to carry them to the coach; I took him to the station-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the other man nearer to the coach? A. He was about ten yards in front of the prisoner; neither of them were within sixty yards of the coach - the prisoner was going towards the coach; here is one picture of His Majesty, the rest are frames and this crown and cushion - I found nothing on him suspicious.</p>
               <p>JOSIAH MORGAN. I live at No. 51, <placeName id="t18310217-203-crimeloc1208">London-street, Fitzroy-square</placeName>

These frames, crown and cushion, are mine, and this portrait - I missed them on Wednesday evening, the 2nd of February, between six and eight o'clock - I found the door of my shop open at eight, and the glass-case door open; I had seen them safe at dusk, about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then these things must have been gone before eight o'clock? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told him to catch hold of the man before me, as he had given me the goods to carry.</p>

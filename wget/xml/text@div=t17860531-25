Fanny, where are the other handkerchiefs? I immediately said, I had them this moment; then she said, good God, they are gone!

               <p>Were they worth fifteen pounds? - Yes, between fifty and twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Did you see them take any thing? - I did not.</p>

               <p>You have two or three sorts at least; your stock is not so considerable as in other shops? - No, I wish it was.</p>
               <p>Such a quantity of handkerchiefs had considerable bulk? - About the bulk of that book, and about that size.</p>
               <p>You suspected the persons you had in your shop? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not, watch those persons whom you suspected more than you would persons of whom you had no suspicion? - I did not.</p>
               <p>In about half a minute you asked after your handkerchiefs? - Yes; and my wife immediately told me they were in the window; I went out after them as soon as I could find my hat; Jew's-row is about three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Is it in a strait line, or is there any turning? - There are several turnings.</p>
               <p>When you came up to them, they were arm in arm, looking at somebody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You found nothing of your's upon them? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd desired you to be cautious of what you were doing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He told you that coolly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He said he was of the profession of the law? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They said they had no objection to going back? - No.</p>

               <p>Is there any iron grating, any wire-work? - Yes, to my sorrow, now too late for me, I have put some up.</p>
               <p>How far did that iron rail extend into the shop? - About a foot and a half.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You expressed a surprise at the time you was wrapping up the handkerchiefs, good God! what is become of the India handkerchiefs! were these India handkerchiefs there in the morning? - I saw this parcel of goods in the window, about five or ten minutes before they came in; I saw a heap of goods before they came in, but I cannot say whether they were these India handkerchiefs; it is not a common rule for us to put above one or two pieces of these handkerchiefs in the window, but undoubtedly my wife put them all.</p>
               <p>Did you pursue these people in the direct road that leads to London, or how? - I saw them about a hundred yards off; I saw the pockets bulk out, of the man that I passed.</p>
               <p>There was no appearance of any connection between them and these prisoners? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

             was not in the shop in the afternoon, he stood at the door, the shop door was ajarr, and I repeatedly asked him to come in, he declined coming in, and as we could not take the money for the handkerchiefs they all went away; after they left the shop, Mr. Frazer went to gather up the handkerchiefs they had been looking at, he says to me, where are the India pattern handkerchiefs, I turned about and said, here they are, I concluded they were, I looked, and they were gone; after Mr. Frazer came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310037"></xptr> down, I stood very near the window, but I was turning round to serve a boy with some thread and binding, and did not much attend to them during the time.</p>
               <p>Was it possible they should take such a quantity of handkerchief off the bulk that has been described, when you was so near the window without your observation? - I did not see them take them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Were these pattern India handkerchiefs loose in the window for shew, or were they tied up in a parcel? - They were folded up.</p>
               <p>So that if you had laid hold of them, they would of course come loose, as my handkerchief does now? - They might not.</p>
               <p>How many different pieces are there? - There are some three, some five, in a piece, some whole pieces, they amount in the whole to fifty-seven handkerchiefs; I was standing almost close to the window, between my husband and the window; these things were missed instantly, and they were pursued in about five minutes; he was seeking his hat and folding up the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>It was almost instantaneous was it not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I understand you have no grate or wire-work to protect your counter? - Yes, I had a wire to the counter, to protect the handkerchiefs, but where these handkerchiefs lay, there was not, they were at the end of the wire; it took its beginning from the door jamb, and went to the end of the counter, next the door a foot and a half.</p>

               <p>I went out to the next door for some beer for dinner; I some times serve.</p>
               <p>Did you shew these people any thing? - Not that day.</p>
               <p>Did you see them at any time, and where, before they came in the evening? - Yes, I saw them about half past six in the evening, I went into the shop for some thread.</p>
               <p>In what situation did you see them? - They lay in at the window.</p>
               <p>At what distance from the door? - About a yard; my Master was up stairs; Miss Shepherd came in, and said, these are the handkerchiefs you looked at in the morning, and Mr. Shepherd stood at the door, with the door a-jar, with his great coat upon his arm; I went into the parlour; I only saw Mr. Shepherd at the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. These handkerchiefs were about a yard from the door? - Yes, from the door to the counter there is a little wire-work about a quarter of a yard, then there is a glass case; I was in the parlour; there is a glass door; there was a little boy in the shop, a neighbour's boy who keeps cows, very well known; indeed there was another lady in the parlour, and she said, is that one of your sweethearts?</p>
               <p>So that it seems you and the lady were looking pretty sharp upon this smart young fellow at the door? - Yes, Sir, I did not know what to think of them.</p>
               <p>You thought it not at all improbable he might become a sweetheart? - I cannot say, he was so very smart.</p>

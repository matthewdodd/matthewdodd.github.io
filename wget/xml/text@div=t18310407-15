I had known the prisoner for a fortnight or three weeks before this happened: the money in question was kept in my bed-room, on the second floor- the prisoner did not lodge at my house; he came there on the 2nd of February, and represented himself as the master of a ship; he said he had been drinking with the owner of his ship, he was out late, and could not get to his ship - he wanted a bed, and he went to bed in my house; I saw my money safe at nine o'clock in the morning of the 3rd, when I went into the bed-room - he was at that time up stairs in the room over my bed-room, where he slept, but I did not at that time know he was there; I went into the City immediately, and returned a little before twelve - he had been gone a few minutes, and I heard the money was gone; I went to my bed-room, and missed the money from the drawer, which had been opened by a picklock-key, I think, as the lock seemed to have been prized open by force - I missed ten sovereigns, sixteen half-crowns, twenty shillings, and twenty sixpences; I never saw him again till I found him in custody at the Thames Police, nearly two months afterwards, in consequence of an advertisement in the newspaper; I am quite sure he is the man who had a bed at my house - I gave information to the inspector as soon as I lost the money.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I know the prisoner; I saw him at the house on the 2nd of February, about eleven o'clock at night; he asked for a bed, which my husband allowed him - he slept in the room directly over our bed-room; I did not exactly know what money was in the drawer - I had observed ten sovereigns there the night before, with some silver, but how much I do not know; the prisoner did not stay to breakfast next morning - he paid for his bed over night, which is usual; I saw him leave the house; he asked me what time it was; I told him between eleven and twelve o'clock - my husband had been out, and came home just after the prisoner was gone; I had not then discovered the loss - I examined the drawer after he came home; but before he did, I found the lock injured, and the money gone - I could open the drawer; none of the money was marked - I saw the prisoner at the Thames Police, on the 7th of April - we had no other stranger in the house at the time; the bed-room was shut, but not locked; any body coming down stairs might open it - I found the door open when I went up; I had left the room about half-past eight o'clock - the door was then shut: my husband had gone out before ten - when I went up, I found the door wide open; I knew nobody in the house could go into the room without my knowledge - our front door is kept shut, and nobody goes out but what we let out - I let the prisoner out - we serve no customer till after twelve o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can only say I am entirely innocent - I throw myself on the mercy of the Court; I have no friends in London.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH LEATHERDALE re-examined. We have a servant girl, who slept in the kitchen, and a servant man up stairs - they are still in my service.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Had the servants access to the room? A. They could not go up stairs without my seeing them - the servant girl was at work with me, providing dinner, all the morning - I was directly opposite the staircase with her all the morning, and saw the prisoner come down; there is no back staircase; the man servant slept in the top garret - he came down stairs before me, and could not have gone up without me, or the female servant seeing him.</p>

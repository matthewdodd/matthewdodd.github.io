                  </hi> I deal in provisions, at 43, Sloane-street. The prisoner has been in my employ since Sept.—on Wednesday evening, 9th Feb., I marked three shillings, and gave them to Mr. Wain—on Thursday morning the prisoner was left in charge of the shop—there were two other shopmen there—I was away for two hours—if he received money in my absence he should put it into the till—I came back, went to the till, and found only two marked shillings—there was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver there, and a great number of shillings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are those shillings here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I had laid a trap for the prisoner—I also marked half-a-crown, and gave it to Mr. Cook, of Sloane-square, and a shilling and a six<lb></lb>pence, and gave them to Mr. Smith, of Sloane-square—he is not here—I had marked fifteen shillings the week before, and placed them in a bag—I did not keep them, I did not think it necessary—they were marked in a different way to these—they were put into a cash-box for security—he had not access to it—when he was taken he asked the policeman to search him—he wanted his box searched, but the policeman said he had no authority—he objected to be taken to the station—he was taken, and the boxes were then searched, in his absence—the policeman had got authority from the station-house—the policeman had never seen any of the marked money—my sister asked me for the key of my cash-box that morning, to give the prisoner 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for change—he had to go his rounds at ten o'clock.</p>

                  </hi> I am a grocer, at King's-road, Chelsea. On Wednesday evening Mr. Leete gave me three shillings, which I gave to my wife next morning—I saw her give them to the servant, with directions—my wife is not here.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 183.) On Friday, 11th Feb., about seven o'clock in the evening, I was called to Mr. Leete's—Mr. Leete said he gave the prisoner in charge for robbing him—the prisoner said he knew it was for marked money—I searched him, and found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—I did not go into his room then—I did after he was locked up—Mr. Leete was there—I searched his box, and found 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the greater part in shillings, and a franc—I put them on the table—Mr. Leete picked out this shilling (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) and gave it me—I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Give me the prisoner's exact expression about the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said, "That is about marked money; I have remarked to the shopman that there had been marked money paid to me before"—it was not consistent with our ruled to search his boxes without an order—he asked me to search them, and see if there was any marked money—I would not do so—I believe I told the Magistrate what he said about the marked money—I am not confident—I had no object in not saying it—I did not see the money in the till.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

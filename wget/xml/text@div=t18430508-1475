                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-house in Old-street-road—I took it on the 1st of April, and found the prisoner there, acting as waiter—he had been taken in out of charity by the former landlord—he was not in my employ<lb></lb>ment—I had a silver watch and guard, which I saw safe on the 3rd of April,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184305080067"></xptr>
               <p>at two o'clock in the day, in a draft-board on the mantle-shelf in the back parlour, and missed it at two o'clock on the 4th—I took the house on Satur<lb></lb>day, and allowed the prisoner to stop till Monday, the 3rd, as he said he had nowhere to go—the last time I saw him in the house was at ten o'clock on the 4th—I did not see him again till he was in custody on the 13th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> In what situation does your house stand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Old-street-road—it is at the corner of a court—it fronts the street—the back and the side of it is in the court—there is a passage between the court and the parlour, where the watch was—a side door opens into the passage from the court, and a door opens from the passage into the parlour—it is a double-fronted shop, and I occupy a part—a man named Tomlin lives in the upper part of the house—the house was being repaired—it was not finished, but the men were not at work at it after I came there—there has been nothing done, or any workmen about the house since I have been there—they might, per<lb></lb>haps, have been at work in a loft at the top of the house, getting their paint ready—that loft has no connexion with the house—you get to it by a pair of steps from the court—there is no communication from the inside.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coffee-house-keeper—I heard of the watch being missed—I saw the prisoner on the 13th of April, and told him he was the very man I wanted to see—he said, "Well, Mr. Leach, I will tell you; I have taken the watch, and I took it for the purpose of doing myself good; I have got it, and will bring it back next week"—he then tried to get away—I said he had better come with me to my house, and give me the particu<lb></lb>lars of what he had done with it—he kept going backwards and forwards down the street—I told him whichever way he went I intended to go—he came into Bishopsgate-street with me, and as soon as he saw an officer, he made a stop, and said, "Now I do not know what to do"—I said, "Yes, you do; come with me"—I caught hold of his arm, and gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you tell the Magistrate, that when you met me you said, that if I had taken the watch, to say so; that Cox would not do any thing to me; that all he wanted was the watch, as it was a family concern? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—before I kept a coffee-shop, I worked at Mr. King's, wholesale tea and coffee dealer, 22, Budge-row—I left on account of trade being bad—before that, I worked at Mr. Wilcox's, Bush-lane, Cannon-street; and before that with Mr. Mott, grocer, in Whitechapel; Mr. Blissett's, of Leadenhall-street; and at Messrs. Lacy and Reynolds, gum makers, in Great St. Helen's, from all of whom I can have a character—I took you into my house when you were so destitute that you had not a meal's victuals, and gave you shelter; and when I left I recommended you to Mr. Cox—there was an Arnott stove in the shop I let to Cox—I never said that I had bought it on the cross—I remember two men coming in one evening with a quantity of cigars to sell—I do not know how they obtained those cigars—I knew them to be dealers in cigars; and from the price I paid, they could have come by them honestly—they had them in a paper parcel, not in their hats—I recollect a person who called himself a minister being there one evening, when a sailor lost his tobacco-pouch, and you and your friend Williams knew more about it than any one else—I did not stand before a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man and an<lb></lb>other man with a paper in my hand, to hide them from the minister while they took the tobacco-pouch out of the sailor's pocket—it is all false.</p>

I am a pawnbroker—I produce a watch and guard-chain which was pawned at my shop on the 4th of April, in the name of John Clark, to the best of my belief by the prisoner—I am quite certain of him in my own mind, but I decline swearing positively to him—I had never seen him before to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> If Inspector Darby was here, I should be able to prove that this Leach is nothing better than a fence; the coffee-shop is no<lb></lb>thing but a blinf—it is a receptacle for stolen goods; or if either of the policemen who took me were here, they could confirm what I state. If any doubt should arise in your minds, I hope and expect that you will give me the benefit of it; this charge arises merely out of a few words which passed be<lb></lb>tween us; during the month I was with him, I saw quite sufficient to get him transported a dozen times over; and the first opportunity I have of bringing any charge against him, I certainly will do so.</p>

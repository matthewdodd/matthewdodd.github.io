On the 3d of this month, I left the vessel about ten o'clock in the morning, and returned about twelve. I left my property in the vessel; there were three sovereigns and a half in my jacket pocket, which was in my box, not locked up; the prisoner was a stranger. When I returned, I missed my watch immediately, which hung in the bed cabin; I afterwards missed the other things. I took the prisoner next day at the head of Billingsgate market with the jacket on. I have found nothing else. I told him he was the man I was looking for - he made no answer, but pretended to be in liquor, and I think he was. I gave him in charge.</p>

I had a pair of trowsers, a hat, a shirt, and two Chelmsford one-pound notes in my pocket-book, in my box - the trowsers were on the bed. I returned about one o'clock, and missed them. I saw the prisoner when he was taken; he had my brother's jacket, and my trowsers, shirt, and hat on him. I found the prisoner's old clothes in the cabin.</p>

I had seen him on that morning before; he then had no shoes, stockings, or hat on, and an old jacket. When he came ashore he had shoes and stockings, and a blue coat and trowsers, and a new beaver hat. About an hour afterwards, I heard the vessel was robbed, and mentioned this.</p>

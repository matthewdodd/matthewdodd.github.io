I said—he said, "Expenses in employing my men and seizing the goods"—part of the goods have been sold, and part, I believe, are at Sadler's house—I have never received a farthing for them, or got any of them back—I gave notice to the auctioneer to hold the money for them, but I do not know whether he has, for they are all alike, a bad lot—the prisoner has never paid the bill, or a farthing of it.</p>

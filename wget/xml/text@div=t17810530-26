               <p>I am one of the Officers at the Rotation Office. Yarnold took the prisoner. I found the pawnbroker's duplicate of the watch upon a girl in the room, who was connected with Davis. The watch was pawned at a pawnbroker's in St. Martin's lane: he is not here. Finding no owner for the watch, the duplicate and things were delivered to the girl again, and they were discharged. This gentleman came to me, to see if I could find the watch again: that was last Tuesday. I went and took the girl, and found the watch upon her.</p>
               <p>(It was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I know nothing of this watch.

               <p>Macdonald. I found both the watches in the girl's pocket: when I took her last, she had a silver watch, and a duplicate of a metal watch, in her pocket.</p>

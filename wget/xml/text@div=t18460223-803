On the morning of the 9th of Feb., the prisoner came for a pint of porter, and took out a sixpence to pay for it—I took it up, Writ in two, and gave it him back—he was very abusive, and I sent for the policeman—he had taken up the two pieces of the sixpence, and when the officer came the prisoner put them down on the counter—the officer took them.</p>

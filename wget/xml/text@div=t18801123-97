                  </hi>. I am now employed at St. John's Wharf, Wapping, as colonial sampler—I went in May, 1880—I had been at Butler's wharf from 1875 to that time—the prisoner was employed there as delivery foreman in the Colonial department—soon after I joined the service the prisoner asked me on several occasions whether I could make up packages of goods for him to dispose of for our benefit; any stuff I was working in the Colonial department he would be able to dispose of if I got it ready for him—I did not take any property from Butler's wharf—these overtures were made almost up to the time I left Butler's wharf—I think between 12 months and two years before I left Butler's Wharf I met the prisoner on the stairs; he showed me one or two sovereigns and asked me whether I should like them—I said they would do very well—he said "You can very soon earn them;" I said "What about the other side of the question?"—the subject then dropped—up to the time I left the service I gave him no answer to these overtures, nor did I act upon them in any way—after I had gone to St. John's Wharf the prisoner came over to the wharf on one occasion—it was about three miles from Butler's Wharf—he came about the time we were closing, and and it would be early in June, I should think—he was waiting for me outside the wharf—he asked me if I could spare a few minutes, and we walked down Wapping Wall together—he asked me what we were working on at St. John's Wharf—I told him we were doing coffee—he asked me if I would consent to make up some packages to get rid of from St. John's Wharf—I said "No"—I suppose we were together five minutes—the next time I saw him was in Bermondsey Street—my brother-in-law had gone to Croydon in a trap, and I went over there to meet him, when business was over—I walked along the road, and on the road I met the prisoner; it was some time before August—he asked me what we were working on, I told him we were still working on coffee, and he asked me whether I would consent to make up some packages—I then said to him, "Broughton, you have been a long time punching this into me; to what extent would you wish me to go in this matter? do you want to go to 1, 2, 3, 6 or 12 bags?" he said, "Use your own discretion, creep as you go," or "creep and go," I cannot exactly say; he asked me then whether I consented to do it, and I said"No;" he then said if I would do so he was going away in the course of two or three weeks, and if I arranged to do it we might both go away together—I think the subject dropped then—he came over to my house one Sunday after that; I was in the back garden and did not see him—he made four suggestions to me to rob St. John's Wharf—I stated at the police-court that he had made 30 to 40 suggestions to rob Butler's Wharf—I do not wish to correct that—on the 18th August my wife gave me this letter marked "A"—it is in the prisoner's handwriting—I then communicated with the manager of St. John's Wharf. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "18-8-80. Friend Sones,—As I have not seen you as promised, I thought of taking a week's holiday next week, and should like something to back it up with Let me know if there is any prospect this week.—Yours truly, W. B.")</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He first tempted me to rob soon after I joined the service at Butler's Wharf in 1885—I cannot give you any date in 1875 when he asked me to rob my masters—I refused to do so—I left Butler's Wharf in May this year—his suggestions continued through 1877, 1878,</p>

               <p>and 1879; I did not tell my master or the foreman of the firm—I was always unwilling, but still he kept on—we were friendly as regards business at the wharf—there were some sweepings sold at St. John's Wharf; I believe it was the custom to sell sweepings, and that they were properly sold—I never said to him when he suggested to me to rob St. John's Wharf that I had got some sweepings mat I was getting together, and that I could lot him have them—there was never any con<lb></lb>versation between us but once—the first time the sweepings were ever mentioned to me was when Mr. Lafone, of Butler's Wharf, took the prosecution up; he sent for me at St. John's Wharf, and the first person I met standing on the quay was the prisoner, and he asked me before I went up to Mr. Lafone whether I would say it was sweepings he wanted me to get from St. John's Wharf in answer to that letter—in June or July he came to St. John's Wharf one afternoon when Butler's Wharf closed early—he walked from St. John's Wharf to Wapping Station—there was nobody else with us—on 5th August I met him in Ber<lb></lb>mondsey Street; I did not say then that I had been putting together about a ton of coffee sweepings, and there would be about ten bags; I swear that; that note did not relate to such sweepings—from 1875 to 1880 I never mentioned these suggestions to my employers or anybody else in authority in the firm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not keep a diary, and I did not put down when these suggestions were made—I was not aware when he made those suggestions that he was making them to any one else; I thought I was the only person—Mr. Lafone entered the service at Butler's Wharf about two years ago I believe; since he has been there there have been no sales of sweepings; I think previous to that time a certain amount was sold.</p>

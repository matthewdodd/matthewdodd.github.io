On the evening of the 21st of October, between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner and his wife came to my shop, and looked at several shawls - they staid about twenty minutes - they selected one and said they would call again, but did not - I heard the next morning that there was a loss of some calico, and one of the witnesses brought it to my shop to see if he could find an owner for it. I had not seen it to my knowledge on the preceding evening, nor could I miss it, as we have a great number of the same description - it would be impossible for me to say it is mine. I did not know when it was taken.</p>

            . I am a draper, and live in Ratcliffe-highway. About eight o'clock on the evening of the 21st of October I went to the shop of Mr. Lord; he asked me if I knew the prisoner, I said I did; he said "How do you know him;" I replied "He and his wife came to our shop and asked to look at some calicoes; I asked what he had got in his basket - he said something that did not belong to me - I said "Let me see;" he said I should not - I said I would, and then I put my hand in, and pulled out a pair of stockings, with a ticket attached to them - I said I should insist upon seeing what he had further - he then took out a piece of calico wrapped up in a shawl - I said "Where did you get this?" he said "I bought it in the Commercial-road" - I asked him how much there was, and he said sixty yards.</p>

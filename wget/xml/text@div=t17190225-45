             Wine Cooper, Mr. Jordan telling them that by swearing in wrong Names they could not be found out or come into any Trouble; and on Monday Morning they went before Mr. Justice Tracy and swore the said Affidavit: And that he being Necessitous , and by Jordan's Solicitations, and giving him Money in all 8 Giuneas, he was prevailed upon to swear she said Affidavit, and that hearing they were detected, Jordons would have had them to appear in Westminster-Hall to justifie it, which he refused, and kept out of the way: and own'd that all that he had sworn in the Affidavit was false.</p>

             confirm'd what Wright had swore as to their meeting at the Half-Moon in Bell-Yard , and what pass'd since; and added that at Jordan's Request he did appear at Westminster to justifie what he had sworn; but the Court were pleased (as he said) very justly to commit him to the Fleet ; and said, that all the Money he had of Jordan at several times was about 32 s. and owned all his Affidavit was false. Mrs. Storman corroberated what Wright and Freeman had sworn, and declared that after Freeman was taken into Custody by the Tipstaff , Jordon applyed himself to her, and offered her a Guinea to make an Affidavit against Mr. Jones, and told her there was no more harm in it than in drinking a Glass of Rum which he was going to drink; and said he would carry her in a Coach privately to a Judges Chamber, and she should swear in a wrong Name, and after wards could not be discovered, which she refused.

In July or August the pri<lb></lb>soner came there, with a person whom she called her husband—they occa<lb></lb>sionally slept there—on 9th Nov. the prisoner came, and said her husband was gone to Bath on railway business, and she wanted lodgings till he came back—I let her a bedroom at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a night—she boarded with me and paid daily—she left on 10th Dec.—while she was in the house I took into her room sixteen yards of silk—I asked her if it was sufficient to make my two girls a frock—she said, "No"—I laid it on the bed, and said, "This must be a future consideration"—she appeared to be a dressmaker, and to be a highly respectable person—she made a clock for me and I said, "Take it into your room till I have an opportunity of taking it up stairs"—two days after that I told my sister to go and get my clock—she went up stair and called me—I went up and missed my husband's velvet waistcoat—I said, "My silk is gone, too I suppose"—the prisoner said, "No; I can be on my oath, I brought it in the bar on the next day afterwards; and to convince you, I laid it on the bar and it rolled down"—on 9th Dec., she said her husband was coming from Bath by the five o'clock train—she left me on the 10th, and did not return—on the 12th, I missed a gold watch and chain, from a drawer in my bedroom—I had seen it on the Sunday week before—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in my room when I put it away—a few days afterwards I missed five table-cloths, some shifts, and other things—on 4th Jan., Mr. Becket called at my house—my sister went with her, and she brought back the pri<lb></lb>soner—I said to her, "O, Mr. Davison, how could you act so to me, when I treated you so well at my house?"—she began crying and hoped I would forgive her—I said, "I have put it into my husband's hands, he may do as he likes"—he said, "Certainly not."</p>

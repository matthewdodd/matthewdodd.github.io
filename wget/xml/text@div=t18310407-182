            . I am a shopman to Mr. Attenboro, a pawnbroker, of Crown-street. On Saturday, the 12th of February, the prisoner came into our shop, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070090"></xptr>brought with him a pocket Bible and a Prayer-book; I asked whose they were; he said his own, and that he bought them at a bookseller's in Holborn, and had given 10s. 6d. for the Bible and 7s. for the Prayer-book, and he had bought them either five weeks or five months before; he mentioned one of these times at the shop, and the other at the office - he said his name was Sparkes, and he lived in Earl-street, Finsbury; I sent the boy to make inquiry, and then I heard an alarm; the boy had met the prisoner at the door, seized him by the collar, and brought him back - an officer was sent for, and took him; these are the books.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Was the boy who seized him the same boy you sent out to make inquiry? A. No; the prisoner had quitted the shop, and turned round the corner a short distance; he had got out of my sight - the boy was at that time at the door; we have boxes in which persons go to make pledges - these were other persons there; the prisoner offered to pawn from the first of the boxes - they are rather dark; I cannot be mistaken in his person - I did not see the prisoner stopped outside.</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody on the 12th of February - I asked him how he came in possession of these books; he said he had bought them of a strange man; I think he said five months ago - he described where he lived; I went there, and found he worked for Darton and Harvey, which was true.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you think he said five weeks? A. I cannot be sure.</p>

            . I live in Gracechurch-street, and am in partnership with Joseph Harvey - the prisoner was in our service for about eight years, and was so on the 12th of February. These books I believe to be ours - we have a binder named George Matthews; he binds books of this description - the value of the Bible is about 10s. 6d., and the Prayer-book 7s.; the prisoner bore a good character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he has given you money which he has found? A. Yes, and we have entrusted him to take money to the Stamp-office, under 50l.; we are generally in the habit of marking books when they come from the binder's, but they may lay for a day or two - there is a particular person who has the care of Bibles and Prayer-books; his name is Bowler - there are two others who take them in, but they are not here; the care of these books is left to one of these persons, or the whole of them- I very seldom mark the Bibles and Prayer-books; one of these three persons generally mark them with a private-mark, and also the retail mark - there is neither of the marks on these books.</p>

            . I live in Warwick-lane. I have examined these two books - I bound them for Messrs. Darton and Harvey; I know the Bible by the edition, which we do for no other firm - we do not do all the bindings in the same way; theirs is the only house for which we do that edition in this binding - I know my own work - I cannot say when the Bible was bound, but it is since Christmas; the Prayer-book has the prayer for the present King and Queen - that had not been bound five months on the 12th of February.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you will not undertake to swear it had not been bound five weeks? A. No; I have had no Bibles of this edition, (which is the Oxford common edition) to bind since Christmas; we have them by fifties at a time - this is the edition of 1829 - I perhaps did one hundred of this edition in the course of the last year; I send them to the prosecutor by a boy or a porter - the lettering part of this is remarkable, and the headband; we do not put any marks in the book - I was at the office when an examination of these books took place, but I did not hear the Magistrate desire them to be examined with a magnifying-glass - I was only there the two last days.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. DARTON. Q. Are there any books sold from your shop which have not the private-mark? A. A great many are, but Bibles and Prayer-books generally have it - I do not mark them myself, and would not affirm that my shopmen always do it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them in Holborn - I did not attempt to leave the shop; while the boy was gone I was necessitated to go to the door, but I did not move from the door, and the boy ran and seized me - I said I was not going away.</p>
               <p>G. J. MOULTON re-examined. The prisoner went away towards Sun-street - I had not missed him above a minute when he was brought back; I saw him at the next door - the lad who stopped him is not here.</p>
               <p>MR. MATTHEWS. I cannot be positive that I bound this Prayer-book for the prosecutor - we do them for other houses in the same way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor's shopman swore most positively that he did not believe they belonged to him, and that it was not possible I could get at them.</p>

            . I did not hear the shopman say before the Magistrate that he did not believe they were the property of the prosecutor - here is a faint mark on the Bible now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did not the shopman examine it with a magnifying-glass? A. Yes, and he said this was greatly like the mark, but he could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>MR. DARTON. This is the place where the mark should be, but it is not sufficiently legible for me to see whether it is the mark or not.</p>

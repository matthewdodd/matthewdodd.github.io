               <p>Did he say which man it was? - No, he did not mention whose name, nor any thing about it.</p>
               <p>After he told you this, he held up his apron, and you saw his shirt bloody, and the blood running down on the floor? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did he seem to speak it with concern or with triumph? - I am sure he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>In what manner did he speak it? - He did not speak it in an over harsh manner.</p>
               <p>In what manner did you understand him to speak it? - He spoke it mildly like.</p>
               <p>Did he express any concern for what he had done, or any thing of that sort? - No, no further, and upon saying that, he and the woman went out together.</p>
               <p>Did the woman say any thing? - I heard them say they would go to some doctor's, and they went to the doctor's afterwards, I followed him in the highway, and I took him by Mr. Bishop and Bayley's door, I knocked his heels up and caught hold of him, and I took him before Justice Green.</p>
               <p>What did he say when you laid hold of him? - As soon as ever I took hold of him, and threw him down on the stones, there was another man who assisted me, and took a knife out of his pocket; says he that is not the knife I killed the man with.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that was his expression? - Yes, them were his words.</p>
               <p>What sort of a knife was it that was taken out of his pocket? - A clasp knife, I took him before Justice Green, and they put him in the watch-house till the next day, there I left him.</p>

               <p>Did you examine whether the knife was bloody or not? - No, Sir, the knife was shut, it was not bloody at all.</p>
               <p>Did you see the deceased again that night? - Yes, I went back, and lent the man a hand to put him on a board to send him to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Did the deceased say any thing then? - I heard him say, who could have thought that the man I had been drinking with all the afternoon, and pawned all my things to treat him with, should have served me in this manner. I know nothing further.</p>
               <p>When did the man die? - He died on the seventh of November.</p>

               <p>Did you know him before? - A good while before, he is a shoemaker.</p>
               <p>Did you know him shew any signs of insanity before this? - Always in liquor, they always used to call him mad Clarke when he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>But not when sober? - No, I never heard any one call him mad then.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He sat down a little while, and still persisted he had killed a man, I asked him where, he told me at the Hoop and Bunch of Grapes; I asked him who, he told me Johnson, he said he saw his bitch, I believe, or something as bad as that, getting out of the window from the man, or the door, I cannot be positive which, I cannot be positive to the words, it was getting out of a window or a door, the one from the other, but I cannot be positive which; if it is where he mentioned, it must be a door, for the pavement is raised.</p>
               <p>How did you know what place he meant? - The house that Clarke used to live in.</p>
               <p>Who did you take him to mean by his bitch? - A woman that used to live with him.</p>
               <p>Do you know her name? - I cannot be positive to her name, she went by the name of Clarke, she lived with him a great many years, and had several children by him, at the same time my wife came in, she had been out with a pot of beer, and this man was walking by the door, says she, you scoundrel how can you say you have killed the man, and he is just gone by; so it put me out of all thoughts that he had killed any body.</p>
               <p>Is your wife here? - No, my Lord, it is rather hard for us both to be out from our business at once.</p>
               <p>Does your house lay between the Bunch of Grapes, and the King and Queen? - Yes, before you come to the King and Queen, between the one and the other.</p>
               <p>What did he say upon that when she said the man had walked past the door? - He went out directly, as soon as she said that, he took the knife out of the table, and went out.</p>
               <p>He took out the knife? - Yes, he struck it into a little wainscot table, and though the point of it is pretty sharp, it fell, he took it up and went away; I should have preserved the knife, if I had thought any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing upon the knife? - I had no thoughts of looking at it, nor did I think he had done any such thing.</p>
               <p>What sort of knife was it? - I was a very picked pointed one, with a short handle, it appeared to me to be a shoemaker's knife, they call it a welt knife.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner locked up; just before he came to the watch-house, I asked the prisoner what he had been doing, he told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100018"></xptr> he had cut a man across the belly; I asked him how he could be guilty of such a thing, he told me it was through passion and liquor, and that after he had cut him he went to a couple of surgeons to get them to dress him, and that he hoped to God the man would not die.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is the surgeon? - He left a card of his place of abode where he might be sent for, Mr. Seaman, No. 33, Thread-needle-street.</p>
               <p>(The Surgeon sent for.)</p>
               <p>Court to Marshall. Did you see the wound? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What appearance had it; what sort of a wound was it? - It was about an inch long.</p>
               <p>Where about was it? - The right side of the navel, just under the navel.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing particular about it? - I did not observe any thing particular, but I saw a part of the caul of the belly hanging out of the wound.</p>
               <p>A part of the caul? - Yes, a good part of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Goodman. What state of health was Johnson in before he received the wound? - He had no disorder at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, if you think there is sufficient evidence before you now, that the wound which this man received in his belly was the cause of his death, in that case, if you are satisfied with the evidence now before you of that fact, it may not be necessary to wait for the surgeon, for it certainly is not necessary in point of law that that fact should be proved by a surgeon; there may be cases where a surgeon could not be had.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish to wait for the surgeon, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot be too cautious in such cases, but it is not in point of law necessary that it should be proved by a surgeon.</p>
               <p>(The Surgeon sent for, but was not at home, he was gone to the other end of the town; the Court ordered his recognizance to be estreated, but it was afterwards discharged on the application of the Surgeon.)</p>
               <p>Court to Goodman. You say this man was in a good state of health before he received this wound? - As good a state of health as any person in the world.</p>
               <p>Did you see his wound? - No, I could not bear to see it; I went to see him in the hospital three times.</p>
               <p>Was you with him at the time of his death? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Court to Marshall. You knew this man before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he in good health? - Yes, in perfect health.</p>
               <p>No disorder that appeared to have indangered his life? - No, I believe by the stab he got his death.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say any farther than I knew nothing of stabbing him, there was nobody but the woman; I have nobody to my character; my master that I have worked for this twenty years did not expect I should be tried till to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, I will state to you what the witnesses have said, with such observations as it is my duty to suggest to you. (Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and then added as follows:) The declarations of the deceased after receiving the death-wound are always considered as admissible evidence in cases of murder, through nothing before that wound is considered in that light. The result of the evidence seems to be this; that this man, as appears from some of his expressions, from some conceived jealously, the cause of which does not appear in evidence, or whether it existed at all further then in his own mind, went with a determined purpose, with this weapon with him, in search of the deceased Johnson, and him, called him out of the house where he was, and instantly stabbed him in the belly: it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100019"></xptr> appears also, that they had been drinking together a considerable part of the day, and there is reason to suppose the prisoner was in liquor; and he himself said to Eloy that it was through passion and liquor. Sayer describes his conduct, when he came into his house, as appearing to him in the light of a madman; that led me to enquire whether the prisoner had shewn any signs of madness, and the witness said, only when he was in liquor on former occasions, and then he was called Mad Clarke.</p>
               <p>In the first place, Gentlemen, it is my duty to state to you the law upon the subject. The killing a man deliberately, and with premeditated malice, is clearly and unquestionably murder, and is the legal definition of that crime; the killing a man at all in consequence of an intention to hurt or injure him, is in law an high offence; but where death ensues from a sudden quarrel, or the wound which occasions the death is given in consequence of a sudden provocation at the instant, the law makes that allowance for the impetuosity of passion, and the frailty of human nature, to reduce the crime to manslaughter; but it is necessary that the provocation should be sudden, and proportioned in some degree to the violence of the party who kills; for a greater degree of provocation, provided it is sudden and instantaneous, will reduce to manslaughter, when the same degree of provocation would not justify the use of a deadly weapon, even though it was done on the instant: and the law has held it so strict, as to consider that nothing but personal violence will mitigate the offence of using a deadly weapon, however sudden the occasion may be; no words, however provoking, can reduce the offence to manslaughter.</p>
               <p>In this case there is no proof of any actual provocation given by the deceased at all; there is no evidence, except from the declarations of the prisoner, that tends to shew that he had conceived some kind of jealousy with respect to the deceased and a woman who lived with him; now that jealousy would not be a sufficient cause, even if the cause of it had been proved to exist, in point of law to reduce that offence of killing a man to manslaughter; but independent of that, no such case is in proof to have at all existed: it is in proof to you that this man, before he gave the wound which is supposed to have occasioned the death of the deceased, declared to a witness that it was for the purpose of killing him; that declaration being accompanied by the other I stated to you, if you take the one you must take the other, it is for that reason alone that I selected those expressions of the prisoner that imported jealousy, for he declares expressly his purpose to kill the deceased; he goes in search of him with that deadly weapon, he finds him in a house where it is proved the deceased had been ten minutes before, he strikes him a blow, calls him out, and the wound must then have been instantly given; the deceased afterwards declared he had received his death wound from the prisoner, and the prisoner makes the same declaration in a manner very extraordinary: I therefore am of opinion, that no provocation is proved in this case to have existed, that can reduce the offence from murder to manslaughter.</p>
               <p>The next consideration is, whether you can upon this evidence, find any other excuse that will reduce the crime of the prisoner. If the prisoner had been a man, really disordered in his senses, from natural and unavoidable infirmity, that act which would amount to murder in another man, would certainly not have amounted to that in him, because such a man is not considered as knowing what he does, and the consequence of his actions; but there is no pretence in this case for that sort of defence; for all the madness that is imputed to the prisoner, is the madness arising from liquor; and independent of the consideration, that such a madness is far from being an excuse for the commission of any atrocious crime; and it would be a great hurt to society, if such excuses were ever admitted; but independent of those expressions, he appears to have known what he was doing, both before he did it and afterwards; he declares, even after he had seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100020"></xptr> the deadly wound (which one would have thought, would have made the strongest degree of resentment relent) he declared that that, he did it on purpose, and with intention to kill the man: therefore he clearly appears, even with that drunkenness, which in itself would not be an excuse, he appears yet to know what he was about to do, and what had done. It is there four for you to consider gentleman, first whether, you are clearly the satisfied with the truth of the evidence, and the result of the whole evidence taken together, the prisoner is the man the deceased that wound; and next wether you are satisfied that that wound was the cause of the man's death, for however criminal the conduct of the prisoner may have been, yet unless you are satisfied clearly from the evidence, that he was the actual occasion of the man's death, he is not guilty of murder; and with respect to that part of the case, to be sure the evidence is left less compleat and perfect than it sometimes is in other cases, from the absence of the surgeon who had examined the deceased, and dressed his wound and attended him; for that evidence would have put it out of all doubt. It is not however necessary, at all, in point of law, that that fact should be proved by the evidence of a surgeon particularly, provided it is proved without such evidence; but it is fair to make also this observation, that though it is clear that the presence of a surgeon is not necessary, yet where a surgeon has examined the wound, his evidence in that case is the best and most satisfactory that can be had, and where he is absent, a less degree of evidence appears before a Jury, than would be before them if that surgeon was examined. Subject, therefore, to that observation, gentlemen, you will consider the evidence as it stands; this man is in health, he receives his death wound, he, himself, declares his own idea of it, that it will be mortal; that wound is described as a wound in the belly, near the navel, a very dangerous place, where all the intestines are exposed to injury from the wound; and a part of the caul of the intestines is described as hanging out of the wounds; under these circumstances he is carried to the hospital between nine and ten in night, and on the morning of the seventh he dies; the witness who saw the wound who is not a man of skill or judgement, he has no doubt but the wound was the cause of his death; is therefore remains under the circumstances I have stated to you upon the description of the wound, the place in which it was given, the wound of giving it, the state of health of the man before, and the time he died: If from all these circumstances you are clearly satisfied that the wound was the cause of his death, and are also clearly satisfied with the truth of the rest of the evidence, and that the result of that evidence is proved clearly to your satisfaction, that the prisoner is the man that gave the wound, I am then obliged to tell you that I am of opinion there is nothing in this case that can reduce the crime below that aggravated crime of murder: and it will in that case be your duty to find the prisoner guilty of this indictment: If on the other hand you think there is any room to doubt the truth of the evidence, or that believing the truth of the evidence is not sufficient proof that the prisoner gave the wound, or that the wound was the cause of his death; in that case it is your duty to acquit the prisoner wholly; or if there appears any circumstances that would reduce the crime to manslaughter, in that case you may find that verdict; but there does not appear to me any sort of evidence to take that middle line: Therefore, give your verdict according to your own consciences, you must be clearly satisfied of the fact of a crime so heinous in its nature, and so penal in its consequences, and then it is your duty to the public and to justices, to find the prisoner guilty. If on the other you think there is any reasonable cause for doubt, either upon the fact of his warning the man, or of the wound being the cause of his death, you will acquit him.</p>

            , you have been convicted upon the clearest and most satisfactory evidence, by a Jury as much inclined to mercy as any I have met with, of a crime, one of the most heinous, both in sight of God and man, that can be committed by the most wicked of mankind. The act of wilfully depriving a fellow creature of life, is a crime, which in all civilized nations has been justly punished with death, the law of God as well as man, decrees, that whoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed; you have been unfortunately a prey to those violent and outrageous passions of malice and revenge, which have led you to perpetrate this horrid crime; when I say you have been a prey to violent and outrageous passions, I do not mean those infirmities of nature, for which the laws of man, and I hope of the Almighty also, will make some allowance; but you have been a prey to those dark and malignant passions, which have led you deliberately to seek the life of your fellow citizen, and that fellow citizen your acquaintance and your friend, with whom you had spent the day in harmony and sociality! Guilt so aggravated, can have no hope to escape the punishment of the laws: I hope therefore, that the impression made upon you by the dreadful sentence which you must now receive, will so operate on your mind as to correct that malignant temper, which has rendered you unfit to continue a member of society here, and so to correct it as to entitle you to that mercy hereafter, which is infinitely more important for you to obtain, and that the short period of time which you have now to live, will be spent more in regretting and lamenting that crime, than even the miserable consequences that must follow upon it; I hope the remorse of your own conscience will be such as to make the only atonement that is left you in this life, and such as to obtain mercy for you at the throne of him whose mercy is infinite. It therefore only remains for me to fulfil my duty, and pronounce upon you the dreadful sentence of the law; which is, that you be <rs id="t17831210-4-punish29" type="punishmentDescription">

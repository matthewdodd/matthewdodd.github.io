               <p>Q. Did you see the soldier before he knocked you down, or did he take you by surprise - A. He took and led me by the arm into this by-place, as I suppose; I do not know how long he was with me.</p>

            . I am a lamp-lighter. On Wednesday in the afternoon about a quarter before five, I was crossing down Strand-lane, I saw the prisoner leading the prosecutor. I passed him about thirty yards. I heard the cry of stop-thief. I ran up the lane again. I saw the prosecutor lying on the ground; I picked him up, and he being intoxicated in liquor, I put him against a house. He said he was robbed of his watch; the soldier was gone. I pursued the soldier across the Strand into Windsor-court; when I came there he had been down stairs, and came up again into the passage of the house, No. 6, Windsor-court.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were pursuing him, was he out of your sight at all - A. He was; I am certain he is the same man, I took notice of him as he was leading the man down the lane. The officer searched him; he found nothing; another officer came, he told him that he had secreted the watch in the dust-hole, he went and got it. I went down stairs and saw the watch found; the prisoner was taken to Bow-street.</p>

            . I am one of the Bow-street patroles. I was sent for. I went to Windsor-court. I re-searched the prisoner, he shewed me where the watch was in a dust-hole, at No. 6, Windsor-court. I have had the watch in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS. I am a chimney-sweeper, I live in Strand-lane. I saw the soldier rise from the prosecutor as he was lying down, out of my window, it is right fronting where he got up from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner got any thing with him. - A. Not as I saw. When I saw him rise he ran away and I ran after him, by a woman saying he had robbed him of his watch. I seized him as he was coming out of No. 6, Windsor-court. I held him until Read the officer came up; I then gave him into the charge of Read. I charged him with stealing the watch, he denied it, the officer searched him and found nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you afterwards to find the watch. - A. Some person or other said, you had better tell and you shall go about your business. He took Limbrick the officer, and shewed him where the watch was.</p>
               <p>Jury. He did not acknowledge that he knocked the man down. - A. No.</p>

Yes, I was informed by Davis, that a man was knocked down, and his watch was taken away; Davis had got him in custody; I searched him and found nothing; about a minute afterwards he owned where it was to Limbrick; he went to the dust hole, and raked the watch out with his hands.</p>

Between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner was brought in custody for having offered the articles for sale. We had not missed them. The prisoner was my errand-boy. The goods were in our shop. Our stock is large. All I know the boy was stopped, and the property is ours.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. The prisoner came to my shop in Russell-court, Drury-lane, and offered the articles for sale; he said his father had ran away, and left his mother in distress; I said, what is your father; he said, a tailor. I said, very likely, if your mother comes, I shall agree with her; he said she was sick a-bed. I said I will go with you to your mother He wanted to get away; I said, no, I will go with you to your mother. He took me to a coal-shed; he said it was not there, it was at some other place. The prisoner then ran away. I called after him; he was taken. He throwed away the property. The watchman laid hold of him. The prisoner then told me he lived at Mr. Gibbons's. I went with him there. He then said he lived with Mr. Croft; I then said, I should go with him there. I did. This is the property.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The articles are ours; they cost us more than less than what they are valued in the indictment. They are articles of a superior description.</p>

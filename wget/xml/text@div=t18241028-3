            . I am a saddler, and live at No. 222, High Holborn. Messrs. Reid and Co's. shop is right opposite mine. On the 9th of October, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning. I was in my shop, and saw the prisoner with his hand through a pane of glass, and moving something in their window. I crossed the road, took hold of him, and took him to the door, which I found fast - one of the young men opened it. I asked the prisoner what he was about - he said he was doing nothing. I asked what he was doing with the piece of silk handkerchiefs which I saw him moving; he said I was mistaken; he was doing nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where was you - A. Standing in my door-way, with the door open. I saw nobody else near him. He did not move from the spot till I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you crossed the road did not you look back to see if there were any carriages, for fear of being run over - A. No.</p>

I found a square of glass broken, a piece of handkerchiefs entirely gone, and another piece moved from its place. I had placed them in the window twenty minutes before - the glass was then safe. They are Bandana handkerchiefs - the piece which is gone cost me 65 s., and the other 38 s. I had put six pieces in the window; five were left - one of which was moved, and one was quite gone. The piece removed was tumbled about, and laid five or six inches from the broken pane. The hole was large enough to admit a man's arm. There were other persons in the house beside me; it is our joint dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are you sure your shopmen had sold none of the handkerchiefs - A. I am; no customer had been in.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of going out every morning to look for work. I was coming by this shop, and saw a boy about my size going away - I had not been there half a minute before a gentleman came and took me. I hope you will consider that this is in a wide part of the street, where carriages are passing, which is very deceiving to the eye. If you consider that there is sufficient evidence to find me guilty, do so. No doubt the gentleman lost sight of the lad as he crossed.</p>

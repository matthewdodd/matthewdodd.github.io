                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Stanmore. On 14th July, about a quarter past 10 o'clock in the evening, I was at the Abercon Arms, Stanmore, and saw the prisoner there with three more, who were kicking up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at Mrs. Sedrick's door—it was something about half a quartern loaf—she keeps a sweet shop, and sells bread as well—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner go to strike Mrs. Sedrick—one of the four struck her, but I cannot say what sort of a blow, because it was dark, but it was a sort of a push—they were men—I went and pushed three out of the four down, and the pri<lb></lb>soner was one—they then all four went away forty or fifty yards, and the prisoner turned back, and said that he would fight me—I said, "Very well, I will"—as he was coming towards me I saw a knife in his hand—I said, "He has got a knife in his hand"—I was standing ready for him, and was laughing—I was sideways to him, turning away from him, and he struck me on the left thigh—I bled a great deal, and it was fourteen days before it healed—I walked lame for fourteen days.</p>

                  </hi>. On 14th July, about 10 o'clock, I had gone up to bed, and saw the prisoner and three other men near my house—I heard them say that they would break my b—door open—I went down stairs to stop them, and when they came to the door I opened it, and told them that if they did not take care what they were about I would call a policeman—it was not about a loaf, Clark did not hear the beginning of it—one of them struck at me, the prisoner used a great deal of abusive language, and they said that they would break the door open—I do not know whether they wanted to be served—I am not unpopular with them, I never saw them before, they are not inhabitants of the town, but are quite strangers—when I went down one of them struck at me, but he did not hit me—I drew back, opened the door and pushed him away on the kerb stone—two men then came up to me, and Clark said, "You shall not hit this woman, she is all alone, and I will see her protected"—he pushed them away rather hard, they fell, and I saw no more of it—I did not shut my door, because I thought if a police<lb></lb>man came, I would give them in charge—directly afterwards I saw Clark brought back wounded; he showed his wound in my shop—the prisoner did persuade the others to come away, and not kick up a row; and he pulled them away once before Clark came up—they were all strangers to me—it was haymaking time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nine years old; I live with my parents in Maiden-lane, King's-cross. On Wednesday, 25th Oct., I was going down Caledonian-street, to buy my brother an apple—the prisoner spoke to me—he asked me to go to the sweetstuff shop round the corner, and fetch a pennyworth of white peppermint—he promised to give me a halfpenny for fetching it—he gave me a shilling to pay for it—I went to the sweetstuff shop round the corner; I gave that shilling to the person in the shop—that person gave me the peppermint, and I went back to look for the prisoner—I did not see him at first—I saw him in two or three minutes, when I crossed the road—he took the sweetstuff from me, and he asked me where was the change—I told him I had no change—while I was speaking to him the gentleman who served me the sweetstuff came up, and he laid hold of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Charles Morris and Co., cigar manufacturers, in Half-moon-alley, Whitechapel—the manufactory was broken open on 1st February, and sixteen or seventeen cwt. of cigars were stolen—I went to the Raglan Music Hall, the prisoner is the proprietor—I went there first on the 23d March; I purchased three cigars and paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—I recognized them as Messrs. Morris's—the cost price of one of them was 2 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., another 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and another 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for them—two of them were British and one was foreign—I did not say anything to the prisoner at the time—I went again on 24th March, I saw the prisoner; I asked for a cigar—he brought me one—he said, "They are very good—only"—I said, "broken"—I have that cigar with me, this is it—the cost price of that was 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I paid 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—it was a British cigar—I went again on 3d April and bought two more cigars similar to those I bought before—I went again on 4th April in company with Smith, the officer—we had a search warrant—we searched the premises and found thirty-nine lbs. of cigars—they were not then in the state they are now—they were several sorts, but mixed together—they were cigars varying from 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound to 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—our cigars never went out in that intermixed condition to my know<lb></lb>ledge—these are them; I recognize them as Messrs. Morris's cigars—I particularly recognize these eight bundles, as being made from a new quality of Havannah tobacco—these were the first that were made from it—some of these I had made up on the night previous to the robbery, and put this ribbon round them on the night previous to the robbery—this ribbon was brought in previous to the robbery, and the first time of using it I put it round these cigars—we had thirty-four lbs. of that kind, and they were all gone—when I saw these cigars at the prisoner's bar, some were in a case, but the principal part were in two boxes on the floor—they were intermixed, but have all been sorted—some are worth 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., some 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., some 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., some 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., some 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., some 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and some 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told the prisoner they were our cigars, he said, "Had I known you had been coming I would have cut my throat."</p>

Morris is a large establishment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they manufacture in the course of a year hundreds and thousands of pounds of cigars—they were manufactured on the premises, employed for the purpose of manufacturing, and a large number of men are employed—all these cigars are Messrs. Morris's, but one lot, about a hundred cigars, they are not Mr. Morris's, but they were mixed up with the others—I can't tell whether these cigars were only a small part of the cargo of cigars—these particular cigars are not made in the Havannah for us and nobody else; but there is a quality about them that we can generally tell—I could not identify any bundle of the cigars as having been in our establishment, only that they are the same kind—one part of the cigars made on our establish<lb></lb>

April I paid 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for; that was the value of them at cost price—the cigars I bought on the first and second occasions were not from the prisoner personally, but he was in the room—he used to go round with a box of cigars—I had never been there before—there were lots of people in the room—there is singing and concerts there, and persons sit there and smoke and drink—when I said to him, "These are our cigars," the officer Smith was with me—we were all together—Smith was in plain clothes; he first spoke to him; he told him he was an officer—I did not go in with him, I went in afterwards—he said, "If I had known that you had been coming, I would have cut my throat"—his words were not, "If I had known it"—but H If I had known that you had been coming."</p>

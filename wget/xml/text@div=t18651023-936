                  </hi>. I am accountant in Mr. Holloway'a establishment in the Strand—Spooner was a cashier on probation—his duties were to keep the cash-book, make all the entries in the cash-book, and balance his cash-book</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186510230017"></xptr>
               <p>every night—amongst other duties he had to take cash from the cash box for the purpose of purchasing stamps, and to enter the amount so taken in the cash-book—there is a book called the cashier's postage-book—this is it—it is kept by the cashier—he should debit himself in this book with the amount expended on postage stamps, and credit himself with the amount of stamps given out to the different clerks—each person receiving stamps would initial the entry representing the value of the stamps given out to him—this book is in Utton's writing—he was a clerk in my department—he has written this to assist the cashier—it was Utton's duty to keep the private ledger, which is made up principally from the cash-book—the entries there representing cash entries should generally represent the cash-book—on 16th January, there is an entry in the cash-book of "Foreign postage stamps, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>"—that is Spooner's writing—in the cashier's postage book of the same date the entry is, "Stamps, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." in Utton's writing—from the fact of only 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. being found in that book Spooner would not be called upon to account for the difference between the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would only have to account for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in the private ledger of the same date the entry is, "Postage stamps, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the private ledger contains an account of the expenditure of the establishment—it represents the whole trade dealings, and amongst other things the postage account—there has been an erasure in the pounds' column in that entry—the private ledger ought to correspond with the cash-book; there should have been an entry there of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that book is called over about once a week against the cash-book—I call over the cash-book, and Utton would take the private ledger—I do not look to see that the entries correspond, I only call out the amount—there is a tick at the side of the entry—I have no doubt—that is Utton's tick—my tick is in the cash-book—on 26th January I find an entry made by Spooner of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for stamps—there is no item entered in the cashier's postage-book—in the absence of any entry Spooner would not be called upon to account for that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is not entered in his book; it is not entered at all in the private ledger—I called over that entry from the cash-book to Utton; there is my tick against it—in the cash-book, folio 486, I find a reference in the hand-writing of Utton to folio 490—that would indicate that this item of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been posted and ticked—I am referring to the cash-book now; it stands 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the cash-book—Utton does not write in the cash-book—the entry is posted by Utton, but the cash is credited by the cashier—the folio 490 is in Utton's handwriting—that would indicate that the item had been posted into the private ledger; that is where it ought to have been—on February 15th, folio 591, the entry is, "Postage stamps, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—there is no entry whatever in the cashier's postage-book—in the private ledger there, is, "Stamps, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—there is no erasure—that must have been an absolutely incorrect entry from the commencement.</p>

               <p>always necessarily consumed—the cashier's postage-book is kept in Spooner's own possession—he was supposed to have kept it, though he did not—on the 16th January the stamps given out were only 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the only entry we have that day—that entry is made by a person named Besley—there are, I should think, four persons to whom stamps would be distributed in the course of business—some days as much as 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of stamps are issued—I should not think so much as 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is expended in stamps in one day, nor as much as 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the cash account is examined every night—Spooner would take the money from the cash-box—he receives all the money that comes in during the day—when I am there I collect the money at night—the cash is balanced every night—all the receipts for the day are entered and all the payments out—we add up those at night, and are able to say whether the money in the cash-book corresponds—the postage stamps are entered in the cash-book—all the cheques that come in during the day are entered to the debit of the cash—we have no means of knowing the gross sum in the cash-book, except by adding the cash-book up and showing what the balance ought to be—the cash-book shows each separate sum received on each day—when the cashier calls me to take his cash the balance is already prepared, I look over and see the receipts and payments, a balance is struck, and I count the money up—I can see the exact sum which he states to have given for stamps, every night if I look every item down—sometimes there are three or four pages, and I am not supposed to look at every item—he credits himself with what he has received, and debits himself with what he has paid, and the difference between these two ought to be in the cash<lb></lb>box—there are numerous entries with which he credits himself besides stamps—I have not the opportunity of seeing whether the credits which he places to his account every night are correct or not, not that same night—I had an opportunity of doing so by going over the entries in the different books—I do not know that I have done so.</p>

Was Utton in your department? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was—he was in the service eighteen months or two years—my duty was to superintend the business of the house generally, and to see that the books were properly kept—Utton kept the private ledger; several other persons wrote in it, not so many as five or six; a clerk named Hawkins wrote in it—I think Sell in wrote in it sometimes—I do not think Rowton did—Hodges and Hyde wrote in it—I have not said it was Utton'8 duty to keep the cashier's postage-book—the cashier was supposed to have kept that himself—Utton alone assisted him—no other person assisted him—there is no writing of any other person besides Utton on the debit side of the book—every person that takes stamps has to give his initials—Spooner kept the book locked up in his own desk—I could not tell how many books Utton kept; he had a great many to keep—he had other duties to perform besides—he used sometimes to act as secretary to Mr. Holloway, to go up to write letters for him—the column in which the erasure occurs is added up—the addition has been subsequent to the erasure—we make out a half-yearly balance sheet—the half-yearly balance sheet for June is not completed; it is in course of preparation—I believe the firm has em<lb></lb>ployed a professional accountant for the purpose of going through the books—I generally manage to get the checking of the cash-book done, so that it was all completed once a week—it did not frequently happen that the cash<lb></lb>book was not checked for five or six weeks—there might be an odd entry or two unchecked, but I made it a rule to get it all checked up—one of the Mr. Holloways is generally superintending the business—he used to have the cash-book up every day to look at.</p>

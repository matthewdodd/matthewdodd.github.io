             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Newmarket-street, May-fair, upon what I have: on the 8th of January I was robbed of a band-box, containing the several things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) the box had a lock and key upon it; it was in a public house, the prisoner and another man took it from me between three and four in the afternoon; I was going to a place, in Covent-garden, I don't know what street; we were in the parlour backwards.</p>
               <p>Was you acquainted with the prisoner? - No; I never saw him but once before, he came to my apartments and said he was sent by the other man; the other man and I went into the parlour together; he told me his name was Fletcher, but the prisoner told me his name was Davis.</p>
               <p>Was Fletcher your acquaintance? - No; some time before I met him in the street, he called me by my name, and asked me where I was going, and if I did not know him in the country? I said I knew nothing of him; he said he would go home with me, and said he was a linen-draper in York-street, Covent-garden; he came to me afterwards to my place, and asked me if I had received any linen; he said he had sent me a great quantity by a porter, and as I had not received the linen, he must take up the porter, but he could not do it without I paid him some money first; and upon that I gave him five guineas; he came to me afterwards, and asked me to go and live servant with his sister-in-law; I agreed to go, and took my band-box and things with me, and went with him; I thought to go to the place, and he took me into a public house, and called for six-penny worth of brandy and water, and the prisoner came in; I put the band-box on a table in the parlour of the public house; they called each other out, and spoke to one another at the door; I said I did not chuse to be so late at my place, and told the other man I would not stop; that was between three and four in the afternoon; I sat about a quarter of an hour, then I looked behind me on the table, and my box was gone.</p>
               <p>Were they both in the room? - Yes, they were both together.</p>
               <p>Did you see your band-box in the room<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220046"></xptr> after they went out and talked together? - No, I did not look.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay out talking? - I saw no more of them; I don't know when the box was taken away, nor by which of them; I called the maid, and asked her if they were gone; she said she did not know; I asked the master, and he said they paid for the six-penny worth of brandy and water, and ran fast down the yard.</p>
               <p>You never saw the prisoner before; are you sure he is the man? - Yes; two or three days before he was taken, he came into the house where I was to take possession of some goods; I said I thought I knew him, and asked him if his name was not Blackett? he said it was; I had heard his name mentioned when they were together; the other man called him Blackett; and then I asked him where the other was? he said if I would give him a bottle of wine, or some money, he would tell me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I live upon what I have, I had 3000 l. left me.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to any body about this trial yesterday? - Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Did you say if this man would give you five guineas you would not appear against him? - I said no such thing; I said if the person would come and pay me half my money and half my expences, the bill might be thrown out; and he said he would put me in a way of doing it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was put in possession of the house where this lady was a lodger, I was there four days and nights, and we breakfasted, dined, and supped together, and nothing was said about it.</p>
               <p>He called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

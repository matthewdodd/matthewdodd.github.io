               <p>Mr. Morgan, Prisoner's Counsel. My Lord, I submit if this witness is the least interested, in a capital case you will not suffer him to be examined; he is the person supposed to have signed a receipt, and he is supposed to act under the authority of his brother.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose they have given a release.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. It is not the prosecutor simply that can release him; he says, I have received only five pounds, very likely you my brother may have received fifty pounds, and there may be a fraud in this, you may have inserted the fty after you have written the word five: my client cannot prove that the brother of the prosecutor had an authority to receive the money, but giving credit to the assertion of the said Joseph, because he was the brother, he pays into his hands, as the brother of the prosecutor: my client says, my payment to you is not a payment to your brother without an authority: the money is the prisoner's, and he is accountable to him for forty-five pounds; I therefore say, none but the prisoner can release

               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Counsel for Prosecution. He pays him as and for his brother, that is an accountable receipt.</p>
               <p>Court. The objection shortly is this, I may make the payment to a stranger for your use, that does not bar your action against me; it is evidence against Joseph that he has had the money, and an action for money had and received would lay against him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Then Mr. Morgan's objection comes too soon, the question will be whether this money was not paid to the brother knowing that Joseph was a clerk in the house; though they act as clerks, they do not act for their own benefit.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260156"></xptr>Court. Can you prove by Samuel that he gave him authority: or if they will give you that proof now by the evidence of Samuel, and bar the act of Samuel: however any thing that will bar the act of Samuel will do as well as a release.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. I suppose 50 l. was paid to Joseph, and that he paid but five pounds to his brother, and I say the prisoner has a right against Joseph for 45 l.</p>
               <p>Court. Samuel's evidence will operate as a bar to any claim from Samuel upon you; I am of opinion, if Samuel will swear that he gave an authority to Joseph, it will be sufficient: but there is another difficulty that occurs, and I will hear you upon it; Samuel at present stands disinterested, because he is entitled to receive the money, if he has not already received it, either from Joseph or the prisoner, but he has released Joseph, therefore, unless the prisoner is convicted, he loses his money, and therefore he certainly is not competent, for if the man is acquitted, he loses the whole of his money.</p>

               <p>Did you empower your brother to wait on the prisoner to receive any money? - Yes, Sir, I did, I sent a letter, dated the 22d of March, pressing the prisoner to send what money he could spare, he was then indebted 56 l. 15 s. and that the receipt of my brother would be acknowledged as a discharge for what he could spare; on the first of May I called on the prisoner, I did not see him immediately on my coming in, I first saw his wife, and asked if he was not in the way, she said he was, and would come into the parlour presently; after some conversation with her, he came in, I soon said to him, Mr. Tissington, you have not had things as usual from me, and not given me orders a long while; he said, it is very true, I buy cheaper elsew here; I said that he should have paid me something more of so large a balance, or that he should have cleared his account; he replied, I fancy you have received a pretty load of cash by your brother; I asked him what he meant by a pretty load, he said fifty pounds; I told him it was impossible, he had only paid five pounds; after some altercation I asked him for the receipt, which on looking at, I found it was altered. He declared he had paid the money, and if my brother had spent the money, he must account for it; I had not, I told him, that from my brother, and if he had received it, he should account for it.</p>
               <p>The receipt read (as in the indictment) and shewn to the Court and Jury, having the word fifty altered , and a cypher added to the figure of five.</p>
               <p>Acton. I endeavoured to persuade him to confess the alteration, as it was to me clear that he had done it; he persisted that it was the receipt; I told him if argument was in vain, I should take the receipt, but he was at liberty to call in any body, but he did not, I took away the receipt; that is the receipt, it has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Morgan.</p>
               <p>You and I once had some conversation on this business before? - I had no conversation with you.</p>
               <p>You and I have? - That conversation was not directed to me.</p>
               <p>Then we will have a little now; when the receipt was put into your hands, what did you say? - He said it was a pretty load, it was fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>He lent you that voluntarily? - He did.</p>
               <p>He gave it into your hands voluntarily? - He did.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was not you in the first place very angry with him, because he had left you, and did not deal with you any longer? - I was not angry.</p>
               <p>Recollect did you or did you not object to the receipt being a valid one because it was not upon stamp? - I did not object to that.</p>
               <p>You did not make that objection? - I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260157"></xptr>I again ask you upon your oath if you did not make that objection? - I did not.</p>
               <p>No such objection? - No such objection.</p>
               <p>What else passed between you? - I will give it over again.</p>
               <p>If you please. - When he produced the receipt, it was very evident to me that it was an altered one, and as such it surprised me, when I had received but five pounds; I told him that he had altered it, I put it into my pocket, he said I had no right, I told him I had a right, as it appeared to me to be an altered receipt, and unless he would confess it, I should keep it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did not he ask you if you wanted to rob him as you had robbed the orphan? - He did not.</p>
               <p>No such words? - I do not know who you mean by the orphan.</p>
               <p>I judge that he alluded to Mr. Warburton's son; there were two executors appointed by the old man's will, and you got yourself in afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Are you going into this history.</p>
               <p>Court. He has a right to discredit the witness by any question, the answer to which does not tend to criminate himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Warburton had made a will, and appointed two executors, and executed that will sometime before you was executor? - He had.</p>
               <p>Was not Warburton ill, and at the point of death, when you was made executor? - He was.</p>
               <p>You attended there on the occasion, did not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you take an attorney that had never done business for Warburton? was not Mr. Gabell the constant attorney for Mr. Warburton? - He was not.</p>

               <p>Did not he prepare the will? - He did not make it in it's first original.</p>
               <p>Who did prepare the will? - A Mr. Eames.</p>
               <p>And Mr. Pritchard and Mr. Taylor were appointed executors? - They were.</p>
               <p>You had a Mr. Stanway with you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had he before done business for Warburton? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did Warburton live after you was made executor? - I believe a week.</p>
               <p>Why, did he live twenty-four hours after? - Yes, he attempted to write his name to the codicil, as he used to do, he did not write it on account of his il ness, but he said that would do; I took his business.</p>
               <p>For which business you was to have given 800 l.? - No such thing, I was to give him whatever it might amount to by fair appraisement, it amounted to between 8 and 900 l.</p>
               <p>Did you or not give a bond for that money? - No, not for the whole money that that amounted to.</p>
               <p>Did you give a bond for any money to Mr. Warburton? - Not at the time of this being executed; there was a bond given, but Mr. Warburton did not accept it as was intended at the time; Mr. Warburton had no bond from me after I entered into the business.</p>

               <p>Then he never had any bond? - He had not but what he returned me as soon as he saw it; he did not accept it; I took the stock at a fair appraisement.</p>
               <p>And he returned you the bond before you took it? - He had the money paid him.</p>
               <p>Who went first into the room of the deceased after his death, you or the two other executors? - I did not go into the room with the executors at all, I went there as soon as I received intelligence of his death, not into his room where his chest and papers were kept, I went into a common sitting parlour.</p>
               <p>Did not you go into a room where the old gentleman had been? - I did not, none but a public room.</p>
               <p>Did not you go with two executors; - Not till he was buried, I met the executors there at the time I went, I was not there before the executors.</p>
               <p>Is not there a bill in equity now depending against you, calling upon you about this bond I have been enquiring of, by the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260158"></xptr> two executors; is there not a bill filed in Chancery by the other two executors, upon supposition of this business? - I believe there is a bill, but I have not heard any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Do not you know you are under an order to put in an answer? - Mr. Gabell sent to inform me of the business.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner tell you he followed you up to a room and looked through the door? - Not till after I took the receipt.</p>
               <p>Very well then, did not he tell you that he had through the door seen you take the bond? - I do not know that he told me any such thing.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he is the only witness that the executors have to that fact? - I do not know it, I do not know that he could be any witness on the occasion at all; he never told me so, he told me of robbing the orphan, that was nearly all; I asked him what he meant by that; he named Mr. Warburton's son; I told him that I then saw what a bad man he was, that of course I should leave his house, it was in vain to argue with him.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you that he had seen you take the bond? - I do not recollect that he did tell me so, he told me that when I came down with the liquor he had peeped through the key hole, that was all; he told me so at the time I obtained the receipt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stanway came with you, did not he, at the time that the man said he peeped through the door? - Mr. Stanway went as an attorney, I am not positive that he told me so.</p>
               <p>I ask you when you took his receipt, if he did not tell you that he saw you through the key hole take the bond? - I am not perfect that he did tell me so, I do not recollect that he did tell me so, it has been rumoured since that he did, which I have heard, but I do not think it was mentioned at the time.</p>
               <p>Did not Pritchard talk to you about this bond? - He did, I told Mr. Pritchard the particulars, but not since.</p>
               <p>I ask you when Pritchard first spoke to you about this bond, having had intelligence from the prisoner what had been done, whether you did not deny it? - I told Mr. Pritchard there was no such bond in existence.</p>
               <p>But did not you deny to him, that there ever had been such a bond? - I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him that you had not given a bond, but had paid ready money? - I told him that when I came into the business, I paid ready money for it, I said there was no such bond in existence, nor any thing else.</p>
               <p>What was you before you went into this business? - I was with a Mr. Kennett, the upholsterer in Bond-street.</p>
               <p>In what capacity? - I was clerk to him.</p>
               <p>I suppose you saved that 800 l.? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner to your certain knowledge the very day that you had got the receipt sue out a warrant for felony against you for stealing the receipt, and send the constables after you, and could not find you? - He certainly did, I took it away on the Saturday between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>You had heard that the constables were after you? - When.</p>
               <p>That you can best tell? - I did not hear on that day; I heard when I went to Sir Sampson Wright's, I never heard before I went to Sir Sampson, which was about eleven on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>How came he to know that there was a warrant for felony out against you? - It was not taken out before him, I believe it was taken out before Mr. Green.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had totally done dealing with you? - He said on account of buying cheaper, he did not say totally done.</p>
               <p>No other reason? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. When you had got this receipt from him, he having delivered it to you, you said you would keep it, then it was that he mentioned something about the orphan? - It was.</p>
               <p>Had he ever mentioned any thing of that sort to you before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. After you had got the receipt,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260159"></xptr> you say that a warrant was issued to take you up for a felony? - Yes, for stealing and taking away the receipt.</p>
               <p>Did not you know that Tissington had before this time of your taking away the receipt told the executors that he knew of your taking the bond? - I did not know it, he never mentioned it himself, nor did I ever hear it from any body.</p>

            . Have you ever seen that before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are not you to give that up to your brother as soon as the trial is over? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>You are? - I do not know that I need answer that.</p>
               <p>Court. You must answer upon oath? - I cannot answer that.</p>
               <p>Have you made any agreement with your brother to give it up to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Explain what you mean? - There was no agreement made to give that up.</p>
               <p>Why did you answer yes to the question? - I did not know what he meant by giving up, by making the agreement.</p>
               <p>What did you think you answered yes to; what did you understand the question to be? - I did not know what I answered yes to.</p>
               <p>Do you answer upon oath to a question you do not understand, so that you may swear either true or false? - I never had it in my possession.</p>
               <p>What was it you was to give up to him? - I never had it in my possession.</p>
               <p>You shall answer the question; you swore that you were to give something up to your brother after the trial, what was it? - I did not understand him properly.</p>
               <p>What was the question you answered to, you did answer? - I understood that I was to have that given to me, and I was to give it him back.</p>
               <p>Well, and you said you were to give it back, did not you? - I could not give it him back.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Sylvester. Do you think it will be of any consequence to examine this man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall certainly direct the Jury not to pay the smallest attention to what he says.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Do you think you are liable to pay your brother any money on it? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had that release in your possession? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you suppose you are liable to your brother for this 45 l.? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Then I beg leave to go on again with my cross examination.</p>
               <p>Court. I will not suffer this man to be examined; if he will tell me what question he meant to answer yes to, I will admit his evidence; suppose it was not that, what was it? what was the question you supposed Mr. Morgan to put? - I supposed I was to deliver this first of all to my brother.</p>
               <p>What was it you was to deliver up first of all? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. A receipt is produced which the witness swears he had from the prisoner, which appears upon the face of it to be altered from five to fifty, but it does not appear but it might have been altered since the time that the money was paid; this witness has destroyed his competency, and the prisoner must be acquitted.</p>

I lost a guinea and 8 s. 6 d. which was wrapped up in a piece of white paper.</p>
               <p>Was it light, or dark? - Twilight. I was sent for, on the Monday se'nnight, to the Rotation-office; there I saw the prisoners; I knew them as soon as I saw them; I was clear, when they robbed me, I should know them again; they were in no disguise at all; the middle one, Pyke, had a scar on his cheek; Robinson was of a fair complexion, and his own hair; I can swear to him. I advertised them; the runners, knowing where I worked at Hampstead, sent for me; when I came there, the three prisoners, and another, were in the office, who was charged with breaking open an house in Bloomsbury. I was asked by the clerk, Whether I should know the persons that robbed me, if I saw them again? I said, I should know them in my conscience; I went through the office, and pointed out the three prisoners; but was not sure, in my conscience, to Collinwood.</p>
               <p>Pyke. He said, at the justice's, one of the men that robbed him, had a mole on his cheek. - I have not the advertisement here; I described him as having a mole.</p>
               <p>Pyke. I have a cut on my cheek; it is plain it is no mole.</p>
               <p>Collinwood. He swore more positively to me than the rest, till I proved I was in gaol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300012"></xptr> at the time, and then he swore more positively to the other man.</p>
               <p>Pyke. He swore Collinwood was the first man that stopped him, and demanded his money: he is a private soldier in the guards; he has been hired by the runners to swear against us.</p>

               <p>Did you swear positively to Collinwood, before the justice? - I swore to those three, but were not positive to Collinwood.</p>
               <p>(He is shewn his information before the justice.)</p>
               <p>Is that your hand-writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The information was read, in which it appeared, he swore positively to Collinwood before the justice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a postman, of 25, Shaftesbury-place, Aldersgate-street—about half-past 1, on 28th November (after midnight), I met the prisoners in Cheapside—I had walked from Greenwich, having lost the last train—one of them spoke to me, but I did not stop—they came after me, and Fossett said, "Good night"—I made no reply, but walked on six or seven yards—she then came up behind me, took me round the waist, put her hand into my right-hand trousers pocket, and took my purse, which contained 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a gold ring—I felt her hand in my pocket—I said, "Give me my purse; you have taken my purse out of my pocket"—I saw her pass her arm over, and give it to the prisoner Jacobs—I told Jacobs she had got my purse—she said, "I have not got it"—a constable came up and I gave them in charge—we searched, but neither the purse nor ring has been found—I had felt my purse safe ten minutes before, and nobody had touched me since—the ring cost me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw no one come up to the prisoners—I am sure I saw my purse in Jacobs' hand.</p>

This woman came over, and he said, "I will have you too." Four policemen followed with their lanterns down to the ground, to see that the purse was not passed away. I never saw it.</p>

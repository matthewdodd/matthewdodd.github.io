I am in partnership with my brother Samuel—we are boot and shoe manufacturers in Fenchurch-street—the prisoner was formerly our apprentice, and lately he has been in our employ—I asked him where he lived, and he gave me the direction No. 9, White Horse-street—I afterwards found a shop with his name written up at No. 6, Albion-terrace—I went there and saw these shoes and boots—I suspected they were mine, and am able to swear to some of them—here is a pair I can swear to, and I believe the others are all mine—I had not authorized the prisoner to take any of them.</p>

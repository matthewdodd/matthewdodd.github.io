               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is not very difficult to guess what way of life you are in? - Hardly, since I have been committing these depredations.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a thief, a notorious thief? - I have been a very bad man some time.</p>
               <p>Give me an answer, guess a little how long have you been a thief? - I cannot guess, I am in hope to leave it off.</p>
               <p>Nothing will make you leave it off but a halter; how many robberies have you committed within this twelvemonth last? - Nothing but these three robberies, and picking pockets a little, and such like; I think I should use the gentlemen very wrong if I was to say I was an honest man, I have worked at my trade, and I can't say I have been honest.</p>
               <p>What other trade have you worked at than that of picking pockets and other depredations? - I am a shoemaker.</p>
               <p>You have not worked at that lately? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Who is this Mrs. Ford; I suppose Mrs. Ford is a rib of yours? - A rib of mine!</p>
               <p>Yes, bone of your bone? - That I believe is from scripture.</p>
               <p>What, have you had any thing to do with scripture? - I hope so, though I have been so bad a man.</p>

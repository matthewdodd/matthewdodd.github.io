               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not receive twenty-five quarters in the second load, and say it was all right? A. No; some of them had been delivered before the empty sacks were laid down - I cannot say how much; the prisoner, and a person who came with him, unloaded it, and two persons who were in the yard, assisted - they are not here; the corn was shot in the granary - it was all put together; there were not fifty quarters - there was one short; they have not been measured to this day, but I counted the sacks - I put the constable in charge of the prisoner before he left the yard, and he looked to him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, in the presence of the two men who assisted in unloading the waggon, say the corn was right, and let the prisoner take the team from the yard, before you gave him into custody? A. No, I never said it was right - I cannot tell how long it was before he was taken; it might be an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the constable take him in the yard? A. No; I wanted to know who the receivers were - I gave the constable orders to secure him while he was in the yard; he had put out several sacks of corn, and then two empty sacks - I counted the sacks that were put out; the two empty sacks made up the number to fifty - I saw forty-eight sacks emptied, having previously seen them full.</p>

This witness gave me information that he was a quarter short, and desired me to take the prisoner while he was in the yard - I saw him come out with a horse, and give the team to another man to take it down to the Coach and Horses; the prisoner took his horse to be shod - I never lost sight of the waggon; I saw the prisoner in conversation with a man at the Coach and Horses; he then went on towards Isleworth, and the man with a green cart went with him - I followed them, I suppose a quarter of a mile; I stopped the prisoner, and the other man went off - I found two sacks of oats in the waggon; they were full, as near as I can recollect - they had no name on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was the reason you did not take him in the yard? A. I was not in the yard; I do not know how much a quarter of oats is - I found two sacks, nearly full; I took it into my possession, and have a sample here.</p>

               <p>MR. HOLLINGS re-examined. Q.Up to the time of this charge had the prisoner a good character? A. Yes; I always found him honest - he has been with me about twelve months; these samples correspond with each other.</p>

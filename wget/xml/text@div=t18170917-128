             is the landlady. We took the house on the 25th of July for two months certain; her furniture and servant remain in the house; we had all the rooms in the house; her servant slept in one by my permission-it was her intention to remain. On Saturday evening, the 13th of September, I and my husband saw all the doors and windows safe between ten and eleven o'clock. The plate was kept in the sideboard drawers, it was all our's. The servant-maid came into our bed-room about seven o'clock the next morning-from what she said, I learnt that the house had been broken open. I came down immediately, and missed all the plate from the front parlour; the silver waiter weighed thirty-seven ounces; the articles stated in the indictment were gone, all of which belonged to us, except the gown, the handkerchiefs, and the ham; the knuckle of veal was mine, some wine had been drank, and the decanter left; the upper sash of the back parlour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170041"></xptr>window was down, the shutter open, and marks of footsteps on the table, which was close to the window; the persons had got through that window; there were some ribbons found in the bag, which were mine - I knew them again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. The house is in Jeffries-terrace, Kentish-town, a mile and a half, or two miles from Grosvenor-square-the Venetian blind was up when I went to bed.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Lewis, the owner of the house. Every thing was safe when I went to bed soon after eleven o'clock; the kitchen-door is in the front of the house-that was safe; there was a bundle of old ribbons on the dresser; the knuckle of veal was in the front kitchen. When I came down, I found some matches and tinder on the table and footmarks where they entered. I had not been using matches or tinder the night before-the matches were broke in two, and burnt at both ends. I was the first person who was up. I found two holes had been bored with a gimlet in the pannel of the lower kitchen-door, which goes into the garden. The door which leads into the area was unfastened, but not open. When I went to bed I am sure they were all shut. I saw the ribbons at the office - They are the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Let us understand a little better about the doors - A. The door on the stairs opens immediately into the garden; it was open, and a decanter put to keep it so-that was shut at night; it did not appear to be forced, The door in the back kitchen also leads into the garden-that is the one that had the holes bored in it; both these doors were bolted the night before. The officers saw every thing in the same state that I found them.</p>

            . I am conductor of the Bow-street patrol. On the 14th of September, I was sent for to the prosecutor's house at eight o'clock in the morning. I found the things thrown about, and two of the doors open. There were some matches and tinder, and footmarks on the table-the matches had been used. The back-door, which leads into the garden, was kept open by a decanter put against it. There were two holes bored in the kitchen-door with a gimlet-both these doors lead into the garden-the top sash of the back window was open, so that a person could get in at it from the top of the out-house; the green blind was let down.</p>

Hale had a bag; I asked what they had in the bag?

I followed him; the other watchman prevented his going down Tottenham-court-road. We pursued, and apprehended them in Charlotte-street, Bedford-square, and took them to the watch-house.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. I asked the prisoners where they got the property when it was brought in. Hale said, they were mushrooms-Smith was close to him. I examined it, and said, "they are hard mushrooms," and asked Hale where he got them? he said they had gone out mushrooming, found the bag in a ditch in Maiden-lane, and were returning home with it. Smith was close by him, and heard what he said. I said it was very unlikely they should return with the bag, without getting mushrooms, and not looking for them. I believe they made no reply-Smith did not speak. When Halo spoke, he said "they," (speaking of both)-Smith did not contradict him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There is a place at Pancras, called Maiden-lane, near the back of Jeffries-place, where the robbery was committed. I compared the gimlet which we found in the bag with the holes in the door - They corresponded exactly. Nothing was found on the prisoners.</p>
               <p>HALE'S Defence. When I came to the watch-house, I said I was going a mushrooming, and found them - I had not got any mushrooms. I found the bag in a ditch, partly covered over. I was walking by myself, about a quarter past four o'clock in the morning, in Maiden-lane, and was bringing the bag home; I got into Gower-street, the watchman stopped me, and asked what was in it? I opened it, and told him he should see. I ran away, but do not know why - I had no occasion to run. Smith ran too, but I do not know why - He was before me.</p>

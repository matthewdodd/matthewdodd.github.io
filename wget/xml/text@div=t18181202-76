            . I am porter to Mr. Morgan. The window of the back warehouse looks into Helmet-court, which is at the back of the premises. On the 9th of November when the men left work, I fastened that window by an iron bar, outside - it had a pin through it, which was fastened with a key - I slept on the premises that night, but heard no alarm. Job Webster, went to the window the first, about five minutes before seven o'clock in the morning - it was not daylight. He called me to look at the window, I found a square of glass broken, and the shutter not quite close; the bar was broke at the staple end, and hung by the pin, there was a little iron poker laying inside the window, by which I suppose it must have been done - I had a candle with me - it was not light enough to see without.</p>
               <p>Q. When the pane of glass was removed, was there room enough for a man's body to have got in - A. There was. I missed two or three looking glasses, off a chest of drawers. I did not miss the tea-chests.</p>

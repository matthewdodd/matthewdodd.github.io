               <p>About the middle of July 1791, the prisoner came to Mr. Oldham's warehouse in a carriage, in the character of a gentleman. Mr. Oldham's warehouse is at the corner of Brook-street, in Holborn; he said that he had taken a house in Upper Norman-street, No.46, Mary-le-bone, and desired that we would send somebody to measure the place for the stoves, and send such as we thought proper for his inspection, stoves, and other things that he ordered. I am in Mr. Oldham's shop. I sent up a person to measure, and afterwards I sent up such goods as I thought most proper for his inspection.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you send a bill of parcels? - Never, they were not considered as sold, they were only sent for his inspection; I waited on him myself the next morning, and found he was not in town, and enquired of him in the neighbourhood, and found he was an indifferent character, and I sent some porters up to take away what goods were then left, and they were re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040007"></xptr>moved to Steven-street, in Rathbone place. I never saw the prisoner after he ordered them in, till I saw him after he was advertised. I went to Steven-street, and the woman of the house acknowledged the having of them, and that I should have them in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enter the goods in the waste books? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the porter here that delivered them? - No, he is not, that porter has left our service, and we know not where to find him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Notting Hill-terrace. The prisoner was upwards of five years my nursemaid—she was going to leave us in a few days after we discovered this—on the 31st of July I went to the police-court at Kensington to search her box, and found a sheet, a pillow-case, small silk handkerchief, and a small box—I went home, and accused the pri<lb></lb>soner of it—she stated she could not tell how the things got into her box; if they were there some one must have put them there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Bartlett. I saw this box at the station—I only know it was the prisoner's from having received a letter from her, stating that it was hers—I saw her in my house after I came from the station—I and Mrs. Melville went to her—she denied having taken away other things, and said she had only taken those which were in the box—the said the pillow-case I threw down as old linen, and she was not aware that the sheet was in her box—I said, "You told my cook and housemaid the sheet came from your sister in India, and it was marked S. A."—she said she had not said so—she then said there was no sheet in the box—this is my sheet—I can swear to it—I never gave her either the sheet or pillow-case, nor told her to make away with them or burn them—this is a little toy box of mt child's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live in Notting Hill-terrace. I with Mrs. Bartlett saw the prisoner—I told her there were some things found in her box, and begged she would explain what she had taken, as she was before a friend—she said she had not taken any thing—I said, "Yes, a pillow-case marked A., and a sheet marked G. S. P."—she said the pillow-case was thrown down by her mistress, and if the sheet was in her box she had not put it in—when we came from the station we found her standing in the passage—Mrs. Bartlett said, "What do you want, Ann?"—she said, "I am come to see my master to get my box from the police-station"—Mrs. Bartlett said, "You have a pillow-case and a few other things in your box;" and as</p>

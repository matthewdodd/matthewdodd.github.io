                  </hi>. I am an interpreter of languages, and live at 15, Alfred-terrace, in the hamlet of Ratcliff. On Sunday, 29th Sept., about half-past three or four o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by the police—I went to an aviary in my yard, and found it burst open, and thirty-four pigeons gone; two of them came back next day—I had seen them safe about ten or half-past on the Saturday night—I afterwards saw two of them in the possession of the police—the aviary is enclosed by the same wall as the house—I occupy it with the house—it was not locked, bat the top part which opens down was pegged and solidly fastened, so that the pigeons could not get out of themselves.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 234). On Sunday morning, 29th Sept., about two o'clock, my attention was attracted by a noise under one of the railway arches which runs abreast of the prosecutor's garden-wall—I went and threw my light on, and then saw the prisoner coming from the top of the prosecutor's garden-wall—directly he saw me he took to his heels and ran as fast as he could through several different streets—I pursued him till I was nearly exhausted—I came up to Mercer, and called to him to follow him—he was afterwards brought back in the custody of a constable named Bull—I am quite positive the prisoner is the man I saw dropping from the wall.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 120). On the morning of 29th Sept., I saw Taplin running after the prisoner, springing his rattle, and his light turned on—I ran towards the prisoner, and he turned down Joseph-street—I saw him drop two pigeons from his left breast, apparently from under his coat—I think it was the same he has on now—I lost sight of him for three or four minutes, and then saw him again in custody of another constable—I am positive he is the man I ran after first, and who dropped the pigeons—I had seen him before, and knew him—he dropped the pigeons in the street, and after he was in custody I went back and picked them up—their wings were broken, and their feathers very much tossed about by being crumpled up in his chest, to that they could not fly—I found them where he had thrown them down.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband keeps the Admiral Rodney, at Deptford. On 6th June, the prisoners came there together about half past 10 o'clock—I served them a pint of beer, and Sullivan gave me a shilling; I examined it, and told him it was bad—I gave it him back—he said he had taken it in change at the Cape of Good Hope, opposite, and he would go and get it changed—he went, and told M'Carthy to wait till he came back—he left and did not return; M'Carthy waited five or six minutes, and then he went away—they left the beer—on the following day I saw them again in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Mechanics' Arms, at Dept<lb></lb>ford, about four minutes' walk from the Rodney. A few minutes before 11 o'clock at night, on 6th June, the prisoners came in together—they were served with a pint of porter, and Sullivan gave me a bad shilling—I bent it with my mouth, and asked him where he got it from, he said, "From the Noah's Ark, in change for a half sovereign"—I should hare let the prisoners go, but the policeman looked in, and asked if they had attempted to pass bad money—I said, "Yes"—I threw down the shilling, and the police<lb></lb>man took it and broke it in two pieces—he took the prisoners into my par<lb></lb>lour and searched them—one shilling was found under M'Carthy's trowsers.</p>

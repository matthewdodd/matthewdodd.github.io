I live at Hammersmith, and keep horses for hire On the 3rd of September the prisoner came to me to hire a horse, to go in Hounslow; about half-past five or six o'clock in the morning—I let him a mare for that purpose—he never brought it back—I found it at Brentford on the Saturday—he hired it on the Thursday—he was in custody when I found it—the saddle was in the station-house, and I found the bridle with the mare,—I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

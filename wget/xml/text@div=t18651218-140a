                  </hi> I live at 1, Jackson's-gardens, Carlisle-lane, Lam-beth, and am a bricklayer—on Saturday night, 9th December, about half-past 11, I was going along Carlisle-lane, by a dead wall there, when the prisoner and another man came up from the opposite side of the way, took a circle round, and met me, the man not in custody ran against me with his head, caught me in my belly, and knocked me down on my back, into the mud—he fell on me, with his knees on my belly, and his breast on my face, and both of them rifled my pockets—they broke my watch-guard in three pieces, and I lost a piece of it—I held the prisoner there till a policeman came—the other man got away—I lost 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my right-hand pocket—they were at all my pockets—I was not drunk—I could not breathe well for two or three days after this.</p>

About a quarter past 11, on 9th December, I was in the Westminster-road, and heard a cry of "Police"—on crossing the road I saw the prisoner a short distance from the end of Carlisle-lane—some one said, "That is the man you are called for"—the prisoner said, "If I am the man, I will go with the policeman,"and he went with me to where the prosecutor was—he said he had been knocked down and robbed, and that the prisoner was one of the men—the prisoner said, "If I struck him, he struck me first"—the prosecutor gave me a piece of broken chain at the time—he was not quite sober—he could stand and walk well.</p>

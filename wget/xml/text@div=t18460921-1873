I am a widow, and live in Baker-street, Commercial-road—it is not an improper house—I let it out in tenements—I told the Magistrate I did not know who I let it to—the prisoner was my servant—on the 10th of Sept., about seven o'clock in the evening, I was lying down on the bed, in the parlour, and fell asleep—the prisoner was in the parlour, putting on the kettle—I had three half-crowns, six shillings, sixpence, and two or three halfpence in ray pocket when I went to sleep—when I awoke up, the prisoner was gone, money and all—she never came back—next day I was told she was at the public-house—I found her there—I told her to come out—she said she should not—I caught her by the shoulder, and said, "I am a widow; if you will give me two or three shillings I will forgive you"—she said she would not—she was very tipsy—she could hardly walk—I brought her out—she had five or six shillings in her bosom—she swallowed five shillings—she had a half-crown in her hand, which she tried to put into her mouth—it dropped down in the street—I picked it up, and gave her in charge.</p>

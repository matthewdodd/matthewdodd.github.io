On Wednesday, the 23d of July, the prisoner came to my employer's, and said he had hid four sovereigns, and a person had told him that I knew where he had hid them, and that I had taken them - I asked him who the person was - he would not tell me - I put on my coat, and went with him as far as Hatton-garden, and then he wanted to leave me - I said, if he did, I would give him in charge of a policeman - he went on with me to Hackney, and then wanted to leave me - I met policeman Gillett, and told him, and he took him - he told Gillet he had hid them in the skittle-ground at the King's Head.</p>

            ; I lived there seven months.</p>
               <p>You are a single woman? - Yes: I lost a silver tankard, a silver half pint, and eight silver table spoons, there is but one in the indictment, a pair of silver tea tongs, a silver salver, and a black silk sacque and petticoat; they were locked up in a trunk in my lodging in Dowding's house; I had the one-pair of stairs fore-room.</p>
               <p>Where did the trunk stand? - By my bedside in the corner on one of the boxes; I had the key in my pocket at the time I missed the things; I saw it safe on Sunday morning the 23d; I found it broke open about nine at night; I did not lie in the house between the 23d and 25th; I was at the prisoner's house, the prisoner's wife had been my servant; I trusted him in my house; I was involved in trouble.</p>
               <p>Was she your servant at that time? - No; I had been to my attorney, and he ordered me to look at my evidence; she was my only evidence; I went and found her up and she was married to this man; she had been from me some months; she asked me to come to his house; the prisoner lay at my house at the time; when I found them out they were in great distress.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you ever give him authority to pawn any thing for you? - Only a pint mug when I wanted money.</p>
               <p>That was the only article you gave him authority to pawn? - Yes, that was the only piece of plate I ever gave him to pawn.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Bruin, a pawnbroker? - Yes; instead of carrying it to Mr. Johnson's, as I told him, he went to Mr. Bruin's, and Mr. Bruin sent for me, and stopped him, and asked me if I had that left, having lost so much before.</p>

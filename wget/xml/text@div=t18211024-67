The prisoner kept company with my daughter, but I never saw him in the house myself. I left the ring on the mantle-piece about eleven o'clock in the morning; my daughter and three children were at home. I missed it on coming home. On the 17th of October I saw the prisoner in Cheapside, I called to him, and he ran away. I cried Stop thief! and he was taken. He said he would bring my daughter to swear I had not lost the ring, but had left it in Newgate-market.</p>

            . On the 10th of October, about four o'clock, my father sent me home, the prisoner came in and asked for my sister; I saw him take the ring off the shelf - he gave me 2 d. and told me not to tell my mother that he had been - he went out and said he would return again. I am sure he took the ring away. My mother came home, and I told her.</p>

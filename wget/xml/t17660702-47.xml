            . Mrs. Parker said, That wicked creature has put her hand over the counter, and took out your till, and taken something out; we went to her before she had time to put the till in again; I charged her with taking something; she said, I robbed you of nothing; I said, it looks to me as if you had something in your hand; I took hold of her hand, she had a pot in it; I took it out, but she would not open her hand; Mr. Parker came and helped me, then we found two sixpences in it; she said she had earned them with her own precious hands; but when before the Alderman, she owned she took them from my till.</p>

               <p>Hill—on 26th November, shortly after midnight, I was at the corner of York Road, City Road, and received a tremendous blow on the right side of my head—I had bought a flask of whisky in a public-house, and when I came out I saw two men who noticed me—one crossed over to the right side of the City Road, and the other kept on the York Road side—I did not notice their faces then, but I felt that I was watched, and crossed the road twice—the blow partially stunned me, and knocked me down—I attempted to get up, but found I was attacked by two men—there was a severe battle for a moment, and I was down in the mud—I noticed the prisoner's face—he kicked me, and mauled me about, and cut the whole of my trousers and waistcoat out—he took the whole front of my trousers away containing my pocket, and my money disappeared, and my watch and chain, but my im<lb></lb>pression is that the other man took them—they ran away, and on the next day I described them at the station—I went to Worship Street station on 6th December, and picked the prisoner out from six or seven others.</p>

A Servant of Esquire Chetwind's saw the Goods at the Justice's which she knew to be her Master's. The Prisoner said, that coming up Holborn, he saw two Men very much in Drink sitting at a Door, with the Bundle on the Stall, and one of them desir'd him to carry this Bundle for them, which doing, one of them follow'd him at some distance, but ran away as soon as he saw him taken.

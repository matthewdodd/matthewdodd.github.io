                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Wykeham-place, Chelsea Common. On Christmas night I was going along Grosvenor-row, Pimlico, and met the prisoner's son very tipsy—I and another woman helped him to the prisoner's door, he was rather troublesome—we persuaded him to go in, on which the prisoner came down in his shirt with a knife in his hand; he rushed towards me with it—I cannot tell you what he said because it was Irish, but I understood it to be abusive language—he made an aim at my throat with the knife, I put my hand up with my shawl to save my throat, and he drew it across my fingers—he had not the knife at first—he went away for it, but he was not gone half a minute—it only grazed my neck, but my fingers were cut right across and bled dreadfully, the wounds are not well yet, but they are much better—it was a dinner knife, I saw his wife take it out of his hand and hide it.</p>

I examined Mary Egan's hand, there were two incised wounds in the middle of the hand across the fingers—she said nothing about her throat at that time, but a few days afterwards, before the Magistrate, I examined her throat, and saw that a small wound had been inflicted—it was only a slight scratch.</p>

               <p>---- ----. I am a master baker, and have known the prisoner twenty years, as a respectable man. The woman his son cohabits with is in the habit of coming at very unreasonable hours of the night, and breaking the peace of the whole neighbourhood—when she cannot get her ends she breaks the windows, and irritates the man—he is a feeling, kind-hearted man, and is too ill to do harm to any person, but the police will only drag this woman out at one end of the street, and she comes in at the other; there is no getting id of her pest at all.</p>

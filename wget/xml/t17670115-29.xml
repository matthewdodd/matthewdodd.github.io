I asked him if he knew any more of his accomplices; he took me to a house; he went, I thought, into a parlour, but I found he went into an alley, and got off; then I went to the Raven again, and applied to the first man taken up, named Hughes; then he took me to the prisoner's lodgings; he was in bed; we made him get up; I brought him to the Black Raven; I asked Hughes if he knew of any more; then the prisoner told the prosecutor he could help him to the woman that bought the goods of Seedy; he took us to a private house on the back of Saffron-hill; having no warrant we went to Justice Girdler, there Hughes desired the prisoner to clear him, persisting he was innocent; the justice said, he had been before him several times; then the prisoner said, Sir, Hughes is innocent of this, for I am the man that robbed Mr. Adgit of his breeches, and said, he took six more pair; upon that he was committed; when we were at the alehouse; the prisoner owned, he first kicked at the door, and no body came; and that if they had, he should have made some excuse; but as nobody came, he came in and took the breeches.</p>

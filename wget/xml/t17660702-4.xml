               <p>I met a woman as I was going home from my labour; she asked me if I was a carpenter; I said I was: she said her husband was a carpenter, and was dead, and she had three children, and she asked me if I would buy that plough: I bought it for 5 s. 6 d. out of pity to her children; I do not know that woman where she lives.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner told me the very spot where he took the plough from, before half a dozen people, the day he was committed: he first told me, he brought it out of Somersetshire two years ago; after that, he told me he had it of a woman that had it in her apron upon some chips, who, he said, told him she found it, and that he gave her 6 d. for it.</p>

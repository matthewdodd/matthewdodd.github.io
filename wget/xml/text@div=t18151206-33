The prisoner lodged in that house for three weeks before the 15th of October, he slept in the same room with me. My brother and I have the house between us, it is a small house which we rent from my mother; it belongs to both of us. The prisoner got up between eight and nine on the morning of the 15th, which was Sunday. He got up and went out of the house; I was very ill in bed; I had asked the prisoner to get me a letter to go into the hospital. When I got up, I missed my watch and seals; I gave seven pounds for them, and I suppose they were worth three. I did not see him for a fortnight after that. I saw him in about a fortnight at the White Horse cellar, and I asked him what he thought of himself for taking my property, he made no answer but said in a very slow voice which could scarcely be heard,he was sorry; he told me he had pledged them, and said he would take me to a place where I could get the duplicate; I got them I think in Beaufurt buildings Marylebone; she went with me there. I found the things at a pawnbroker's, I think the name is Baylis. The prisoner told me that a woman pawned them for him; he did not tell me her name then, but afterwards he did.</p>

            . I keep a public house in Wood-street, Westminster. On Sunday the 25th of December all four of the prisoners, and one Grant, came together to my house, between five and six o'clock in the evening: I knew Grant: the prisoners I knew nothing of. They called for liquor: I served them. They drank plentifully. I was backwards and forwards in my business. After they had drank their liquor they came out of the room where they had been, into the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q What time was this?</p>
               <p>Mallard. I take it to be something after nine. By what means I cannot say they began to jostle one another, and make a sort of a riot; Grant was thrown down. I went to assist him and got some ugly knocks from some of the company; I cannot say which of them. There was

               <p>Q. What liquor had these five persons?</p>
               <p>Mallard. They had two half pints of brandy, a pot of beer, a paper of tobacco, and four half-crown bowls of punch. They behaved very honourable: they paid me for the liquor before they had it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in liquor when they went away?</p>
               <p>Mallard. They certainly were. They went something after nine o'clock. I did not go a yard from my own house after them.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they sober at coming in?</p>
               <p>Mallard. I believe they were perfectly sober. They behaved like gentlemen, and had a room to themselves, and behaved quite peaceable. This affair of their riotous behaviour was in a quarter of an hour, just before their going away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of the prisoners before?</p>
               <p>Mallard. I do not know, to my knowledge, that I had ever seen any of them before. Grant had used my house before.</p>

            . (A Black).</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in England?</p>
               <p>Wadeson. I have been in England about twenty-six years. I am servant to a gentleman. On Sunday the 24th of December, I was at the house of Mr. Mallard drinking a pint of beer with an acquaintance. There came the four prisoners, and another man named Grant, out of another room where they had been drinking, into the tap-room. They began to quarrel. Patrick and Grant fell down; they got up again by the assistance of the landlord and somebody in the room. They wrestled again, and Grant gave Kennedy a fall; the landlord went to pull Kennedy off Grant; the others fell upon the landlord: my acquaintance said to me, Robert, we will go away, here will be nothing but quarrelling. As I was going out, I said, That is the landlord, don't hurt him. Then they struck me. They were all five upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they in this quarrelling way?</p>
               <p>Wadeson. About a quarter of an hour. They tore my shirt off my back. I remember seeing the landlord down and all five upon him in the tap-room. I ran up stairs to call a brewer's servant who was coming down. I cannot say I had a blow from any one in particular; they all struck at me several times, They said one to another, at last, Get your hats and run as fast as you can, at their going out.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when they went out?</p>
               <p>Wadeson. This was, as I imagine, half an hour after nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any sticks in their hands at going out?</p>
               <p>Wadeson. I cannot say I saw any.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you live with?</p>
               <p>Wadeson. I live with Mr. Blunt in Abingdon's Buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoners before?</p>
               <p>Wadeson. I knew nothing of them before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they wrestling together by way of diversion?</p>
               <p>Wadeson. I really do not know that; my companion did imagine it was a kind of roguish motion among themselves to make others fight.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they not in liquor?</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Mallard. The prisoners are like the men that were at our house, but I cannot swear to any of them. They came in about candle lighting, and staid there till about nine o'clock. They had been drinking in a room. They came out there to the bar. Three of them went out at the door, and the other two came to the bar and insisted upon having more punch; master refused letting them have it. One of them said, Let us have a guinea's worth of punch, and laid half a guinea down. Said the other, I'll cover it. One of them took the half guinea up, and he that put it down challenged another man with it. Said he, I have not got it. Then the other answered, I have got your half guinea. They threw the plaisterer down: his name is Grant. My master went to take him up. (I was backwards and forwards, not in the tap-room all the time). I did not see the whole. They got hold of a man in a white waistcoat: they all struck at him: three of them got beating the black with sticks. They were very much in liquor, but yet they had sense enough not to strike one another.</p>
               <p>Q. When three of them went out at the door, and the other two wanted to have more punch, how long did they three stay before they came in again?</p>
               <p>A. Cotterell. The were not absent above five minutes. They all quitted the house about a quarter after nine. They said, Take up your hats and run; and when out of the house they cried, Go your length. I saw one of them have the poker in his left hand as he went out. I cannot swear who took it. Their dress is altered, and I was too much frightened to recollect them. One of them, I remember, broke his stick, and that was the reason, I believe, that he took up the poker.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they mean by that expression, go your length?</p>
               <p>A. Cotterell. I cannot say I ever heard that expression before. I do not know what it meant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your master down?</p>
               <p>A. Cotterell. I was in the kitchen when he was knocked down. They knocked the things about in the house in shoving one another about; two of them laid hold on the black, and they beat him. I thought they were only joking when Grant and the other were wrestling. I saw one of them wring my master by the nose.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Grant used to use your house?</p>
               <p>A. Cotterell. He did on Saturday nights. I saw Grant strike my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it Grant that had the poker?</p>
               <p>A. Cotterell. No, it was not. Grant had white clothes on, and the man that had the poker had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it Grant that wrong your master's nose?</p>
               <p>A. Cotterell. No, it was not. That was a man that had a white coat and red waistcoat on. Grant had not a red waistcoat. It looked to me, by the candle, to be a white coat.</p>

            . I was coming along Wood-street about nine in the evening, or a little after, on the 24th of December. The first person that I saw was a brewer's servant coming out at the door. He reeled as he came out. I thought he was in liquor: his head fell forwards, and a great quantity of blood fell from his head immediately. He fell against me. I put my hand out to give him assistance. When I got him by the arm, I supposed him. I believe, the space of half a minute. I said, Are you hurt? he made me no answer. Before I could turn myself round somebody struck me across my shoulders. I turned round immediately and saw a man at the door which struck me. I immediately made an attempt to run away. (What became of the brewer's servant I do not know). I fell with my shoulder against a post near the door. There came a blow upon the post; I suppose it was aimed at me. I got up and ran a hundred yards; a man followed me with a green coat and red waistcoat trimmed with gold or silver. He d - d my blood twice, and said, Where is my hat? It was pretty dark: the way I turned was the means, I believe, of my escaping. There were only two lamps. I do believe that man was

            . I am a brewer's servant. I was at Mr. Mallard's the 24th of December in the evening. I remember seeing the four prisoners<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210026"></xptr> there; there were five in the whole. I came to the house about nine, and was in the tap-room; the prisoners were then in another room. I had not been in the house above ten minutes before they all five came into the tap-room. They began first of all throwing money about: they wanted half a guinea's worth of punch. The landlord desired them not to have any more. They threw some money upon the table, saying they would be half a guinea a-piece and have a guinea's worth of punch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they sober or in liquor?</p>
               <p>Bliss. They might be a little in liquor; I believe they were. They wanted to lay the half guinea that was put down upon a coachman, that he had taken it up. I saw one of them take it up. Upon my saying I saw such a one take it up, the man that put it down asked the other if he took it up; he said, Yes, he did take it up, and it was all one between you and I after that, Kennedy, and the man not taken, named Grant, began hustling and wrestling: they had fall and fall in the house. Mr. Mallard hearing a noise, begged of them to be quiet, and not to have any disturbance: he strove to help Grant up, who was upon the ground, and they fell upon him. I seeing him so used, came to his assistance. I pulled one of them off him; and they fell upon me with their sticks as hard as they could; one and all fell upon me. I received several blows with sticks. I had one tooth knocked out of my head: I had one terrible blow on my head. The blows came so fast that I cannot swear to one man more than another. They continued in that manner upon me about two minutes. I had a blow upon my head that drove me into the passage, and I then got out at the door. There was a gentleman met me as I got out at the door. I did not know him, but he knew me again, and told me of it. My head bled much.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the gentleman laying hold of you?</p>
               <p>Bliss. I do not. I gave a snatch away, as he told me, and got away, and saw no more of them. By all accounts they followed me out; but I cannot tell they followed me in particular.</p>

             in Old Palace yard, I can't justly say the time of night; it might be about nine o'clock; they were facing the Ship alehouse. I was going home towards Wood-street. I saw a mob; there might be seven or eight people of them. One of them in a brown coat, asked me if I wanted to rob him? I said, No. Another in blue, with a laced waistcoat, said, Let the lad alone. No, said he, I shall not let him alone; and held up a piece of iron, as I took it to be, and went to hit me. I slipped on one side towards the Ship alehouse door, and the man belonging to the alehouse pulled me into the passage. There was a coachman stood with a coach facing the alehouse door; he said, Gentlemen, you had better go about your business; and one of them struck him. There was a stone-mason at the door was knocked down by some of that company; with a cane with a brass-coloured head; the man that struck him I took to be in a blue coat and a laced waistcoat: then they made off towards the bridge, and I went home.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light where you saw what you thought was iron?</p>
               <p>Vincent. It was not very light there.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the coat was green or blue?</p>
               <p>Vincent. The man that had this iron, I think, had a brown coat on. There are not many lamps there.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you formed your notion of the colour of the coats and the bit of iron at that time, or by the conversation you have had with the other witnesses since?</p>
               <p>Vincent. I formed my notion at that time. I went home, and told the same then at home. If I had thought this thing would have happened, I should have taken more notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a lamp at the Ship alehouse?</p>
               <p>Vincent. There is; and another at the next door but one: but I don't know whether the lamps at the new building were up then.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the brown coat was a furtout coat?</p>
               <p>Vincent. I think it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Grant?</p>

               <p>Q. How did they appear in regard to liquor?</p>

             was one. Two or three of them came up to me and said, D - n your eyes, what are you? I was just by the Ship alehouse. Gentlemen, said I, I don't interrupt you in the least, why should you me? let me go home about my business. One of them said, D - n him, he is a servant, let him alone. There was a young man named James with me, he is a groom; they struck at him with a stick. There was another man came out of the Ship alehouse; they knocked him down. One of the company came up to strike me. I held my hand up, and put the stick off. The man fell backwards, and I upon him, and as I was getting up from him, another of the same company took me a blow on my head with a stick. I went to the Ship and got my head washed with some gin. It was cut to the skull. When they hit me that blow they ran away. After my head was washed, and I came out, two of them were taken; the constable or watchman was leading them down Westminster bridge. I saw one of them knock the man down; whether there were two or one there I cannot say. I left them then and went home. I swear to the knowing only Patrick Kennedy.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you received the blow was it that you saw the man in custody on Westminster-bridge?</p>

               <p>Lucas. It might be about a quarter of an hour after that; that was at this hither end of the bridge. As soon as I saw the man fall, I ran after the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think as to the other prisoners?</p>
               <p>Lucas. These are like the persons; they looked like men of that size; but they were then in different dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you imagine the man you saw fall was the man that was killed?</p>
               <p>Lucas. No, I imagine it was the constable of the night; I saw his lanthorn fly out of his hands. There were then many people gathered together; one of the men had boots and spurs on, he was in blue and gold; the other, when taken, was in a brown coat.</p>

There were five men of them all together: I got close to the wall, and went in for a stick to defend myself. My landlord would not lend me one. I got a broom, and got the broom off the handle, and went out after them.</p>

They had all something in their hands, I cannot tell what. This might last about seven minutes, as near as I can say. My partner got up, with the blood running down his face; we followed: I went a little way down George-street, and then returned towards the bridge. We met the two Kennedys coming down the bridge arm in arm: I said, James, there is the man that knocked you down; he went to take him, but missed him. They knocked the constable down, as I understood, after that. I saw the two Kennedys running down Bridge-street; I followed them down Parliament-street: there had been paving in Channel-row, and they were puzzled which way to go. I made up to

            . I keep the Ship alehouse in Old Palace-yard. On Sunday the 24th of December, about half an hour past nine o'clock, the prisoners at the bar came before my door. I know the two Kennedys particularly: as for the tall Kennedy, (that is Patrick) I swear to him; he knocked two men down at my door. I and my wife were obliged to go from my door into the house, or we must have shared the same fate.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of them?</p>
               <p>Quick. There were five of them. The fifth person went from them at my door, and went down Abingdon Buildings; that was Grant. My boy was going over with a couple of pots of beer to one of my customers. He came in again and said, Uncle, Uncle, here is mischief going forwards. These men that were knocked down at my door, came out with nothing in their hands; that was Rowlinson and the coachman, named Lucas. My wife, my boy, and I came out, we got the two men into our house, and dressed their wounds. I saw Rowlinson and Lucas knocked down by

               <p>Q. How long did they stay about your door?</p>
               <p>Quick. I believe they staid about a quarter of an hour in a riotous manner, endeavouring to knock down every body that came nigh them. They made a stroke at me, and the post-screened me, and my wife pulled me into the house. After the mens wounds were dressed, they proceeded after these men to help to take them.

               <p>Bracegirdle. No, he had not. I came to him on the bridge about a quarter after nine. I was walking up the bridge with him. Coming from the foot of the bridge towards the middle of the bridge, two men came up and ran against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts on the bridge was this?</p>
               <p>Bracegirdle. It was between the second and third porch; I take that to be the second that is shut up; and it was a little beyond that, on the right hand side as you go out of Westminster towards the country. I was close to him when they came up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done?</p>
               <p>Bracegirdle. They ran up to him and I: one of them had a came in his hand. They had been running before, but they seemed to be out of breath; they were seemingly upon a little run. They both turned about, and one struck me on the head with a cane; the other began to beat Bigby with his hands. Bigby ran backwards and said, YO-I! and called for help a good while.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you done any thing to them?</p>
               <p>Bracegirdle. We neither of us had said a word to them; we were walking quietly along with our backs towards them. It was the shortest of them that struck Bigby. I have seen him since, and know him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Look about, see if you see him.</p>
               <p>Bracegirdle. That is the person that struck Bigby, in the blue clothes, ( pointing to Matthew Kennedy) and that is Patrick, in brown clothes, that struck me, (pointing to him.) Bigby ran back, and called for help. There came two more, I can't tell who they were. The tall one was beating of me; after he hit me with his cane he hit me with his hands. The other was following Bigby, and kept striking him at the same time, till the two men came up. One of them had something in his hand.

             took it out of his hand, and struck Bigby with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a thing was it?</p>
               <p>Bracegirdle. The end of it was square: it looked like iron, about a yard long. ( Describing the length of it with his hands) It was round on the other part of it. He knocked Bigby down.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to him when he was knocked down?</p>
               <p>Bracegirdle. I was not near so far from him at that time as I am from you. (Meaning the council, which was not six yards distant) The other of the men came up, and laid hold of me. I then had the came in my hand which I was first hit with: he said, Take it out of his hands and knock his brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man?</p>
               <p>Bracegirdle. I will not pretend to say I should know him. The other two prisoners look very much like the two persons that came up to the two Kennedys, but I will not pretend to swear to them. Bigby fell down flat on his back with his arms open, near me. When I was stooping to pick him up, one of the men gave me a blow over the back with something, I know not what. I had thrown the cane through the bannisters of the bridge.

Coming by the Bear at the bridge-foot, he struck the watchman over his forehead, and knocked him down. The watchman got up and went into the house. I could not hold the prisoner alone; he got away, and I went into the house also. Then I went to look for Bigby, and he was gone. Patrick is the tallest of the two Kennedys. I went to Bigby's house, then it was near ten o'clock, to see whether he was got home. I helped to carry him to the hospital.

            . I was a watchman on Westminster-bridge. I remember an outcry for assistance that night. I went upon the cry as far as the lower end of the bridge on the Westminster side; there was the constable of the bridge in at the Bear anointing his head. I was on the bridge; between nine and ten o'clock the tallest of the Kennedys was leaning against the side of the bridge, beyond the centre arch.</p>

               <p>Best. It is hard swearing. I cannot swear to the person. He gave me his hat to slap. I told him I could not do it. Then he said, D - n you give me my hat again. (This was at the third row from the centre). Said he, Unfortunate I am, and unfortunate I shall die. I said, Why do you say so? You seem a little in liquor, go home. He swore d - n me I should go home with him. I walked with him as far as the centre arch; he then said, D - n your blood, neither an Irishman nor a Scotchman will speak to an Englishman now. There were some gentlemen behind; they said, Why should an Irishman or a Scotchman be against speaking to an Englishman? He answered, D - n your eyes, give me a stick, I'll clear the gang-way of you all. Before I got to the bridge foot the watch word was given.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the watch word?</p>
               <p>Best. The watch word was YO-I. I went to the place as fast as I could, and found the constable that belongs to the bridge dressing his head in at the Bear. There was a mob in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were they that answered to this expression of his?</p>
               <p>Best. They were three or four well-dressed men.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the tallest of the Kennedys?</p>
               <p>Best. I heard the men say he that I saw was the tallest.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he wanted you to go home with him for protection?</p>
               <p>Best. I think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain of any thing that had been done to him?</p>

            . I am constable of Westminster-bridge. On the 24th of December I came from the watch-house about a quarter after nine down on the South side the bridge where this unfortunate fellow was knocked down, which was about twenty minutes after nine. I spoke to Bigby: there was a person with him. I said, Will you have a pint of beer along with the rest of the watchman? Aye, said he, I will be glad of it. I had not been gone above two minutes from him when I heard the watchman call out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210031"></xptr> the watch word YO-I! I returned back. This was about four or five lamps from the foot of the bridge, on the Westminster side. The poor man was lying there; I helped to take him up: we set him up against the bannisters. I asked him how he did: I could not understand him. He was taken from thence, and, in about a minute after came one of the Kennedys; he had been over towards the other end of the bridge, and was coming back again. He came and stood by me: there are two brothers of them: this was the eldest (Patrick ). He had boots on and a sort of a green coat. There were people coming over the bridge said to me. That is one of the men that knocked the man down. Said I, Are you sure of that? They said they were, and would take their oath of it. I called him directly. There were two of the watchmen took hold of him. We were taking him down to the watch-house; when we came about two yards from the Bear, there was a sort of a rescue. They gave me a blow on my head. (Showing a diagonal fear about the middle of his forehead about an inch and a half long ). I was under the surgeons hands about three weeks with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you taken him when this happened?</p>
               <p>Shillitoe. I believe I had got him about thirty yards. There was no moon at that time. I cannot tell who gave me the blow; a man came up and gave it me, and the prisoner got away. I was knocked down. They took me in at the Bear. Howson and another watchman were there at the time. Bigby never watched upon the bridge before that night.</p>

            . I was a watchman on Westminster-bridge on Christmas eve. About a quarter of an hour after nine I heard the watch word given YO-I. I looked round and saw the deceased on the ground. I crossed over to assist him: I asked what was the matter. A man made a snatch at my stick. I put it out of his way, and was knocked down; then I gave the watch word; there came assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that struck at you?</p>
               <p>Hewson. I do not know. He got away; after that the tall Kennedy (Patrick) came back from towards the other side of the water. There were people that said he was one of the men that struck the deceased. The constable took hold of him. I assisted to bring him down to the watch-house. Kennedy and I fell down. The constable went to secure him, and he was struck, and so was I, but by whom I know not. He got away, but was taken again in Channel-Row.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any lanthorns?</p>
               <p>Hewson. No, we had not. I saw the two Kennedys in the watch-house after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they sober?</p>
               <p>Hewson. They talked well: they might be a little disguised, but they talked sensible.</p>

            . I am a pupil at the Westminster informary, where the deceased was brought. He was put to bed as soon as possible in the infirmary. I examined his head: there was a very large wound on the back part of his head, and it was swelled a great deal. There was a contusion and a plain fracture appeared; the skull was divided: the man lived about two hours (hardly so much) after he was brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. What, in your opinion, was the cause of his death?</p>
               <p>Dickinson. He died of that wound he had received; there is no doubt of that. He was brought in between ten and eleven, nearer eleven than ten.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion this wound was given with?</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased the next day; and on examining his head I found a large confused wound on the back part, and round about much swelled. On dividing the scalp, the pericranium was covered with extravasated blood, and there was an oblique fracture which extended from the bottom of the us occipitis to the sagittal future of near seven inches in length. On dividing the skull I found the fracture had penetrated both tables,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210032"></xptr> and went down as low as the foremen magnum on the as occipitis; there was a large quantity of coagulated blood covering the whole surface of the brain; and that part of the dura-mater, which covers and contains the cerebellum, was almost full.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think this might come by a fall or a blow?</p>

               <p>We went to take a walk to Westminster-Abbey: we could not see any thing to our satisfaction: we met with an acquaintance of M'Mahon's, and he took us to that house to drink: he asked for a back room and we went in there. After we drank one half pint of brandy we had more. We had beer and three half crowns worth of punch, and a penny worth of tobacco. I wanted them to go home, and said, I would give them a glass at the bar going out. There Grant and I went to wrestling: I threw him down and he me: the people interested among us and we struck at them and they at us. I went out, and M'Mahon went in again for his came: I had neither cane or any thing in my hand. As soon as we came out of Palace-yard, I ran on the Surrey side of the bridge, and came back again, and heard murder cried out. I walked along: just as I was going along they pursued me. They got me into Palace-yard, knocked me down, and took away my hat and four guineas, some halfpence and silver and my watch: they ran off. I got up to run after them; not knowing my way, I got into a place, and was taken there. My brother cried murder, and he was taken along with me. They found neither stick nor any thing on me. They tied both our hands behind out backs, and carried us to the round-house. They brought a chairman along with them while I was in Tothill-fields Bridewell, and wanted me to give them money, and they would not appear against me. I took down directions to a man that used the Ship in Old Palace-yard, and those men could not be found.</p>
               <p>M'Mahon's Defence.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of December I dined at Mr. Kennedy's house, and we four agreed to take a walk to Westminster Abbey. We met with Grant: we asked him if he would come along with us to the Abbey; he said, Yes. It was so dark we could not see any thing. Grant knowing that public house took us in there, saying there were genteel people used there. Grant said he would have some brandy. We called for half a pint, a tankard of beer, and pipes and tobacco; after that we called for another half pint of brandy, and half a crown in punch. Mr. Kennedy went to the man of the house in the bar: he gave him a guinea, and desired him to give change. He took his reckoning. Mr. Kennedy said to us, Gentlemen, I'll treat you with a glass of shrub at the bar going out. Grant was going past; we all drank a glass each. Grant came into the tap room, and fell to pulling Mr. Kennedy about; Kennedy threw Grant down; Grant made a hideous noise, and said it was not fair, and would wrestle again. There was a black man and a brewer's servant. They came and interfered directly; they both made a blow at us; I was next to the door. I opened it, and Kennedy was the first that went out, and I after him, and the rest of our companions followed us. The house is a corner house, and,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210033"></xptr> instead of turning on the left we went strait on. I missed my cane, and went back for it; the gentlewoman gave it me. I went out to bid them all a good night. When I went out I heard a great noise in Palace-yard. When I came there, there were four fellows came up, and one of them knocked me down; who I do not know. Mr. Grant struck me in the face. I lost my hat some time, and at last I found it in the street. I lost my cane there. I desired Mr. Kennedy to make the best of our way, as their intent was to kill and rob us. We made the best of our way (not knowing our way) to Westminster-bridge. We went under an arch way: we all parted. Mr. Evans and I ran a-cross the foot of the bridge and to Channel-row. As we went round there Kennedy called to me, and said, There is a great mob that way, and you will be killed. We turned back again, and when we can to the foot of the bridge we could see nothing of them. I went thirty or forty yards from th of the bridge; there were four fellows came up, and said, Here is one of the Irish ves: somebody said, By G - d he has but a row escape for his life. The four struck at e one after another. I struggled some time; at last, as they could not knock me down, they made an attempt to take me by the breast: I put my hand out and shoved them off, and got a little wind, and off I set. There was another struck me at the foot of the bridge. I was knocked down. The man which I believe was one of the first fellows that came to me upon the bridge, was the man that made a blow at me: I moved from the blow, and the weapon that he had in his hand having no support, came to the ground. I took it up, and what should it be but this poker. There were fifty or sixty people, more or less, about it. I took it over my head, and turned upon my heel, and off I set as fast as I could, and made my escape, and never made a blow. I went to the Globe alehouse in the Strand, with the poker in my hand. Where did you get this? they said. I said I got it in Bridge-street.

When we came to Palace-yard we met Grant; he was acquainted with M'Mahon: he took us to the Abbey, and after that into Dean's-yard. I thought that was not our nearest way to go home. He asked us if we would drink; we agreed to it. He took us to that alehouse, and turned around, and said, What will you drink? A tankard of beer, I said; No, said he, we will not: he called for half a pint of brandy: after the brandy, half a crown bowl of punch: then he began to try which was strongest, by turning of hands. Mr. Kennedy and he went out into the tap-room. I heard a noise. I went; there were Kennedy and Grant on the ground. Grant got up, and then he threw Kennedy. The landlord and a black interfered in the affair: they struck at us several times. As soon as we could get out we made off. I did not know my way very well. People called, Stop thief! after us. They came and stopped some; and some they let pass. I went on. I looked back, and saw the coachman near them. I desired them to come along. I did not know my way home. I saw Mr. Kennedy and his brother going the wrong way, over the bridge. I called to them. I went down a paved alley, I think they call it Fishmonger's-alley, into Channel-row. I went home to the Globe, and left them all. There was old Mr. Kennedy. I asked him if his son were come home: I was told they were not. I went and waited at the door a little while. It occurred to my mind that there was somebody taken by the watch. I went to St. Margaret's watch-house; there I found Mr. Kennedy without his hat and his brother with him: he desired me to go home to bed. I went back to the Globe: M'Mahon was there. I told him the affair: there were four or five of us went in a coach to bail them. I lent Patrick my hat. The bail could not be taken. When we came back, said M'Mahon, I do not know what to do with this poker; I am ashamed to carry it to my lodgings. I took and carried it home. I was playing at cards with my brother when the people came; I desired them to walk in; then they took me, and I was committed to New Prison.</p>

            . On that Sunday evening<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210034"></xptr> I was going towards Lambeth, over Westminster-bridge; I believe it was about ten o'clock; I heard some noise upon the bridge, inclining to the right hand side as I went over. I saw a man dressed in dark-coloured clothes, either black or brown, strike a watchman. He was a large man, something larger than I am. (This evidence was much bigger than the tallest of the prisoners ) He had a slouch'd hat on; I stood within a yard and a half of him. There were a croud of people, and a great noise occasioned me to stop to look. I met that gentleman, named

               <p>Q. Do you take upon you upon your oath to say he was not the person that knocked down the watchman?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. I can say that. He had no weapon to strike him with; he was coming from Lambeth side towards Bridge-street: I saw him coming just as the man was knocked down, and they cried out murder. It was neither of the other three that knocked the man down, nor none of their size: he was more corpulent and taller than any man at the bar.</p>

               <p>* That Bear-and-ragged-staff is in Christ-church parish, within a furlong of the foot of Black-friars bridge.</p>

               <p>Culvertson. I had been to several other acquaintances; I had been at the Globe in the Strand, and at the One Tun, and other places. I met with a great many acquaintance that detained me.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts on the bridge was the man knocked down?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. It was clear of the pavement; rather nigh the middle of the way. There was a great croud about him. I saw the man raise up his hand with a stick and strike him.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he come at him for the croud?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. The people seemingly made way for him to knock him down. As soon as murder was called, I turned back the way I came; and when I came to Channel-row, the prisoner ran by me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you stopped before the watchman was knocked down?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. Near five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between the two men?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. There was a great noise and a great many words between them, but I could not understand them.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it was a watchman?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. Because the people said it was a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a lanthorn and staff in his hand?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. He had a lanthorn and stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his lanthorn and stick?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. Some people said he had a lanthorn and stick in his hand; that was when it was all over.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his lanthorn?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. I can't say I did, for the croud of people.</p>

               <p>Culvertson. I did; I have seen him at the Globe in the Strand, but I never drank with him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light or a dark night?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. It was a very dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first give notice of this to any of the Kennedy's friends?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. On New-year's-day I spoke to old Mr. Kennedy. I went to the Globe in order to tell him. I was told by Morris Corner he was their father. There was an account of a watchman being killed on Westminster-bridge, and one Kennedy being robbed of his money and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210035"></xptr> watch; and for people to come to give an account of what they knew.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people do you think there might be round the man when he was knocked down?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. There might be fifty or sixty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did no body attempt to take the man?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. He ran away towards the Surry side directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did no body run after him?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. Some ran and some walked.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John. I had a transaction last night with some people, which I think very material with regard to Bracegirdle. I had reason to think there was an attempt to prevent justice. I had frequently heard there had been offers made by him, that if they would give him a certain sum of money which he had specified, he would not give evidence. Hearing this, I desired the relation of these Kennedys would send Bracegirdle to me, that I might have some conversation with him. Last night there was a single knock at my door; no servant being at home, I opened the door myself; there I saw three very ill looking people. I was afraid to trust myself in their hands. I went out of the house with them, and called at Mr. Murphy's chambers, who was not at home. Resolving not to trust myself with them, they having a very suspicious appearance, I took the resolution of going with these three people to another gentleman's chambers, in order that he might be witness of what passed between us; that they might see I had done nothing that should impeach my conduct. When we came into the room I did not say a single, word that should be construed as a proposal from me. I said, Gentlemen, have you some proposal to make to me? if you have, let me hear, then I shall know how to act. There was Bracegirdle and two others. One of these people said, You know upon the account of Mr. Kennedy. I said, Who are you? He said, I am a friend of the witnes's. I then said, If you are only a friend of the witnes's, I had rather hear from the witness himself than you. I could get nothing from the witness himself for some time; it is evident he had some intention of making some proposal. I could not get from him his business for some time, till at last the other man interested, and said, Sir, it is about the Kennedys that are in prison, and you know, some satisfaction - I said, I did not know what that meant: what is your proposal, and what do you mean? He after some time said, He had for a long time lost his labour, not been able to apply to his business, and he thought it was very hard - and at last it came out 10 l. Upon which I said to Bracegirdle, Do you mean then from what I have heard from this man and yourself to make a proposal to me? You will refrain from giving evidence, if I will give you 10 l.? He said, Yes, I do, that is the proposal. Upon which I said, You have made application to me of a nature extremely criminal, with intent to obstruct justice; upon which I declined all conference, and departed.</p>
               <p>Q. Of whom had you this account of this application having been made?</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John. From one of the relations of the Kennedys that was known to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether that relation had application made to them by Bracegirdle?</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John. They said application had frequently been made, I should rather believe, not by Bracegirdle himself.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had another witness, but he is decoyed away, and I can't find him.</p>

            . I am attorney-general of the island of St. John's. M'Mahon came to England<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210036"></xptr> with me from Ireland. I never found a more in offensive lad in my life. Upon the account of my informing him of the ways of London, he seldom went out. I could have trusted him with all I had. Upon my oath, I never saw him drunk. If he had continued in my service, he must have gone abroad, and he did not chuse that, and he was recommended to be a clerk to an auctioneer.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Coppleston. I have known M'Mahon fourteen months. He lodged at my house, and behaved exceeding well, as quiet a man as ever came into a house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Benson. I am an auctioneer. I have known M'Mahon about twelve months; he lived with me as a clerk that time. He was sober and diligent, and greatly respected.</p>

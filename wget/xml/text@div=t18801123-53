Wilson, manager to Messrs. Mann, Crossman, and Paulin, telling us he had received it from that firm—the order is for a 2-inch regulator, price 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believed the order to be genuine—he pleaded poverty, and said he should be very much obliged if I would pay him the commission on that order at once—the commission was 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I had advanced him on a cheque which he asked me to cash, and which I refused to do—that left 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to be paid to him on that order—I paid him the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and hold the receipt.

                  </hi>. I live at Snaresbrook, and am manager to Messrs.

             sworn. - I am a watchman to Messrs. Wood and Company's coal-wharf, at the bottom of Northumberland-street; I have known the prisoner at the bar for several years: On the 11th of May, about five in the afternoon, I saw them shove a peter-boat, which is the property of Griffin; they put this peter-boat out from York-buildings; they shoved the peter-boat to the Black-lion causeway, that goes up to Charles-court, where they both reside; Griffin went up the court, and shortly returned with a basket; they both rowed down the river together. I went over to inform Mr. Butt, the officer, and desired him and Richardson to watch their return; and we went about twelve o'clock, that was the time of the return of the tide; I waited for them till they returned, about one o'clock in the night, as near as I can tell; we all three of us were close upon the stairs, waiting for them; they came to the back of the Black lion public-house, adjoining to the stairs where we were; and they put out some deals from the boat, and then they put their boat back again to the upper side of the causeway, and put this basket, with a chain,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230019"></xptr>out upon the causeway that I was going down; then they put their boat back, and fastened it close to a house built upon a barge; then they returned to the basket, and both stood by it for some little time; then Jones came up to the foot of the stairs apparently to see if the way was clear; I suspected he saw us there; he looked and said, a hoy! a hoy! I then said, lay hold of him, Richardson then laid hold of him; Mr. Butt and I immeditely jumped up and secured Griffin and the basket; immediately as we went down to the basket, Butt said to Griffin, what have you got here; Griffin said, a basket of chains; he asked him where he got it; he said, he got it out of Mr. Bailey's sailing boat, Jones was within hearing at the same time, in custody of Richardson; he said, he was going to carry it ashore for safety; he said, he had the care of Mr. Bailey's boat; we secured them in the watch-house; and the next day, Mr. Bailey came to the watch-house, and asked Griffin what brought him there; Griffin said, it was for a piece of chain that he had found; Mr. Bailey asked him again, how he came by the chain, and he told him that one of their anchors run foul of it; Mr. Bailey said, he had no chains.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, had their boat any anchor? - A. No, nor grapling, nor any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see Mr. Hillier, the prosecutor? - A. Yes, I shewed him the chain, it has been in my possession ever since. (Produces the chain.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Hillier. I am sure it is my property.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. About twenty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Under forty shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- RICHARDSON sworn. - I was present when the prisoners were detected; I laid hold of one of them, and secured him. The account they gave of it was exactly what the last witness has stated</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones's defence. We were plied by a West-country barge, to tow her up to Putney, we agreed for five shillings; and then rowed back home. I never saw the basket nor chain either till Mr. Went brought it upon his shoulder, in the basket, to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Griffin's defence. I went with Jones up to Putney; I never saw the basket or the chain either.</p>

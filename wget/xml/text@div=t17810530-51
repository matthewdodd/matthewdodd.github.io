             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Aldersgate-street. I am a <rs id="t17810530-51-viclabel233" type="occupation">working-stationer and vellum-binder</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17810530-51-victim505 t17810530-51-viclabel233"></join>. I saw this advertisement in the Daily Advertiser of the 1st of March last. (It is read.)</p>
               <p>"MONEY READY.</p>
               <p>"A Gentleman of strict honour and integrity, who has upwards of 3000 l. unemployed, would willingly advance the same, or any part of it not less than 300 l. to any Lady or Gentleman of fortune and character, with the utmost secrecy and dispatch, and on terms agreeable to the nature of the security. Principals only will be treated with, by applying or addressing to S. F. at the Globe tavern, Hatton-street, Hatton-garden."</p>
               <p>In consequence of this advertisement, I went to the Globe tavern. I asked if the principal was to be spoke with. The landlord of the house said he was not there; but, if I pleased, he would give me his address. He said his name was Alvarez, and he lived at No. 30, Skinner-street, Bishopsgate-street. I went there. The second<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300049"></xptr> morning; I saw the prisoner. I asked him if he was the principal who had the money to lend. He said he was not the principal, but he was employed by several gentleman of fortune and character to lend their money. We went together to Bread-street coffee-house. We had a couple of dishes of coffee there. He said he must enquire my character; and if he approved of it, I might have what money I pleased. We parted then. In a day or two after, Mr. Alvarez came to my house in Aldersgate-street. He told me he had enquired my character, and liked it well; and I might have what money I pleased. I told him I wanted but 200 l. He then asked me what I dealt in. I shewed him. He gave me an order for a groce of gentlemen's pocketbooks with instruments/ I thought it a very large order. I said it was so large an order, I could not undertake to execute it. He said he would give me time. I said I could not execute it till he let me have the money, but it should be forwarded against he let me have the money ready. On the 12th of March, Mr. Alvarez came to me. I was called down from dinner. He took me to the Half-moon tavern, in Aldersgate-street. He called for pen, ink, and paper; and asked for my draughts. He said I could not have less than 400 l. I was greatly surprised at his asking for my draughts; I said I expected to give a bond for the money. He said it was all the same; the Gentleman did not wish to put me to so much expence, he would take my draughts. I then drew four notes. After they were drawn, he said the Gentleman was extremely angry he had not brought the premium with him: he must have part. He desired to have three guineas. I gave him three guineas, as part of the premium. The next day he came for two guineas more, for part of the premium. I gave him two guineas. Three days after, he came again, and pressed me for five guineas more; he said he could not do without it, and must have it. So I gave him five guineas. I gave him thirty-one guineas for premium, in part.</p>
               <p>Did you ever receive the 400 l.? - I never saw the colour of his money: I received no part of it. On the 28th of March he sent for me to the Vine tavern, in Holborn. There he told me he was come to finish my business. He desired me to bring all my accounts of the different monies he had received, and of the goods he had had of me, which was 109 l. 10 s. 1 d. I went and gave him all this account in one bill of parcels. He desired to see how much he was in my debt; in the whole it was 551 l. 10 s. 9 d. He had given me two or three notes of hand for the different notes and money.</p>
               <p>That does not accord with the idea of this money to be given as a premium. - That money is not in that account. He gave me a note for the 400 l. and the 109 l. worth of goods he gave me a note for at three days, which he was to come and take up in three days. There was 26 lb. of tobacco I bought for him, which I had not put into the bill of parcels. After he gave me that note, he said, if I would get a bit of fish for supper, he would come and sup with me that evening, and bring the money. This was upon the 28th of March. He did not come in the evening; but at nine at night he sent me a note, that he could not get the money, and could not come till eleven next morning, when he would call upon me. I saw no more of him, till I received a note from him to come to him at a spunging-house. I went. He there told me I must lend him 70 l. or he could not get me the money. That was in the beginning of April. He sent for me then to the Windmill, in Rosemary-lane: he said he was arrested by

            , the person who had these goods in his possession, and if I would lend him that 70 l. he would get the four hundred-pound notes back again; that Mr. Barnet had got my notes, and kept them for money that he owed him. I told him I would have nothing more to do with him; and left him. While I was in there, Mr. Menham, a Gentleman he says he expects, was there in company with him; he went out of the room. I had a friend there. Mr. Alvarez and my friend had some words. I desired my friend to go out of the room, while Alvarez and I settled the business. Alvarez wanted 70 l. more of me. I would not give it: I thought he had had enough. He then called the landlord of the house in. I paid 10 l. to that Mr. Menham, of Fenchurch-street, for giving me up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300050"></xptr> four 100 l. notes, on the 7th of April; and Mr. Menham then obtained a promissory note from me for 5 l. 15 s. which I have been troubled for to-day.</p>
               <p>How came you to give him the note for 5 l. 15 s.? - He said he had been at a great expence in getting these notes back, and expected some satisfaction for himself for taking all this trouble to serve me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Are these two papers your hand-writing? - They are both. I received these when I gave Menham the 10 l. and 5 l. 15 s. It is a receipt Menham or Alvarez wrote, and I signed it.</p>
               <p>You said it was in consequence of this advertisement you found out Mr. Alvarez? - It was.</p>
               <p>I believe upon your meeting you agreed to give him four promissory notes of hand? - I did; and I did do so.</p>
               <p>What had you by way of counter-security? - His promissory note for 400 l. He was to bring me the money for that on the 7th of April. I saw he never intended to pay me, and wished to get my own notes back.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you might think it would affect your credit to have these notes out? - I was determined not to pay them without I had value for them.</p>
               <p>You then applied to Alvarez for your notes? - No; to Menham: he was the person who applied to me about getting them back.</p>
               <p>Then you found yourself desirous of getting back these notes? - When I found I should not get the money.</p>
               <p>Your notes were not then due? - No.</p>
               <p>Those notes you are now in possession of? - I am.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect having a variety of dealings with Alvarez? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I understand you have given several premiums? - That is that I call upon him for now.</p>
               <p>The intent of giving these premiums was for the purpose of his raising the money? - It was.</p>
               <p>Within what time had Alvarez contracted with you to raise the money? - Within 12 days.</p>
               <p>At what distance from first seeing him was it you required these notes to be delivered up? - About a fortnight or three weeks after his note of 400 l. was due, and I found I should not get the money.</p>
               <p>Was you not told by Alvarez, that his principal, who had employed him in this business, upon discovering your name, did not very much approve of your notes? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you he was employed by a Mr.

               <p>Do you recollect, at any time after you had given the notes, and before they were delivered up to you, going to Alvarez, and desiring him at any rate whatever to raise you some money? - No.</p>
               <p>And if he could not get all the notes passed, to get one or two passed? - No; I positively deny that.</p>
               <p>Who was present when you settled? - Nobody but Mr. Menham.</p>
               <p>Did you make any complaint upon the settlement? - None at all.</p>
               <p>You was perfectly satisfied with the transaction? - I was perfectly satisfied that I had the notes back again; I was very happy that I should not have them to pay, as I had never received any value for them.</p>
               <p>Did not you strike a balance of all matters and accounts that were then between you? - There were no questions asked about any thing. There is a receipt I signed there, which is for the notes Mr. Alvarez gave me.</p>
               <p>Upon the 7th of April all accounts of all matters and bills were settled between you? - Yes, but the bills had not been paid.</p>
               <p>You had them in your pocket; you had requested to have them delivered up? - Yes, but I requested to have the money back again that Alvarez had obtained of me for a premium.</p>
               <p>Is not the premium now made part of your settlement? - No.</p>
               <p>If he had raised the money, the premium he was entitled to? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The reason of your not receiving the money was because you received the notes back? - I got them back because I could not get the money.</p>

            , with one of Douglas's notes; Mr. Alvarez bought some goods of Mr. Barnet, and gave him this bill in payment. Barnet would not deliver the goods to Alvarez till he had spoken to Douglas himself, to find if Douglas was a good man: Mr. Barnet came to Mr. Douglas, and he told him.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. Was you there? - No: but I shall tell you what Mr. Douglas has told me: he said it was his note, and he would pay it when due: all his notes were honourable bills; when Mr. Alvarez came with the second bill to Mr. Barnet, which had, to the best of my knowledge, to run about nine months.</p>
               <p>Do you know what was done with the first bill? - I have heard Mr. Barnet mention, but not else.</p>
               <p>He wanted more goods upon the second bill of 100 l.? - He took 32 l. worth of goods upon the second bill, and gave Barnet orders to deliver the remainder: a few days after, he wanted to lay the second bill out with Barnet, as cash for goods.</p>
               <p>Tell the conversation that passed between Alvarez and Douglas, upon the 7th of April. - Mr. Douglas came to my house, and delivered to me a bill for 440 l. or 540 l.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what conversation passed between Douglas and Alvarez? - Yes: Douglas promised to pay me for my trouble: the meeting was at one Mr. Smith's, an officer's house, in Rosemary Lane, about eleven or twelve at night.</p>
               <p>How long had you been Mr. Douglas's friend? - From the time I went to know if this bill was his hand-writing, I was employed by Mr. Douglas; and when Alvarez found Douglas had been at my house, and desired me to settle the matter, I made an appointment with Mr. Alvarez to meet Douglas; so Alvarez appointed Mr. Smith's, in Rosemary Lane, to meet at: I sent Douglas word to meet there; Douglas did not come at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did Alvarez, when you were together, at this settlement, tell Douglas, that if he would be patient, he could raise him the money upon these notes? - Mr. Alvarez had 132 l. from Barnet, and goods.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether any part of that money was given to Douglas? - I do not know: Douglas mentioned to me he had lent him 30 l. I was present; Alvarez told Douglas he had parted with his bills, and could not get any money upon them, but 132 l.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Alvarez tell Douglas that he had received 132 l. upon two of his bills? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You venture to swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who was present when he told Douglas so? - Douglas and I were present: there was another gentleman present, a friend of Mr. Douglas; but he bid him go out.</p>
               <p>Was he, the other gentleman, present when Alvarez told Douglas he had received 132 l. for his notes? - No: Alvarez and Douglas bid us to go out of the room; they had something to say to themselves they did not care any other gentleman should hear.</p>
               <p>Court. Mind the question I ask you: who was present when Alvarez told Douglas he had 132 l. upon his notes? - Douglas himself told me so when he went away from Alvarez, about twelve at night.</p>
               <p>Did you hear Alvarez tell Douglas so? - I was not in the same room.</p>
               <p>The question I now ask you, requires no other answer than yes or no: Did you yourself hear Alvarez tell Douglas that he had received 132 l. upon his notes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What answer did Douglas make to that? - Mr. Douglas said he had nothing to say; that as he could not give him any money, he meant to have his bills from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300052"></xptr>How could Douglas say that, when he had said he had 132 l. upon his notes? - Alvarez said he would get his bills out of the hands of Barnet in a few days.</p>

               <p>Then he did not pretend he had got this money of Barnet? - He had it in goods; and Douglas could not make use of the goods: and when he got the money to pay Barnet again, he meant to get the bills out of Barnet's hand, as Barnet would not advance any more money upon them?</p>
               <p>Did Douglas approve of this use being made of his notes when Alvarez told him that? - Douglas answered, he should not pay Barnet; he should not pay any body: and meant to have his goods back again: and if he could not pay him what goods he had received of Douglas, he should give him security more: he said, if you cannot raise any money, give me the goods you have got of me; if you are put in a non-plus about it, give me my goods back again that you have got. After this was mentioned to Douglas, Douglas went away with the other gentleman in a great passion, and said he should take his own time, only to get his bills as soon as possible. When I went away, Douglas begged favours of me; and said, he would pay me for my trouble, if I could get these bills again without any blemish upon them. I went to Alvarez, and told him he should get the bills out, or there would be bad consequences.</p>
               <p>He wanted his bills back again then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he want the premium back too? - No. He mentioned nothing of the premium. He mentioned that he had lent him money to the amount of 30 l. sometimes 3 l. at a time, sometimes 5 l.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Alvarez present? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he deny it? - No. He did not deny that he lent him the money.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Was that money lent by Douglas to Alvarez? - I know no more than Douglas told me, that he lent him the money, and had his note for it.</p>
               <p>Did you hear what Alvarez was to have of Douglas for his trouble, if he raised the money? - I heard nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a gentleman, Sir.</p>
               <p>No other business? - Yes. A merchant.</p>
               <p>A gentleman merchant? a merchant in what? - In what I can buy to get money by.</p>
               <p>One of those merchants we meet about the streets? - No. You are greatly mistaken. I am a man who sends goods abroad.</p>
               <p>Abroad in the street, you mean? - I am a merchant who has suffered a great deal here in this country.</p>
               <p>And if you stay here many years longer, you will suffer more in this country, in all probability. You were the friend of Mr. Douglas? - Mr. Douglas sent me, as his friend.</p>
               <p>And you, a capital merchant, employed by a friend, expect to be paid for doing him a service? - I have been hunting about for Douglas for seven or eight days.</p>
               <p>Then one of the merchandizes you deal in, is friendship, which you sell. You sold some of your friendship to Mr. Douglas? - I sold him some he has not paid me for yet.</p>
               <p>He gave you a note? - He gave me 10 l. in cash, and 5 l. 15 s. to give Barnet. He lent it Alvarez; and Alvarez gave me a note for the balance he owed Douglas.</p>
               <p>Court. For whose use was that fifteen guineas you received of Douglas? - For Mr. Alvarez, and for the use of Mr. Barnet.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, that the 5 l. 15 s. was not for your trouble? - No.</p>
               <p>Is not the name of Mr. Smith, at the Rosemary-Branch, Jeremiah? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You said you heard Alvarez tell Mr. Douglas about having received 132 l. from Barnet. You mentioned first of all, that a gentleman was present: was that gentleman present at the house? - No. We were out in the other room. They bid us go out in the other room.</p>
               <p>Then you did not hear them say it? - Mr. Douglas and Mr. Alvarez mentioned it to me.</p>
               <p>But you told his Lordship, that you heard Alvarez tell Douglas, that he had received 132 l.? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman was there then? - No. He was affronted with Mr. Alvarez, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300053"></xptr> would not go in. I was called in as the friend of Mr. Douglas.</p>
               <p>Then you did not know Alvarez before? - No; we were not acquainted.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you swear you did not know Alvarez before this transaction? - Yes, I knew him.</p>
               <p>Then why do you hesitate about it? - I might know him by sight. I had no connection with him.</p>
               <p>Did not you know him very well before this? - I did not know him very well.</p>
               <p>How long had you known him? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Had you known him a week, or half a dozen years? - I did not know him half a dozen years, nor three neither. I cannot tell, upon my oath, how long I knew him.</p>
               <p>You can tell the difference between a week and a year? - I knew him longer than a week, but can't say that I knew him a year.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear you had not known him a year before this transaction? - I cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that you knew Douglas at all before this business? - No.</p>
               <p>You knew Alvarez a twelvemonth before, but had never seen Douglas before; how came you to meet to settle the business between Alvarez and Douglas, as Douglas's friend? - Mr. Barnet sent me to Douglas, to hear if this was his hand-writing; and Douglas called me up into his room.</p>
               <p>Court. And adopted you for his friend immediately?</p>
               <p>Counsel. You heard nothing of these premiums? - No: I heard Douglas say Alvarez came to him at different times, and he lent him money.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any transaction between Alvarez and Douglas? - I know nothing about it; but on May the 1st or 2d I went to Leadenhall-street: Alvarez came to meet me. I went to drink with him. I went with him as far as Aldersgate-street. He said, Do me a favour: I have a little transaction with one Mr. Douglas. I went to Douglas, and told him, as Alvarez desired, that Alvarez would be glad to see him. I went to Douglas. He said he would come to him. He came. They drank together. Douglas said, We are friends now together, but I could ruin you. I have a note of 400 l. odd: I could ruin you: but you shall have it back again. Alvarez said, As we are friends together, I will call upon you tomorrow; and for the goods I have had of you, I can pay you in seven weeks. He called next morning and took the goods, and paid him a note for 161 or 2 l.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any talk about 400 l.? - He said he had got his notes up, and the other notes he had got by him.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any talk about 400 l. - I heard nothing about that.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>I have the pleasure often of meeting you in different courts: how many years has Alvarez been acquainted with Menham? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>They live near together, don't they? - He lives at No. 30, Skinner-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not take that money as a premium.</p>

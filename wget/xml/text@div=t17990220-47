            . I had the letting of the house, and had a person in the house to take care of it. The prisoner called upon me on the 3d of December last, and said, he had seen a house, which I had to let, in Great Ormond-street; he asked me the rent; I told him, it was 60I. a year; he said, that was too much, as it was considerably out of repair; and he made the objection, that it was too near a baker's shop; he said, it would could cost him 100l. to repair it; but he said, if I would take 55I. a year, he would take it upon a lease for twenty one years, but he said, he must have immediate possession; that he would get workmen in it directly, to repair it, ready to receive his son, whom he expected from the East-Indies, he did not know how soon, and whom he had not seen these twenty years; he said, his son had married a black wife, and had children by her, which he very much lamented; but he said, if his son was happy, he should be soon reconciled to the colour; I agreed to take the 55I. a year for twenty-one years, and told him, that there should be an agreement drawn up; he pretended to be in a great hurry that evening, but I told him, I could soon write it out; and asked him his address; he told me, he lived at Tottenham-high-cross, that he had a house there, where he went every night to sleep; I drew up the agreement, which he was very much pleased at, as it would save him the expence of employing an attorney; he signed it, and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your agreement on a stamp? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he drest at that time? - A. He had silk breeches on, and a kind of snuff coloured coat, and a buff coloured waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he altogether the appearance of a respectable man? - A. Yes; I took him to be a man of considerable property. The next day, the 1st of January, he came into possession of the house; on the 4th of January, I sent a messenger to enquire after him, but could not get any intelligence; on the 9th of January, I went myself to Tottenham-high-cross, but could not find any such person; as I was returning home, I called at the first turnpike,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200047"></xptr>and made enquiry there, but could not find him out.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you deliver him the possession? - A. No; Gray, another witness, who had the care of the house, did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hart. Q. Were you present when the prisoner was taken into custody? - A. Yes, I was. Upon my return from Tottenham-high-cross, I sent three of my men with a second key, and upon their return, I went to Bow-street; that was on the 9th; in the evening, they got two officers, who went with me to Ormond-street; he was in the street, but seeing us, he did not attempt to go in; I said to the officers, this is the person that has taken the house, and they immediately secured him; I asked him, where the keys of the house were; he said, he had left them behind him. We took him into the baker's shop, searched him, and found the keys upon him; two of my men then went into the house to examine it, Thomas Ash and

            ; then we took the prisoner to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his appearance at the time he was taken? - A. Very shabby; much as he is now.</p>
               <p>Q. Very different from his dress when he took the house? - A. Yes; he was very dirty, and one of his fingers tied up; I found some blood upon the lead in the house, and I found a chissel in his pocket. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. Upon the oath you have taken, is not the coat that I have on now, the very coat that I came to you in that evening? - A. I do not think it is; he had a great coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. I have not wore a great coat for years; the dress altogether that I have on now, is literally the same as it then was; I had none to change it with- Did you not present a pistol to me? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>PETER GRAY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Manton put me in possession of this house in Ormond street; I quitted possession on the 31st of December in the evening; Mr. Manton told me, in the front shop, that he had let the house to that gentleman, the prisoner was then with Mr. Manton; Mr. Manton asked me if I could leave it the next day; I told him I did not know that I could; however, the next day I went and got a lodging, and, in returning to Ormond-street with a carter, I met the prisoner; I told him I was going to leave the house, and he told me, I declare you have been very expeditious; I left the key at Mr. Clarke's a baker, the next door, at the express desire of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q.When you left possession of the house, how were the leaden sinks? - A.Within five minutes of my leaving the house, I saw them all safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these leaden sinks in doors or out of doors? - A. In the kitchen and wash-house; Mr. Manton sent me down with a padlock to fasten up the house, Ash and Whitelamb went with me; I opened the door, Mr. Manton had delivered me a second key, which he had not given up; Ash went to light a candle, it was dark; I staid in the hall about two minutes, and the prisoner came out of the back kitchen into the hall; I apologized for coming to him, that it was Mr. Manton's order; he went to take hold of the key that I had in my hand, and said, he was glad that I had come, because I put him in possession of the second key; I told him I came to the house in consequence of his not being found at Tottenham-high-cross, where he had given his address; he took the key, and put his hand gently to my shoulder, as if to push me out, and I went out; Ash and Whitelamb were standing at the door, and then he shut the door and shut us out; there is one thing which I omitted, which is, that he said he had got some chairs into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any chairs in the house? - A. No, I could find none.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of your companions say any thing to him? - A. Yes, as near as I can recollect, Ash told him Mr. Manton wished for his address.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after he shut the door? - A. After he came out along with us, Ash told him Mr. Manton wanted to see him, as he wished to have the lease made out; he said, he should very likely wait on Mr. Manton that night; Ash told him, Mr. Manton wanted his address; he said, he lived at Tottenham-high-cross; he asked him, where; he replied, at the further end; he asked him what he should say to Mr. Manton, as he wanted to make out the lease, whether he was a gentleman or a tradesman; he answered, neither; the prisoner then walked away towards Lamb's-conduit-street, and Ash and me stopped a few minutes, while Whitelamb went about some other business; in the course of our stopping, he returned again; Mr. Ash then stopped him, and said, in case he should not wait upon Mr. Manton, could he see him to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go the next day with the officers? - A. Yes; we went into the house, and found a piece of leaden pipe in the hall, that I am positive was not there when we went in first.</p>
               <p>Q. The same night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might that be? - A.About two feet, as near as I can guess, or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see from what part of the house that had been taken? - A. From the back kitchen; I was there when the officers fitted it; I am positive it was cut off with a saw, it had the appearance of being fresh cut; in the wash-house the sink was ripped off the wood work, and entirely taken away; two sash weights were gone from one of the stair-case windows; there were fifteen door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200048"></xptr>locks in the house that had been taken off; I went into every room in the house; I suppose there were about two hundred pounds weight of lead removed, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was secured, did you observe his hands? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. As near as you can state, what was my dress at the time I took the house? - A. I did not take any particular notice of his dress; he seemed to me to have his hair frizzed out at the sides.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you hear him represent himself to Mr. Manton as a gentleman of fortune? - A. It did not occur in the front shop, while I was there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.When the officers came, did you not see a pistol in the hand of Mr. Manton? - A. I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not see the officers box me in the face, and knock me down? - A. I did see the officers strike you, and I held their arms.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he make any resistance? - A. None that I saw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there not many locks in the house that wanted keys? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of them were brass locks? - A.Three.</p>
               <p>Q. And how many handles were deficient? - A. None, to my knowledge; it might be so, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ASH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Hart. I was in company with the last witness on the 9th of January; I know no more than he does.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WHITELAMB sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am servant to Mr. Manton; I went with the two last witnesses to Ormond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any lead removed from the place where it stood? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the hands of the prisoner? - A. Yes, I observed a rag round one of his fingers, and bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any appearance of blood upon any part of the lead? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am a poor, weak man, unacquainted with the law touching the situation. I now stand in; I have always understood, from the earliest of my manhood, that if I entered into a contract between a lettor and a lettee, I thought that, after an agreement for twenty-one years to repair a house, or lay out any sum that I liked upon it, while the rent was paid, it was as a complete freehold. This I ever understood to be the law of this country, and if I am wrong, I am very sorry for it. As to my representing myself as living at Tottenham-high-cross, suffer me to observe, I have a wife, the daughter of a merchant in the City of London, who has resided upwards of twenty years in Church-street, Stoke Newington, at a Mr. Field's; I always was taught to consider that as my home. Mr. Manton did not ask me my name or place of abode till he had wrote six lines, and as my wife lived there, and was going to live at Tottenham-high-cross, that was the direction I gave. I have been a character well known in the world, and have carried on a great business; Mr. Manton did not ask any reference; had he said, you are a stranger to me, I must request a reference, I would have referred him to Mr. Long and Mr. Hall, two gentlemen in Finsbury-square, who pay my wife her annuity quarterly. As Mr. Manton waved any enquiry touching a reference, I conceived myself in a state of safety in doing what I did, putting Tottenham-high-cross, as it was to be the residence of my wife, and will be at Lady-day. If I have committed a fraud, it has not been intentional; the work-people were going to be put into the house when they took me; what I was employed in was measuring the height and extent of the rooms, which I meant to have painted and put in order. It is very true I told Mr. Manton I had an only son that had been at Bengal above twenty years ago, and who is now safe arrived at Lisbon; he wrote to me, wishing I would provide for him a reception in London, and I thought that a house of 55l. a year would do very well for him who was so well able to pay it, as I am told. Mr. Manton has been pleased to represent me as a gentleman; it has all arisen from Mr. Manton's own want of caution; he never asked a reference, which, if he had, I would have given him. I considered it as exceedingly ridiculous in me to make any further scruple of accepting the premises, as he seemed so remarkable slack in asking a reference; my dress was the same, and I believe, the whole would not fetch half-a-crown. This is the first time I have erred upon such a ground. I am sorry if I have intruded upon your Lordship's humanity in hearing me so long; but I conceive it must be proved by some witness, that I was seen aiding or abetting in carrying away the articles charged in the indictment to the satisfaction of your Lordship and those twelve independent gentlemen who are to decide upon my deliverance. My Lord, I take it by virture of such an indenture as is contained in the articles of lease between landlord and tenant, if this is to be called a felony, it would stretch the very vitals of the constitution. If, instead of three windows, I had chose to have made them all into one bow-window, I conceive I had a right to do it. I have seen a great deal of the world, and have done business for the nobility and some of the first families in England, Scotland, and Ireland.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Have you any witnesses?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no witnesses but God and the truth to support me. GUILTY (Aged 67.)</p>

On Sunday night, just about six o'clock, I was sitting at the window, I saw the two prisoners some behind the chapel, to the front window where I was sitting; they were in conversation together, but not very near together; when they came in the square opposite of the window the boy turned to the lost and me other to the right; they were in conversation when they came round the corner. The boy turned to the left and the other turned to go to the bottom of the square; they turned and came nearer together and went to the bottom of the buildings; I saw nor heard no more of them till the alarm was given that they were thieves.</p>
               <p>Q. You went there and pointed out Brown as being with him - A. Yes; I am positive sure that Brown was with him, and I am positive sure of both.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the boy Smith - A. Yes, I saw him sitting at Mr. Tancred's window; the sash was open, one leg was in and the other out; he had the appearance as though he was trying to get out.</p>

               <p>Smith's Defence. I came out of my mother's house about half after five o'clock on Sunday evening; my mother had an own sister that lived with her; all of a sudden she left my mother and went to live in Lincoln's inn; I work at coal heaving; I had only an opportunity to go to look after her of a Sunday; I went to this house, knocked at the door, and asked if a person lived there of the name of Smith; she said, no; and directly called out thieves.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. About three months ago I returned from sea; I went to work at Mr. Fellow's, Blossom street, Spitalfields; my master discharged me upon his death bed; I had some prize money to take; I had lost my prize certificate; on this day I was told that if I went to Swan yard, I should see an officer belonging to the ship that was invalided, where I should get my ticket again; I went through this inn, Clement's inn I think it is; they told me it was the best way to go to Somerset house; I heard the cry of stop thief; I went to see what it was: they took hold of me, and said that is him; the prisoner Smith I never saw before with my eyes till they brought him out.</p>

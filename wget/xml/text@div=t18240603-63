            . My husband went out in the morning - I went after him, and returned at seven o'clock in the morning, lighted the fire, and put the watch into a box wrapped in a counterpane; I did not lock the box - I locked the door; the window of that room was a little open; a person could get in at it. We have three rooms, all on the ground floor; I went home again at eleven o'clock, and again at ten minutes after five; opened the bedroom door, and went to the box - the counterpane was safe, but the watch was gone. I had seen the prisoner between twelve and one o'clock, sitting in the fields where we work; it is not far from our house; upon missing the watch, I went to my sister, who is his mother, and told her, in his hearing, that I had lost the watch, and suspected him; he began to cry, and denied it; I said if he did not let me know where it was my husband was coming - he took me to a fishmonger's - Connelly came out, and said he would take me to where the watch was; he took me to a stable, and the watch was down a cellar in the stable; the prisoner went with us, and Connelly handed the watch to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the silk trade, carry<lb></lb>ing on business with Mr. Richard Chandler, 18, Bread Street—the signature to the partition is the prisoner's handwriting—prior to September, 1867, I was in business on my own account, at Lyons, as a commission agent in the silk trade—I had very extensive dealings with the prisoner, who was, prior to that time, carrying on business as a silk merchant, at 139, Cheapside—prior to September, 1867, I had known him eighteen months—my first knowledge of him in business was in January, 1866, and from that time, up to July, 1867, I had very extensive transactions with him—he from time to time paid me very large sums of money—his business, as far as I could judge, appeared to be a flourishing and good one—I dealt with him upon my own responsibility—his transactions were with me—I bought goods from the manufacturers specifically for him—I was responsible to them and he to me—he, from time to time, came over to me—he came in 1866 with a letter of introduction from a highly respectable house in the City of London, Bradbury, Greater, &amp; Beale—the letter was written by Mr. Edward Beale, giving him a very high character—he continued to carry on business in that way until August, 1867—in the latter end of July, 1867, he came over to me—he also came over in the early part of June, when he bought largely on the market, and left orders—I believe he purchased over 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods in June, 1867—at that time I had heavy claims against him, for which I held his acceptances to the amount of between 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and</p>

should you require assistance, name it"—he replied, "If I require it, I should have asked for it"—I said, "I am very happy to hear you don't require any"—he again assured me he did not require any assistance—in another interview he admitted it was possible he might—he said, "I might require assistance; there are not any of your acceptances due; but let us have a chat together"—we had a chat—I advised him not to carry on the conversation in his warehouse, but to meet me at my solictor's, Mr. Potter, of King Street, cheapside—he met me there in the afternoon of the same day—he then named what assistance he should require—he said if I would get him three bills renewed for a short</p>

               <p>period, it would be a great assistance to him—he named seven days, where-upon Mr. Potter remarked, "Seven days soon fly away; are you sure that is long enough?"—he assured us it would be—I replied, "It is as easy for me to obtain the renewal for ten or fourteen days as it would be for seven; let me understand your position, is it a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> one; do not trifle with me, I am a poor man, and if you fail you ruin me"—he then made a solemn assertion or affirmation, he said, "I am perfectly solvent, my expenses in my business are nothing, do not be alarmed; I am tightly pressed for money, I admit, but you are the last man I should think of ruining; you have been a good friend, I would not ruin you"—I then consented to have the bills renewed—I said I would return to Lyons, place the matter before the parties who took the bills, the different manu<lb></lb>facturers to whom I parted with the bills—a further conversation ensued between Simpson, myself, and Potter, more directly with Mr. Potter and Simpson, Simpson assuring us that he was a solvent man—upon his representation I returned to France and obtained the renewal of the bills—the interview took place about 17th August—he did not then tell me of any of these transactions with Mr. Meeking, nor was I informed by him that he had pledged my goods—he did not meet his engagement, and the bills were all dishonoured about a fortnight afterwards—I then came over to England, and called on my solictor, and, accompanied by Mr. Lovering, the accountant, went to Simpson's warehouse—that was the first or second week in September—I said, "Simpson, you have not behaved like a man, you have not kept your word, you have ruined me; you have but one alternamtive, surrender like a man, and let us know the state of your affairs"—he declined to do so, and said he would do nothing of the kind—he said he would give no preference—I said, "No preference is wanted; I will have nothing more to say to you, but I leave the affair in the hands of Mr. Potter"—Mr. Potter served him with a notice of bankruptcy, and on the 24th he filed his petition—the consequence of the bills being returned was that I had to suspend payment, and was driven into the Bankruptcy Court—I called my creditors together, in the usual way, according to the law of France, and obtained my <hi rend="italic">concords</hi>

               <p>from the manufacturers and invoiced the goods to Simpson in my name—as a rule I added nothing to the prices from the manufacturers, although these were exceptions, namely when I submitted goods to him, I have added 1 per cent, or it might be 2 per cent. besides my commission—I frequently offered him goods at a certain price, and if he thought them cheap he bought them, if not he declined—in June he ordered 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, for the autumn market, and on the 27th, 28th and 29th, he was at Lyons—what he bought in July was a distinct transaction from what he bought in June—in June he ordered a quantity of goods to be delivered in the months of August and September, but they never were delivered—the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods which he purchased in July were never delivered—he purchased them of me—he selected the goods, but they went through me, the manu<lb></lb>facturers getting my security only—at the original interview he had with me he told me he only had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. capital—he repeatedly told me, both by verbal communication and by letter, that he had wealthy relatives, whom he belived he could get support from—when I saw him in August, I have no recollection that he said anything about hoping to get money from his relatives when the crisis came—after the crisis had arrived he did say he had applied to them and failed—at this conversation, when I was urging him to trust to me, I did not exactly say to him, "Simpson, put yourself in my hands, I can get any amount of credit at Lyons"—I said, "Give me your confidence, and you shall have mine"—I said, "My capital is like yours, very small, but my credit and my reputation on the market is good; any reasonable amount, provided it is fair and honest, I can obtain"—I never told him in August that if he put himself in my hands, I could get plenty of credit at Lyons—you are mixing the two occasions together—that was at the commencement of our transactions—I failed for 160,000 francs—in round numbers 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner failed for a little more than that—I do not remember that at the time he failed there were outstanding bills which were afterwards met—in June, when he gave me an order, his indebtedness to me was rather more than 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was between 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the time he failed he owed me 4540<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—during the three months that elapsed before the bankruptcy, he paid me about 3380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so that if he had failed in June I should have been worse off than I was when he did fail, by a couple of thousand pounds—he might have rendered me liable for another 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as I had delivered the goods, and had I continued in business, I must have accepted those goods because I was liable and they were ordered in my name—from time to time, without having any direct order from him, I sent goods to him, acting according to the best of my judgment—if I had a lot of goods which I thought he could sell, I sent them to him—I never sent him goods without acting on my own judgment, except in carry<lb></lb>ing out previous orders that had not been executed—during the three months previous to his bankruptcy, I never sent him goods of my own accord—at the Mansion House the solictor for the defence asked me if I had not sent him some black taffeta that he had not ordered—I said I had not—I can make that perfectly clear by the prisoner's own handwriting—he ordered ten pieces, the order could not be executed on the market at the time; I sent him patterns—he wrote back saying they were very dear, and not suitable for him—some week, or ten day afterwards, I wrote to him saying, that I had found a few packets, but that was what I considered a portion of his previous order—at that time I never bought him any robe; that was in July—he sent me in July an indefinite order, saying that he re<lb></lb>quired</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186904050052"></xptr>
               <p>some very handsome stylish brocaded robe, with black ground with rose buds, just suitable to the season—I went through the market and found an assortment of eleven robes—the result of that was that he came to Lyons on the strength of that, and expressed his satisfaction, saying that he should like to buy thirty or forty of that same sort—I never bought any robe with<lb></lb>out his <hi rend="italic">bonacircfide</hi> order—I could not pledge my oath that I never, during the three months previous to his bankruptcy, sent him any goods which I selected without a previous order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi> Monday, 12th August, was the earliest date at which I had any notion of the prisoner's difficulties—that induced me to come over to see him on the 14th, when he re-assured me—about a fortnight afterwards the bills were returned—I should add 3 per cent. to the invoice price, and that would make the cost price to him—a man engaged in a business of that kind ought to make from 7 1/2 to 10 per cent profit.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solictor, practising in King Street, cheaspide—in the summer of 1867, in consequence of some imformation I obtained, I communicated with Mr. Grove, at Lyons—I telegraphed to him on the 12th August—he afterwards came to England—I saw him nearly every day between the 14th and the 17th—Mr. Simpson came to my office, accom<lb></lb>panied by his clerk, Mr. Nash, on the 17th August, in order to give me certain explanations—I was acting as Mr. Grove's solictor, and was not satisfied—those explanations referred to Mr. Simpson's position—a bill had been returned, and as some other bills were failing due within the next few days, it was a subject of great anxiety to Mr. Grove to know what his posi<lb></lb>tion, was to be with the manufacturers in Lyons who made these silk goods—I could not advise Mr. Grove on his own position without satisfying my<lb></lb>self of what was Simpson's position, so Mr. Simpson and Mr. Nash came to me—at that interview I asked Mr. Simpson to tell me candidly what his position was—I pointed out to him that Mr. Grove was a very young man in business, with a wife and family depending on him, and that it was of the greatest importance for him to know the position of affairs—Simpson assured me that he was perfectly solvent—I then made some inquiries about what bills, were falling due within the next few days—there were some acceptances, I belive, and some bills of other people falling due, and Mr. Nash, who was present, referring to a memorandum-books, told me what those bills were—I then said to Mr. Simpson, "What is to be done? I suppose you want to be able to meet these bills?"and he said, if time could be obtained from the manufacturers in Lyons he could meet everything—I said to him, "Tell us truly what your position is?"—those bills amounted to several hundreds of pounds—there was one for 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and some con<lb></lb>siderably larger ones—I said to him, "if Mr. Grove is to go and ask a favour of these manufacturers it would be better he should ask a longer time"—I said, "You will find a week run away very quickly, and it is just as easy to ask for ten or twelve days as a week"—he seemed to agree with me, and it was agreed that Mr. Grove should ask indulgence until the 1st or 2nd September—I am not quite certain which—I then asked Mr. Simpson how he had got into such a position, and he said he had over-bought himself,</p>

               <p>and that trade was excessively bad—I then questioned him with reference to himself and his own personal expenses; I said, "Where do you reside?"—he told me, I think, that it was in the Fentiman Road, Clapham Road—he said, "I am an exceedingly frugal man, I do not cost more than a police<lb></lb>man's wages; 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week would cover all my expenditure"—he said when he first went into business he used to sleep under the counter to save the expense of a lodging—on that occasion he assured me of his perfect solvency—on the 2nd September I again communicated with Mr. Grove, and he again came over to England—I again saw Simpson in company with Mr. Grove, but we could get nothing satisfactory from him—I asked him to place his books in the hands of Mr. Levering, the accountant, in order that we might be satisfied about his real position—he refused, and I afterwards took out a warrant against him, whereupon he filed a partition of bankruptcy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> As far as you were concerned, you had no reason to doubt that statement, had you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it is an every-day occurrence to have transactions of this description, and by persons whom we know to be solvent—it is not uncommon for people to raise money for a temporary purpose, under the circumstances that Mr. Simpson did—some of these parcels were renewals—the parcel of the 18th July was a renewal of a former pledge; it was originally a three months' pledge, and the inference is that that time had expired when it was renewed—that is the case as to a few of the pledges, but not all—some were pledged on the dates I have named—all the pledges have been redeemed—sometimes they remained for a few days, sometimes for a longer period—it is a common thing, whether it is right or wrong.</p>

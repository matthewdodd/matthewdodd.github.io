                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Mr. Thomas Martin, of Tooley-street, Borough, a pawnbroker. On the 19th of January, in the afternoon, I was directed to the end of the shop by somebody, and saw the prisoner drawing his hand from his pocket, as if he had put something into</p>

               <p>it, and then he looked at some other goods—I laid hold of him, and he im<lb></lb>mediately produced this handkerchief from his pocket—it had hung at up in the shop—I detained him till the officer came, and then gave him into custody.</p>

I had hold of him at the time the officer came—he did not attempt to escape—there was only one person in the shop, but four or five in the boxes—the person in the shop was a stranger—he could not see what he was doing, without turning round to look at him.</p>

            . Q. Was Botfield in your service on the 13th of January last. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it customary with you in your business to purchase articles of him. - A. Yes. These glasses we purchased of him were his own property; sometimes he had our goods to manufacture and sometimes he found them; but on the 13th of January he brought in two glasses of eighteen inches, one was damaged, which he requested me to cut for him; I cut it, and made the most of it I could; I cut it to fourteen inches and a quarter; the usual size of them glasses are fifteen inches.</p>
               <p>Q. What glasses were they. - A. They were convex mirror glasses, cut in a round circle; the other glass was an eighteen inch glass. After I cut it he took it from the front shop to the back shop, where we silver them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you purchased these two glasses of him. - A. He brought them in; I did not purchase them. He went away as if he was going to put them by.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember the prisoner bringing any glasses in the warehouse on the 13th of January last. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he employed in the warehouse that day. - A. Yes. On the 13th of January I bought of the prisoner two glasses; I paid him for them; one was an eighteen and the other a fifteen; that glass only run fourteen and a quarter, there was a star in the middle of it; it had been an eighteen inch glass, it was cut down. I paid him twenty six shillings for the fourteen, and one pound sixteen for the eighteen inches. After I paid him for them I missed the glasses, he ought to have brought them into my shop to have them silvered, to make them fit for sale. On the 18th we made a purchase. On the next day I found the eighteen inch glass; I could not find the fourteen and a quarter. I went to Mr. Drings on the Monday following; I found two other glasses that I knew to be ours. My partner found the fourteen inch glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find on the Monday, when you went to Mr. Dring's, any of the glasses that are now in the indictment. - A. Two of them that are in the indictment. This fifteen inch glass I know to be my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of these glasses purchased of the prisoner, or were they other glasses that you knew to be your property. - A. These were two others that we know to be our property. This glass I found at Mr. Drings; I know it to be mine by a private mark.</p>
               <p>Court. These are the two. - A. Yes, there are two private marks on each, having a stone in the middle, and a figure of 2.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Are the glasses now produced, the glass that was bought of the prisoner Botfield. - A. The first two that I produced is not; the other one is the glass that was bought of Botfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that these glasses were your property. - A. I am sure as to one: I leave my partner to speak to the other two.</p>

            . Q. What are you. - A. I am a mirror maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these plates and tell me whether you have seen them before. - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you receive them. - A. From the prisoner Botfield, about the 12th or 13th of January; he brought me a twelve inch; he asked me if I would silver it for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that either of these. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Confine yourself to these. - A. I do not know that I could go on with my story without mentioning that; I silvered it for him; he took that away on the 14th; Botfield's wife brought me an eighteen inch, and two of them there; I think that was about the 15th of January. I was to silver them. On Thursday afterwards I met Botfield in Fleet-street, he wanted to know if he could not have the eighteen inch on Friday; I told him he had better let it be till Saturday, the silver would be dry and more fit to take away. I went to Mr. Oakey and told him, knowing he worked there. In consequence of that, they came, they found those two glasses in my possession; they owned them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean all the three. - A. No, the two fifteens in my possession; Botfield came on the Saturday and fetched the eighteen inch glass that was silvered; he was apprehended on the 19th, he then seemed terrified, it was in Mr. Oakey's house; he said he had done nothing that he was afraid of; he denied it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. How long have you known Botfield. - A. Two years; I never heard any thing against him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>COURT. This is laid as a capital offence, stealing in the dwelling house to the value of four pounds and upwards. The first thing for you to consider, is, whether these glasses were all taken away alone and at the same time, for if they were all taken away at one time, certainly it would be a capital crime; but supposing they were taken away at different times, then it does not appear that either of them are worth forty shillings; if you think they were taken at different times, the capital part of the indictment is done away; the next question will be whether you conceive that this man took them with a view to convert them to his own use. In a case that is doubtful, character ought to have great weight; on the other hand where the case is so clear that you cannot have a doubt then character cannot have any weight.</p>

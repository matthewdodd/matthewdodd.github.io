I was salesman to Theodore Hyla Jennens, and Co. before their bankruptcy, and, after that, I was retained as salesman by the creditors' assignees, Thomas Phillips and George Alcock—on 4th March, in this year, somebody, giving the name of Dennistoun, called at my place of business, No. 6, Halkin-street-west—he said he required a small selection of papier-machô goods, for a correspondent of his—he gave me, in writing, this reference," W. Robertson, and Co. 38, Crutched-friars, ship-brokers"—he gave me as his own address, 33, Great Tower-street—in consequence of what he said, I wrote to Messrs. Robertson, of Crutched-friars, to say that a per<lb></lb>son named Deunistoun had applied for some goods; I stated the amount, and asked if Messrs. Denmstoun, and Co. were trustworthy—I received this letter in answer (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "36, Crutched-friars, London, 9th March, 1860.

                  </hi>. I reside at 33, Great Tower-street, City—I did not let a room in that house to a person of the name of Dennistoun; I have the looking after the offices—there was a room let to him in December, or there<lb></lb>about—I never saw any business transacted there—there was one chair there, and a carpet there once, but the carpet was moved out a few days after<lb></lb>wards—a lad used to come there for letters—one day, when the lad came for letters, I followed him to 38, Crutched-friars—I stayed outside half an hour—he did not come out when I was there—I followed him again, a few days afterwards, and he went to the same place again—I once went into this office and saw that boy there—I saw that same lad at the police-court—he came to solicit an adjournment of the summons on behalf of Robertson.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 23, South-grove, Peckham—I know Clemitson and Robertson—they were residing at 24, next door to me—I think they were living together in that house from 2d March, till the time Monger came—I saw them together often—Monger came on 2d Jnne—I think Clemitson let Robertson in at the moment Monger came—it might be that Robertson let Ciemitson in—the two were at the gate at the same time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was Clemitson living there long before Robertson came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Clemitson was a tenant of ours at Michaelmas—Robertson came, I believe, some time in February—I don't know whether Clemitson took lodgers there before that, I have seen no one there—I know Robertson lived there, because I used to see him go out the first thing in the morning, and come back there at night.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever seen any person residing in that house, except Clemitson and Robertson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; except their wives and families—I saw somebody whom I presume to be Robertson's wife; and I have seen Clemitson's wife too—on the occasion when they were at the gate and Monger came, Clemitson ran down the garden—I lost sight of him and never saw anything of him afterwards.</p>

               <p>HENRY HARRIS. On Monday, the 1st of August, about six o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in <placeName id="t18250915-108-crimeloc586">Smithfield</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18250915-108-crimeloc586" type="placeName" value="Smithfield"></interp>

When it was found it was tied up in a silk handkerchief, and a neck handkerchief belonging to me. I suppose I must have dosed, and had the handkerchief taken off my neck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What time did you meet the prisoner? A. About seven o'clock in the evening. I got drunk, and I believe I went to sleep; there is no mark on the gold.</p>

            . On the night of the 1st of August I was called by the prosecutor in George-alley, to take the prisoner, whom he had in custody - he accused her of robbing him, but did not say of what. As we were going along Saffron-hill we found this property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there many persons about? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Before you examined and passed the accounts of the prisoner, was it your practice to examine the items contained in the banker's book? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do it in this case? - A. I am fully persuaded I did, before I put my name to the account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever, upon any occasion, sign such account, as audited by you, without finding the items agree? - A. Never, to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the name of that book? - A. This book we call the London renewal book.(The banker's book produced).</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the book produced by the prisoner before you audited and passed this account on the 17th of July? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q.Do the items in that book, as they stand now, correspond with the items in the other account? - A. They do not; it certainly is not in the same state, because I passed the full sum of 381l. 15s. 7d.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time when you passed his account, was there any erasure before the 81? - A. I am confident there could not have been.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any erasure now? - A. There certainly apears to be one very strongly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it customary for the prisoner, at the time he passed his account, to produce a slip of paper, containing items which were severally ticked by you, item by item? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When was the prisoner dismissed from his employment? - A. I cannot tell; I do not think I was in town at the time.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it after the 17th of July? - A.Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have told us that book was produced by the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not, and is it not frequently produced by Mr. Bowers, one of your clerks? - A. Mr. Bowers may have had it.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no entry in that banker's book in the hand-writing of the prisoner? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. That book is permitted to be in the hands of Mr. Bowers, and every Trustee? - A. It certainly is not locked up, but I do not know of its being in any body's hands, except the messenger's.</p>
               <p>Q. All the Trustees have access to it? - A. That department is confined to four gentlemen, the two Mr. Rhodes, Mr. Godwin, and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. But it is not locked up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is like any other voucher produced at the time, and not confined to his custody at all? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have frequently known consisiderable mistakes in your banker's book, to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160070"></xptr>amount of four or five hundred pounds? - A. I have never known of any.</p>

               <p>Q. Are the entries in that book of your handwriting? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at July the 14th? - A.Cash eighty-one pounds, fifteen shillings, and seven pence, is my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. On whose account did you receive that? - A. On account of the Pelican Life Insurance Office.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you receive it? - A. I do not know; I received it by a draft upon Weston and Company, bankers.</p>
               <p>Q.By whom drawn? - A. I do not know; we never take an account of the drawer's name.</p>
               <p>Q.When you made that entry, was there any erasure previous to the figure 8? - A. Not that I saw or knew of.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you did not, upon that day, receive three hundred and eighty-one pounds, fifteen shillings, and seven-pence? - A. I am quite sure I did not, corresponding with the book in which I entered it at the time I received it; that book is here: (refers to the book, reads,) Pelican Office, eighty-one pounds, fifteen shillings, and seven-pence, on Weston.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Mr. Boldero.) Q. Though you do not know of any mistakes that happen, do you mean to say this prisoner was at all deficient three hundred pounds in his account with the Society? - A. I am not prepared to answer that.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to pledge yourself there is any thing like that deficiency? - A. I do not mean to pledge myself at all, because we may not be able to ascertain the whole amount.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Thomas.) Q. By whom the draft was drawn you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TIBBS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am clerk to Messrs. Weston and Company, at the Borough Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether the prisoner kept cash at Messrs. Westons on the 14th of July last? - A. Yes, he did. (Produces his book.)</p>
               <p>Q.Have you an entry of a draft of his there?- A. Yes; on the 14th of July I received a draft for eighty-one pounds, fifteen shillings, and seven pence, drawn upon our house by John M'Gregor; it came through the house of Robarts and Company; it was paid the same day, and carried to the prisoner's account.</p>
               <p>ROBERT WARD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. I am clerk in the Pelican Office; Mr. M'Gregor was a clerk there also; he was dismissed on Thursday, the 23d of July, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, after that period, his coming to the Office? - A.He came to the Office the next day, I was in the Office at the time, and two Directors; it was on a Friday, when the cash of the Office was to be settled; it was settled every Friday; there was an order that the Directors were to see him, and he was to be requested to give up his keys; he said, he thought he had sent his keys the day before by the messenger, Mason; Mason denied it; the prisoner gave Mason a note to go home to his house to fetch the keys. During Mason's absence, Mr. M'Gregor, having had an accident, complained he was thirsty, and was advised to drink spruce-beer for his complaint; he went out, and did not return that day; when Mason returned, he brought me a draft for six hundred pounds, upon Weston and Company, drawn by M'Gregor, and made payable to himself, with a message, saying, he was so unwell he could not attend himself; that he had sent it desiring me to give it to Mr. Bowers, for the renewals he had received that part of the week that he had attended.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the custom in the Office with respect to the quantity of money the clerks may receive?- A.Every clerk, who has received one hundred pounds, should pay it into the Office that evening, and settle the accounts every Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember when he was before the Directors for the purpose of settling his account?- A. It was after he was discharged; he was discharged on one Thursday, and the Thursday following he was to make up his accounts to the Board.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any deficiency in his accounts to the Office at this time? - A. There is a deficiency of fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I suppose you know that this injury he had received was occasioned by being thrown out of a carriage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon application being made to him, he sent a draft for six hundred pounds - was not that more than sufficient to balance the account? - A. There is fifty pounds remaining.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not recollect something about a bill of fifty pounds, about which there was a mistake?- A. I do not; Mr. M'Gregor wrote me, after he was in the Compter, that he had paid in a bill of fifty pounds, which had not been presented for payment; but that bill I know nothing of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. Six hundred pounds was paid in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And I believe some subsequent payments? - A. Yes, I think on the Thursday following, thirty-one pounds, nine shillings, and eleven pence, and he afterwards paid me a draft of sixty-seven pounds, ten shillings, on account of another insurance.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at the time he left the Office there was a deficiency of seven hundred and fifty pounds?- A. There was a deficiency of more than that when he was dismissed.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this book, and see if you can find<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160071"></xptr>any entries made of the sum of six hundred pounds and the other sums? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are the entries in that book the prisoner's writing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not attend on the day the Directors attended, and was taken ill? - A. He attended on the Thursday, and went away ill.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe all the Directors have these keys? A. None of them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Taking the whole together, there would be a deficiency of fifty pounds? - A. Yes, taking the bills and cash; some of the bills have been paid since.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he speak to you so as to be heard by any body else? - A. I believe not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. (To Ward.) Q. Do you recollect, at any time, enquiring for a banker's book?- A. I enquired for it, I think, on the 31st of July; I sent for it.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Mr. Boldero.) Q. Who are the persons who hire servants? - A. The Board of Directors.</p>

               <p>Q.Those are the Board of Directors? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I only mean to state the reason of my absence from the Office, in consequence of an accident I had received on the 21st of July; I went to the White Hart Tavern to meet a few friends, and in coming home, a little before nine, I was overturned in a chaise, and so much hurt that I was taken up as nearly dead; I sent to Mr. Bowers, requesting him to make a few entries for me in my cast-books, which I had not made; it was my intention to have attended at the Office on the Wednesday, but was prevented; on the Thursday, being exceedingly bruised by the chaise going over my body, I could not make the entries; however I went with intent to go to the Office, but in the way was prevented by indisposition, from loss of blood. On the Tuesday night I sent a note to the Pelican Office, in which I said there were several entries not made, and I should be very much obliged to Mr. Bowers if he would enter them for me; I understood Mr. Stonestreet was very angry with me for having sent but one key, and I was that very day suspended from my employment; I came on the Friday, and was prevented from settling my accounts; I was desired not to touch the keys; Mr. Bowers has got a duplicate-key of those very drawers, and I have frequently found them open in the morning when I could have sworn I had locked them the night before; and sometimes I have found them opened with a chissel; Mr. Godwin desired me to make out the account, and give them the balance; Mr. Stonestreet said, recollect yourself on Thursday next, (which was Board day,) and, what you have to say, the Board will attend to; I had not the books at my command, and therefore I could not make out the account; I rather suspect there is a balance in my favour. The banker's book is frequently very erroneous, and Mr. Boldero has observed the slovenly way in which it has been done; there is an erasure in that very book of one hundred and forty-five pounds; the Policy Office, as well as the Pelican Office, have an account at the same bankers, and they had entered the one for the other; I am not indebted to the Office one single shilling; on the contrary, I conceive there is something owing to me; I had no intention of defrauding these gentlemen, it was the farthest from my heart.</p>

               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>PETER BOWERS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any mistakes in the banker's books?- A. I recollect an instance of one hundred and forty-five pounds being carried by the banker's to the Pelican account, which belonged to some other person.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called sixteen witnesses, who gave him a good character. GUILTY, aged 36.</p>
               <p>London Jury, before Mr. Common Serjeant.</p>
               <p>Mr. KNOWLES, (in Arrest of Judgment).</p>
               <p>My Lord,</p>
               <p>It seems to me that I shall be able to shew your Lordship, that, in point of fact, the crime is not sufficiently averred upon this record. I take it, that this Act of Parliament creates no new felony, but refers the offence to the class of larcenies, and, therefore, every indictment upon this Act of Parliament must contain upon the face of it a good charge of larceny against the person accused. That the indictment should previously state, as this has done, the circumstances from which that inference is drawn. I do not quarrel with, but inasmuch as the Grand Jury have drawn the conclusion that this man has committed a larceny, it remains for us to contend that they have not drawn that conclusion rightly and according to law. I say, here is no charge of larceny against this person, though he is prosecuted for a larceny. Every charge of larceny must contain not only the charge of taking, stealing, and carrying away, but it must also charge the taking something which is the property either of some persons known or of some persons unknown; if the persons are known, it must aver that the thing alledged to have been stolen is the money,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160072"></xptr>goods, or chattels of that person, and must be described to have been stolen from him; if the persons are unknown, it must describe the money, goods, and chattels as being the property of persons unknown to the Jurors. So not only in cases of larceny, but in cases of highway robbery, to make out a highway robbery I must charge that the person has taken violently and feloniously from the person of the prosecutor, a gold watch, or ten pounds in money; and having so charged it, I must not stop short there, if I do, I do not present a proper record, but I must say he has taken violently and feloniously from the person of A. B. ten guineas, the monies of the said A. B. Now, my Lord, this is an indictment for stealing monies, but there is no person mentioned whose monies this person has stolen; it is alledged that he has feloniously stolen, taken, and carried away the said sum of money, which is said to be three hundred pounds; but it does not any where aver that that three hundred pounds so stolen is the monies of these gentlemen, or that it is the monies of any person whatever. I take it, therefore, that neither in the first or second count is there any averment of property in any person. Now, it is not sufficient that I should be told, "Can any body of common sense say that if it is taken from them it is not their money?" But we must read this record with the sense and understanding of lawyers, and I say, that in no construction can a lawyer find an allegation of property at all. Suppose an indictment for a highway robbery had alledged that the prisoner had at such a time violently and feloniously taken from the person of such an one ten guineas in money, and had stopped there, I take it that would not have been a sufficient description of a highway robbery, because it should aver that that money should belong to some person or other; but here it is no where alledged that this money, charged to have been stolen, is the money of any body. Now, this answer, I am sure, cannot be given, that the force of precedents will justify it; if it could, my answer would be this, that the Act of Parliament only passed in the year 1799, and there cannot be a sufficient number of precedents to say that shall bind us; but the force of precedents is the other way, for I will only recur to the indictment which immediately preceded this; if I had been put to defend that person I should have had no such ground to stand upon, for there the indictment charges that

            , the prosecutrix; but here it is no where alledged that it is the money of the persons from whom it is alledged to have been stolen. My Lord, in Hawkins I find this passage: "It seems to be taken as a ground in many books, that regularly the persons offended as well as the defendant ought to be certainly described in every indictment, and agreeably hereto it hath been adjudged, that an indictment for stealing a certain piece of linen cloth of one J. S. without adding de bonis &amp; catallis cujusdam. J. S. is insufficient, because it doth not expressly appear to whom the goods stolen did belong." You must, therefore, not only say he took it of such an one, but you must aver that it was his property, or that of some other person. I conceive, therefore, that this indictment is bad, and cannot be maintained.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp and Mr. Alley followed on the same side, and requested if the Court entertained a doubt, that the point might be reserved.</p>

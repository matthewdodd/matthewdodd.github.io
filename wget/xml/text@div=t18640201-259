                  </hi>. I live at No. 22, Queen-street, Bloomsbury, and am a moulder—on Saturday night, 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> January, at half-past 10, I was going down Drury-lane, and missed my way from being a stranger—I have only been in London three weeks—I turned down Charles-street, and I there saw Galloway and Coleman close to the edge of the kerb—I asked them my way to Queen-street—they said, "Straight on"—I went on, and before I got two or three steps away, Galloway laid hold of me by the collar, and Coleman shoved me into the passage of a house—she then slung her arm round my throat—Galloway then laid hold of my trousers, and ripped them down by the pocket—she then cried out, "Bring the knife; quick!"—Cain came with it—I began shouting, and Coleman put a piece of wood in my mouth and stopped my crying out—Galloway took hold of my pockets, and Cain cut them off with the knife—I had in one pocket half a sovereign and five shillings—in the other pocket there were a few coppers—Galloway took all the money—I did my best to get away, but I was frightened because of the knife; when my pockets were off, two men looked out from a door, and Galloway said, "It is all over, "and they then pulled the door after them—as soon as I got my hands at liberty, I took the piece of wood out of my mouth, and Cain shoved the knife across my mouth and cut my lip—Galloway said, "Cut the b——'s throat"—her finger was cut in getting off my pockets, and she began jumping and crying, and said te Coleman, "Come and go with me to the hospital, and get it dressed, "and I said, "I will go with you my lass"—her finger was covered with blood—they went out, and I followed them—I do not know what became of Cain; she had disappeared—we came up to a constable, and I gave them into custody.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH AQUILAR, ESQ. I live at 22, Baker-street. The robbery was not committed in that house. The robbery was committed in <placeName id="t18130113-51-crimeloc292">Grafton-street, Fitszroy-square</placeName>

               <p>THOMAS - . I am servant to Mr. Aquilar.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand he had taken a house in Grafton-street, and some part of the furniture had been sent in: did you reside there - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What servant are you - A. I am a footman.</p>
               <p>Q. You slept there, did you - A. I did. On the 22nd of December, between the hours of eight and nine at night, I was coming from Baker-street, to Grafton-street house. Our house being a corner house, I observed a man leaning over a post. I did not like the looks of him. I had a little boy along with me, between ten and eleven years old. I said, Thomas, come along with me. I went by the house, took the little boy along with me, and went to the bottom of the street, and came back on the opposite side; and when I came opposite of the house I saw the street door open, and a man came out with the six blankets. I ran after him immediately, and catched the prisoner, and took the blankets from under his arm. The other man ran away. I had a little bit of a tustle with the prisoner. He ran away. The watchman took him to the watchhouse. I took the blankets from him. They were in a bag under his arm. The bag was searched at the watchhouse; it contained six blankets, and the prisoner had some matches in his pocket, and some twenty-penny notes, and one-penny notes. I left him in the care of the watchman, and the blankets also. They are here. They are quite new. I left the house in the morning, between six and seven. I fastened the house when I left it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 22nd of December last, I happened to be in Harford-street, crying the hour of nine o'clock; I heard the cry of, stop thief. I saw the prisoner run. I immediately laid hold of him. I kept hold of him until the last witness came up with the bag. He said, that was the man that I had secured. I took him to the watchhouse, and gave him to the watchhouse keeper. The watchhouse keeper examined the bag before me. I saw six new blankets counted out of the bag.</p>

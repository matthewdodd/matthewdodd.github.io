            . On Saturday morning, the 7th of December, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning I received information, and went down the yard leading to my slaughter house, in Wheeler-street, and saw three men there breaking up a copper - they said they were employed by a Mr. Paget of Wheeler-street, to break it up there. I said,</p>
               <p>"I should like to see Paget before the copper goes off the premises" - I sent for him, and was left with the three men. I believe both the prisoners to be two of them; but will only swear to Clay; I am certain of him. They took the copper up, put it into a sack, and went out of the yard with it. I went out with them, and said,</p>
               <p>"I shall follow you." Paget came up, and said in their presence that he knew nothing about the property or them. Clay was going up Fleur-de-lis-court; Izard followed and took him with the chopper and axe - one of the others had the copper on his back, I think it was Smith; I followed him, he laid it down by the White-heart window - I took it up, and gave it to Hart. Clay was brought back and taken to the watch-house. Smith and the other man got off. I found Smith at Worship-street on the Tuesday.</p>

            . About a quarter past eight o'clock in the morning of the 7th of December, I went to the slaughter house for a sheep, and saw Clay and Smith (I am sure of them), and another person breaking up a brewing copper; it appeared nearly new - I went to Spitalfields-market, returned, and saw them still there breaking it up, Horwood desired me to go and ask Paget if he sent them to break it up there; I went, and he said he knew nothing of it - Clay immediately turned round and went up Fleur-de-lis-court with the axe and chopper, and at the top of the court he threw them down - I followed him; he ran up Elder-street and down Blossom-street, where I took him, and brought him back with the axe and chopper. I saw Smith at Worship-street, on the Tuesday after, and pointed him out from among other persons.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Old-street, St. Lukes. I know both the prisoners. On Friday night, the 6th of December, between seven and nine Clay came to me with a washing tray, a knife tray, a few old forks, three old sacks, and several other small articles - a few minutes afterwards Smith brought three coolers, and another person was with them; they brought other things as well, and left them all with me, and wanted me to buy them, but said they had a copper also, and I was to see that in the morning. I asked Clay where I could see it, and I think he said at No. 14, Curtain-road - I appointed eleven o'clock in the morning; they went away leaving the things with me, and about nine o'clock in the morning Smith and another man came to my house; they said Clay was gone to work - I said I was to go to see the copper at eleven, and they said their mother had moved, and that she had given the copper to Clay. I said they must take the things away, or bring their mother or brother - they went away, and I went to No. 14, Curtain-road, and found Clay had not lived there. I saw</p>
               <p>"Acton-place," chalked on the tun bowl, and as I thought No. 1, I went there, but the house was shut up. Smith had agreed to come at two o'clock, so I got an officer ready, who took him when he came. I advanced Clay 8 s. overnight.</p>

I had the chopper in my hand, and finding there was a disturbance, I put it down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150007"></xptr>and walked away - I made no resistance.

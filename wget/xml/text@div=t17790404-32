I said, I had not; he said, then I will tell you where you may find your things; I can show you where the persons are who robbed you. I went with him to several places, but could not find them; at last, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, we found Walker and Canton in Walker's lodging, at a house on Saffron-hill, in the same room were two girls; one was in bed, and the other getting into bed; we made them get up; I asked them if they knew any thing of breaking my house open; they said, no; I desired the constable to search, and see if he could find any thing; he found three of my patterns in Walker's pocket, and two in the closet; he found also in Walker's lodgings, a saw, and some tools; among which was an iron-crow; there was nothing found on Canton.

I searched the lodging, and found two patterns in the closet, and three in Walker's pocket. I then went and searched the lodging of Canton, but found nothing there. The next day I took them before a magistrate, and Penticross wanted to be an evidence; but would not say any thing till the other two were brought up. Then the magistrate said, he understood he was come voluntarily to offer himself as an evidence, and asked him what he had to say; he said, nothing at all, and refused to say any thing. Then they were all three ordered to the bar, and began to accuse one another. Penticross charged Walker with softening the iron crow, and bending it up with a hammer to break the house open. I went and tried the crow, and it fitted the mark where they had wrenched the window open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an architect, and live at Brecon, South Wales—on Saturday, 8th May, I was staying at the Crown Hotel, Leicester-square, and about 12 o'clock that night I was near Mile End-gate—a man asked me for something for a bed—he really appeared to be deserv<lb></lb>ing, and I gave him a shilling—some time afterwards I was walking along to get a cab, and received a very severe blow with some hard instrument on my head, which completely stunned me, at the same moment a man, what appeared to be in a recess or doorway, sprang out, and struck me, in far less time than I am describing it, a severe blow on the forehead—his fist was armed with some hard substance I am positive, and I fell—I recollect some man tearing at my ring to get it off—here are the marks of his fingernail—as I came to my senses, I heard people say, "They are robbing the man; look at the blood"—I also heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and a paceing down the street—five or ten minutes afterwards, I found several women round me, bathing my head with hot water, and I found I had lost my silk-handkerchief, a gold chain, three little seals, two keys, and a silver watch—I believe Brock to be the man who struck me, but I should be very sorry to take away the liberty of anybody—I believe he is the man, from his light-dress—just before the blow I saw Hancock pass me and come back—this if my handkerchief and watch—I swear to it from a little indent which I did when I was fishing—I will describe the seals without looking at them; they are two cornelian stones and two other stones, and a light pink one—the larger one has a dove upon it—I also lost a sovereign, and about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my watch was worth 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and my chain 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I said that I did not want it; I had just had one; but with a little persuasion I had a cup of coffee and a slice of bread and butter. They then asked me questions about the robbery, and we took a walk, but could not find Clark. They told me to bring him to the station, which I did the next day, and Glark gave him the chain; with that they took us and gave as a pot of beer and some tobacco at the Prince of Wales, and about an hour afterwards they came and told us the inspector wanted to see us. He came over, and said he was in duty bound to send us before a Magistrate.</p>

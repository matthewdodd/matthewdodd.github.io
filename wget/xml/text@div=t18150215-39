On the 20th of January, I counted my trusses of hay; I missed them. On the 21st I marked the hay by cutting corners out of the trusses with a knife. I got up in the morning when he went out of the yard; I went into the loft to see if he had taken any hay with him; I missed one truss. and I conceived two more; I then followed the cart to the Old Mother Red Cap at Highgate; at the yard of the Old Mother Black Cap beyond Kentish Town on the North road; I jumped into the cart, and rid in the cart; he did not know I was in the cart; I got out of the cart; I backed on one side of the horses, and he on the other, until he came to the Green Man at Finchley Common; he stopped his horses there, pulled down his tail board, and pulled the hay out of the cart; he had got two trusses and three quarters in his cart; I saw it when I was in the cart; I considered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150020"></xptr>the three quarters of a truss he might want for his horses at the Green Man; he delivered the hay to a man with a white smock frock. Bromley delivered it into the stable belonging to the Green Man; I stopped a little time; I went to the bar window in the tap room; I saw Bromley drinking at the bar; I then went on to Whetstone to get my breakfast, he never saw me at all. I got my breakfast; I made general enquiry whether the landlord, or the ostler found hay on the road. I returned back to the Green Man at Finchley, and had a glass of wine and water; I saw the man to whom he delivered the hay to; I cannot swear that the prisoner Warren is the man.</p>

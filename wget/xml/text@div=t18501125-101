                  </hi>. I am butler to James Holford, Esq. of Hol<lb></lb>ford-house, Regent's-park, in the parish of St. Marylebone; he is now in America. On Sunday night, 13th Oct., previous to going to bed, I went round the house, I left it perfectly safe, and went to bed between ten and eleven—I sleep over the banqueting-room—about twenty minutes to two o'clock I heard a noise in the banqueting-room—I got out of bed and listened at the window—I looked out on the lawn, and heard a dog barking, and saw what I thought was the shadow of a man or a tree, I lifted up the sash and it moved—I awoke the footman and groom—I armed myself with a double-barrelled pistol, with a bayonet affixed—I gave a sword to the groom, and a gun loaded with ball, shot, and slugs, to the footman—we all three went down—the sashes of the banqueting-room window do not quite come down to the ground, there is a step about two feet six inches deep—the banqueting-room doors have nine or ten squares of ground glass in them—there are no shutters to them—I could see a light through the doors in the banqueting-room, but could see no one—I went round to the stable, at the west wing, and awoke the two coachmen—I took the gun from the footman and gave it to Thomas Hall, one of the coach<lb></lb>men, and gave a pitchfork to the other—I sent the coachmen to the south side of the house—I took the north side, at the other end of the banquet<lb></lb>ing-room, with the others—just as I took my station I heard the report of a gun on the south side—the light had then left that end of the banqueting-room—I went round to the south side, and saw a man running from the direction of the banquetting-room—I followed him—he threw himself under a thorn-bush; I saw it move, and fired at the lower part of the bush—the pistol missed fire, and I heard a voice from the bush say, "Oh don't, for God's sake, don't shoot me"—I could not tell whether there were any more persons in the bush—I fired again—I should expect the shot would have taken effect on the right side of the man's head; I saw his hat and fired a little below it—I then went to the assistance of the other servants, who were crying out very loudly—I there found Dyson in custody—I had passed him before—the police came—I found a candle near the gravel walk, with a piece of paper round it—a portion of one of the vases, which contained flowers in the banqueting-room, was shown to me broken off—there are on the' candelabra some ormolu birds, and also on the vase, and also a cup cover—I saw the window that was examined by Lockerby—it was fastened the night before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 250). On Sunday evening, 13th Oct., at ten o'clock, or a little after, I was at the George, and saw the three pri<lb></lb>soners sitting at the table in the tap-room—there were three or four others at the same table—they appeared to be in conversation—I left them there—Dyson nodded to me as I was standing at the door—Mahon sat at the end of the table, Dyson next, and Mitchell sat opposite Dyson—the others were all at the table—they came in company—there was a man between Mahon and Mitchell, as far as I recollect, but not between Mahon and Dyson—I was with Barry when he took Mahon—when we had got about ten yards, I returned and took Robinson, and took him to the station— Mahon was there, and said to me, "You have no business to bring that man here; he knows nothing about it"—I had heard Barry tell Mahon that he took him for the burglary at Mr. Holford's—I laid hold of Mahon's hand, and looked at it; it was injured—he said he fell on some glass about a fortnight before—I had seen the three prisoners together daily at the George previous to 13th Oct.—after the burglary I went there once or twice every night, and sometimes more, but saw none of them there again.</p>

On the night in question I had taken a fare to the York and Albany public-house, at half-past one o'clock, or twenty minutes to two—I was feeling whether my horse was sweating; and Mahon came up to me from the Gloucester-gate, Regent's-park, in a direction from Mr. Holford's—I asked him whether he wanted a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he said, "No," and told me he had been bitten by a dog, and showed me his right hand, which was bleeding near the palm of the thumb—I said, "There is a pump here; you had better go and wash the blood off"—he went to the pump—I was outside the railing talking to him; he was inside—two or three minutes after I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Great Marylebone-street. On 28th Oct. I examined Mahon at the police-court, and found several marks on his right hand, which I consider had been produced by shot—there were three holes inside his right hand—they did not appear recent—my opinion is that they must have been more than a week old; it may be a fortnight—I also found a cut on the left hand, about an inch in extent—a spike of this description might probably have produced it—it did not appear to me that it could have been produced by the bite of a dog.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WOOLLETT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it a clean or a lacerated cut? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A clean cut; an ordinary spike would not have produced the injury—a knife, or a fall on a sharp flint, would have done it—if done in getting over a fence, I should expect the flesh would be torn, but it would depend on the character of the fence—there were a great many spikes—they were very close together, probably a couple of inches apart—the wound was on the left hand, close to the last finger, on the inner side of the palm—I think it could be produced by spikes of that description.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the shot-marks been wounds, or only indentations? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were indentations when I saw them—from the character of them, I should say shot had been lodged there—I did not extract any shot—the skin had been broken—I should think the skin might have been broken, and shot lodged, and the place healed, in fourteen days, so as merely to leave an indentation—a mere fall on some pebbles would not cause an indentation so deep—I have never seen a fall produce such wounds, but I have seen shot produce a very similar effect—I cannot swear these were shot-marks—I had heard the evidence when I examined his hand.</p>

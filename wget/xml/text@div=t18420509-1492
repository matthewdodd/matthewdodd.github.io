                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and live in Oxford-street. On the 28th of February the prisoner came to me with a note as from Miss Wing<lb></lb>field—this is the note she brought—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Monday morning, February 28. Miss Charlotte Wingfield will feel obliged to Mr. Lewis to send her a small gold chain, cable cut, for her to make choice of, and the money shall be sent to-morrow. 4, Eaton-square, Pimlico."—I had had dealings with</p>

               <p>that family, and I put several chains before the prisoner—she selected two as those most likely to suit—I put them into two boxes, and she took them away—I heard no more of the prisoner till she was in custody at the station, for stealing other property—I went to the station—the officer turned to me and said, "What do you charge her with?"—I said, "With obtaining two gold chains under false pretences"—to the best of my recol<lb></lb>lection the prisoner said, "It is known that I have taken them, and I will tell you where they are," or "I can tell you where they are"—she said they had been in pledge, and since that they were in the hands of a Jewess, of the name of Isaacs, I think.</p>

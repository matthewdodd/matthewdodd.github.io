                  </hi> I keep a coffee-house in Houndsditch—it is my dwelling-house. On 8th Feb., about half-past one o'clock, I missed a cash-box, con<lb></lb>taining 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, from my bed-roomm—I had seen it safe the day before—the prisoner and three others were in the back room first floor, from twelve till about twenty minutes to two o'clock—I saw him leave not ten minutes before I missed the box—people who came had access to that room—I saw no one else there—the bed-room is on the same floor—there is a landing between the rooms and a water-closet, into which I saw two or three of them go—I informed the police, and went to a house in Bethnal-green, and saw one of the men—he ran away, and I have not seen him since—one of the men, not the prisoner, gave me a sovereign that evening—my wife got change for it, and I took it to them—they did not stay ten minutes after that.</p>

                  </hi>. I manage the business for my mother, Elizabeth Payne, who is a pork butcher, living in High-street, in the Borough—Pension has been in our employ about ten months—on the morning of 13th Feb. I watched him—as soon as he came down stairs, he took a hamper from the shelf, and went into the cellar with it—he brought it up, and put it into the cart—I sent him away, and I looked into the hamper—I saw in it three bellies of pork, which were my mother's—he had no authority to take them away—when he came back, I drove the cart and him to Newgate<lb></lb>market—I spoke to a policeman, and I went into the market, leaving Penston in the cart—I had seen Hunt about the market as a porter—he had never worked for me, but through another man for me—I came back, and something was said to me by the policeman—I afterwards saw the same pork at Smithfield station.</p>

From information, on 13th Feb., I watched Mrs. Payne's cart—I saw it stop at Ivy-lane, and the last witness went down into the market, leaving Penston there—Penston then got down, and went into the market—soon afterwards he returned with Hunt—Penston had this cloth in his hand—he got into the cart, and put the three bellies of pork into the cloth, and gave it to Hunt, who put it on his head, and went towards Ivy-lane with it—I followed him, and when he had got to Warwick-lane I stopped him, and asked what he had got there—he said, "Three bellies of pork"—I said, "Where did you bring it from?"—he said, "From home, and I can tell you where I five"—I took</p>

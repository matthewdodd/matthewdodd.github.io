That he then put something else into her Body, she knew not what, but said it was something where the little Boys Cocks are; that it hurt her sadly, and made her cry out.

             depos'd the same. The Constable depos'd, that he heard the prisoner own that he put his Finger into the Child's Body. The prisoner in his Defence said, that he bid the Child go to his Bed, because she had been frighten'd when she lay alone; that coming home in drink, he went to Bed, and fell asleep; that before he was thorowly awake, he laid his Hand upon the Child, thinking it had been his Wife; but as soon as he found his mistake, withdrew from her. That it was no wonder that the Child was poxt, for he believ'd she was born with it, and that her Mother was poxt before her; and that the Prosecution was intirely malicious. The Mother depos'd, that when the Child came home to her, two Weeks after the Fact, she was so sore, that she could not sit; that the Child said, her Master threatned to put her in Bridewell if she told any body, and when he went out, always lock'd her up. The Woman that wash'd the Child's Shift depos'd, that she did not see the Shift any ways bloody, or stain'd: and the Child being ask'd, the same Question, confest that she knew nothing of her Shift's being bloody when she pulled it off, or that she herself had bled at all.

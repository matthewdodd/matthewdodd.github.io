                  </hi>. I am store-keeper at the Lambeth workhouse, and was so on 10th April last—Messrs. Waters and Steel, millers, of Blackfriars, have been in the habit of supplying the workhouse with flour—it was delivered in their own sacks, which, after they were emptied, were fetched away when the other load came—that was the usual custom—they wera fetched by our own carman—on 10th April we had at the workhouse 162 sacks belonging to Messrs. Waters and Steel—on that day I saw the prisoner there—I first saw him on the pavement outside the flour loft door—he then came up the eteps into the loft, and said he came from Messrs. Waters and Steel for some flour sacks—he then began taking them up from the floor and weighing them—during that time I asked him if he was one of Waters and Steel's men—he said he was—there was a horse and cart at the door, and I said to him, "Is that Messrs. Waters and Steel's horse and cart?"—he said, "Yes, it is"—he then went on weighing the sacks till he had finished them—I then said to him, "You are a stranger to me, you may as well sign a receipt for the sacks"—I drew out this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and he signed it—I did not know the prisoner at all—I knew his brother, but I did not know it was his brother till afterwards—he was in the employment of Mr. Ward the flour contractor—he was in the habit of coming with loads of flour—upon this receipt being signed, "Henry Woodman," he took the 162 sacks away—almost all the sacks were branded with the name of Waters and Steel—there might be five or six that were not—I should not have parted with those sacks if I had known that the prisoner was not in the employment of Messrs. Waters and Steel—about a fortnight after this Messrs. Waters and Steel sent for some empty flour sacks—we had about five or six empty sacks which we could not let the prisoner have, as they were full of wheat at the time—inquiries were then made—about six weeks afterwards I went, with an officer named Hudson, to Mr. Weston's—he is what is called a sack collector—when the gate was opened I saw the prisouer in the yard—I said to him, "I suppose you know me again?"—he said, "No, I dou't know that I do; I don't recollect you"—I said, "Don't you recollect coming to Lambeth workhouse for some empty sacks?"—I am not certain then whether he made any answer or not—I then produced the receipt and asked him if he recollected it—he said, it was not his; he did not know anything about it—I am quite sure that he is the man—he did not pay me anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the baker at the Lambeth Workhouse—I was present when the prisoner came on 10th April—I am sure he is the person who came on that day—he came in and I asked him what he wanted—he said he had come from Messrs. Waters and Steel for some sack—I said, "How long have you been with them?"—he said, "I have been with them some time now"—I said, "You are quite a strange hand here; I have never seen you here before"—he said, "I might have been here and you not have seen me perhaps"—I said, "That might be; I don't know"—he said he wanted the sacks—I said, "I suppose you must have them"—I said, "Is that Messrs. Waters and Steel's cart?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "That is a very funny cart for them to send out; it looks more like a cat's meat cart"—it was a curious cart—he then went up into the loft and took away 162 sacks—the store-keeper was there—the prisoner did not pay me anything or Cole—I did not ask for anything—he did not mention the name of Weston at all—it is always a rule when a fresh load of flour comes, to take away the empty sacks—I don't receive anything on the sacks—I have been there six years and a half—ordinary bakers at shops and workhouses receive an allowance of 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a sack when they are returned—that is not so with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Waters and Steel, millers, Holland-street, Blackfriars—they had a contract to supply flour to the Lambeth Workhouse—it expired on 25th March, I think—our men are in the habit of bringing back sacks from that workhouse—I think the contract was for six months, and during all that time they have brought back sacks—I did not authorise the prisoner in any way to fetch them or Mr. Weston—I afterwards sent our own man, and they found that the sacks were gone—the prisoner brought a quantity of sacks on the 11th and 12th—I paid him as from Mr. Weston—he was the collector—I paid the prisoner on the 11th two sums of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on the 12th 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—two separate lots of 300 each on the 11th, that is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 78 on the 12th—that is 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on each sack—supposing these 162 to have been among the sacks which the prisoner delivered, I paid 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on each—that is the usual practice—2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is paid to the baker, and there is a halfpenny profit for the collector—</p>

               <p>they are supposed to be collected from the bakers—I can't tell whether the sacks from the Lambeth Workhouse were among the 300—the prisoner gave me receipts for these sums of money, signed "Henry Ward"—I believe this signature "Henry Woodman" is the same writing—I know the prisoner as I coming from Mr. Weston—if I had seen the name of Ward on the receipt given at the workhouse I should have known at once to whom it belonged.</p>

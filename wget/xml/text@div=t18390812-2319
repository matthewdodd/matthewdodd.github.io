                  </hi>. I am the superintendent of the London house of Isaac Cookson. He has more partners than one—they are plate-glass manufacturers at Newcastle—the prisoner was sent up from there to assist in their employ about six years ago—he had a salary of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—it was part of his duty to receive accounts due to the house, and to enter every day in the cash-book the sums he received—I do not find any entry of 153<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 19th of June as received from Mr. Cook, but I find it entered on the 29th—there is no entry at all in the book of the receipt of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Marney—he never told me that he had received that sum till after he was charged—I find this 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque has been paid in to our banker's on account of the receipts he charged himself with on the 29th of June, so that he accounted for the 153<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on that day, and paid it in part with this cheque—the entries in this cash-book are all his—we keep a book with Mr. Marney—there is no entry in that book of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque on the 26th of June—some differences arose between me and the prisoner, and he was told on the 15th that he would have to leave on the 29th at the finishing of the quarter—on the 29th he made up his accounts at three several times, and in neither of them has he entered this 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the account is deficient that sum.</p>

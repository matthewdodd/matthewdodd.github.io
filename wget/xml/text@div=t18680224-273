                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman X</hi> 11). About half-past five on 15th January, I was in Lancaster Road, and saw the prisoners together—I saw them go into the front garden of Lancaster Lodge, Nothing Hill, which is separated by a high wall from the prosecutor's house—I went and stood inside the gate—after waiting a few minutes, I saw the prisoners come up a passage at the side of the house from the back garden—they then had a bag each—these are the bags (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Hart had something under his arm—I took hold of them, and took them into the hall of Lancaster Lodge—there were some gentlemen outside, and I asked if I might take them there, and they said I might—when I stopped them Hart said, "Do not hold me, you are mistaken, I can show you where I got them from"—he afterwards said he found them lying under a fence—I asked him what he had done with the other bag, he said he had not got one—as I went out to go to the station I found this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) close to where I stopped them—the property has been shown to Emma Thomas, and has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hart. Q.</hi> In what direction were you coming when you first saw me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Up the Lancaster Road, towards the railway station—I passed you out<lb></lb>side—both of you went in at the garden gate—I went inside the gate and waited about three or four minutes—it was not two minutes—the wall is four feet on one side and six on the other—it is six feet in the garden where the linen was taken from—the gate is about forty yards from the house—when I took hold of Cooper he told me to let go—I took hold of you both together—Cooper dropped his bag, I did not take it away—one of the gentlemen picked it up—I will swear you had something under your arm—you made no attempt to get away—I only asked the gentlemen once before they came to my assistance—you could not have seen me from the garden before you got close to me—I had not looked in the bags—I had you by the collar—an examination took place inside the house, and then I took you to the station—one of the gentlemen went for a policeman—I asked for your bag and you said you had not got one—one of the gentlemen was present at the examination of the bags, and one had gone for a police<lb></lb>man—Canton wanted a cab, and I said if the gentleman would take care of you, I would see whether he would go or not—it was about ten minutes from the time I took you in custody till I took you to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Canton. Q.</hi> When did you first see me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Walking with Hart—you were going towards the Round House—you said in the hall you had found the bag, and were going to take it to the station—I called on the gentlemen to assist me—I looked in the bags in the hall, and said it was linen—you said, "There is no occasion to hold me, you have made a mistake"—you said you wanted a cab, because you did not want to be dragged through the streets where you had been known for years—you said you found the bags.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Lancaster Road Villas, Nothing Hill, with my mother, next door to Lancaster Lodge—I have seen the things in the bags, and identify them as belonging to my mother and my sisters—on 15th January they were hanging in the back yard, safe, about half-past four, at half-past five they were gone—I saw some mud on the wall, and foot-steps—the walls are rather high at the back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hart. Q.</hi> How were the things fastened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By pegs; some were tied—There is a mews at the back of Lancaster Lodge, which leads into a back street—there is no glass on the wall—the garden of Lancaster Lodge is very large—you can see the things hanging out from the road—the wall that divides the two gardens is about twelve feet high—there are fruit trees nailed to the wall, it is possible for a man to get from one side to the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hart, in his defence, stated that if they had any felonious intention they would not have gone through the gate but would have gone out into the mews; that the two gentlemen had not come to give evidence; that he never saw that bag at all; that the policeman said he was only three minutes at the gate, when they would have to go the length of the garden, forty yards, get over the wall, unpeg the things, and come back the same way; that he was disgusted at the time, and did not say anything; that if they had got over the wall they would have left footmarks; that they saw some things just inside the gate, and Cooper went in, and the policeman followed almost instantly</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Canton, in his defence, stated that he met Hart, and as they were passing the gate they saw a black thing inside the garden gate, and found it was a bag; he was going to take it to the police-station, but the constable came up and laid hold of him by the collar; that two gentlemen came up, and he asked one of them to go for a constable; that one did so, and was gone a quarter of an hour, but could not find one; that he was taken to the police-station, and was charged with stealing linen, but knew nothing about it</hi>.</p>

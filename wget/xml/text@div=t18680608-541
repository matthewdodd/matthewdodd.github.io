                  </hi>. I am a sailor, of 1, Old Gravel Lane—on 14th May, about 4.30 in the morning, I had come from Liverpool, and was near the Thames Tunnel—the prisoner carried my chest about ten yards, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then got another man to carry my chest to the Gravesend steamboat, and the prisoner came up to me again, and said, "I want another shilling," and pulled my waistcoat pocket out, and my money fell out—I had five sovereigns and four shillings, or a little more—I tried to take him by the throat, and he struck me in the eye—I fell, and he kicked me twice in the side—I saw him pick up the money—I called "Police!" and he ran away towards the bridge—I saw him next at the station.</p>

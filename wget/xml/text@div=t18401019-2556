On the 17th of September I went to bed about half-past seven o'clock, leaving my wife up—when I had been in bed about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, I was alarmed by the cry of "Thieves in the house"—I got up, came down to the street-door, and saw my son at the door, who said something—he is between eleven and twelve years old—I went into the front-room down stairs, and saw things lying about the floor in a disturbed state, and the drawers open—Catling came up and told me something—I went up stairs and dressed myself, and came down again into the front room—I did not examine, to see how any body could have got in—the windows were fast—I saw several matches lying about on the floor—I afterwards saw some property brought back by Catling, which I delivered to the officer.</p>

On the evening of the 17th of September, about eight o'clock, I was in my father's stable, doing up the horse, ten or fifteen yards from Inman's house—the stable looks into Felix-street—I heard the little boy cry out, "Father, here are thieves"—I pushed open my stable-gate directly, and saw a tall man come running, with a black bundle, with part of it showing white—I did not see how he was dressed—I said, "I will have you"—he was then within search or ten yards of me—he directly <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the bundle away, and ran away—I followed him, and kept him in sight—I did not overtake him till the officer took him into custody—I called "Stop thief" all the way I went—I saw the officer take him, and was running with him at the time—I had not lost sight of him from the time he threw the bundle away till the officer took him, only when he just turned the corner, and I was not five yards behind him—I did not lose sight of him for a moment—when I got sight of him again there was no other man in sight—I am sure the man the officer took was the man I saw throw the bundle away—he was taken back to the house—the prisoner is the man, but he had more whiskers than he has now—Catling picked up the bundle, and carried it to the house—it was gone when I came back—he threw it away between Catling's house and our stable, which are next to each other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the night of the 17th of Sep<lb></lb>tember I was on duty, watching the house next to Inman's, and saw the prisoner and a short man together several times while I was there—I saw them just against the shutters of Inman's house between seven and eight o'clock—I walked round, suspecting they were watching me, and saw them—I came round again, and missed the prisoner—I saw the short man standing by himself, just against Inman's place—I crossed and looked at him, and went away—he followed me—a few minutes after I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I ran in a different direction to where I heard the cry—I came to the corner of Hope-street, and saw a number of people singing out "Stop thief," and the prisoner and a short man running from Inman's house, towards Hackney way—I laid hold of the short man first, and put him on the ground—somebody hallooed out, "That is not the man who <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the bundle away, it was the other man"—I then pursued the prisoner, and took him in Hackney-road, running as hard as he could—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184010190110"></xptr>
               <p>he was right out of breath, and could not speak—a person said, "That is the man that robbed the house"—he said he was not guilty—I took him back to the house, searched him, and found on him a silk handkerchief, one shilling, two sorts of lucifer matches, and a knife—some Lucifer matches were given to me by Mr. Inman—I also found two lucifer matches in the bundle of things—the matches found on him and those given me by Mr. Inman were of the same description, (but some of them were partly burnt,) and the same with what were found in the bundle—MR.

Hunt, the prisoner's solicitor, reprimanded me for it, the Magistrate did not—Mr. Hunt spoke to the Magistrate on the subject—while a witness was being examined, I interfered, and Mr. Hunt made an observation—I do not think the Magistrate reprobated my interference—I will not swear he did not—I was standing close to the witness at that time—the Magistrate did not order me to go back, that I swear—I did stand back of my own accord, not on account of the Magistrate ordering me back, but when the remark was made by Mr. Hunt.</p>

            . I keep a public house, the prisoner at the bar had used my house about 6 weeks or 2 months. On the 10th of Sept. he came to my house to dinner, and after that he seemed to be very much in liquor; he beg'd the savour to go and lie down on the bed, I took him up stairs, and let him lie on my own bed, which he did; there were the silver tankard and other things then in that room. My wife and I took a little walk out, and left my man John and a young woman to take care of the house; we were gone out about 2 or 3 hours, when we returned, the prisoner at the bar was gone; we went to bed that night, and got up as usual; next morning my wife went to see for the tankard, before she had put on all her clothes, and found the tea that was in it was emptied into a in the window, and the tankard was gone: where we were upon the inquiry where to find him, he came in and took the paper to read; my wife and I told him, as he was going out, we wanted to speak with him; I charged him with taking these things, he denied it, and began to curse and swear he never wronged man, woman or child in his life, saying, he would surrender himself, and would not stir. I sent for a constable, and we took him to Sir

As I was going along with her, she said, I must have a nightman to get it up, it being down the vault where she lodged: I got a nightman, who soon brought up my tankard out of the vault. The constable found his trunk, and in it the rest of the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>

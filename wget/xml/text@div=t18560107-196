                  </hi>. I am a German. I have been forty-one years in England, carrying on business as a ship broker in London, under the firm of Sack, Bremer, and Co.—I was for five or six years the sole owner of a ship called the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi>, on my own account—in June, 1852, we had two letters from Muntz and Co., of Harliugen, and in May, 1853, the prisoner called on me with Mr. Lindeman—I never saw either of them before—they wished me to send my steamer, the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi>, to Harlingen—she had been there, and they wished me to send her again, which I declined—it was Mr. Moens, the prisoner, who proposed it—I declined doing so, stating it had been a losing concern upon the previous year, and at the same time I mentioned that we had had letters from Muntz and Co. to the same effect—to which Moens replied, "It is all the same concern, we are all three partners"—he had not introduced Lindeman to me before—he did not tell me what Lindeman was, nothing else but, "It is all the. same concern, we are all three partners"—I did not make any proposition or agreement; nothing particular—they wrote to me subsequently, inquiring the draught of water, and the price, and I named 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had conversation with them after<lb></lb>wards, they frequently called at the office—the contract was made to pur<lb></lb>chase the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi> for 10.000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were to pay me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as deposit, in cash, but they gave me a bill—I made the agreement myself, but Mr. Hollania drew out the contract—there was no agreement made at that time for run<lb></lb>ning the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi> in the meantime—I had her employed in the Oporto trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything said afterwards by Moens about hiring the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A second contract was made, the first bill not being paid—the acceptance was refused—I agreed to take 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they made the second contract for the purchase, and they brought me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more as a deposit, making 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but when the time expired they had no cash to pay the remainder; the contract was at an end—I could have kept the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but I did not—the final contract was made on 30th Aug., 1853—I gave them credit for the whole 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—in Aug., 1853, when the contract was entered into, Mr. Hollams was not present—he had made it out, but was not present—on 30th Aug. I entered into a fresh contract—they brought me 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for purchase or hire, according to the new contract—that 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. included the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a sum was agreed to be paid, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week for twelve weeks, or at their option to purchase the ship—(<hi rend="italic">This agreement was here put in and read, dated 30th Aug.</hi>, 1853, <hi rend="italic">between M.

               <p>for the first twelve weeks—Moens did not pay for the ship—a second agreement was then entered into, and that was signed by Lindeman, for Bernelot Moens, and Co.—I saw Lindeman and Moens Very frequently together—Lindeman never acted as a clerk—on the contrary, he proposed that we should keep the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Moens objected to that, and said we ought not to be hard, and I yielded to that, and gave them credit for the whole—in Nov. the second agreement was entered into—on 23rd Nov. I wrote to Moens—this is the letter—it is directed to Lindeman—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "23rd Nov., 1853. Mr. T. H W.

We don't need to say that the boilers were not in a very good condition when we had her in the station, although we were made to suppose they would last for two or three years.

Mr. M. F. Bremer, London. Dear Sir,—As it appears by your letter with the contract that you still are pretending of our owing you money, although Mr. Moens showed you all the wrong posts in your account; and as also you not yet acknowledge receipt of the account charges sent to you in our letter of the 16th of May, 1854, so we beg to enclose you our account current, as also a duplicate of the charges, and if you don't remit us the amount of balance due to us, say 2,063<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., we will take liberty of drawing upon you for that amount, as we don't like to be troubled any longer with your false claims. We once more repeat that the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi> was a private affair of Mr. Lindeman; and the reason why we are at present agents of the <hi rend="italic">Leinwarden</hi> is, because when Mr. Lindeman sold the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi> to Mr. Muntz he made this a condi<lb></lb>tion, as promised to us when he retired himself from our firm.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you answer that claim? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I answered it on 12th March, with a threat of arresting them—I never received the letter of 16th May, which is alluded to in this letter of theirs on 27th Dec.—no proceedings were taken against me—I heard that Moens was in London in March—I em<lb></lb>ployed my solicitor, and he was arrested—after he had been arrested, he commenced an action—I had commenced an action first, but from some circumstances his action came on to be tried first—I heard the evidence about his not being on board the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi>—I saw Mr. James produce a book,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Marten, Thomas, and Hollams. I was attorney in the actions of Bremer against Moens, and Moens against Bremer—the action of Moens against Bremer was tried first—I received instructions from Mr. Bremer in presence of Mr. Moens respect<lb></lb>ing the agreement—it was ultimately drawn from those instructions—when it was said the terms were 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, it was not spoken of as a nominal sum, never—the terms were not discussed before me—they merely told me the agreement they had made—it was prepared in my own office, and I read it over in presence of Moens.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say, "Suppose we put 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; is that fair? or any sum you like?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing of the kind—no conversation took place at that time, and nothing was said about the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being a nominal sum—the arrange<lb></lb>ment between themselves was not discussed in my presence—these matters were all put into my hands, and afterwards 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week was charged—I put that down—I was present at the trial, and heard Mr. James open the case—I heard him read the letter reported to be sent on 21st Feb.—I after<lb></lb>wards saw this book put into the prisoner's hand, and heard the evidence he gave—the book was passed by me towards him, and I took the liberty to see that the letter was in the order of date—I believe the prisoner had the book in his hand, and I heard him make the statement he did—I heard the verdict given—it depended upon certain principles, and the figures were adjusted by the Chief Justice—I heard the prisoner state that he was not in England on the 22nd Feb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a letter produced written by Lindeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot speak to that, at the time of the trial—it was produced before the arbitra<lb></lb>tors—it was directed to Bernslot Moens and Co., Harlingen; it is dated "London. 21st Feb., 1854"—it is from Lindeman to Moens—here is an in<lb></lb>dorsement on it—"Letter, London, 21st Feb., 1854; R 23, R. 25;" meaning</p>

               <p>received on the 23rd, and responded to or answered on the 25th—this in<lb></lb>dorsement is the prisoner's writing—the letter appears to have gone by the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi>—it was written in Dutch—this is a translation: ("London, 21st Feb., 1854, per <hi rend="italic">Queen.</hi> To Messrs. Bernelot Moens and Co., Harlingen. Gentle-men,—I have seen to-day, Mr. Bremer, and according to your orders com<lb></lb>municated him that you decline to renew the agreement, as you think there is no chance to find the necessary funds to make up the purchase money for the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi>, and that you do not feel inclined to keep the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi> on the station for your account, on paying hire. It appeared, however, that Mr. Bremer was very well satisfied with the freight made this week by the steamer, and he is decided to run the boat, for instance, a few voyages more to Harlin<lb></lb>gen, for his own account and risk. With regard to the hire for the twenty-four voyages or weeks, I had also a conversation with him; and although he must confess that the hire stated in the agreement cannot be of any con<lb></lb>sequence, he would not take less than 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week. I gave myself much trouble to have this enormous high price reduced, but Bremer's mind was not to be altered upon this point. I am sorry that you decline entirely upon this steamer mentioned to you by Mr. Bremer, in his letter last week, as it appears to me to be very suitable. Even if you would, the boat is not to be purchased now, and the chance lost. By the accounts of sale, you will perceive that the cattle dealers have lost this week much money. The market was very dull; my opinion, however, is, it will be better next week. Within a few days I hope to write you more about the other matter, and remain with kind respects, your obedient servant, J. H. W. Lindeman")—The original is indorsed in the handwriting of the prisoner, "London, 21st Feb., 1854, J. H. W. Lindeman; R 23, R 25"—from hearing what Moens swore, with reference to the 22nd, 23rd, and 25th of Feb., I caused inquiry to be made, and having learned the facts which have been deposed to to-day, I caused the hotel keeper to be subpœnaed—when the case was called on the next time, one point was referred to Mr. Davidson; and there was one that the Lord Chief Justice was to determine, that was the purchase of the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi>—that would turn the verdict either way—I was present when Moens was examined before the arbitrator—the books were produced, and amongst them were these two books—while Moens was being examined, I examined this book (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—Moens objected to my looking at the books, more particularly these two books—the prisoner more than once complained that I was looking at matters which did not relate to the trans<lb></lb>action—there were some letters which in my opinion had reference to this transaction—there were several in Dutch; I said I could not read Dutch, and I wished I could—that was heard by the prisoner—the books were retained by the arbitrators—when I saw this book again it was not in the same state in which I had examined it before—a great many letters had been torn out—some of them undoubtedly were letters to which I had called attention in the presence of the prisoner—one letter which I had remarked, but had not called attention to, still remained—it is in the handwriting of Moens—it is in Dutch, and is dated the 4th of Sept., 1854—I looked carefully at the dates—this hole in the paper was not there when I turned over the letters.</p>

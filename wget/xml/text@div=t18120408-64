            . On the 11th of February last, I was stationed at the Export West India-dock. I passed the prisoner on the bridge, he was coming from the Export dock, he had a jacket under his left arm, I asked him what he had got in his jacket, he said nothing; I asked him a second time, he said, a bit of meat; I asked him to let me see, he refused; Pearce, my brother officer said, why refuse the officer seeing what it is, and taking the jacket from him, I found this piece of cotton in his jacket, under his arm: we took him to the guard-house, and searched him, and found three pieces more secreted under his shirt, and two dozen of buttons I found in his pocket, after I had done searching him, I saw this knife open in his hand.</p>

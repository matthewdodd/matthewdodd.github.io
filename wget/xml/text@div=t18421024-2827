A man named Powell was in our employ—having missed a great many shirts during the last two months, I watched Powell, and on the 14th of October, in con<lb></lb>sequence of what I saw, I gave him into custody—he told me that he had taken between five or six dozen shirts—on the 13th of October, I had secreted myself behind some boxes in a place we call the odment room—I had marked shirts belonging to my master previously to the 11th—I cannot positively say these were missing in September—I have seen some shirts since in the hands of twenty-three pawnbrokers which I can swear to.</p>

I am in the employ of Mr. James Ward, fruiterer, of 19, Newgate Street—about 4.45 on the evening of 8th January I was serving in the shop, the prisoner came in with another boy—he asked for some nuts; a little girl in the shop served him—they left, and immediately they had gone I missed the money box—I had seen it safe while they were in the shop, as I had put some money in—it contained about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and some coppers, but I could not say to what amount—I went to the door, and a young man nest door went in search of them, and the prisoner was brought back in custody.</p>

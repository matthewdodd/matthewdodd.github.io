                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). I watched the premises of Messrs. Matthieson and Co., and on 15th June, in consequence of what I saw, I called Brooks into a room, where he made a statement—on May 24th I went to West's premises in Golden Lane with another officer and Mr. Raley, Messrs. Matthieson's foreman—I told West that Brooks was in custody for stealing paper, and had told me that he (West) had bought two reams at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ream—he said "Yes, I bought some from a man I do not know and have never seen before"—I then went upstairs in the kitchen, and Raley took four reams of paper from underneath the counter, and said "That is our paper"—West said "Yes, that is it"—West then produced a book and showed me an entry of 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 12th May, which he said was the first transaction he had had with Brooks—he said "I suspected it was wrong, and I told him not to bring any more," and he said "I had three or four other transactions with him after that," and he pointed out the entries in the book produced, of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 16th May; 19th, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and 26th, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and June 2nd of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 13th 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., all for paper—he said "He told me he was hard up and he wanted a pair of boots"—I asked why he suspected Brooks; he said "Because he used to bring the paper before 8 o'clock in the morning"—I asked if he had any more in his place; he said he had not—when I first saw the paper I told West I should take him into custody and cautioned him—on taking him downstairs he said he wanted to speak to his workman, and I heard the words "paper upstairs"—I left him in charge of Halse in a cab, and went back and found the work<lb></lb>man West had spoken to, and West's wife moving this parcel of paper—I took it to West, who said "Yes, that belongs to Mr. West, of 128, Cheap-side," and he showed me the bill-head which was underneath the cover—I took him to Bow Lane police-station, where the property was identified, and Brooks said "That is what I sold to West"—West is a printer and employs four or five hands.</p>

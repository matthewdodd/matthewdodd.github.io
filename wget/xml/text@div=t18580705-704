                  </hi>. I live at No. 26, Porter Street. The prisoner is my husband; we have been separated very nearly four years—on Monday, 14th June, about 10 o'clock at night, I was standing in Earl Street, talking to my daughter-in-law, and saw my husband in the middle of the road, coming with his face towards me; I endeavoured to avoid him, by walking away—he came across the road, on to the pavement, overtook me, and took hold of me by the shoulder very heavily—he said something, and I said, "Do not take hold of me so brutish; you will find you have a wrong one to deal with"—he then took hold of me very lightly; then he repeated my words—he then took hold of me again, with a very strong grasp, on the same shoulder, saying, "I do not care for your protection," and struck me a blow on the neck with his right hand, which I think was clenched—I put up my left hand, and found blood coming from a wound in my throat—I struggled very slightly with him, and fell—I believe he then walked away; I do not know anything more—I was picked up, and taken to a surgeon's, and then to Charing Cross Hospital, where I have been ever since.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 12, Compton Street, Soho. Shortly after 10 o'clock, on the night of 14th June, I was talking to a friend, at the corner of Earl Street and West Street, which commands a view of both West Street and Earl Street, I heard a rush by my side; I turned round, and saw the prisoner push a woman against the gutter of the public house, close to where I was standing—I cannot swear to the woman, for I did not observe her particularly—the prisoner then put his right leg back, and stood like this, and deliberately his arm went twice towards the woman; whether he struck her or not, I cannot tell—his arm was going in this direction, as if he was stooping partly—I cannot say against what part of her his arm would have gone, because she was fixed against the shutter, and appeared to be trying to slide down—I can positively assert that be struck her; he appeared to strike her twice, and she sank on the pavement, and I heard a kind of a groan or a cry—I was as close as I am to you, rather closer; I only had to turn my head round—the prisoner walked slowly round into West Street; I walked directly after him, as close as I could keep to him—I heard a person cry, "A woman is stabbed!"—I immediately took hold of the prisoner, and</p>

               <p>said to him, "You must go with me to Bow Street;" he said, "Let me alone"—I said that it was too late, go he most—I was not aware of it, but a person, a boy, I believe, cried out that he had got a knife in his hand, and the prisoner immediately threw it on the pavement; the boy picked it up, and delivered it to me; I had it with my right hand, and the prisoner with my left—I went down West Street with the prisoner, up St. Martin's Lane and Long Acre, met a policeman, and gave him into his hands, telling him to take him to Bow Street; I followed, and took the knife to Bow Street Station, and gave it to the inspector on duty—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it had no case to it when I saw it; it was covered with blood.</p>

                  </hi>. On 14th June, I was house surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital. I have lately resigned—on that evening, about half past 10 o'clock, Mrs. Dobson was brought there—she was seen by the surgeon in the hospital the same evening, and I examined her the following morning, and found her in a very debilitated state—she had a punctured wound in the centre of the collar bone, on the right side; it extended directly backwards; it was three or four inches deep, and about an inch wide, penetrating to the blade bone; it bled considerably—it most have been given with considerable violence with this instrument—this knife might have inflicted it—the point was stopped by the bone—she was in a very alarming state for two or three days—she had lost a good deal of blood—the danger was from the amount of fever—the wound must have been given from before, backwards; I mean, a thrust forwards.</p>

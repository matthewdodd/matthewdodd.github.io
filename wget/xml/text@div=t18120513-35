            . I am a fellowship-porter. On the 5th of May, before ten o'clock, I happened to go into the tap-room, I saw that the prisoner had something of a bulk; I hit her over the thigh. I told her I suspected she had got something there that was not her own; she made no answer; in the space of three quarters of a minute she dropped three pint pots; they were all three clean ones. They had not had any beer in them. She was taken into custody immediately. I picked up the pots, there is the name of

               <p>Prosecutor. They are my pots; I value them at three shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Tuesday morning I went out to a day's washing; I came home about eight o'clock in the evening; there was a letter when I came home, for my husband to go and bottle off wine. I went to Mr. Child's tap-room to see my husband, to give him this letter; my husband told me to get a pint of beer; that man came to me and said, you have got something that does not belong to you. I said, I had nothing but my pocketbook and a few halfpence; they searched me and found nothing. I go out a charring to gentleman's houses, and wish to get my bread in an honest manner.</p>
               <p>Q. to French. Are you quite sure that you felt the pots before she was searched - A. Yes. I turned up her apron, she had got a very large pocket, big enough to hold a bushel of corn.</p>

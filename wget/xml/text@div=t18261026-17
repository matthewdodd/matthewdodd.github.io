On the 21st of September, about a quarter to ten o'clock in the morning, I was at breakfast with my wife, quite at the back of the house, on the ground floor - the two windows of the room look into an orchard; they were open, and are about three feet from the ground. I put my watch on the breakfast table, and left the room<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260012"></xptr>with my wife, just to walk round the grounds. I have a little boy five years old; he was in the nursery at breakfast time. I walked from my house into the stable, and in about ten minutes, on returning from the stable-yard, I came througg the shrubbery suddenly, in sight of the window, and saw the prisoner getting in or out of the window; both his hands were on the window, as if he was dropping down; I immediately seized him by the neck, close to the window, and said, "You scoundrel, you have robbed me;" he attempted to get away - he replied,"You see I have only come to sell lemons;" he had a small basket. I took him into the stable-yard, and called to the gardener - my little boy immediately said, in the prisoner's presence, "I saw you get into the window," and when I complained that he did not tell me of it, he said, "I thought he had come to clean the windows - I saw him when you and mamma left, as I was playing in the orchard, and I saw him get into the window." I left the prisoner three or four minutes, to send for an officer, and as he had made some resistance to the gardener, I came out with a sword; the prisoner then complained, and said,"You see I have only come to sell lemons, and I have lost two or three out of my basket;" my little boy replied,"Oh! I saw you lose your lemous - I know where they are" - he immediately ran into the shrubbery, and brought both the lemons and my watch - it was laying with the lemons;" all this shurubbery into the stable-yard; the lemons and watch were found four or five yards off, so that he might have thrown them there without my observing it. Two chairs had stood in the recess of the window, and one I found had been removed, to make room for somebody to get in. It is a gold watch, and worth 40l.</p>

            . I am Mr. Kershaw's gardener. I was in the stable-yard; I heard master call out, and went to his assistance - I saw the prisoner in his custody; I took him into the stable-yard, and there he complained of losing his lemons; the child instantly said, "I will go and seek your lemons" - he returned in less than a minute with the watch in one hand, and the lemons in the other; it was a dry morning. I had been digging under the window - I looked next day, and saw the marks of a man's footsteps under the window.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Kershaw's service. On the 21st of September I was in the pantry, and heard him call out - I went out, and saw the prisoner in custody, between master and the gardener; I went into the breakfast-room - the watch was not on the table; I shut down the window, and observed footsteps leading from the window to the table, on the drugget and carpet - it was quite wet, from the mould under the window.</p>
               <p>MR. KERSHAW. I had only slippers on - the footsteps could not be mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the house to see if they wanted lemons - I knocked at the door, and received no answere; the gentleman then came and collared me - he shook me violently, and said he suspected I had been to his parlour - I said not; he gave me to the gardener, then fetched a cutlass, and said if I offered to move he would cut me down - I said I had done nothing; he sent the servant to see if all was safe - she returned, and every thing was safe; a child came to him with the watch in his hand - the gentleman took it from the child. I declare I was never in the house, and never saw the watch till I saw it in the child's hand. Previous to that the child had been missing from the house fifteen weeks.</p>
               <p>MR. KERSHAW. The child had been playing under the window.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it possible your child could enter the parlour while he went for the lemons? A. It is impossible - he must have gone all round the house, but he darted into the shrubbery, and brought it directly. The prisoner must have opened the gate to get into the orchard.</p>

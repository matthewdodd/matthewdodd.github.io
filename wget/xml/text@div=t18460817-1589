                  </hi>. I am a glass-dealer. The prisoner was taken into my service about the 10th of June, as a town-traveller, at a salary of two guineas a-week—I gave him instruction on the 3rd of July, or a few days before, to make out this account—this is his writing—I can swear to it—it was his duty to give me the money he received the first time he saw me—I saw him either on the 3rd or 4th of July, and asked him if he had been to Mr. Fenton's—he said, yes, and Mr. Fenton was out of town, and would be back in a fortnight—he never accounted to me for this money—I had other settle<lb></lb>ments with him—he did not say anything more about this money.</p>

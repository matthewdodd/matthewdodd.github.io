            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250025"></xptr>On the 17th of October, in consequence of information, I went with Edwards, Lloyd, Kirby, and Reynolds, to No. 1. Ponder's-place, Reynolds'-court, Ropemaker-street, Cripplegate - we are all officers except Reynolds; we got there about four o'clock in the afternoon, and found the street door open; I opened the door of the parlour on the right hand side, which was on the latch; Lloyd went in with me. I saw all the prisoners there, very near the fire place - Mrs. Cole was sitting very near the fire, close to the table - the other five prisoners were all round the table; Cole had her bonnet off, and nothing on but her gown; Smith was the same - Milton had her bonnet and shawl on - the men were dressed, and had their hats on: we forced them all from the table, up into the corner of the room, which is near another door of the room, which opens into White-street; it is a corner house, with two doors to it. The other officers then came in; they began to secure the prisoners, and I heard money drop - I cannot tell from which of them, but it dropped from somebody in that corner; after we secured them we sent for Mr. Powell, and in about two minutes the two Mr. Powells and Mr. Field, the inspector, came, and the prisoners were sent to the office; Edwards, Kirby, and Lloyd went to the office with them; before they went Edwards found some money in the corner, and picked it up; there was a basin with water in it on the table, with four counterfeit shillings, and four counterfeit sixpences in it; they were in a rough state, just as they came from the mould; before the prisoners were taken away we found two moulds, one on each hob; one for shillings, and the other for sixpences - I felt them, and they were quite warm.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the warmth such as they might acquire from being on the hob, or as if they had had hot metal in them? A. As if they had had metal in them; the hobs were brick; in my judgment the moulds had been recently used; the window of the room had a curtain from top to bottom, which made the room quite dark; nobody could see into it. Mr. Field felt the moulds as well as I did; when the officers returned we proceeded to make a general search; I found the four shillings and four sixpences in the basin of water on the table; it stood there when we went in; one mould was on each hob - that was all I myself took possession of. I found a linen apron on the back of the chair where Mrs. Cole sat; there are spots of white metal on it, as it has been dropped when hot - it is metal itself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you say whether you know Cole has been deserted by her husband? A. I cannot say that of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SMITH. There is a curtain to the window, but it was drawn up when they entered. Mrs. Cole desired the officers to put it down. Witness. The curtain was down; there were people pulling it up and peeping through, and Edwards pushed them away. There are two windows; one is a glazed door, which looks into White-street, that had no curtain to it; people could look into the room through that, but I cannot say whether they could see the fire-place from there - I believe they could not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SMITH. There are only three squares of glass, and one of them is broken in half; the curtain is green; Cole begged of them to put it down, that there might not be a bustle in the place.</p>

            . I am an officer, and accompanied Limbrick and the other officers to the house in question, and assisted in securing the prisoners; I secured Milton: I followed close behind Limbrick; there was a small table in the middle of the room, near the fire place, and they appeared to me to be all round it. Limbrick went nearest to the fire-place; Cole was close to the fire - I do not know whether she was sitting or standing; Limbrick went first - I took hold of Milton's left hand; she was standing near a chair at that time: she then sat down - I still held her hand; I stood up myself, and heard something fall from Milton, apparently from her right hand; I afterwards saw it was six counterfeit shillings, and two counterfeit sixpences. I found three of the shillings and one sixpence on the chair, on which she sat; I did not observe that chair before she sat on it; I found the other shillings and sixpence on the floor; there was no carpet - they fell on the boards; one sixpence was in the chair, and one on the floor. I took possession of them, and now produce them; I did not pick them up till we returned from taking the prisoners to Hatton-garden; I observed them in the place before I went away, but left them till I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Hatton-garden, did you leave any body in the room? A. Yes; the two Mr. Powells, Mr. Field, and Limbrick; on my return I found the money as I have mentioned, and on the table, close by where Milton sat, I found this piece of sand-paper, which appears to have rubbed some white metal; I saw some green baize on the table, close by where Milton sat, and here is a piece of metal adhering to it, which has been dropped on it in a hot state - there are several pieces of metal on it - there were two tables in the room; this was on the largest table; the marks are only on one side of the baize, but the other side has something white on it, like plaster of Paris; I found a piece of old carpet near the fire-place, with a quantity of metal adhering to it, like that on the baize.</p>

               <p>Q. By being secured, do you mean handcuffed? A. Yes; her left hand was handcuffed to another prisoner; she threw it from her right hand, which was at liberty; I picked it up immediately, and put it into my pocket, where I had nothing else; when I took it up I found it was shillings and sixpences, and they were quite warm;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250026"></xptr>I afterwards counted them - there were fifteen counterfeit shillings, and twenty-four counterfeit sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that the warmth was from their being newly manufactured, or was it the warmth of the hand? A. The warmth of the hand; on our return from the office, having left Mr. Powells and Limbrick there, Mr. Field gave me some plaster of Paris out of the right hand cupboard; there was a tin cannister full, and some in a paper; on the left hand side of the fire-place I found two earthen pipkins on the hob; they have been on the fire, and in one of them is a portion of white metal; I found some glass-paper by the fender, and it has been used - it is finer than sand-paper, and would finish the coin after the application of the sand-paper; in the left hand cupboard I found this crucible, with a portion of metal in it: I found the frame of a mould, but it was spoiled, and a mould, the impression of which is defaced - it is made of plaster of Paris; I found on the hob a quantity of pipes, and metal has run right through them; I found two pairs of large scissars, which would clip metal.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I suppose you have been employed on similar occasions before, would these scissars clip off the ragged parts of the coin? A. Yes.</p>

I keep the house in which the prisoners were taken - Mrs. Cole rented that parlour - I let it to her on the 3d of March; she came with her husband, as I supposed; he was there till the Wednesday before, or the Wednesday after Whitsuntide; when I missed him, I asked her where he was; she said he had assaulted a landlord, and was taken up for an assault - I have seen Austen come backwards and forwards there - I knew Smith for a fortnight before she was taken; she was there backwards and forwards as a young woman out of a situation, for that fortnight, and I believe was there by night, as well as day - I believe she slept with Mrs. Cole; there was no other bed in the room, except a small one, for a little boy about eight years old - I never saw Milton or Riley, till the day they were apprehended; Mrs. Cole told me she was a book-folder, and worked at a shop - I never saw her employed at home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When she first came to your house, used she to go out early in the morning? A. Yes, and return to her meals, as if she was engaged some where; this continued till within a fortnight of her apprehension, and during that time she seemed to be very ill.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Who paid your rent? A. Mrs. Cole paid me weekly - sometimes she would pay me two or three shillings, or sixpences, and the rest in copper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has she any children? A. Two - one a boy, about eight years old, who lives with her, and a girl about twelve, who is kept by the grandmother.</p>
               <p>Q. Since her husband left her, has he come to give her any support whatever? A. No, and I believe she very often wanted bread for her child; she continued to work up to the fortnight, and then appeared ill; she appeared an industrious woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner AUSTEN. Q. How long before the apprehension, had you seen me there? A. I believe it was some time before - I have seen him while the husband was at home, and since he has left; it must be three weeks or a month before he was taken, that I had seen him there - I have seen him there, three or four times - I cannot say how long he stopped, as he might go in at one door, and out at the other - I never knew him there long together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he remain there long enough to be engaged in any work in the room? A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>JOHN LIMBRICK. I produce the pair of moulds which I found on one hob; here is a piece of money in it, which was in the basin of water, on the table, and it had then the mark of the channel of the mould, in which the metal ran; it is just as it came from the mould; the impression agrees with the mould; it has evidently been cast in that mould.</p>

            . I am a plaster-figure and mould-maker, and live in Cock-lane, Smithfield. I have frequently seen Cole at my place; she frequently came to purchase 6d. worth of plaster of Paris, and more than once I have seen Smith with her; neither of them ever told me for what purpose they meant to use it; it was purchased in the powder: plain water would render it into a composition; the moulds produced, appear to have been made of plaster of Paris; to the best of my knowledge, it is two or three months from this time that they came to my shop, but I am by no means certain of the time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The mould once used to take an impression, cannot be again used, can it? A. I do not know about that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SMITH. I was never in his place in my life? Witness. I am certain you and Mrs. Cole came together.</p>

            . I live in this house. Cole first came there on the 3d of March; a man came with her, and left her a week before, or a week after Whitsuntide; she had a little boy who slept with her - I have seen Austen at Mrs. Cole's; he came frequently, when her husband was at home, and since, but for five weeks or a month before she was taken, I have not seen him - I know Smith by seeing her with Mrs. Cole during the fortnight before the apprehension - I saw Rowland there a week before the apprehension.</p>

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin, of the Mint. I have examined these shillings and sixpences, and all the money produced; it is all counterfeit, and all of the same description; it is a white metal, generally called Britannia metal, which common spoons are made of; the money is all cast in a mould - I have compared it with the moulds found - I have compared one of the shillings produced from the basin found on the table, with the mould; it fits precisely; here is a lump on the side, which fits the broken part of the mould exactly - I have compared some of the shillings produced by Edwards, with the pair of moulds; there is a crack in the mould, from the heat; and I find on the coin, an impression of that crack; the moulds have evidently been used a great many times; the sharpness of the impression diminishes every time it is used; these have been used a considerable number of times - I went into the room a few minutes after the prisoners were in custody; the Mr. Powells were with me - Limbrick handed me two pairs of moulds from the hob - they appeared quite hot through - I felt them inside and out - I cannot say how the heat might have arisen - I apprehend, it is necessary to keep the moulds always hot, as the metal will then flow into them better, it does not chill; the coin produced by Edwards, I suppose, to be all in a state in which they would put it into circulation - I constantly find it in circulation in that state; there is one mould for sixpences, and another for shillings.</p>
               <p>COLE's Defence. A great many words the witness has said are false, for, when he entered the room, he stood with his back against the bedstead - I begged of him to pull the curtain down, and shut the door, that there might not be a disturbance, and one of them pulled the curtain down - I was not sitting down, but standing up - I do not think I have any body here to speak for me, as I thought my trial would not come on till evening.</p>
               <p>SMITH's Defence. I was out of place, and went to lodge with Mrs. Cole, about a fortnight before I was taken - I was not at home in the day time, not in the morning; I went to look after a situation; one day as I was going after a situation to Parr's office, Mrs. Cole was going part of the way up Holborn; she met Milton, and asked her to come and take a cup of tea with her; she had not been in the place half an hour, when we were taken - I had nothing in my hand, and dropped nothing - I never saw any thing of this kind going on whatever - I was out almost all day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SMITH to MR. GIANNELLI. Q. Can you swear you have seen me in your place with Cole, for I never was in your shop? A. Yes, I have, I am quite certain - I had nothing particular to draw my attention to them; a great many persons come to purchase plaster of Paris, both men and women - Smith said nothing - Mrs. Cole asked for the plaster; I cannot recollect how long ago it was.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was she there more than once? A. I cannot say that - I know she was there once; she never came alone, that I know of; she did not ask for any thing.</p>

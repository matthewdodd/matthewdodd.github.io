               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.Have you the knife here? A. Yes; the prisoner is a labourer in the East India House; it is a knife which he uses to open tea chests - I had lodged in the same room with him for about three months and slept with him; I had had words with him, in the presence of Jones, on the Monday night; I said he had come home drunk on the Sunday night, and complained that his toe nails annoyed me in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night this happened, was not the prisoner in the room before you went into it? A. He was not; he came in after I was in bed and asleep; I was awoke by his marching about the room and using abusive language; he came along on my side of the bed and stumbled down by my box; he was not so much in liquor for he could lock the door and wind up a Dutch clock; I don't think he sat on the bed at all; I first saw the knife after I let Mrs. North in, as he was coming round the bed, and the instant I saw it I knocked him down; my hand was bleeding before I let Mrs. North in, and before I saw the knife - Mrs. North said on the Monday morning that she saw my hand bleeding - I believe the prisoner has an annuity from his friends; I never said I might as well have the annuity as him, and that his friends would pay it to me, and I would prosecute him to get him out of the way; I said nothing to that effect at any time; I don't know his friends; I might use abusive language to him on the Monday - and on that night he went out of the room, came in again, and said,"Now Mr. Edward, if you say another word to me, I have got a brace of pistols in my pocket and will send a bullet into you;" I might have said I would knock his head off.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you suppose the knife was likely to lay on your side of the bed, or was it always in his possession? A. He generally carries it about him in his waistcoat pocket, and used it to cut his victuals; it is very sharp - he got into bed with his breeches and waistcoat on; I suppose he got into bed to do as he had threatened, and that was the reason I struck him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On Wednesday morning, the 24th of April, I saw the prosecutor; he had a simple wound of the integuments, partly entering the tendons of the hand: I think I dressed his hand four times myself; his hand was disabled during the time I attended him; he has very nearly the use of his hand now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was not a very severe wound? A.Certainly not; if the prosecutor's hand came in contact with the prisoner's, with the knife in it, such a wound might be inflicted; but it would depend on the position of the hand.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Will you describe the cut? A. It was a transverse cut across the back of the hand, dividing the integuments and one of the tendons; the hand and the knife must have been very nearly in a line with each other.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house; I saw the prosecutor's hand, and it appeared to me dreadfully wounded; and I moreover saw a wound on his left arm, a scratch with a little drop of blood flowing from it; and on examining his shirt there was a cut exactly corresponding - on searching the prisoner's person, I found a variety of documents, and among them a duplicate, and next morning I stated to him what I had taken from him, and mentioned the duplicate, he said "Ah, that is the thing that did all the mischief;" I said, how so; he said, "I pawned a coat that day, and with that I got intoxicated."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you spoken to Thomas Jones respecting this case? A. We may have got into conversation about the badness of the case; I did not use threatening language to deter him from giving evidence; I don't see what evidence he could give; he came to my house and requested me to give up the documents which I took from the prisoner - I refused; he said Mr. Wontner wished them to be given up, as they related to property; I said I would deliver them to Mr. Wontner myself; I found that was false; I saw

             the next day, and said,"How dare you come to me and state a falsehood, I certainly will tell the Judge what you have said to me;" I never used angry words towards the prisoner, nor demanded money of him; I took one shilling and ninepence from him when I searched him, and he ordered me to pay it to different people for services they had rendered him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I came home that night, I was going to cut my toe nails, Pinniger called me an old b-g-r and a boar; I took no notice of him, I was going to take my stockings off, and he fetched me a rap and down I went; I got up again, he aimed at me again and caught the knife, he said to me "I will have that annuity made over to me; your relations will pay me sooner than you; you have possession under two forged wills, I will get you transported" - Mr. Horton demanded nine shillings from me for taking me to and from the prison - I had taken this lodging to myself, but this young man came as a religious man, but I found him quite the opposite, and I believe there was some correspondence with my family; they have had me twice in Whitecross-street prison; the ill-treatment I have received from that man is most unaccountable; I had no animosity towards him, and did not mean to stab him, nor threaten his life; he came to me as savage as a bear both on Saturday and Sunday night; Mr. Jones and Mrs. North could hardly keep him from me; my life has often been threatened by him.</p>

            . I keep the house in White-street, where these persons lodge; the prisoner came home on this night about half-past ten o'clock; the prosecutor was then in bed; the prisoner came into my room very much intoxicated; I could not get him up, he staggered so; I got him to sit down, he talked a good deal to himself, and was quite stupid, he fell down all along the hearth; I got him up to bed with the assistance of the watchman very quietly; I took off his shoes and gaiters, untied his garters and the knees of his small-clothes, and put him on the bed-side; he was quite comfortable and wished me good night - I left the room, and went up in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to see if all was safe; when I first went into the room with him, Pinniger was in bed, I told him to get further and make room for the prisoner, but he was very heavy in sleep, and I don't think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160055"></xptr>he knew I was there; when I went up again Pinniger opened the door to me, and the moment I entered he struck the prisoner down all along on the floor; the prisoner was out of bed standing on his feet; when I left him he had his coat on, but he then had only his breeches and waistcoat on - the prosecutor was sober, thelight was burning, I could see the prosecutor distinctly, I was close to him, I saw no blood at all - when he knocked the prisoner down he never moved hand nor foot; I said "Oh Edward, how could you do so;" he turned to his bed-side and said "Do you think I can stand this?" and as he spoke he wound a handkerchief round his hand, but I don't know why, I was some distance off; I saw no blood - the prisoner was very drunk and quite helpless; I did not see anything in his hand; I never heard the prosecutor say anything about the prisoner's annuity; the prisoner was a particularly inoffensive man, rather a peace-maker than a peace-breaker.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. On your oath was there no knife in the room? A. There was; because he had it in his hand, but I did not see it till it was put into my hand after the blow was given - my daughter took it out of his hand as she said - I cannot say whether the prosecutor's hand was or was not cut when I entered the room, or whether his handkerchief was then round his hand; I saw him wind one round his hand afterwards; I saw blood on his shirt, I suppose that came from his hand; there was a hole in his shirt, it looked more like a tear than a cut.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did the prosecutor hit the prisoner with his right or left hand? A. His right hand, I am sure of that; there was only two spots of blood on his shirt; he told me he struck the prisoner with his right hand, but I cannot say, I was so frightened; he is not left-handed.</p>

            . I am a watchman, on the 24th of December, about half after eleven o'clock, as I was walking up and down near the Middlesex-Hospital, a man informed me, that two men were gone by with some lead, I went after them, I passed them, and then turned round and faced them, and asked them what they had there, and they threw down the lead, I laid hold of the prisoner, he got away from me, but was stopped by another man; the other made his escape, the next day being Christmas day, we kept him in the watch-house 'till Monday, and then took him before justice Welsh, I found out by chance that it belonged to Mr. Thorn, and was taken from a shed of his, there was some lying by the shed not taken away, I saw the building, and the lead lying by it.</p>

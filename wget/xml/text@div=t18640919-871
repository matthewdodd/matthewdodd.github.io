I am the wife of Frederick Smith, of 19, Sekforde-street, Clerkenwell, which is exactly opposite the prisoner's house—from my room, I can see into theirs—on Monday, 1st August, I heard quarrelling in their room; it continued about half an hour—I was sitting at the window before it commenced—the prosecutrix was lying on the bed—both window were wide open—it was about half-past 4 in the day—she came to the window, and I thought I saw blood on her lace and hands—she turned round with her back to the window, and her hair was all down her back—as it being very white, I could see plainly that it was covered with blood—the prisoner was standing by her side—he was speaking to her in an angry tone, and I saw him strike her on the head with something—it was some<lb></lb>thing with a handle; and after the blow, the blood streamed afresh down her back, and she was a dreadful sight—she called out, "Oh! murder!" and I called as loudly as I could from my window for some one to go to her assistance—I was very much frightened, and I went in, and saw no more of it.</p>

               <p>August, after the alarm was given, I went with the constable up stairs to the prisoner's room, on the second floor—when we got in, the prosecutrix was neither sitting or standing; she was half-kneeling, any how, between a chair and the window, in a bent position—she seemed to be trying to do something to her head—it was in a fearful state of blood—the constable said he must take the prisoner into custody; she said, "Don't take him away, for he is a good husband to me; I don't wish him hurt"—she was beastly drunk—when I went close to her with a bottle of water, her breath smelt so much of gin, that I could not stand near her—I afterwards went with her in a cab to the hospital—I then went back to the room with the constable, and found this chopper or hatchet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was in one corner of the room—there were some very small marks of blood on the handle.</p>

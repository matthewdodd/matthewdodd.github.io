                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 20, St. John's-square, in the parish of St. John, Clerkenwell; it is my dwelling house. I have a shop, which is part of my dwelling house—on Saturday night, 16th Sept., I put the shutters up a little after 12 o'clock—I barred them, and left them safe—I then went to bed—I was disturbed between half past 2 and 3 o'clock—I was awoke by a sort of nibbling noise, which I thought was rats, being troubled with them—I listened, and heard a sort of jumbling against the shutters, which we sometimes have when drunken men fall against them—soon after I heard a great noise, as if the shutters and bar hid fallen down, and I heard a smash—I sleep in the parlour adjoining the shop—I got up and dressed myself, and Mr. Bailey spoke to me—a police<lb></lb>man then said, "Open the door, and we can get in"—there were two police<lb></lb>men</p>

I was at home and in bed on the night of 16th Sept—about half past 2, or a quarter to 3 o'clock, I heard a rumbling at the shutters—I did not take any notice at first, because we have been so used to it by persons passing—I heard a second rumbling, and I got up and looked out of the window—I saw three persons running from the shutters, and I heard the glass fall at the same moment—I looked out of the front window on h first floor—to the best of my belief, the prisoner was one of the three who ran away—I did not see the constable stop anybody, but I saw him bring the prisoner back—I believe him to have been one of the three; I had a good view of his back, and his whole person—I only looked down upon him.</p>

               <p>I am son of the gentleman where she came to in Bunhill-row; I went to the Golden Cross, at Charing-cross, to meet Mrs. Harbin; I accompanied Mrs. Harbin to my father's; I particularly observed a person at the gate when we got out of the coach in <placeName id="t17820220-41-crimeloc198">Bunhill-row</placeName>

               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>I did not see the trunk taken out; I saw it in the coach as we were coming along; I did not see the trunk taken out; it was a little after seven; I cannot say whether the moon was up; nothing particular struct my observation respecting the prisoner at Charing-cross, the first observation of him was at Bunhill-row; I handed Mrs. Harbin out of the coach, and went into the parlour; she was but a little while in getting out; during that time I made particular observation; some time elapsed before the door was open.</p>
               <p>He was pointed out to you as a supposed offender? - Yes; I saw by the place he stood in he was an offender; there was another there besides himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination by the court. I handed Mrs. Harbin out of the coach; she went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200064"></xptr> immediately into the parlour with me, and I did not see the trunk taken out of the coach, I saw the trunk in the coach as we went along; I believe it was in one corner of the back seat; we rode forwards, I believe.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Harbin come out as soon as as the coach door was open? - As soon as the coach door was opened.</p>
               <p>You did not wait till the trunk was taken out? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Harbin. I thought I understood you the trunk went into the house before you? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Explain that if you please? - When the door was opened I bid the coachman take the trunk; there were two; he took one immediately, and came in, he took only one and then went to take the other; I did not see him take the large one; they were taken out before I got out of the coach, I saw them both in the passage while Mrs. Smith was in the passage.</p>

             sworn.</p>


               <p>I am a horse-waterman at Charing-cross; I don't remember the stage coach coming with Mrs. Harbin; I remember the hackney coach coming to take up the fare, and the gentleman go into it with two trunks, and a hat box; the gentleman ordered it to drive to bunhill-row, Moorfields; I did not see the lady get into the coach; the gentleman only.</p>
               <p>At Charing-cross you have a hundred and fifty gentleman of a day getting into coaches? - Yes; I saw the gentlemen get into a coach.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing in particular led you to observe him at that time? - No nothing in particular; I looked at him very hard, and asked him for some halfpence, he said he had none; he ordered me to tell the coachman to drive him to Bunhill-row; there was not any thing in particular made me take notice of him, more than what I have mentioned already.</p>
               <p>What day was it? - I believe the 3d of December, I did not know the day of the month, but I heard the gentleman mention it at the office, three weeks last Tuesday from the time it happened; it is now near two months since it happened.</p>
               <p>What made you recollect it? - Sometimes one cannot be off taking notice of people one lets in; I may let in a hundred or more gentlemen in a day.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing in particular led you to take particular notice of it that day? - No; nothing in particular.</p>
               <p>You were sent for to the office; did you know on what account you were sent for? - No; not till I came there; the gentlemen asked me about it, if I could recollect the coachman, I told them no; I could recollect nothing about it, at first.</p>
               <p>Do you mean the runners? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any body on this day lurking about the house? Yes; at the time this coach was there I saw four men; it was the third of December when the coach went off; that was the day, as the gentleman told me at the office.</p>
               <p>Are you clear of that circumstance of the gentleman's desiring you to drive to Bunhill-row? - At night; yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was there never no instance of any person ordering you to drive from Charing-cross to Bunhill-row? Yes; often before that; I did not understand what you meant at first, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see either of the prisoners at the bar? - Yes; I saw those two men, and two more with them, about six o'clock or soon after in the evening, soon after the stage came in, I heard the name of

               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You are a waterman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many coaches were taken last night? - I was not there but at St. Giles's round house; they told me I must go there till the trial came on; they gave me 18 d. a day, good living and good lodging.</p>
               <p>Perhaps better than you are used to? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Eighteenpence a day is more than you get by watering? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you tell me where any one coach drove on the 4th of December from the Golden-cross? - No, Sir; I don't recollect any thing of the day of the month, but as I told by the gentleman as lost the things.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200065"></xptr>Two months you know? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was you taken up? - Tuesday three weeks; the day before I was took up I just sent a coach off to St. Paul's.</p>
               <p>What applications had you made to you by the gentlemen runners that attended the office? - I don't know what you mean by applications.</p>
               <p>They asked you about it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The runners have often applied to you? - Once or twice I believe.</p>
               <p>You was not desirous to go into the Round-house? - I was not desirous to stay there, I would rather be out and do nothing, than have eighteen pence a day and be there, they had spoke to me several times about it.</p>
               <p>Did they ever talk to you about a reward of forty pounds for convicting this man? - No.</p>
               <p>Did they never tell you, you was to have a share for convicting them? - No; I was at the coach door while the coachman put the boxes in, nobody was in as far as I saw, before the boxes, the gentleman went in, I saw nobody else, I shut the door.</p>
               <p>Did the men whom you saw go after the coach walk or run? - They ran after it.</p>
               <p>In this case the clerk of arraigns said there was no reward allowed.</p>

               <p>I am a hackney coachman, I remember taking up a fare at the Golden-cross, Charing-cross, the 3d of December, I remember it was on a Monday, I was first coach, they called me to the yard at the Golden-cross to take two trunks, I took them and put them in, I took up a gentleman and a lady, and was ordered to drive to Bunhill-row, at St. Martin's-lane end I went to take hold of my check string, I saw a man up behind the coach like a footman, I did not know but he belonged to the gentleman, he still kept behind like a footman, at every turning I turned, he got down at the end of Chiswell-street, I drove up the row, took the things out, and they paid me; I missed him at the turning, I remember the house, I could go to it now; I took the trunks out, the lady went in before the trunks, the gentleman too; I put them in custody of the maid, a man then came and asked me, what shall I give you to go to Charing-cross, I believe it was the same man, it is the further man of those two, (the prisoner at the bar, Verrier) I believe it to be the man, he had a light brown great coat, the waistcoat I could not see, but he had a lapelled white waistcoat, I asked two shillings, he said I will not give two shillings; as I was going to the same stand again, I parted with Verrier at Mr. Smith's door, and went away with another person, I saw him at the office, I looked round twice, I was so ignorant of the matter I could not distinguish him, they bid me look again, I did, and then I looked at the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>I was asked all these questions there, and then I was asked to look for the man, I took the box out, it was pretty heavy, I am pretty strong, the trunk was not very small nor very large, it was middling heavy.</p>
               <p>You were left to bring in the trunks after the lady and gentleman had got out? - The lady had got in, but the gentleman did not just then, he was at the door with me, the lady was in the passage till the trunks were both in; there was one man behind the coach all the while to Bunhill-row, I left him there at the door.</p>
               <p>You had no difficulty of knowing him again? - No; I took him to Catherine-street, and by accident.</p>
               <p>What opportunity had you of observing him? - I took notice of him, being in light cloaths behind the coach, when I said I would not take less than my fare, he said I thought you were going to the same stand again.</p>
               <p>Did you ever observe his face before? - I did not.</p>
               <p>I want to know how you know the man that spoke to you on the side of the coach, was the same as was up behind? - I am certain it was, I took notice of his light dress, I am certain, I took notice of his lapelled waistcoat too, it was open.</p>

               <p>At the office I had no doubt about it, I did not positively swear to him then, but I had no doubt, I have not seen him from that time to this, I have now no doubts; my fellow servant has an acquaintance of the name of Jones I have heard her speak of; we knew the night Mrs. Harbin was expected, that Mr. Smith went to meet her, she came in the coach with him, I am a single woman, and have no acquaintance in the neighbourhood, I saw nothing of his coat.</p>

            . I work in the sword-cutlery way, and live in Gardner's-Lane, King-Street, Westminster. On the 2d of this instant, between the hours of four and five in the evening, I heard a knocking at the door, but was not the first person that came down. I saw nobody there, and the key of my street door was taken away; I also missed a sword, the property of His Majesty. The prisoner was taken up about eight or nine days after; he had the same sword which I missed, and he deliver'd it to the constable in my presence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am so superannuated I know not what I do, any more than the man in the moon; I never wrong'd man, woman or child.</p>

            . I am on to the other witness. The prisoner knock'd at our door on the 2d of this instant, between four and five in the afternoon. I heard the sash of the window rise up; after which somebody came in and call'd, Master. I came down, but did not see any body. I know it was the prisoner that call'd Master.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>J. Keith. About four or five years, and have been in company with him several times. I missed a regimental sword belonging to the first regiment of guards. I believe the prisoner is out of his senses.</p>

            . I am a constable, and took the prisoner up this day se'n-night at an alehouse near the Horse-ferry; he went home and fetch'd this sword and sheath, and deliver'd them to me (the sword produced in court.) I believe he is not in his senses.</p>
               <p>Q. to G. Keith. Is this the sword you lost?</p>
               <p>G. Keith. It is No. 19. the same sword.</p>

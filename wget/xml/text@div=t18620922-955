                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Spinks, and reside at the prisoner's house, 42, Warren-street, Fitzroy-square—on the evening of 8th August, between 6 o'clock and half-past, I heard a noise in the passage downstairs—I was at the top of the house—I went down, and saw Mr. and Mrs. Cotier fighting together—she said she wanted to go out, and he said she should not—he had hold of her by the hair, and they both fell—she fell underneath the prisoner, and her head came against one of the stairs, and she said, "Oh!"—she fell very heavily—I begged of the prisoner to leave her alone, which ho did, and I got her downstairs in the kitchen—after that she went out and came back again about half-past 12, or from that to 1, that night—I heard cries of "Murder" two or three times; it was her voice—there was a great noise in the room, but we did not go down—they lived on the first-floor front room, and we lived at the top of, the house, the third-floor—I was on the landing when I heard this noise—it continued about half an hour, or it might be a little longer, I could not say</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 53, Marylebone-lane—I was acquainted with the deceased—on the evening of 6th August, from twenty minutes to half-past 10, she came to my house, and I returned home with her at a little past 11—the prisoner was not in then—I first saw him while I was down in the kitchen with Mrs. Cotier—it was some time after I went upstairs that I saw him first—he never spoke to his wife at all—she was sitting in the chair by the side of the bed, and the moment I told him she had got money about her, he took her by the hair of her head and flung her violently on the floor; he put his foot on her clothes and began to tear them—she cried out "Murder!" of course—the prisoner had been at my house about a fortnight before this occurrence—his wife had been to my house for shelter several times before that—I told him that she had been—he said that</p>

My husband's name is George Southgate—I life at 30, Warren-street, very nearly opposite the prisoner's house—on the night of Friday, 8th August, about a quarter to 12, I was in the shop and beard screams of "Murder"—they appeared to come from the first-floor front of Cotier's house—I stood at the door some time and heard the screams of "Murder" and "Help," and then I heard like a blow, which I took to come from Mr. Cotier, and heard him say, "Hallo again if you can"—I did not hear the screams of "Murder" again after that, but I heard her cry, and as if another blow and something fall on the floor or up against something very violently; then I knocked at the door—I saw a man's arm, which I knew to be Mr. Cotier's, up, and it went down as if he struck—I was then at the street door—the blind was down, but the window was up and there was gas in the room—I heard the expression, "Hollo again if you can" when I heard the cries of "Murder," and before I saw the firm up,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220020"></xptr>
               <p>and I then went across and knocked at the door—Mr. Cotier opened the window and halloed out, "Who knocked at my door?"—I heard Mrs. Cotier crying; her sobs were dreadful, and she called for Harry to come to her, and then I could hear her sobs; they seemed gradually to turn off more to a groan, and then he closed the window down and everything was silent soon after—the gas went out before I went in—I went in and looked up at the window and saw that the gas was re-lighted—I did not see or hear any more that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 45, Upper Marylebone-street—I was called in to look at the dead body of Mrs. Cotier—I had attended her before that—the first time I was called in it was for delirium tremens, and more recently I attended her for fractured ribs—it was in May last that I attended her for delirium tremens—when I was called in on this occasion she appeared to have been dead about an hour—it was about 7 in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I made a post-mortem examination—the body was generally contused particularly on the left side, on the legs and arm, and there were one or two patches of lividity on the face, and one on the right side of the right eye—the left eye was also considerably contused, and there was swelling of the left cheek—the scalp was contused in one or two places on the left side from behind the ear at the back portion of the head—it was a place about two and a half inches in length, and an inch in breadth—on opening the head, between the membranes of the brain and the skull, there was a large quantity of clotted blood covering both hemispheres of the brain; the brain itself was softened for about an inch in extent on both hemispheres—the vessels gene<lb></lb>rally were healthy, with the exception of one portion of the superior longi<lb></lb>tudinal sinus, one large venous trunk corresponding with the softened portion of brain substance—the cause of death was extravasation of blood on the surface of the brain; that might arise from a blow or from a fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might the extravasation have been caused if she had received a fall the evening before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The blood might cause very gently from the wounded vessel, and it might be some hours before death ensued—it might have happened from a fall on the evening of the previous day—if she had been drinking after that fall that would have a tendency to render it more certainly fatal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might the softening of the brain go on for a great number of years without causing death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It may do so—the softening of the brain substance itself corresponded with the condition of the vessel in the brain where the injury was, which was the cause of death—there was a little slit in the softened vessel of the brain, from which the blood oozed, and that corresponded with the softened portion of the brain substance—a person in that condition of softened brain would be more likely to be seriously affected by a blow than a person in sound health.</p>

               <p>but she would not—she went in at the private door and got her shawl off the table—my father heard of it and he went to the private door and tried to keep her in—he did keep her in a little time, but she was determined to go out—he took the shawl away from her—she afterwards went out without her shawl or bonnet, and walked up and down the street, and had a mob of people all round her—she kept saying to my father, "Come out, and I will fight you," sparring up at him—she then went down the street, and at last she got a lot of boys to go and fetch a cab; she got two or three cabs and they would not take her—I saw her at last get into one; after that my father told me to go out and look for her—I did so, but could not find her—I looked for her everywhere at every public-house, but she would not go anywhere where she thought we should go to look after her—I came in that evening about half-past 12—my father came down and let me in—I saw my mother then upstairs lying on the floor, just as she would throw herself down; she was asleep and snoring—there was a sheet and a quilt over her, and a pillow under her head—I and my father then went to bed—about 6 o'clock in the morning my father got out of bed and went to my mother; he asked her how she was this morning—he could not get an answer, and he came and called me up directly, and said, "There is something the matter with your mother"—I looked at her, and he said to me, "Go and fetch the doctor directly"—I went to Mr. Mason's—I could not get an answer the first time—when I went again the assistant opened the door to me, and he said he would tell Mr. Mason and he should come directly—when I came back I found Mr. Phillips, the blacksmith opposite, there, and the lodgers upstairs as well—my uncle was not there then—my father went down to my aunt's to tell her my mother was dead—she came up, and afterwards fetched my uncle—my uncle did not say any<lb></lb>thing to me; I did not see him till after that—there was some hair under the grate—I gave it to my uncle; he asked me to fetch it—my mother used to comb her hair in that room every morning—it was the same hair that I found under the grate.</p>

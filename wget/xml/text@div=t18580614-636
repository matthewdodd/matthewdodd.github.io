                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners' statements before the Magistrate were here read as follows: Mingay says</hi>, "I am living with Mr. Forster, who is a very honest man; at 6 o'clock in the morning, he went out, as usual, to his stall; he took one penny with him; I never saw him till 1 o'clock, when he and his daughter, the prisoner Mortlock, came home, and I let them in; Mrs. Mortlock lay down on the bed; I said to her, 'There is not room for you and your father to lay down, I will pull the bed down;' in doing so, something very heavy fell on the boards, in some newspapers; soon after a man named Henry Adams came into the room, and placed the money in the bed, and then went into the back room; the shilling I paid to Mr. Abbott, was given to me." <hi rend="italic">Forster says</hi>, "My sight is very bad, and whether I took bad money or good I can't say, but I did not know it was bad." <hi rend="italic">Mortlock says</hi>, "I went home with my father, and, being very tired, I laid down; Mingay pulled down the bed, and something very heavy fell off it; she picked it up and placed it on the table; she then said, 'We will open it, and see what the contents are;' and we found it was this money; I said, 'It never can be bad money;' and I asked Mingay to go to Mr. Abbott's, and take a shilling, and ask him to try it; she came back, and said it was perfectly good; I then counted the money, and said to my father, 'If this should be bad money we may be transported;' but my father knew nothing whatever about it; I asked him what had better be done with it, and whether he would throw it down the water closet; I put the money in this dirty cloth, and laid it in the corner of the room."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable.</hi>) On Saturday night, the 2nd of Sept., about eight o'clock, I was on duty by the World turned upside down—I saw a wagon and four horses standing there—the prisoner Biggs was looking after the horses by the house; and in five minutes I saw Cooke come out of the public-house, go into the hind part of the wagon, and remain there about five minutes—Biggs was walking backwards and forwards round the wagon, he looked into the hind part of it two or three times—I saw Cooke come out of the wagon and turn towards the horses; and then Biggs went and took a bag from the back of the wagon, where Cooke came out—he put it on his back,</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, as millers, at Stratford. Cooke was our carman, and went out on the Saturday in question—I know this bag, it is a French one; we import a quantity of French flour, and this is one of the sacks—it has F D on it, which are the initials of a French miller, of whom I purchase.</p>

               <p>saw the sample produced before the Magistrate—I could not say it was mine—chaff cut up is all alike—Cooke has been in our service six months, and conducted himself with great propriety—I had a five years' character with him—if he is discharged, and I am quite convinced of his innocence, I would take him again—this stuff is worth about two shillings, bag and all.</p>

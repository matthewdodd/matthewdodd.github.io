                  </hi>. I am a coachsmith, of Hammersmith; I lodged in the prisoner's father's house. On 27th Dec, about a quarter to six in the morning, I missed my watch, which I had hung up over the looking-glass the night before—nobody else slept in the room—the prisoner used to do so, but he did not that night—his bed was not used—the door was not locked, and be was not there when I awoke—I also missed my two coats off a chair—I did not see the prisoner till 15th Feb. in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hammersmith. On Sunday, 9th. Feb., I was in Hyde-park, and saw the prisoner sitting on a tree—I passed him at first without recoguising him—I knew him before, a little—I joined three other boys, and then passed the prisoner again—he said, "Halloo, <hi rend="italic">Mike!"</hi>—(that is not my nick-name)—I said, "I don't know you"—he said "What, don't you know Ankins?"—I said, "Yea, but you are not Ankins"—he said, "Yes"—I asked him what be was doing there—he asked me if I had not heard that he had robbed his old man (meaning his father)—I asked him what he took—he said be had a coat and a watch, and he had sold the watch for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had had nothing to eat for two or three days, and we gave him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

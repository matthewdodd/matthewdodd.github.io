                  </hi>. I am a wine and spirit-mer<lb></lb>chant, at King's-cross.

               <p>in consequence of his not calling upon me for some time, I went, in March this year, to a public-house he frequented, and saw him—I inquired if he had got the duty, or if he had forwarded the papers—he observed that he had been, but that it was refused, on account that if persons would not avail themselves of the opportunity of having their goods re-gauged, they must put up with the loss of it, for the Customs would not allow it—I afterwards went to the Custom-house, and saw Mr. Cole on the subject—I was taken into the inner-office, and was shown this paper by Watson, one of the clerks—I have no minute of what day it was—it was in March—this paper purports to be signed by me, but it is not my signature—I never saw this paper before it was shown me at the Custom-house—I have never received the over-paid money back, nor any part of it.</p>

B. Cabburn"—all the parties named in the document, except Cabburn, are public officers—I asked the prisoner whether the person with him was the party named in this document—he said, "This is Mr. Cabburn," turn<lb></lb>ing round—I then required the prisoner to put his name to it—MR. Cabburn's name was already to it, and the prisoner put his name under it, in my presence—in consequence of that, I kept the certificate, and de<lb></lb>livered a ticket for the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the prisoner—that ticket would authorize the prisoner to receive the money—the office requires the party himself to attend, unless he gives authority to any agent or party known at the office, but previous to doing that, his name must be registered at the office, and also the party authorised, and the document itself must be signed by the party—it does not authorise any agent to give a receipt.</p>

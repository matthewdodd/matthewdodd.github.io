One Mr. Huggens, who is here, said to me, the man has taken your hat out of your bar: the prisoner was gone, and I went out after him but could not find him; another person ran out into Cornhill, and saw him coming out of a pewterer's shop; he brought him to my house, and I said to him, you have robb'd me of a hat, and a man here will swear it. I unbutton'd his coat. and the hat drop'd down: then I sent for a constable, and charg'd him. The hat produc'd in court, and depos'd to. We took him before the alderman, to whom he confess'd the fact, and went down on his knees to me.</p>

            . On the 14th of May I was at Mr. Griffice's house, in came the prisoner at the bar and called for some twopenny; he put his hand round the bar, took this hat, and put it under his coat. While the boy was gone down into the cellar he drank up his beer, and went away; when the boy came up I told him of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to him at that time?</p>
               <p>Huggens. I was within three or four yards of him, sitting in a box.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay in the house?</p>
               <p>Huggens. He did not stay five minutes there after he paid for his beer. Mr. Griffice and I went in pursuit of him, but could not meet with him; and one Joseph Limely found him and brought him in; the prisoner went down directly on his knees, when Mr. Griffice found the hat upon him.</p>

On 19th Feb., at quarter-past seven in the evening, I was with Serjeant Goff, in St. George's-row, and saw Burrows, with a basket on his shoulder, with something heavy—Smith was ten or fifteen yards from him, he went up, and lifted the basket higher on his shoulder, I followed; they both turned into Garden-row—Smith put his hand on the top of the basket, to save something from falling—I asked Burrows what he had got; he said, "Some lead"—I asked where he was going to take it—he said, "To a shop in Goswell-road; "that he was sent with it from the Philanthropic—the basket contained a quantity of lead—I took them both to the Philanthropic—I asked Burrows who sent him with it—he pointed to some buildings, and said, "I took it from there"—I took them both to the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, F</hi> 11). On 11th November I was on duty in Mercer-street, Long-acre, with Ackrill—we were both in plain clothes—when passing near a urinal at the bottom of Mercer-street, I heard a noise like some person trying to cry out, and could not—we both ran to the urinal, and found the three prisoners and the prosecutor there—Davis had both his hands over the prosecutor's month, pressing him close against him—Sweeney was endeavouring to get the prosecutor's hands out of his trousers' pockets, and Kelly was searching his waistcoat pockets—I have known them well for years—I took Kelly in custody, and dragged him away by the collar—he had a paper collar on—he pulled away, the collar tore, and he got away—I chased him for some distance, but did not catch him—the prosecutor was decidedly drunk; his face was cut about very much—he could scarcely breathe for minutes afterwards from the pressure on his throat—when I found I could not take Kelly, I went back to the prosecutor, and took him to the station—I untied his neckcloth before I went after Kelly—they all got away—I assisted Ackrill in taking them on the 14th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the proprietor of the Repository, in Barbican. On the morning of the 20th of March, I purchased four loads of meadow hay in Whitechapel market—it was to come home to Barbican—Angle was in my employ at that time—it was his duty to take the whole of the corn, hay, and straw into the granary, to count it, to measure it, and take the tickets into the counting-house—he was to count and weigh the hay—he was paid for doing so—it was his duty with respect to this hay, to see that he had thirty-six trusses in each load, and that each of those trusses was the proper weight—I have a clerk named Seers—this ticket (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) it a form we keep printed to acknowledge the receipt of articles of this kind—this A. S. on it are Seers' initials—he would issue this on the representation of Angle that Ue quantity of hay received was right, not without.</p>

                  </hi>. I am constable of Whitechapel-market. I saw Mr. Larman's carts come to market on the 20th of March, and in consequence of information I went to Banks's house, in Brick-lane—there were ten trusses of meadow hay there, all lying together—six of them were identified by Mr. Larman—I took Banks into custody—I then went and took Hawes at a beer-shop, at Enfield-highway, and found Sibley at his lodging, which is near there—I took Dawkins next day—he walked part of the way to Lon<lb></lb>don don with me, till we got an omnibus—as we were on the road he said to me, "This is a bad job, Master Taylor, about the hay"—he said, "I have been led into this by Taylor and the others; I was a very good boy all the time I was in Mr. Wilson's employ; he will give me a good character; I never did anything wrong till lately; the first thing I did wrong was about two months ago; there was a load of clover to go to Mr. Dixon's, and Taylor and Morrell said, 'Leave three trusses of clover-hay at Banks's, but you must make it all right with <hi rend="italic">Dick;'</hi> I took there trusses to Banks's, and sold them for balf-a-crown apiece, which was 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to Dixon's, and unloaded, and gave <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., who stood a pot of beer, and I never went there till the time this happened again"—he said, "On the day in question I and Sibley, and Hawes and 0 renal I went to Banks's, and the first two carts took three trusses each off, and I and Ovenall took two trusses each off our carts; we received 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and then Dawkins received la. back from Ovenall.</p>

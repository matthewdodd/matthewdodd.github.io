                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 66.) On the 14th of April, about five o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Hammersmith—I saw a wagon come up, driven by Chaney—I saw him go and call Gurling up from a house ad<lb></lb>joining to a stable—Gurling came down, and I heard some "correspondence" going on between them, but I could not tell what it was—I do not know that I heard any part of it—Gurling then went and looked up and down in the road—he then came back to Chaney, and said, "It is all right, make haste, jump up, <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> it off"—Chaney then got on the load, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> off a truss of straw—Gurling took it into the stable, and Chaney followed him—I went down, and told Chaney I must take him to the station-house—he said, "Very well"—I took him and the straw to the station—on the way he said he was very sorry; that it was his master's property; it was the first time he had ever robbed his master, and he would never do the like again—I asked what he was going to have for it—he said a pot of beer—I asked how he knew that—he said he had seen other carters do it, and he thought he would do the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Harmondswort✗ Chaney was in my employ on the 14th of April—I had seen my wagon loaded the evening before to come to London—there should have been but seventy-two trusses of straw on it, but it is quite possible to introduce one in the bottom to make seventy-three—I have seen the truss of straw produced—I have no doubt it is mine—it corresponds with the rest.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known Chaney? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Many years—he came to me twenty years ago, but he has been discharged twice since—he was discharged once for being intoxicated—I did not miss this truss—it is impossible I should—there should have been seventy-two trusses on the wagon—this truss was one of the same kind as the others, exactly—I do not know anything against Chaney, but I have heard this is not the first time he has left things at that house—Harmondsworth is fifteen miles from London—the house where this truss was left is twelve miles from my house.</p>

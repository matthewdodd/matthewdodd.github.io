            . I am a bricklayer. I was at the Plough with Parker - I was not quite sober, but knew what I was doing; I saw the female prisoner come in, and in about half an hour I carried Parker on my back to Green-street, Grosvenor-square - Hannington followed us, and An will overtook us - they followed us in company, and as we went along, Parker's hat fell off - Hannington took it up, and said she would carry it; when I got to Parker's house I put him down on the step; Hannington had the hat then- I rang the bell - Parker's wife came to the door, and seemed much frightened - I went in to speak to her, and on returning, the prisoners were gone, and the prosecutor's hat, and the shoes from his feet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you sober? A. I was better than the prosecutor - he could not move hand or foot - it was after eleven o'clock - it might be half-past - we had been to two other public-houses, and had a pot of half-and-half at one house - I drank nothing but gin - I knew what I was doing - I might have two or three glasses of gin; I will not swear it was not six or eight.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the night of the 23d of December, at half-past eleven o'clock, I was in Green-street, and saw the prisoners, the witness, and Parker - they passed me to go to No. 47 - Parker's wife came, and told me of the robbery at twelve - I went up and saw the prisoners near her door - as soon as they saw me they ran off as fast as they could - I saw nothing in their hands - another watchman followed with me - we turned into Norfolk-street, and I heard a hat fall, about twelve yards from me, but close to them, as they ran - we secured them, and the beadle found the hat in the area.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who dropped it you do not know? A. No - when they passed me I asked where they were going; Davies said, to a house in Green-street - he had been drinking, but was not drunk - he had not been drinking much - the female prisoner had his hat and Parker's also; I offered to go with them, but Hannington said,"No, watchman, the man who is carrying him is my husband."</p>
               <p>Prisoner HANNINGTON. He said, "This is a fine game, one drunken man carrying another!" and they both fell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100062"></xptr>down. Witness. That was before I saw them; I heard something round the corner: I looked, and they were both on the ground - I only saw Parker on the ground - he was so helpless he could do nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not swear they were both on the ground? A. Yes, they were.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Mates tell you who let the hat fall? A. No - I will not swear as to what I had drank on that night.</p>

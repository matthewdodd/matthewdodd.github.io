                  </hi>. I am bar-maid to Mr. Bromley, of Bishopsgate-street—the prisoner was his housemaid. I lost a ring—I cannot say where it was taken from—I never wore it while the prisoner was there—it was in my pocket, and I might have lost it out of my pocket—the prisoner slept in the same room with me—I missed it on the 13th of January—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is worth three guineas.</p>

The prosecutrix complained to me on the 13th, that she had lost her ring—the prisoner was not present—the prisoner left my service on the 19th—I sent for her on the 22nd, and charged her with taking the ring—she denied knowing any thing about it—she then began crying, and said she found it at the street-door, and then confessed, in presence of the officer, that she had sold it to a man in the lane for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

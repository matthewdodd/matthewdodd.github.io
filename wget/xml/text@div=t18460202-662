                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my son James Edward Seymour, as gold-beaters, at Long-acre—we have also an establishment at Peckham, where we employ apprentices—the prisoner was employed there as foreman—the witness Isaacs is an apprentice of ours—we supply the prisoner with the necessary tools and gold to work, five beatings at a time, 2oz. 7dwts. in the beating—it is first beaten out, and then made into leaf—a certain quan<lb></lb>tity of what is called <hi rend="italic">shurf</hi> comes off—that is preserved and delivered to me as well as the leaves, and is melted—in Nov. last I delivered the prisoner, five of these rolls—I did not receive any of it back—I applied to him for it, and on the 21st of Jan. I ordered him to get his work up and give it me—I went on the following Monday to Peckham, and asked if his work was up—he said, "not quite, I shall not long about it"—(he had asked me on the previous Wednesday to lend him money, which I had declined)—he then said, "I am a beating and a half deficient, I have done wrong, look over it, and I will work it out"—I said no—I examined the work, and discovered a deficiency of 3 dwts. more than a beating and a half—I sent for a constable and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman gold-beater, and work for Mr. Seymour, at Peckham—on the 21st of Jan. I went with the prisoner to several public-houses, and afterwards went home with him to the factory, about half-past twelve—he said to me, "Will you work all night? I am going to work"—I said I would—we went into the shop, and he said, "I shall melt my stone-dirt"—he melted it, and there was 3dwts. 6 grains—he said, "That won't do, I must have more"—he then went to his box in which his <hi rend="italic">shruf</hi> was kept, took some gold out, weighed it, put it in, and melted it—there was 13 dwts. 7 grains, to the best of my recollection—he said that would do to pay for the funeral of his child, and get his wife a black gown—he told me on the Wednesday that he had asked Mr. Seymour to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had refused, and he then remarked, "Well, he has refused to lend me the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth out of the old b—"—he went to town at four o'clock next day with his wife, and said he was going to sell the gold—I saw him again on Friday morning, and he asked me to go to Nunhead<lb></lb>cemetery with him about a piece of ground—at we were coming back he told me he had sold the gold, he had taken it to Mr. Groser first, and he refused to buy it, as it was between the lights, and he said, to the best of my recollec<lb></lb>tion, that he had sold it to Mr. Collingridge—I could not swear to the name, but it ended with a <hi rend="italic">ridge</hi>, and was in Wilderness-row—he said he got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—he said to me, "I hope you will keep it <hi rend="italic">dark</hi>, for if you <hi rend="italic">come it</hi> I shall get <hi rend="italic">lagged</hi>, and I should look pretty in chains"—I did not say anything about it on that account till I was on my oath before the Magistrate.</p>

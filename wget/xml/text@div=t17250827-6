My Wife coming home, presently mist the Tankard; and wondring the Maid carry'd so long, she sent one to see for her; but she was not to be found. This increased our Suspicion; and upon farther Search, we mist the other Goods in the Indictment. We saw no more of her till the 10th of this Month, when she was taken at the Angel in Hammer Smith, with my Wife's Stays upon her, and confess'd the whole Charge, and where she had disposed of the Goods; some of which we found according to her Direction; but the Goldsmith to whom she said she sold the Tankard for 45 s. deny'd that he ever had it. <rs id="t17250827-6-verdict24" type="verdictDescription">

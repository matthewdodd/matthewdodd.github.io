In April last I saw Scaley and the pri<lb></lb>soner together—Sealer spoke to me about Mr. England's window—I re-turned with them and went into Mr. Scaley's garden and got over the wall—I saw the window had been broken and the boards forced in—I noticed some footmarks on the border in the garden, that were evidently the footmarks of a female—either Mr. Scaley or the prisoner called my atten<lb></lb>tion to it, and I saw the marks—the prisoner said "I have no doubt it was the servant got over after the ball"—Mr. Scaley said "Ask if anyone has been over," and the reply was "I got over after Tommy's ball"—I did not go into the house at that time—I went in the afternoon—I found the boards had been forced in and one of the doors broken—I found two bundles of plated things and one of silver on the carpet—I found a drawer partly open upstairs—it was full of clothes—there was no one in the house while Mr. England was away—there was no clock there when I went in—I learnt that the clock was missing after Mr. England came back—this chisel was brought to the station—I did not see the person who brought it, but I heard his voice and knew it was Mr. Scaley—the constable brought it in and gave it to me—that was in August, I believe—the front door had not been forced in any way; there was a mark outside, as if someone's foot had been against it—there was a slight mark of a chisel, but I did not open the door—it was a mark similar to that which the chisel would make—I was a witness against the prisoner in September last, on another charge—I received information from Mr. Scaley about the body of a child being in the river—the river was searched and the body was found with some bricks round it—Mr. Scaley and I were both witnesses in that case—the prisoner was committed for trial at the September Sessions, commencing Monday, the 19th—on Sunday, the 18th, I received a letter from Mr. Walls, the solicitor, of Walbrook—he was acting as the prisoner's attorney on the charge relating to the child—in consequence of the letter I went to Mr. Walls' office on the Monday before I came to this Court, and he then gave me the clock—he made a statement to me—I took the clock and made in<lb></lb>quiries—I afterwards took the prisoner into custody as he was leaving the Court, on the 21st September—I saw Smith here after leaving Mr. Walls' office—Mr. Walls was present when I took the prisoner—he came out of the prison with him—I said he must consider himself in custody for a</p>

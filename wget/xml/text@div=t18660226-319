                  </hi>. I am a sailor, living at Canterbury—on 2d February I was at Woolwich, at the Duke on Horseback public-house—I had a young woman with me at the bar, drinking, and the prisoner was on my right side—after I had been there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, I went into the parlour, without noticing whether the prisoner followed me or not—I had previously had in my pocket six shillings and two sixpences—I called for a quart of ale, and could not pay for it—I went out to the bar and said, "I can't pay for the ale, because I have lost my purse"—the young woman said, "That man has got it," and the landlord says, "Yes, I know he has, because I saw him with it"—I asked the prisoner if he had it—he said, "No"—I went for a policeman, and gave him in custody—the purse pro<lb></lb>duced is the one I lost—there was a watch-key in it, as well as the money—I was sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Harding's-lane, Woolwich—on 2d February I was with the prosecutor at this public-house—there were three others standing at the bar with him—I did not see him take out his purse to pay for anything then, nor did I hear him order anything while I was there—he went into the parlour, and then I saw his purse in the prisoner's hand, and noticed him taking the money out, and putting it into his pocket—I told him it was the young man's purse—he said it was not—a police-man was then brought, and he was given in custody—I was sober.</p>

I keep the Duke on Horseback, at Woolwich—on 2d February May and the last witness were standing at the bar, about half-past 12—May ordered something, and it was drunk between him and the female—he paid for it out of a purse, which he took from his side-pocket—I heard the prisoner ask him to stand a drop of drink, and the sailor said he would not—after that, the prosecutor went into the parlour opposite the bar, and the prisoner followed him, returning in about four or five minutes—as the prisoner came back, I saw the purse in his hand—the pro<lb></lb>secutor came out, and said he had lost his purse—he wanted the prisoner to give it up; but he said he had not got it—I said, "Why, I saw the purse in your hand; why don't you give it up to the man?"—I found the purse in the bar, afterwards, empty—a constable was sent for—the watch-key was found next morning—I never saw the prisoner before, to my knowledge—he did not try to go away, if he had, he would have been pushed back—there were not many persons in the part where he stood—there were some sailors on the other side of the box.</p>

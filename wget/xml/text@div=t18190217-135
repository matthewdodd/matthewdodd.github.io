He got up, and told me to begone directly - I did not stir. He got up with a knife which he had in his hand, eating some bread and meat, and stabbed me in the left side of my head, close to my eye; it penetrated to the bone. I was so weak I was not able to do any thing for myself. I said nothing more to him than that which I have stated. As soon as he stabbed me he put the knife into his left hand, and then struck me with his fist. He got me down on the floor, and began beating me. I was taken to my lodgings, and was confined to my bed three days. He afterwards said he was sorry he did not rip my g - ts out, and if he had had a pistol in his hand he would have shot me.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Brown's-buildings. I went to the public-house about six o'clock. The prosecutor had been drinking, but was sensible. He asked if Mackenzie was there? - he was not then come. He went out about three minutes. Before he returned the prisoner came in. The prosecutor came in, went to him, and said,</p>

               <p>"We have quarrelled - you are a Scotchman, and I am an Irishman, let us have a pot of beer, and make it up." The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"No, I'll never drink with such an Irish rascal as you are - go away!" he did not go then. He rose from his seat with a knife in his hand, and stabbed him in the side of his head. The prosecutor said he was stabbed. I told the prisoner to put the knife out of his hand, or he would commit murder. He put it into his left hand, and then struck him on the left breast with his fist. He fell - the blood ran rapidly. I went for the landlord, he was not in the bar. I returned, and found the prisoner beating the prosecutor more like a savage than any thing else - he could not see for the blood. I seized the prisoner, and said,</p>
               <p>"For shame, countryman! for using the man so." He said he was sorry he had not ripped his g - ts out, and that if he had had a pistol he would have shot him. I washed the prosecutor as well as I could. The prisoner went out of the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the prosecutor - A. The blood ran very fast from him. I got a surgeon next morning. I slept with him three or four nights, but he groaned so I was obliged to move.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the Monday, at the same public-house - it was the day after this happened. I told him I had a warrant against him for assaulting the prosecutor - he said he had been expecting it; the prosecutor was with me, and asked him to drink - he then appeared friendly. The prosecutor's wound appeared very bad.</p>

It being Sunday I wished to be quiet, and take no notice of him. He came to me, and used very bad and threatening language, and began sparring at me. He struck me twice, and knocked my bone out of my hand. I went to strike him, and the knife touched his head. He got me down, and fell himself. I did not wish to give him in charge for the assault, and took it all quietly.</p>

            . I lodged at the Ship and Star. Delmar came in about seven o'clock - he made use of very bad expressions, and asked where Mackenzie, the barber, was? and said he would kick *** out. A man named Leonard was there, and said the prisoner was a quiet man. He said,</p>
               <p>"You rascal, are you taking his part? I will serve you as I will him." He was quite drunk - he struck Leonard twice; he then went out, and while he was absent the prisoner came in. The prosecutor came in, swearing bitter oaths, and struck him on the mouth. The prisoner, in the heat of passion, rose up, and struck at him with a clasp-knife in his hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"Let me alone - let me have my supper comfortably."</p>
               <p>Q. What was the effect of the blow - A. It cut him, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you only suppose it - A. I saw the wound afterwards. He staggered back, and said he was cut - the blood ran profusely. I asked him to let me wash him - he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I will immediately have my revenge!" pulled off his coat, and stripped to fight. He did not then appear to be hurt the least in the world. The landlord came in, and wanted to part them.</p>

As I lay in my bed I saw the prisoner do it; I had four children in bed with me; the room I lie in is very near the shop; I saw him take out a panel of the window, and take the things mentioned in the indictment and a great many other things off the shelf; I had a great deal of property in the shop; I got up at four, the things were then gone and the place broke open; I knew the prisoner; he is a neighbour's child; his mother lived with the people in the house before I took it: they had a light with them; there was more than one; they had two pistols, whether they had any more I cannot say; the prisoner had the same dress on then which he has now, only he had not the same handkerchief on.</p>

On the 21st of June I had the prisoner in custody, and hearing that Mrs. Brown had been robbed, I sent for her; she came and saw him in the watch-house, and said he was the boy she had seen take the things off her shelf; I took him to the Compter, and when he was before the magistrate, she gave the same account.</p>

The prisoner came and asked me to show her some lace; I shewed her some, and saw her put a piece into her pocket; she continued looking at them, and bought three yards, which came to 2s. 6d.; she then asked for some Norwich crape, and while I was getting that down, I saw her take another piece of lace and a cap-crown; she bought a yard of crape, which came to 1s. 2d.; she paid me a shilling, and said she would call again; she went out - I followed her, and accused her of taking the lace, and she said I gave it her: I brought her back, and it was found on her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had all the lace been pinned together? A. No, this piece was separate - I had not bargained to sell her the cap-crown; she did not say a word about that to me - my master has a partner, a brother of his, who does not serve in the shop; he lives with his father, in Mile-end-road; the money is sent there every night.</p>

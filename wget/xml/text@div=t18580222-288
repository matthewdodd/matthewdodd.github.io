                  </hi>. I live at No. 18, Toogood's Rents, Holborn, and work occasionally for Mr. Younghusband, in the Old Bailey. On Thursday, 21st Jan., between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning, I was working in one of his lofts, waiting till my mate came out from breakfast—I could see from there into the stable, and saw the prisoner there; Bolton was sweeping the manger—he took a four bushel sack and filled it with corn and chaff out of the manger, and put it on the fore part of a wagon which Chapman was the driver of; but I did not know his name—I saw Chapman give some silver and halfpence into Bolton's hands—Bolton did not see me, but on the follow<lb></lb>ing Monday he told me to come up and clean the stable out, and he would give me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and while I was doing so, he said, "Did <hi rend="italic">Stumpey</hi> take notice of that sack of corn that was on the fore part of the wagon?" I said that I did not know—he said, "If he got up and looked at it he would have <hi rend="italic">bowled me out</hi>."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>was swept—I believe he is considered an honest man—his time to return was half-past 8 o'clock, but he was a few minutes after—it was about half-past 8 o'clock that I saw the manger swept, just at the time <hi rend="italic">Stumpey</hi> was expected to come back—from the stable to the loft you have to go up stairs by Mr. Younghusband's office—I was looking down the place where they put the hay up, and could see all over the stable—I was sitting down, and I could see the faces of the men in the stable, and they could see mine if they were looking that way—Bolton never turned round towards me at all; he kept his back to me all the time—it is usual to sweep the manger night and morning—nothing is put into the manger but hay and corn—I had known Bolton about three weeks—I have been there ten or twelve weeks—I cannot say how long he has been there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier in the Old Bailey. Bolton was my night watchman and horse keeper, and was employed in the stable—Chapman came from parties who contracted with me to take away manure; he had no right to take any thing else—Bolton had no right to give him corn or chaff.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, of East Ham. Chapman was in my employ—I sent him every Thursday to Mr. Younghusband's for manure—on Thursday, Jan. 21st, I saw him return; he threw his bait sack off the wagon just as I walked into the yard—I asked him what he had got there; he said that it was part of his bait, that he had put his horses into the stable of Mr. Younghusband, and there was some chaff and stuff in the manger which they ate, and they did not want his bait.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Bolton-terrace, James-street, Camden<lb></lb>town I am a carpenter. I was at the corner of Warren-street at twenty minutes before twelve o'clock at night on the 14th of Jan. and I perceived a handkerchief taken from my left-hand jacket pockets—I turned round, and</p>

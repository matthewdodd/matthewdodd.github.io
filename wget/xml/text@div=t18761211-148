I am a carter in the service of the Great Northern Rail<lb></lb>way, Farringdon Street station—on 6th July, I checked a wagon from Glossop by this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) that is the course of business when we have got the invoice; I find by this invoice that 145 bundles of paper were consigned to W. Davis &amp; Son, from Oliver &amp; Partington, of Glossop, and seven bales by the same from to Crescents Robinson &amp; Co. Borough Road—they weighed about I get each—I loaded them all into van No. 331, and entered the number of the van on the invoice in blue pencil—in the course of business the invoice was passed on into the office for the delivery sheet to be made out; the carman berings it to me and I sign it—this is the delivery sheet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which I signed I gave it to the carman and he takes it with him and they sign when it is delivered—I saw the van sheet oven; it was too late for delivery that evening and was placed in the yard for delivery next morning—some days afterwards a communication was made to me with reference to the non delivery of seven bags and I caused inquiries to be made.</p>

               <p>Smith was a glass paper printer—it was Duke's duty to see that all the paper was received; the paper received should be put into the paper room—Smith and Duke were in charge of the paper room—Manning was in the service of some printer who prints for my master—Matthews, the carpenter, made a communication to me between 10 and 11 o'clock; I was then on the first floor; the paper room is on the second floor—I happened to get to Duke's bench and saw about 4 reams of paper; and I tore the wrapper on one Side and rent off this piece of paper, upon which I made a note on the same day—I afterwards saw Manning and two lads take those 4 reams of paper out of the warehouse and down-stairs—I went to the window with the carpenter and saw them draw a track out which got into the gutter and three of the reams fell off—there were twenty bundles altogether on the truck 20 reams—it went along Weston Street towards Bermondsey Street, and I lost sight of it—after that I had a quarrel with Duke in August and I struck him—Watkins afterwards spoke to me and I spoke to Duke—I produced this piece of paper, and said that I heard he was going to put Kimber on to me; Kimber is a policeman—I said "Mind I do not put Kimber on to you, and showed him this piece of paper—he said "I thought you had better sense; don't you listens to what other people tell you"—after that. I heard nothing of the assault; birth I made a communication to Mr. Davis.</p>

I did not mention anything about the four reams of-paper on-Duke's bench, from the time I saw it till 13th November, when Mr. Davis spoke to me; I kept it to myself at that time—it-was in the middle of August, that I had the disagreement with duke, and struck him—I have been at work there since July—stock taking begins in July, and lasts more than a week—Davis attends to the partner who takes the stock—I was there on 24th August and 24th september, if it was not Sunday—Watkins saw me write on this paper; that was not after the quarrel; I was on perfectly good terms with Duke then—I did not trust myself to keep it I gave it to Watkins three or Tour days afterwards—I showed it to Duke when I said "I hear from Watkins you are going to put Kimber on me"—Watkins had given it to me the same morning—it was then consigned back to the box and never thought about till 13th November.</p>

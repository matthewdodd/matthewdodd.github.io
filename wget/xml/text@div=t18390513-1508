                  </hi>. I live in Foley-street, Marylebone, and am a carpenter. On the 9th of April I went to Sir Claude Scott's banking-house—I had two cheques—I had one of them changed for gold—the prisoner Walls stood at my left hand in the banking-house, and a person was with him, I cannot say who—I went to Crawford-street—when there I missed a cheque for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Marylebone Bank—I went to the Bank the moment I missed it, to stop the payment, but the cheque was there, and had been paid—I took an officer, and went to Enfield, where I found the prisoners, about twelve o'clock—I had seen the cheque safe about a quarter past two o'clock, when I missed it about three o'clock—when the prisoners were taken Walls produced some money—he counted some gold from one hand to the other—the landlord was in the parlour, and a great many other persons came in—I gave Walls into custody the moment I saw him, but he got away from the policeman.</p>

On the evening of 2nd Oct. we were removing our goods from Princes-terrace, Islington—they had been distrained on—the prisoner was a lodger in the same house—while we were removing, the prisoner struck my husband with an umbrella—I went up to him, and said if he still thought my husband was guilty, to fetch an officer and give him into custody—my husband had been charged with improper conduct to Gill's daughter—I had heard of that a fortnight previous—when I went to the prisoner, and begged him to send for an officer and give him into custody, he said he would not hurt me, but my husband he would have—my husband went up to our room, upstairs, and I called to him to lock himself in—Gill struck me on the stairs with his hand on the side of the</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the front kitchen of that house. I did not see Mr. Gill strike Mr. Orton with the umbrella—I saw Mr. Orton come in at the front door, and take up a poker—they were moving at the time, and there was a fender and fire irons placed in the passage—he came round to the front door, and said, "The villain, I will do for him"—Mr. Gill quickly followed Mr. Orton when he came in—I did not see any blow with the poker.</p>

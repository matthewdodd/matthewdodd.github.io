                  </hi>. I am shopman to Elizabeth Kempton and another, of Oxford-street, linen-drapers. In the month of March I missed a piece of lawn, numbered 328 from their counter—I have since seen it in pos<lb></lb>session of an officer—it was not sold, from its not being marked with out private mark, which was not put on it, in consequence of its not being there when the goods were marked.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 198.) On Sunday, the 27th of March, I apprehended the prisoner in Rose and Crown-court, Long-alley—I took him to the station-house, and told him I was going to search his place—he said, "If you are going, take the keys of my boxes, or else I dare say you will break them open"—he gave me three keys—I went to the first door in Christopher-square, Long-alley—I applied the keys to the boxes, and found the piece of lawn produced—a person named Dell pointed out the room—the prisoner said it was his property, and he had brought it from Jersey.</p>

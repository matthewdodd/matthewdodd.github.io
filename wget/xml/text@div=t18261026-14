I walked to the top of Fann-street, and putting my hand into my pocket, missed the purse - she was gone then. I went to the watchman, told him, and described her as a woman dressed in black, without a bonnet; we traced her to Smithfield, and in consequence of information from a watchman there, we found her at two o'clock - I am certain of her person; she was taken to the watch-house and searched; I described the purse and money - the purse was found on her, with the 5l. note and 12s. remaining in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I not meet you in Long-lane, when another young woman was talking to you? You insisted on my laying hold of your arm - you gave the purse into my hand, after we had been down a passage. Witness. It is all false; I made no proposal to her; I was not in Long-lane; I asked where her friend lived, and where she lived - she said, in Cow-lane. I was not out of the city while she was near me.</p>

Davies came to me in West-street, about half-past twelve o'clock, and described a person to me; I afterwards found the prisoner, by his description, at supper in a lodging-house in West-street; she answered his description; he spoke positively to her, on seeing her - I took her to the watch-house; she was searched in a room upstairs, and a purse was afterwards produced which Davies claimed.</p>

            . I am constable of the night. I searched the prisoner, and found a purse coutaining a 5l. note and 12s. on her - Davies claimed the note and purse - the purse was in her month - I saw her take it from her bosom, and put it into her mouth; he described the name on the note.(Purse and note produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was unpinning my clothes, and had the purse in my hand - he thought it was in my mouth. He gave the note into my hand in a passage of a house; he asked my direction, which I told him, and in an hour and a half he came and asked if I was within - I said, "Yes, who wants me?" but if I had robbed him, I would have said nothing.</p>

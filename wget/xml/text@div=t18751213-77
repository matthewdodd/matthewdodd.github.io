                  </hi>. I am a reporter of 14, Pembridge Square, Blackfriars Road—on 4th December about 12.40 am., I was at the corner of Baker's Row, where a policeman cautioned me to get as near to the edge of the pave<lb></lb>ment as I could, but seeing nobody I felt safe, but all at once I was pounced upon by four men; I was pinioned from behind and received a blow under my right ear, and a, blow on my lip, and my spectacles were knocked</p>

               <p>off—I knocked one of the men down and called police—another man seized me by the back of my neck, and squeezed me, while another rifled my pockets—they tripped me up, turned my pockets inside out, and ran away—the prisoner was brought back by a policeman—he is one of the men to the best of my knowledge, but I cannot swear to him.</p>

On this night I saw the prisoner and two others running into Baker's Row very fast—the prisoner was the foremost; I tried to stop him and was knocked down—I got up and caught him without losing sight of him—he said "For God's sake don't stop me, I have not done anything, I am running to get home"—I took him back to the prosecutor who gave him in charge—he was not drunk, but when he got to Baker's Row he pretended to be so.</p>

On the 12th of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock, he was playing about the door with my children, with a cap on belonging to one of my sons, as I could not find his own; he ran in crying, and saying a boy had taken his cap - he is four years old; I ran out, but have never seen it since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How old is your child? A. Six years; I am quite sure it was not Powell's cap - there were about a dozen children playing about.</p>

            . I live in Swan-alley, with my father, who has been a constable. I saw Powell, about eleven o'clock, about one door from Mr. Nelson's, playing with other children; I saw Johnson take the cap off Powell's head, and give it to Taylor, who wrapped it up in his apron, and ran away; I did not follow him, but went in and told Mrs. Allen, at No. 1, Swan-alley, just round the corner; I knew Johnson lived in a court by the National schools, in Chiswell-street - I saw him in his own house about half-past one o'clock, and told Allen, the constable; he called me up stairs, and asked if he was the boy -I said Yes, and he took him; Johnson took us to Taylor's house, and I knew him to be the boy who received the cap- it was a seal-skin cap; it has not been found - I am sure I saw Johnson take it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the prisoners play-fellows of your's? A. No; the prisoners and two others were hanging over one-another's shoulders, not at play - Taylor kept close to Johnson; he did not touch the boy himself - he was standing still, looking at the <rs id="t18310407-68-viclabel387" type="occupation">child</rs>

Johnson went with me to Taylor's, thirty or forty yards off, and Herdsfield said that was the boy who received it - they both denied it; the cap has not been found.</p>

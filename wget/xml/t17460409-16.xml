               <p>Hoskins. Please you, my Lord, I know nothing of the Man; I never see him with my Eyes before this Time: The Woman I have seen; she came to my House; I keep a Publick House. She ask'd me if I would buy a Silver Pint Mug; I told her, I never dealt in Silver, nor never intended it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon that?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. The Creature (So I may call her) she wanted to bring me into a Premunire. My Husband, please you my Lord, was asleep; he had been a Journey, and he did not awake at this Time. She said, I wish you would be so good as to buy the Mug, or let me have a Trifle upon it. I refus'd it; she said she was not in a Dress fit to go out with it, and said, will you please to let your Girl go out to any of your Acquaintance, to borrow as much as they can upon it; so the Girl agreed to go, and ask'd what she must borrow upon this Mug; the Prisoner said she might borrow 20 s. if she could; but they would not give her any thing unless I would come; I went, and told them the People were at my House, and so they gave 30 s. for the Mug.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more to say.</p>
               <p>Hoskins. My Lord, there were 18 s. deliver'd into her Hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the People by the Mug again?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. When the Prisoner receiv'd the 18 s. she said it would get him his Coat, or something, for she believ'd he was in Confinement; these Words dropping, gave me a Suspicion; I got the 18 s. again, and went directly with my Servant to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174604090012"></xptr> Pawnbroker's for the Mug, and no Use was paid for it.</p>
               <p>Court. You Woman Prisoner, will you ask this Witness any Question.</p>

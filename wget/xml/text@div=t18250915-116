            . I am a bookseller, and live in Chancery-lane; I gave some pamphlets to the officer, which I bought of the prisoner, they are small two-penny pamphlets, and I bought them at different times in July - I gave for the whole about 14 s. - I had known the prisoner for years - he bore a good character - he has been in habits of intimacy with Mr. Hall, and he had books of him from time to time - he said, he had at that time very little to do, and if I would let him have the money, he dare say he could purchase them again, and if not, he could get them at a cheap price.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HALL re-examined. Q. Had you lent the prisoner your books? A. Yes, sometimes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many years have you known the prisoner? A. Seven or eight years; we have been on terms of intimacy; he has had books of all sorts of me from time to time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in company with him when the officer took him in Essex-street? A. He came there to see me; he said, he had heard of the loss, and came there to talk to me about it. I had the officer ready, who took him.</p>

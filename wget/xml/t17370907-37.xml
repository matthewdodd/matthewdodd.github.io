The Occasion of my charging the Prisoner, was this. A Friend came to me and asked me if I had not lost some Quicksilver; he imagin'd I had: Upon this I suspected the Prisoner, and got a Warrant, and charged him with the Fact. He deny'd it. I told him I had Proof against him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173709070018"></xptr> and I desired one in the House to get a Constable, but while the Constable was gone for, the Prisoner; took to his Heels, and ran away. I follow'd him, and took him, and put him into the Constable's Hands. When he was brought back, he desired to speak with me in another Room. So I took the Constable and his Assisstants into another Room with me, and there he told me he had wronged me, and if I would shew him Favour, he would make me Satisfaction. Upon this, I call'd for Pen, Ink and Paper, and bid him write down what he had wrong'd me of. Accordingly, before the Constable and the other Person, he wrought down these Particulars. I asked him, when he took them away? He told me he took them, the Morning he was to go away; that he sent an empty Box to the Cross-Keys-Inn, and early in the Morning he took these Goods and carry'd them there in a Bag, then put them into the Box, and sent them to his Lodgings (that were to be) by a Porter. The Woman of the House gave me an Account, that she suspected he had robb'd me, and that the Goods were sent from her House to one

               <p>Mr. Crook. When I was in the Room with him, he desired me to shew him Favour, and he told me he would give me full Satisfaction, for his Father liv'd in Reputation, and he should have a good Fortune when he came of Age. I was disposed to favour him at that Time, because I believed all he said, to be true; and I believe I might say, that if he would make an ingenuous Discovery, I would not Prosecute him. But when I came to enquire into the Truth of what he told me, I found it untrue, and that he had robb'd me of Goods to the Value of 50 l. This is the Account he wrote himself, in this Paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray how did the Figures come to be alter'd?</p>
               <p>Mr. Crook. Some he alter'd himself, and some I made myself, because he did not know the Prices of the Goods. The Goods were mine and my Partners; some of them were taken out of the Shop that is under my House, and some out of that which is under my Partners: Our 2 Houses join together; he pays Rent for his Part, and I for that which I Occupy.</p>
               <p>C. I observe here are different Hand-writings on this Paper; and that which imports the Value, in a different Hand from the rest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Crook. This Figure and these Words, and Alteration, were done by the Prisoner; the other were made by me, expressing the Value of the Goods in his Presence.</p>

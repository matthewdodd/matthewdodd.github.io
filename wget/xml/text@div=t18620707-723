                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Norris, of 72, Market-street, Paddington—on 28th June, about 9 o'clock, I was walking along Drury-lane;</p>

               <p>two persons came up to me; the prisoner is one of them—he snatched my bag from me—I tried to keep it, struggled with him for a few minutes, and he broke the chain—I attempted to follow him, and ran down Porter-street after him, till some one behind me called me, stopped me, and thumped me in the chest—my bag contained a lace fall, a cap-front, a key, some elastic, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money—I gave a description of the person who had taken it, to the constable—I saw him distinctly coming up to me, before he came to me—I did not see him again till Sunday night—this was on Saturday—I saw him at Bow-street police-court, with seven other persons, and picked him out.</p>

The last witness gave me a description, in consequence of which I apprehended the prisoner at half-past 3 in the afternoon on 29th—I told him he must come with me—I did not tell him what for—I had seen him on the Saturday night, about ten minutes to 9, in Drury-lane, about five or seven minutes before the robbery took place, before I received the information, with another man—that was about thirty yards from the spot where the prosecutrix was robbed, I should say.</p>

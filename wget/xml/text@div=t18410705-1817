                  </hi>. I am in the service of Charles George Ladensach and another, linen drapers, in St. John-street. On the 22nd of June, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the shop fol<lb></lb>lowed by another man—the other one asked to look at some calico—I showed him some—he asked the prisoner if it would do—he said, "Very well"—he did not take particular notice of the calico—I had rather a suspicion, and kept my eye on him all the time I was serving the other—the other man gave me a half-crown—I put it into the till—I did not give him the change, as he asked to look at some half-hose—while getting some down, I saw the prisoner take a piece of diaper from a pile of linen, and conceal it under a black bag or wrapper which he had—I directly jumped over the counter, and knocked at the door for my employer to come out—he came out immediately—the prisoner went away with the diaper and bag—I went after him, and took him—he was standing shuffling with the black bag—I saw it dropped after I collared him, and another man went away with it—I do not know where he ran to—I can swear the prisoner is the man who took the diaper out of the shop—a woman afterwards came and told me that the black bag and diaper was lying in the road—I went out, and some person gave it to me—this is it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have sworn to-day that the prisoner came in followed by the other man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> So he did—they were both together when they came in, one followed the other—I should say this took altogether between three and four minutes—the prisoner did not deny he was the man—I never swore "the prisoner said it was not him"—I never swore any such thing—he did say it was not him.</p>

On the 22nd of June I was on duty in St. John-street, a short distance from the prosecutor's shop, and saw a crowd of people near it—I went up, and saw Sparrow outside with the black bag and diaper, and the prisoner—I took him into custody—he said he was not the man, that he was coming past the door, and saw two persons rush out—Sparrow said he could swear to the prisoner.</p>

            , White Conduit-house and the Barley-Mow, Frog Lane.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you respectfully three apartments for you - A. Hudson was a shopkeeper at the time I had lodgings, I believe the prisoner either lodged with his mother or had private lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you occasionally meet at your lodging for the discussion of this plan - A. We were careful not to have any conversation before a fourth person, therefore it was never carried on at any apartments that I had, we used to meet at places were we could have a box to ourselves. It was at last agreed that a forgery should be committed upon the dividend warrant office by filling up four blank dividend printed warrants which was to be brought by the prisoner at the bar and some of the Bank ink on account of its black colour. After the warrants were filled up Hudson was to procure a young man to present them at the proper office in the Bank for payment.</p>
               <p>Q. What sum of money was it proposed to be raised by this means - A. Hudson proposed at least ten thousand pounds, the prisoner objected to the largeness of it, saying that an application for so great a sum would cause the person who applied to be sent to the principal in the office, which principal was most likely acquainted with the names of persons holding large stocks in the three per cents.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he then propose - A. Not a greater amount than two thousand four hundred and thirty pounds should be presented, which sum was filled up.</p>
               <p>Q. That plan was adopted, how did he plan that it should be executed - A. By putting in a fictious name upon a person who had no stock. Then it was proposed to put in a clergymans name because many of them were large stockholders.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this to be carried into execution - A. After this was filled up, a young man was to be procured who was to carry it to the proper office which was done. The young man on being procured was to present this and I was to be behind to see that the money was received.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you to guard against the person who did present it not being detected - A. It was proposed that all sum of that amount would be paid without any objected.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any question before the business was finished how it was to be settled - A. By Hudson reving 500 l. And the remainder between Armitage and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you to do besides being behind the young man to see the money paid - A. To pass the notes and I was to fill up the warrant, Hudson having been in the Bank his hand-writing would be known he thought he should be suspected; I was to fill them up and my principal business was to dispose of the notes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he in consequence of this agreement bring some dividend warrants and some ink - A. He brought six.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of bringing six when there was only four to be made - A. For fear of miscalculation, the two were to guard against an accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence or that fill up these four papers - A. I did fill up these four, I did an except the bottom signature, that is Hudson's to them all William Birt attorney.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you got to the Bank did the prisoner give you any information respecting that office in which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290012"></xptr>he was stationed - A. He did, he stated that very day which was the first day of payment.</p>
               <p>Q. What date was this - A. I am not certain it was early in July 1809, he stated to me that very day, the day before it was intended to apply for the money, that very day a young man had been appointed to the dividend office to pay the warrants, and that he sat at his left and he had to superintend him, that it would be proper that the application should be made to this young man for the payment of them, because of he having the superintendance to guard against a discovery. He said he had on that day early in the morning received two thousand pounds which he had no occasion for them that day.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in the afternoon of the day after the hours of the Bank that you had this conversation with him - A. It was, that he had early in the morning received two thousand pound notes, that he had no occasison for them that day, that he would very likely the next day have the two same or two others of the same amount.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hudson procure a young man - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. What character did Hudson assume for the purpose of hiring the young man - A. The name of Birt, stockbroker.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that of your own knowledge - A. I know that he had the clerk, I do not know what name he went by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after this conversation go to the Bank at the same time the young man went to receive the money with the warrants - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave the warrants to the young man - A. Hudson.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you know that - A. Yes I do, I saw him give them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. With what directions did the young man go to the Bank - A. He was taken into the office by Hudson; his master carried him into the office with the papers in the common way of stockbrokers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the warrant office - A. Into the pay office.</p>
               <p>Q. The young man knew nothing from you of this transaction did he - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the directions that were given him, and see him follow these directions - A. I did, he went to this young man of the left of Armitage the new Bank clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. The brokers clerk went to the new clerk in the Bank, you saw him on the left of Armitage - A. Yes and placed myself immediately behind this clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it early in the morning - A. About half past eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Armitage been apprised that it was to be done that morning - A. It was settled to be done that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between Armitage and you - A. I moved my hat for Armitage to know me, he knew my business, and that it was settled I should be there the preceeding evening. After waiting some time as the office was thronged the young man put the warrants down before Mr. Mills, the clerk Mills took them up, and asked him how he would have them, meaning in what notes; he had been desired to say the shortest way for I am agoing to take them to our bankers directly. The clerk looked over his money; Armitage was close to his elbow, and the clerk Mills said to Armitage, have you got two one thousand pound notes; He said he had, and produced them, they were given by Armitage to the clerk Mills, and Mr. Mills took the number of the notes, these two one thousand and four one hundred pounds; he then gave to Hudson's young man a twenty and a ten, making together two thousand four hundred and thirty pounds. The young man had been desired by Hudson to come to him at the Bank coffee-house, and if he was not there to wait for him because was there any discovery made I was to have apprized him. He waited for me under the Royal Exchange.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw it all done, you went and informed him that it was all right, and then you went with him to the coffee-house - A. Yes, but I staid out side of the coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him go in the coffee-house, how soon did he join you - A. In less than five minutes, he gave me the two one thousand pound notes and told me to go to the Bank directly and change them. I by direction wrote Hammersly upon one of the notes; it was mutually agreed by us before to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note is that the one - A. Yes, the word Hammersley is my own hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did you get your two thousand pound notes broke into smaller sums - A. Into one hundred and fifty tens, and one hundred fives, and while I was waiting in the cashiers office for change, Armitage came out of his own office into the cashers office and saw that I received the change, that there was no doubt there, he did nothing more than look on; I got my change and went away and met Hudson; Armitage went back to his office.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you meet Armitage - A. About four five or six in the afternoon of the same day he came to my lodgings in Princes Square, Kennington.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had them lodgings at that time - A. Not much more than a week or nine days.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose advice had you changed your lodgings - A. By the advice of Hudson and Armitage.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did Armitage or Hudson assign to you for your changing your lodging - A. Because that was a part of the town I never resided in, and of course was not known.</p>
               <p>Q. He came to your lodgings that afternoon, what then - A We rode out together in a chaise me and Armitage we went down the Croydon Road, drank a bottle of wine and returned home to my lodgings. I gave Armitage fifty notes of ten pounds each, and fifty of five pound each and many others of one's two's but the exact amount I could not tell on that night; and the night after made up the amount of a thousand pounds what I gave him, these were the notes that I received at the cashiers office and I had changed some to get smaller notes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you employ any body else to exchange any for you - A. Not the first day, On the Monday early in the morning, Kezia Willis went out with me to break the larger notes; we went to many of the shops at the west-end of the Town, as many as we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290013"></xptr>could; we got rid of as much as we could in the course of that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had your own share - A. Yes, and I paid Hudson his share, excepting thirty-five pounds; I paid him four hundred and sixty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any alteration made to the notes - A. Where an ought could be made into a six or a nine, it was done, and a one into a seven or a four, it was done, but no additional figures.</p>
               <p>Q.Well, sir, this business being so settled as you made alterations was there any application of the ink - A. We made use of the bank ink.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that one of the notes that you so altered - A. It appears like our alterations.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this before you were apprehended - A. About thirteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you intercourse in the mean time of seeing Armitage and Hudson - A. Yes, constantly in the habit of seeing them. I was taken up about the 4th or 5th of August, 1810.</p>

               <p>COURT. Do you mean parties of pleasure - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. And Folkard knew Willis too - A. Yes, we were often in the habit of riding out together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he soon informed that you were in custody - A. Very soon; he visited me; not he himself, but a friend of his, sent by him, came to see me the first week of my confinement.</p>
               <p>Q. Look in that dividend warrant you hold in your hand, there is a hole in the middle of it - A. There is; it was not there when presented; one name I recollect, that is, Hoffman. I see now the letters, Hoff.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there was any clerk in the bank of the name of Hoffman - A. Indirectly I did, that made me recollect the name.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt of the name of the person who signed for the bank, his name was Hoffman - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any warrants of the bank to fill them up by - A. Yes, two bona fide warrants; he said he had paid for them himself, and therefore had brought them to me for patterns. They were for the purpose of copying the clerks names, whose signature they had, and the manner of filling up.</p>
               <p>Q. You, as near as you could, imitated the writing of the clerks - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Hoffman is one of these names - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you made it as much like Hoffman's signature as you could - A. Yes, and G. Taylor, I made that like G. Taylor.</p>

             for that expedition, what account did you give to her, it was rather an odd thing to do - A. That they had been obtained in that way that it would not do for me to pass them, or as little as I could help.</p>

               <p>Q. What was your object besides that of a party of pleasure, for going to Birmingham - A. With deference to you, my lord, I am not obliged to answer any question to criminate myself, except relevant to this case.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this tend to criminate yourself - A. It does.</p>
               <p>Q. You have undergone many adventures not connected with this business, have not you been apprehended upon many other charges than this - A. I have, twice in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. But any where else - A. Then I object; I decline answering the question whether I dealt in annuities; because I might criminate myself; it might lead on to other questions.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were you concerned in annuities - A. I have been.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Ruff. Have you been concerned in annuities - A. I have, only one transaction of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Only one single transaction - A. Only one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Hudson concerned with you in this transaction - A. He was.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you gone by a title - A. I object to answering that question.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you apprehend that your going by any title of honour do you think your answering that question it would tend to criminate yourself - A. I think it will.</p>

               <p>Mr. Serjeant Ruff. Did you ever call yourself, or go by the name of Lord Percy - A. I shall not answer it without my lord commands me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have told me when the period of your first apprehension was, when was the second apprehension - A. About the year 1803.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what charge were you apprehended then Mr. Roberts - A. I negotiated a bill which a gentleman had stolen from his purse, or had lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the charge made against you to cause that apprehension - A. It was merely the payment of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were you first acquainted with, Hudson or the prisoner Armitage - A. I was acquainted with Hudson first. Hudson was a clerk in the bank.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you saw Hudson - A. I suppose it is five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when was it that you first gave an account similar to what you have now given - A. In the month of last October.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after you had escaped from prison - A. After.</p>
               <p>Q. What prison were you in - A. In Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. What prison did you escape from - A. The house of Correction in Cold Bath Fields.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the charge made against you, which occasioned you to be in the House of Correction, Cold Bath Fields - A. I never saw a copy of my commitment.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have no notion - A. I have a notion, I was examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a forgery - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. More than one - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not a distinct charge made against you for a forgery, and was not a charge made against<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290015"></xptr>you for stealing - A. There was a charge against me for things that were found upon my person, they were exchequer bills.</p>
               <p>Q. And the charge was, that these exchequer bills which were found in your pocket were stolen - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course that was a distinct charge from the other charge - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you charged with having stolen any other things besides these exchequer securities - A. I cannot answer the question. There was another charge made against me, but I believe abandoned; it was entered into, but not continued.</p>
               <p>Q. What other things were found upon you besides exchequer bills - A. Two bank post-bills.</p>
               <p>Q. They were also made a subject of charge - A. They were entered into. I was not detained upon any of these things.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, sir, it was not untill you made your escape from the House of Correction, Cold Bath Fields, that you told the story that you have today - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the first person that you told these things to - A. It was written by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that writing extant now - A. I cannot tell, I never kept a copy; it was sent to the Governor of the bank.</p>
               <p>Q. You had taken no step to disclose this previous to your being taken - A. None, whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. And then for the first time you told the story that you have told to-day - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for doing that - A. An innate love of justice, and a desire to make as much reparation as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. That is what you mean now to state as one great motive for your discovery, upon your oath was it that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of 
               <persName id="t18110529-18-person191">Clarke</persName>
             a butcher - A. I do.</p>

               <persName id="t18110529-18-person192">Clarke</persName>
             that Mr. Armitage was as innocent as a child unborn, and that you did it all yourself - A. That is quite impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you state to Clarke that Hudson and you alone did this, and that Armitage was totally innocent - A. That never took place; I will swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you did not say this to Clarke then you did not say any thing about being hanged yourself, did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know such a person as Clarke - A. I do; and I swear that I never uttered such words to Clarke, nor to any person whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Who is this man of the name of Clarke - A. I know a man of the name of Clarke, a butcher at Newington; he was in the habit of coming into Newgate very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was an acquaintance of the prisoner - A. I believe they were acquainted; Clarke kept a public house where Armitage was in the habit of going as well as me, but not lately. It is four years back since he had a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you at the time that you wrote the narrative that you sent to the Governor of the bank - A. In Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send it without any stipulation whatever with it - A. I sent it unconditional.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of your own knowledge, or from the prisoner Armitage, where Armitage was at the time of that communication - A. I had not the slightest knowledge of it.</p>

               <p>Q. And the four one hundred pounds - A. No, not positively, because the figures has been altered.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the one hundred pounds; 2367, that is in its present state, does the third figure appear to have been altered - A. I cannot discover it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the fourth note - A. I believe the ought in 2368 has been altered into a 6, they appear to have been the notes that I paid away, but the figures are altered, the oughts are altered into a six, and the other into a nine.</p>

Certainly not, it has been punched out, I am certain the warrant appeared whole and perfect when paid, they were canceled in this manner at the time, we have altered our mode since.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you by your intercourse with him become acquainted with his hand-writing - A. I think I could speak to his writing if I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Cast your eye upon that letter, and tell me whether you believe that writing to be Mr. Armitages - A. I have no doubt in my own mind but it is his writing.</p>
               <p>COURT to Mr. Mills. Had you any acquaintance with Roberts - A. No, I never saw him in my life until his examination.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you ever talk to Mr, Roberts of what notes you had disposed of on the 10th - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. I am speaking of Roberts - have you ever had any conversation with Roberts, or spoke to him, of what notes you retained on that day - A. Never; I never spoke to Roberts in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You first said that you never communicated to Roberts that you had delivered to you on that day, did you ever tell Roberts what sum on that day you took to the teller - A. I positively never spoke to him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person except the teller who issued out the notes to you, or yourself, or a brother clerk who might look in your collection of notes, could any other person tell what you returned - A. No one out of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. No stranger of the Bank could know what shape you received in the morning, or what sum you returned in the afternoon - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That might become known to a brother clerk in the office - A. No one could know but those that belonged to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. For instance, was he in such a situation if he was curious enough, could he have known what you had in your posession - A. He could have known, but no other person but in the connection of the Bank.</p>

               <p>Q. What the particular thing to be done was, you did not know - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have since Roberts has been in custody, as far as you could, kept up your connexion with him - A. I have.</p>

               <p>Q. You never knew of any regular employment that he pursued, did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know probably that he was a person that went by different names - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q.Was John still in the bank - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Having heard this information it certainly was alarming enough for a friend - Did you go to Mr. Armitage - A. I went to his mother's immediately the same evening; I believe it was ten o'clock when I got to Kingsland; I did not see either his mother or Armitage that evening; I saw Armitage the following morning at the bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in his own office in the bank - A. In the dividend warrant office; I went early, he was at his desk.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you communicate to Mr. Armitage - A. I told him that Mrs. Roberts intended to involve him and his brother in the forgery. I always understood she was Roberts's wife. He said I believe it was an unfortunate thing, and that he was always afraid of the woman, Mrs. Roberts. I believe nothing more passed at that time. I left him there.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see him again - A. It was on the Saturday he left the bank.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the day that you saw him in the bank and made this communication - A. I think that was on the Saturday. I saw Armitage again on the Thursday or Friday; on the week following I met him at Child's Hill, Hampstead Heath; I went with a friend of his, and his friend went for him to some house, and brought him to me on the Heath.</p>

               <p>Q. Did his friend accompany you - A. He did; during the conversation in the way he mentioned respecting furnishing Roberts with the printed blank warrants.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard that before from the prisoner - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he for the first time mentioned to you that he had furnished printed blank warrants to Roberts - A. Yes, and that he received part of the money that was got by forging the dividend warrants.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him respecting that - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Try - what do you think you said - A. I said it was an unfortunate circumstance, what steps did he mean to take; he talked of surrendering himself, and his friend as well as myself advised him not in the present state of the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect making any observations to him upon his telling you this - A. I told him it was a strange thing, it was throwing himself upon my mercy, He said he had no friend that he could confide in, and therefore he had sent for me to consult with him what was the best steps to take.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any other friendship with him than in the company of Roberts - A. None, whatever; he said he should come to town that evening. He did not say afterwards exactly what steps he should take.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this friend that took you, and fetched him to you - A. I do not know his name.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon was that afterwards - A. I really cannot recollect exactly; within about a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the paper Dudley brought you - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acqainted with Armitage's hand-writing - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. It begins, Dear R.; he brought you this - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You kept this, you did not deliver this to Roberts - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe about this time that this paper was delivered to you he had broke out of prison - A. Yes, and on that day I received this paper from Armitage Roberts was re-apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner afterwards until he was apprehended in the country - A. I never saw him until this morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Because he thought you were an honest man, and a friend, he thought he would trust you upon a common, and he told you all you have related - You had a communication with the girl in prison - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say that you, as an honest man, to whom another in distress would look, you went immediately and gave information to the bank - You went to the solicitor of the bank and communicated what you understood - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not the duty of an honest man so to have done - A. It might; I did not communicate it to the Solicitor of the Bank, nor to any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known Roberts a considerable time, you have been on excursions into the country with him - A. Never but once.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never been junketting together - A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290021"></xptr>have met him in parties of pleasure, although I might have not gone with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it cannot be right if any body has stated that you and he have been on parties of pleasure - A. We have been.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was that - A. I cannot answer you. It is six or seven months ago; that pleasure was blendid with business at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I should have thought, if it was partly for your pleasure, and blendid with business, you could easily tell where it was - A. I do not chuse to answer the question.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired you to say that you did not like to answer the question - A. No one.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do not you like to answer the question - A. Because it might tend to criminate myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body desire you to give that answer - A. No; I do not chuse to answer, because it might tend to convict myself, or to involve me in some difficulty.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told me that it is about seven months ago that you went with this party of pleasure blendid with business, I now ask you again where that was - A. I do not chuse to tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. I insist upon an answer, and appeal to his lordship - A. We went to Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Roberts accompany you to Birmingham - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you went to Birmingham - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you whether he and you went on the same business - A. I do not know what business he went on, I know my own.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the business that Roberts went on - A. That I cannot tell. I went to Birmingham to bail a man that was in custody, that was arrested.</p>

               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath, do not you believe it will cease - A. I cannot say; I hope so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean to admit, that when a man trusted you as a friend that you went and betrayed your trust by informing the solicitor of the Bank - A. Certainly I did not.</p>

Yes, On the 13th of August I was employed to print hand-bills by the Solicitor of the bank; on that night I sent off bills to Harwich, Dover, Bristol, Holyhead, and Yarmouth, by the Mail, and to other places; and the hand-bills were ordered to be posted in every one of these places. This is the fifty guineas one, after that it was encreased to the sum of one hundred guineas, and then to three hundred guineas. I then sent two hundred to them by every mail-coach in England. This is the three hundred guineas bill.</p>
               <p>(The dividend warrant read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury - I am totally innocent of the charge for which I am accused. The characters of the persons that are brought against me are such that nobody could believe; they are of that description of people that would do an injury to any one by way of saving themselves. My reason of going away I can explain; Mr. Folkard came to me and said that Roberts meaned to hang me and my brother John; he said, if you stay your place will be forfeited; I went away, believing that if I was accused by such a man my situation would be forfeited, therefore I waited for the advice of a friend, who persuaded me, as I was away, to keep away, until I heard the charge. With regard to my accompts I left them correct; I had notes to a large amount, I had frequently larger amounts in my care than all the clerks in the office; I had thirty thousand pounds in my care, as my books will prove. I have been in the bank seven or eight years, and never the smallest imputation against me in the world. I wish to state with regard to my lending Mr. 
               <persName id="t18110529-18-person220">Mills</persName>
             the two thousand pound notes, that is as common an occurence as any in the office, it is done two or three times a day. The person that gives out the notes comes round the office and says, those who have got large notes lend to the other clerks who may want them. And with regard to Roberts's saying I had a thousand pounds of him, had it been so it is very odd that no notes have been traced to me. When my house was searched no notes were found, nor when I was taken and searched was any notes found upon me. Roberts has been connected with Hudson and Cook, both have been clerks in the bank. They both being bad men knew every thing of the bank business; and with respect to the warrants and receipts they might have been got by any clerk in the bank; and with regard to the letter to Roberts I can account for that, I certainly owed him seventeen pounds, which is the money mentioned there; and I mentioned there of what his wife said of me; I wished to know what his wife had accused me off; and with regard to this Folkard and Roberts their words cannot be taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to the deceased, Mr. Wincott, in South-street, Manchester-square—on 3d February, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I observed some men come down the street—there was at that time a cart standing before my master's door with bones in it—I saw the men come to the cart and pull the bones about—I saw all the three prisoners, and another named Quail—they took bones from the cart and threw at the man viall, who was loading his cart—that continued some few minutes; they then left—after a short time they returned, and followed Viall into the shop—he had gone into the shop, and was in the stop at that time—I believe Quail was the first that followed him, and the others followed him; they were all close together—I did not see any of them go into the shop, only to the door—I did not see Quail go in—whilst at the shop door I saw Quail strike Mr. Wincott; he was then standing at the shop door—after Quail struck Mr. Wincott, Mr. Wincott struck him in return—I afterwards saw Quail With a knife, and saw him stab Mr. Wincott—I did not see anything in Mr. Wincott's hand—I was so near that I must have seen if he had—when Quail stabbed him, he said, "Take that"—I heard one of the others say, "Rip the b—s guts open"—I could not say which it was that said that—I did not hear any other exclamation—I saw one of them with a chopper; I could not say which one it was—I saw him flourish it over his head—I did not hear him say anything—he was by the side of the door, on a level with Quail—after Mr. Wincott was stabbed they all left—I followed them to East-street and there they were taken by the police.</p>

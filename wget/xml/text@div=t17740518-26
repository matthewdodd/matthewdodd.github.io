On the 28th of last March, between the hours of nine and ten in the evening, Capt.

I told him it was all I had, and desired him to take the pistol from my breast. In the interim Capt. Cunningham was moving a pocket book from his right hand waistcoat pocket into his left hand breeches pocket, in which were bank notes to the amount of between four and five hundred pounds; he had twenty-six or twenty-seven, guineas in his breeches pocket, but being in liquor he refused being robbed, and said he would not be robbed; the prisoner saw the pocket book, and took the pistol from my breast, and said, God d - n you, give me the pocket book! he replied he would not give it him; the prisoner said, God d - n you, I will fire upon you immediately! Capt. Cunningham told him to fire and be d - d; he did fire within four inches of my head, and made a kind of confusion on Capt. Cunningham's left arm, but got nothing from him, his horse flew from the coach door, and I saw him feeling as it were for another pistol; I opened the opposite door, jumped out, and assisted Capt. Cunningham out; the coachman said to him, Sir, for God sake don't shoot my horses; he replied no, you are an honest fellow, I shall know you again, and he read the number of his coach, which was 745.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he read it aloud?</p>
               <p>Hart. Yes, he spoke it loud; he asked the coachman whether there were any pockets in his coach; the man replied there were; he got off his horse, and searched the coach; Capt. Cunningham with a small stick beat his horse, and d - d him for a scoundrel; when he was off the horse he had a second pistol in his hand I believe from the shortness of it, and which he held presented as to me, and swore if I came near him he would blow my brains out; I was then at the distance of five or six yards from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish the pistol?</p>
               <p>Hart. Yes: it was a fine moon light night. I must confess I was not very fond of going very near him; he got upon his horse again; Capt. Cunningham was till beating him with this little swish; the prisoner pulled the trigger of the second pistol at his head, within the distance of something less than a yard, and it missed fire; I threw a stone at him on its missing fire, and he rode immediately to town. He was taken a fortnight or three weeks after; I saw him the day he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before he robbed you?</p>
               <p>Hart. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What hour was it?</p>
               <p>Hart. Between nine and ten; the moon was near the full; it was very light.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man?</p>
               <p>Hart. I am certain of it: he was six or seven minutes with us from the first stopping of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish his person?</p>
               <p>Hart. Yes, quite clear.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish his dress?</p>
               <p>Hart. Yes: as near as I can charge my memory, the coat he has on now, with a waistcoat of the same, a hat flapped, with his hair hanging loose about his ears. I saw the horse afterwards, but could not swear to its identity; it appeared to be a dark one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hold the horse by the bridle while he was in the coach?</p>
               <p>Hart. Yes; Capt. Cunningham was striking the horse all the time; he struck the prisoner after he was upon the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. I should suppose from your account of Capt. Cunningham's behaviour he must be much in liquor?</p>
               <p>Hart. He was excessively.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to draw the captain off from provoking him?</p>
               <p>Hart. He was nearer than I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure this is the man?</p>
               <p>Hart. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of the captain?</p>
               <p>Hart. He embarked on the 15th of April for his regiment in Ireland. The coachman was at Sir

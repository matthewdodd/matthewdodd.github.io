            . This waistcoat, trousers, and boots are mine - this pocket-book is mine, and these memorandums: I had left it safe in my box on the evening of the 8th of April, when I went out; when I returned my box was broken open, and these articles gone - this book had been thrown carelessly into the bottom of the box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Might it not have fallen into one of the pockets? A. The waistcoat pockets would not hold it, and it would not have gone very well into the trousers.</p>

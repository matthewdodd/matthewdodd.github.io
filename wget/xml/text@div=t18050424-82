               <p>Q. After she had been with you any time, did you miss any of your property? - A. Yes, I missed seven pair of stockings and a cravat; I cannot say I missed the Bank-notes, I discovered them afterwards; the prisoner stated to me she had received some money from her mother, who was very indigent, in the country, she had said that she got a letter wrote to her mother; I requested to know who this person was; at last, after a falsity, she said a Mrs. Baker wrote it for her; in consequence of that, I went across the yard the next morning where her box was; I desired her to accompany me, I saw her box was broken open; she said it was broken open by Mr. Bradley, for she had lost the key; I desired her to get ready to go to Mrs. Baker's, she made her escape with two large bundles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these bundles contain any articles in this indictment? - A. They did, both mine and my nephew's; we pursued her, and after a lapse of a quarter of an hour, we found her in a cellar in Charlton-street, with two bundles, at Mrs. Newton's, the person who washes at my cottage; we brought her and the bundles back to my cottage; we found there in the bundles my stockings and the cravat, we found more articles which I have not mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards find any notes, and where? - A. In consequence of information, I went to the house of Mrs. Baker; I asked her how she came to write this letter; Mrs. Baker said she had never wrote that letter, nor never had any transactions with her in her life; I took the girl with me, and my nephew; Mrs. Baker said she never saw her before last Monday week; I then turned round to the girl, and asked her if it was true, she made me no answer; I begged Mrs. Baker's pardon for expressing myself so angry; and when this girl was brought back, after she had made her escape, Mrs. Baker came, and said in the girl's presence, I find you have taken Nanny, I have brought you her pocket-book containing two two-pound notes, which I received from your servant Nanny; I questioned the girl, and she said she took them out of my pocket, with others, before I was dressed, while my coat was hanging in the parlour; half an hour elapsed before I told Mrs. Baker I should go to the Office, then Mrs. Baker said she would tell me the whole truth, if I would not bring her into trouble; she said, that Nanny had brought her two other two-pound notes about a fortnight before; the prisoner acknowledged to taking the notes out of my pocket-book, and stockings from the cottage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. Is your house in the City of London? - A. No; Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Baker requested that she should not be brought into trouble, and I believe she is the principal in the business - this is the first service that she came to in London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She came to you particularly recommended? - A. Yes, her mother is a poor woman living in Berkshire.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that the girl made her escape from your house, you were not present? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, you did not see her take the bundles? - A. I did not; I particularly requested the clerk of the indictments not to put the notes in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is she? - A. Sixteen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What is the value of the stockings? - A. Fourteen shillings, and the cravat a shilling; they have my marks on them, I know they are mine; I am given to understand that she has shewn much contrition.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the notes are your's, that you had not paid them away? - A. I had not; there is my writing on the back of it, West, 22 of the 2nd month, and I am given to understand that the prisoner's mother's life depends upon the issue of this prosecution.</p>

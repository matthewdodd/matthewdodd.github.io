                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Deptford—I knew the deceased, William Hazard, for some years—I attended him professionally</p>

               <p>—he was about seventy-two or seventy-three years old—about three weeks before the Coroner's Inquest I attended him for ill health—that ill<lb></lb>ness, I should say, had nothing to do with his death. On Saturday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 18th of September, between five and six o'clock, I was called to see him, by Conner, the policeman—I went to his house and saw him—he was dead, but not cold—I thought he had been dead about two or three hours—I made an external examination of him then, and found a cut on the right eye, with ecchymosis, which is coagulated blood, and an abrasion on the right temple, with contusion, and a bruise on the left eye, a slight cut on the lower jaw, just below the eye, and he was bleeding slightly from the mouth—that blood came from the head—some internal injury in the head produced it—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination with Mr. Atkins—I found extravasated blood between the membranes of the brain, and coagulated blood at the base of the brain, the middle hemisphere of the brain highly inflamed, and a quantity of bloody serum in the left lateral verticle of the brain—those symptoms were quite sufficient to account for death—there was blood on the pillow—these symptoms were produced by some external injuries—I should say a blow or fall, or blows and falls, would account for it—if blows were inflicted a few days before, there would have been the same appearances—he was in bed lying on his left side.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would not excess in a person of his age be very likely to produce apoplexy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in a subject like him—he was intemperate, but for years he was in the habit of carrying a very heavy weight on his head, (fish,) and if he had a tendency to apoplexy, that weight might accelerate it very much, but it did not in this case—I do not know whether he had left off carrying those weights—he was a fishmonger by business—the cut on the right temple was not trifling—the abrasion was slight, but the contusion was severe—it was discoloured slightly.</p>

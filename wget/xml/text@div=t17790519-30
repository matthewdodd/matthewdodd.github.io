I came out in about a quarter of an hour to see if all was safe, and saw the prisoner with the truss on his back. I asked him where he was going with it. He said a man employed him to carry it to Little-Britain; that the man was to meet him there at the pitching-place. He shewed me a paper which he said the man had given him, with the same mark upon it that was upon the shalloon. I delivered the shalloon to the book-keeper, and he locked it up in the warehouse.

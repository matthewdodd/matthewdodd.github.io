A little after that the prisoner and I went into the coffee-room, to drink a little rum and water together; I then said to him, suppose this is not accepted at Liverpool: he said it was a good bill, and would be accepted; upon which, I imagined it would, and proposed giving it to Mr. Hanford, as before. Then Mr. Wright came into the room, an utter stranger to me: I was told he came from Hull; I asked him if he was brother to the Wrights of Nottingham; he said he was; they are gentlemen I well know. The prisoner went out of the coffee-room; he clap'd his hand on his head, and appeared to be sick, and said he would go and take the fresh air: I went to Mr. Wright, and asked him how he did; upon his saying he knew the prisoner not to be so good as he should be; saying, he had forged several bills; upon which I shewed him this bill: he looked on it, and told me it was a forged bill; then I did not think proper to send it to Liverpool: since that I gave it to Mr. Wright, to present to the drawers.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know all their hand-writings?</p>
               <p>Wright. I do, particularly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen them all write?</p>
               <p>Wright. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they keep any clerk?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, they do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this bill of exchange, (he takes it in his hand,) whose hand-writing is the body of it?</p>
               <p>Wright. This is neither of their hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the names Thorleys and King.</p>
               <p>Wright. I am very well satisfied these names are not their hand-writing: they have not been long in partnership.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the prisoner was apprehended?</p>
               <p>Wright. I was: I think it was the 17th of October last: he was searched; he had, at least, upon him one hundred and fifty of these checks *, (producing eight or ten of them) and two bills ready filled up, in his pocket-book: I seeing him at the Swan and Two-necks, in Lad-lane, gave Mr. Taylor to understand he was a bad man, so he was taken up.</p>
               <p>* Note, A check is the end of a draught, marbled or flourished, so as totally with the book it is cut out of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never offered that bill to him: I never had or saw the bill: if Messrs. Thorleys and King were here, I do not think they would swear that is not their hand-writing: but I know nothing of it.</p>

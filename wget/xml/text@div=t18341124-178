                  </hi>. I live at No. 18, Bridgehouse-place, Newington-causeway, in the parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. I had a music-stand on my premises—on the 7th of November, just at dusk, a lady came and said a man had ran away with a music-stand—I looked across the road and saw a man running with it—I ran after him; and when I got within a few yards of him, he threw it down—a policeman took the pri<lb></lb>soner in the next street—this is my stand.</p>

               <p>seven and eight o'clock that evening—the prisoner ran by me with a music-stand—he struck me on the shoulder with it—that was about forty yards from the prosecutor's, on the opposite side—he was going on very fast, and the stand struck two ladies—the prisoner then stopped for a minute to disen<lb></lb>gage the stand from them; and there being a glare of light from Mr. Ste<lb></lb>ven's shop, I had a full opportunity of seeing his features—I saw him run down the next street, and soon afterwards I saw him in custody of the offi<lb></lb>cer—I recognised him as being the person who ran against me.</p>

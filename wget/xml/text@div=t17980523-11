             jumped at me, struck me, and then asked the girl if she was not ashamed of herself to be in bed with a man of my colour, (the witness was a Crecle); upon that, this man seized me immediately, and tore my new shirt violently, and struck me most cruelly about the eyes; they said, d-n you, why do not you kill the black b - r; they made at me with a piece of a bedstead, the candle was knocked out, and I felt for my watch at the head of the bed, and the watch was gone; I said, are not you ashamed to rob me in my own apartments, and try to take my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230012"></xptr>life; upon that, Elizabeth Harold made the best of her way in her shift, with her petticoat in her hand, and her gown, and put them on in the back yard; then they said, let us throw the black b - r out at the window; they lifted me to the edge of the window, and I made a spring from them, I had then but half a shirt on; says Ann Davies, bring a light, and let us see how pretty the black b - r looks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more about the watch? - A. Nothing more than these two women were nearest to it when the light was struck out; I missed it directly.</p>


               <p>Q. What was your watch worth? - A. I gave four pounds ten for it; I have never found my watch since. The next morning I had them taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search their lodgings? - A. No; the officer did that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You lived in these lodgings with Mrs. Harold? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe she had lived with one of those two men that came into your room? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has she lived with you? - A. Ever since I have been from sea, except the first week.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - A. No, I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not these men abuse her as you say, and was not the cause of their abusing the woman, because she had gone to live with you a black man, and had deserted one of them? - A. No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state that at the office, to the Magistrate? - A. No, I never knew she kept company with the man in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said so? - A. No, I never did, because I could not say that that I never saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Mason apprehended in her own lodgings the next day? - A. Mr. Brown took her.</p>
               <p>Q. The other prisoner was taken near the Public-Office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she not there for the purpose of exhibiting a complaint against you for the assault she alledged you had committed against her? - A. I was in at Mr. Staples's office at the time, and I do not know rightly whereabouts they took her.</p>
               <p>Q. you missed your watch at the time the candle was gone out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave an alarm, and said you had lost your watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, the prisoner, Mason, brought a light up, did not she? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently you had an opportunity of examining whether it was gone or not? - A. How could I when I was alone, and all these people beating me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When the candle was brought up, was the watch there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. How long have you been from sea? - A. Between eight and nine weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. You know this is an indictment for a burglary, and that there is a reward of forty pounds for each of these women? - A. I do not know what the law is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you have never heard there is a reward of forty pounds on conviction for a burglary? - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not sent to the prisoners, and said, that if they would give you six or seven guineas, you would not go on with the prosecution, because you knew they had not taken the watch? - A. No, I never did. Mr. Nixon has been with me, and offered me a great deal of money; I said, I would not, because it is against the King and country to do so; it is in the hands of the law now.</p>

             sworn. - On the 24th of April, about ten minutes after ten, I went to bed, the two prisoners and three men came into the room, and broke a piece out of the door with a hammer; I said, O Lord, have mercy upon me, and I had no sooner said so than the door came off the hinges: Upon that the three men all came in and struck me;

             got out of bed, and asked what was the matter; I saw the watch hanging there; then they had a light with them, and one of the men threw the candlestick at me, and that put the candle out; I made my escape out of the room as soon as I could, with my gown and petticoat upon my arm.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable belonging to the Police-Office, Shadwell; On the 25th of April, in the morning, I received information from Wells, that he had been robbed by two women and three men, he mentioned the woman's name that I know very well; I met one of them in the street, and apprehended her; I afterwards went to his lodgings, to see how it was broke open, and there appeared to be a deal of violence at the door; I came again to the mistress of the house, and she delivered this hammer to me, and a knife. I searched the prisoners, but found nothing upon them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where did you find Mason? - A. I think at Mrs. Beaford's.</p>
               <p>Q. The other prisoner you found near the Public-Office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mason's defence. I am an unfortunate woman: this woman of the house always had half-a-crown of me when I had any body with me; I went out to order a pint of beer, and met with this young woman, and asked her to come up and have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230013"></xptr>some salmon; two of the men came up to ask if Elizabeth Harold was at home; I said, I did not know; and just after we heard a noise, and I took a candle to see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called five witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

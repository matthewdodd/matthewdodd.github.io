On Thursday the 4th of January between nine and ten at night I went to a public house the King's Arms, it is now called the Jolly Sailor, to order a pint of beer; it is about one hundred yards from my house; I staid in the house about two minutes. Going home I was stopped by the three prisoners and one who is not taken.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of them before? - No; I never saw either of them in my life before to my knowledge. They were all coming a-breast; the outside one who is not taken, and who is a lad of about thirteen or fourteen years of age struck me on the breast; I asked what it was for; he immediately gave me another blow in the face and said, you bouger take that. I endeavoured to seize him; upon which the three prisoners laid hold of me. Thompson seised me by the hair behind; Henley laid hold of my breast; and Smith laid hold of a silk handkerchief I had on my neck and throttled me so that I could not call out for any assistance. When they had me fast one of them with a knife or some other instrument wounded me in the throat. The wound was in length two inches; there was a knife found upon the man.</p>
               <p>You do not know who stabbed you? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you receive much injury from that wound? - Very great; I am bound up for it now; I have a doctor attending me every day. I cannot eat my victuals on account of it.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoners, are you sure they are the persons who used you in this manner? - Yes. When I was robbed of my handkerchief I called out I was robbed of my handkerchief, and never quitted Henley till by the assistance of a sailor belonging to a privateer I got him into my shop.</p>
               <p>You don't know who took it? -

               <p>When you had crossed the way did you see any of the people there? - Yes; all three of them. The middle one Smith had him by the hair. I saw them the next day at the justice's and knew them directly.</p>
               <p>In what situation was Davis with regard to Smith? - She had hold of him by the hair of his head, the hind part. The man had hold of him by the collar or breast.</p>
               <p>Is that the man you say had hold of him by the breast? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You was not present at this transaction? - No; I went down to Gravel lane, and took a knife from the man; it was all over blood. They told me it was one Mr. Davis had been robbed; I went into his house and saw him all of a gore of blood; Davis could hardly speak. I asked him which was the man; Davis shewed me Henley and said that is the man, and I secured Henley and searched him, and found upon him this knife; I put it in a piece of paper, it has never been out of my custody since (producing a clasp knife all stained over with blood;) his coat was all over blood at the same time. I would have kept his coat to produce in court, but the justice said, as it was cold weather, I had better let him have his coat, and that I might mention it in court. Thompson, when she was going to the watch-house, said to the man, why did not you cut his wheezan over! Smith told them where to find the boy that had done it if they would go after him; they said he was gone to sea.</p>

               <p>I am headborough of St. Paul's Shadwell. I was going home about ten minutes after ten; I heard that Mr. Davis in New Gravel lane had been robbed and his throat cut by two men and some women. I went down to see him; a gentlewoman said she saw two women running up the gardens swearing all the way; they were about thirty yards from me; I followed them, it was a moon light night. I heard at a distance their conversation; they consulted together to go home. I took them both by the back of the neck and took them to Mr. Pigott's, and heard a word drop from the tall one that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100018"></xptr> other had something about her. I searched her and found upon her this handkerchief all over blood. (producing it)</p>
               <p>What was the conversation? - One said to the other, d - n your eyes don't go back; if they fix you, you will be done. I don't know which said that.</p>
               <p>Why did she make use of that expression? - That I cannot take upon me to say; they said together, d - n your eyes if you go back you will be fixed; they will do you. One said her dear fellow was fixed and she would go back and see what was become of him. The other persuaded her not to go back.</p>
               <p>Who had the handkerchief? - Smith had it in her side pocket. I took it down to Davis and shewed it him while the surgeon was with him.</p>
               <p>Is it bloody now? - Yes; and my hands were all stained with it when I took it out of her pocket.</p>

               <p>HENLEY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I belong to a privateer, the Greyhound Cutter. I was coming on shore at Execution Dock. I went down that day and entered on board a man of war; I came on shore at night, and coming down New Gravel lane I met these two women and a little lad with them. I knew nothing of them before; I knew the boy, he was at sea with me on board the Resolution man of war. This lad happened to know me and asked me how I did; we had a few words together; he asked me to give him something to drink. I went down with them and treated them with a pot of purl. They all three went out of the house together; I staid behind and had a glass of gin to myself; after I came out I heard some screaming with these two women and that gentleman. I ran up and when I came up, he had knocked Thompson down; I said, is it not a shame to see a woman knocked down in this manner. Davis and Thompson were in an affray together; I saw him strike her on the head several times when she was down. I asked him how he could serve a woman so? He said he would serve me the same, and came and catched hold of me; then there was an affray between Davis and I, we both fought together; I thought I was not to stand to be struck by him without resenting it. Then the boy who was with them came between Davis and me; he caught fast hold of me after he got the cut; and would not let me go. I believe the boy gave him the cut, because he bragged of it when he went home and shewed the knife.</p>
               <p>SMITH's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>That is not the knife that is produced; I know the knife, it was a broad pointed one with a crack in the handle. We sent Forrester after the boy and they would not go to take him. In the skirmish this good man knocked the young woman down; I went to take up her hat and he pushed me down; I lost my handkerchief and cap; I picked up his handkerchief instead of my own; being wet I put it into my pocket; I picked it off the flag stones. In the alehouse they asked me where my handkerchief was? I said it was in my pocket; Pagitt said, search her she has something that is not her own; they pulled the handkerchief out of my pocket; when I saw it was bloody I was amazed, knowing it was not my own. I never saw the man before in my life.</p>
               <p>THOMPSON's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As this young woman and a little boy and I were coming up New Gravel lane we met this young man; the little boy said he had been to sea with that young man; he asked him whether he would give him any thing to drink, for he had no money. We went into a publick house in New Gravel lane and had a pot of purl. This young woman and the little boy and I came out together and left Henley behind. We came about half a dozen doors from the publick house; that gentleman the prosecutor snatched my hat off my head; I asked him what that was for; he asked me whether I did not like it; I said I did not as I had given him no offence. He made no more to do but pushed me down. I holloa'd out, and this young man came up; as he was coming by I was crying and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100019"></xptr> saying, O! Lord I have lost my hat that I gave seven shillings for yesterday! this young man said, who has done it?

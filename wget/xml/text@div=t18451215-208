I was on duty in Bell-alley, Goswell-street, and saw the prisoner with another man—the prisoner was carrying these four paper parcels—I watched and followed them to No. 11, Parson's-court, Bell-alley—they both went in there, and 1 followed them in—I asked the prisoner where the parcels were—he said, "What parcels?"—he had not got them then—I looked round and saw them in a large basket close to the door—I took the prisoner into custody—the other man ran away—the prisoner said he wished I had taken the other man; that he had gone up to the West-end with him in the morning, and in Long-acre he had given him the parcels to carry.</p>

On the 23d of December I went out between twelve and one o'clock - I locked the door. and had the key in my pocket. I left both the back and front window fastened down. I returned at half-past one o'clock, found the door locked as I had left it, and on entering saw the back window was thrown on the bed; a pane of glass was cut out of the window. I missed the articles stated in the indictment. The back window opens into the yard. The street door is kept shut, but can be opened outside; there is a dog in the yard, and his chain reaches to the window. I found the dog ill. I had folded some pieces of cotton in the window, and have seen some of those pieces since.</p>

            . I was servant at the Golden Harp public-house, Phoenix-street. On the 23d of December, after one o'clock, I remember two persons coming to the house - one had a bundle and the other a basket; the bundle seemed to be patch-work - the one who had the bundle called for a pint of beer, and as I took the beer in they covered the bundle up; the man who carried it went away without his change - he gave me 1s. for the beer. After they were both gone I found some pieces of cotton under the seat. The prisoner is not one of those men.</p>

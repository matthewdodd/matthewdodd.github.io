               <p>Prisoner's counsel. I understand your observation was instantaneous? - Two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Can you state with any accuracy at all as to the situation of the flask at that time? -</p>
               <p>One half of the flask had the pattern shillings on it, which he scraped off with his hands on the table.</p>
               <p>How many were there on it? - I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>Were they laid on it, or impressed into it? - I apprehend them to be impressed into it, they were dented in; most of these that were not thrown out have impressions on them, either on the one side or the other.</p>
               <p>You cannot say that there was any impressions made on that sand? - I only say that the shilling was pressed into the sand, I cannot say what was imprinted on that sand.</p>
               <p>Court. I wish you to explain to me a little more the situation. - The two windows are close together, one happened to be open, which was the window of the first garret, so that my head was close to them; the windows are parallel, the wooden partition did not at all take from the sight, the partition was so thin that my head reached beyond the partition; I was looking through that partition while my brother was breaking the door.</p>

               <p>Court. You have been employed about fifteen years for the Mint, be so kind to explain to us the process that these people use in coining of silver. - This spray is laid into the other, and by the side of this they fix any thing that is to be cast, and they are sometimes laid double, and that is filled full of sand, and crushed down, and that makes the impression; then they throw it to the other side; then there is what they call<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040106"></xptr> facings, which is of a stronger nature, as the sand is of a porous nature: they make a little channel from each, (that is it) and they run it the same as I would dumps: if it was filled full of sand, I call it a flask or mould ready for casting, they are flasks till they are compleat to make the impression, then they are called moulds: (some shillings shewn to him.) these have been cast in sand, and filed round with scouring paper, and then they put them into aqua fortis: this is aqua fortis and water, which they are first put in: the aqua fortis being a strong body, it purges the silver on the outside, and leaves a stain; there has been metal put into this aqua fortis and water: here is sand, patterns, flask, aqua fortis, scouring paper, every thing is as compleat as can be; it only wants a fire to melt the metal: I did see a lump of metal in one of the pots that has been melted, here it is, this is silver and copper; there is a piece of white arsenic, this is a poison, and it has been proved in this court, that when they melt the copper, it is fluxed by this, then they throw it into water, and then it becomes almost like a tutenage.</p>

               <p>I was afraid of being arrested, and I came to lodge with this other man; I told him I was in a dilemma, and he said I might stay there for a few days.</p>
               <p>To Gates. Was there any lighted fire? - No there was not, there was a large quantity of charcoal, but it was not a-light.</p>

               <p>He says I opened my eyes; he stood over the bed with a hanger over me, it was enough to make a man open his eyes.</p>

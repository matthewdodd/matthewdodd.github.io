On the 28th of October we received a package from Wales, in which the gold chain was inclosed; the 28th of October being Friday, we are in the habit of setting our accounts in the accompting house early in the afternoon, it is the prisoners department to shut up the shutters. On Saturday evening he came into the accompting house again, and the chain was left on the desk; on Friday we looked for the chain it could not be found; the prisoner had been applied to whether he had found such a thing, he said no, he had been looking among the dirt and could not find it. Some weeks after a gold broach, ring, and pin, had been sent in by one of the workmen, was missing the prisoner received them of the workman that brought them he always brought word that the workman had brought them in and when the prisoner was asked for them; he said he knew nothing of them From these suspicions we were induced to have the prisoner searched, in his box we found duplicates of these articles.</p>

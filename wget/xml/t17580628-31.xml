            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in St. Martin's-lane; the prisoner at the bar came with a mug to me to pawn; on the 6th of this instant, between six and seven in the evening, he was very much in liquor, he asked two guineas upon it. I asked him if it was his own, he gave me no answer. I stopp'd him and the mug. I saw on the mug the Thistle and Crown; so I went to Mr. Owen's and asked him if he had lost a mug, he said he had, (produced in court and deposed to.)</p>

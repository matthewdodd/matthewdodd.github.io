                  </hi>. I live in John-street. On the 11th of March I was at the Mechanic's Institute public-house, in Circus-street, Maryle-bone—I came to the front of the bar—the prisoner and another person came in—the prisoner said, "Halloo, <hi rend="italic">old chap</hi>, how are you?"—he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> me under the chin, and I felt a snatch from my scarf—I caught the prisoner's hand with my pin in it—I told him that would not do—I then cast my eye to ray friend Kettle's scarf, and saw his pin was gone—I told him so—the pri<lb></lb>soner had been there about two minutes before my pin was gone—I took it from his hand—he said, "You do not think I meant to take it?"</p>

            , JUN. I am between seven and eight years old, and live with my father, William Sapsworth, at No. 22, Coalharbour-street. On the 2d of June, I was in <placeName id="t18290611-367-crimeloc1921">Birdcage-fields, near Bethnal-green</placeName>

               <p>WILLIAM SAPSWORTH, SEN. My son left my house between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and went to play in the fields with his brother, who is about two years old - he goes to church and to school; he had a dark sealskin cap on when he left home - I was informed his cap was taken; I went into the fields, and he was there crying- the cap has not been found; I am a labourer in the East-India Company's service.</p>
               <p>ROBERT YOUNG. I am thirteen years old, and live with my father, who is in the Customs. I go to Finsburychapel; I can say the commandments and catechism - God will punish people who tell lies; I was in Birdcage-fields, on the 2d of June, and saw the prisoner: I had seen him before in the fields with other boys; I was sitting by the side of Sapsworth, and saw the prisoner take hold of him, and swing him round - he fell to the ground, and he took the cap off his head, and ran off with it; I ran after him, but he got out of my sight - I gave information to the constable, and he was taken on the 4th of June, near some fields; a sailor boy was with him - he said, "Good by, Tom;" I said, "That is the boy who stole the cap;" I ran and called the prosecutor and the constable, and they took him.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ROGERS. I am thirteen years old, and live with my parents. If I take an oath, I am bound to tell the truth; I was in the fields, and saw Sapsworth and his brother sitting down - the prisoner knocked him down, took his cap off, and ran across the hill with it.</p>

            . I am a constable, and live close to these fields; I received information, and went to Birdcage-fields, and saw the prisoner running away from Mr. Sapsworth - I ran round and caught him; I told him the charge; he said, "I am not the one;" I found a pair of scissors on him - he told the Magistrate he was not the boy who took the cap, but knew the boy who did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. George, an accountant at Moorgate Chambers, Finsbury Place—he is trustee to Goodwin's estate, which is in liquidation—the prisoner is a possession man, and had nothing to do with Goodwin's estate—he was often at my office, and was sometimes there alone—he had no right to meddle with the papers in Goodwin's case—I did not employ him to collect any money in Goodwin's estate from the persons who owed money—a list of the debtors had been made, and was placed on the table—he had an opportunity of seeing it—I missed it in July—I wrote to Parsons, Edgell, and Gibbs, asking them for the money—I received this paper from Mrs. Parsons. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "6th July, 1878. Received of Mr. J. Parsons, Agnes Street, Silvertown, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in full demand of Goodwin's claim in liquidation A. H. P., for Mr. George.")—I must have seen the prisoner after the 6th July—he never acknowledged receiving the money—he had no authority from me to receive it—these two papers are in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "July 8, 1878, Silvertown. Enclosed you will find 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of stamps, to be struck off my debt, and the balance I will send you in a fortnight's time, if all is well." Directed to Mr. George, and signed "Gibbs.") I never saw that letter enclosing the stamps, and never heard of their being sent—I did not authorise the prisoner to receive three shillings' Worth of stamps from Mr. Gibbs—he never accounted to me for them—this other receipt is in his writing: "<hi rend="italic">Re</hi> Goodwin, 11.7.78. Received, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. A. H.

I have been clerk to Mr. George since January—I am the only clerk at present—he had other clerks during the year—the prisoner was not a clerk to my knowledge—I managed all the business that Mr. George did not manage himself, and I am as well acquainted with it as he is—I knew him before I became his manager—he was trustee under the liquidation of my estate before I went into his employ—that was in 1877—the prisoner was possession man to go in under liquidations and receiver<lb></lb>ships—he first went into Mr. George's employ in April or May—he was not so when I went there, but was possession man when I went—that is all he was employed for—I did not hear Mr. George examined at the police-court—I was ordered out of Court—the prisoner only acted twice as possesion man—he was in possession of two shops at the same time, and that is the only occasion—I mean to say that he was not a clerk in the office at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he assisted me on one occasion in the office, and it may have been two, in preparing statements of affairs, but he never prepared them himself—he has answered some letters—I said at the police-court that he</p>

When I liquidated I received my immediate discharge from my creditors—if we had a meeting, and the prisoner was waiting for a job, I would ask him to assist me, but he was not paid for that work—he never did any work in preparing statements or answering, letters, or any employment as a clerk—he had no time for coming to the office—sometimes I did not see him for two or three days—he might turn up at 10 o'clock or at 1 o'clock—he stopped as long as it suited his own convenience, not ours—he never acted in the semblance of a clerk, except as I have spoken of—when</p>

               <p>he went to Leicester a meeting of creditors was called at the White Hart; the debtor himself got intoxicated, struck Mr. George, and smashed my hat—a bill was presented to me, and I refused to pay, and have always refused—I received more injury there than I did benefit to the hotel—I think they were all drunk together—they did not present the united bill to me—there was no reason why I or Mr. George should pay it—nothing leads me to suppose that Mr. George owed the prisoner money, and was unable to pay him—there is no truth in the suggestion as far as I know—I have found out since this affair that the prisoner has collected money <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Carver's—it was a very small amount—he had no authority to do so.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I swear that the prisoner was noting an active part in the management of Carver's affairs, he did not manage the business that I am aware of—I did not consult him as to any arrangement between the debtor and the trustee—I did not beg him to impress upon Mr. Carver the necessity of meeting me at my office and bringing the amount of cash, the amount of which the prisoner himself knew—I cannot tell you whether I wrote to him: "Dear Sir,—I am sorry I could not go to Forest Gate on Saturday to meet Carver, you, and Lawrence, but the fact is, I was unavoidably detained in town till 8.30, and did not return till 11 o'clock." I very likely wrote: "I write Carver by this post to meet me on Tuesday, by 2 o'clock, when, if he brings a purchaser with, him with the necessary cash, the amount of which you know, I can then settle the purchase, "I very likely went on: "Please see him the first thing in the morning and impress upon him that to-morrow is the last day." I mean to say that that man was nothing but a possession man—I also wrote a postscript—no doubt I wrote to him in the matter of Hagar if you have got it there "Also impress upon Hagar that unless he gets the money to settle with the three creditors the case will fall through." I cannot remember the letters unless you show them to me—I wrote hundreds of letters—there is no pretence for saying that I owe the prisoner a salary as my clerk—I have not brought my diary or cash-book here or a draft statement of my affairs in Gale's liquidation—I had notice to produce them last night at my office in Finsbury Place, but they are at Leytonstone—I did not go there last night—I could have done so—the cash-book and diary are at my office—I was there this morning—there is no entry in my diary about the receipt of cash in Carver's case—it is not entered because it has not been given to us—the diary is not made up with reference to Carver's case—I have not been ordered for contempt of Court to pay over 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had received on an estate in my hands—Mr. Beard is here and he asked me some absurd question—if I had been ordered to pay 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. It is an invariable custom to make an order to trustees to pay over money, and if the money is handed over there is no commitment—there was an order in the regular manner such as is always made—there was nothing exceptional about it—I was asked some questions like these at the police-court—I have not seen anything like such an order or copy of an order purporting to come from the Bankruptcy Court—if such an order had been made the original would be on the files of the Court—Mr. Beard gave me the notice to produce my books last night before we left this Court—this matter was before the Magistrate on, I think, August 10th, since when I have been constantly in communication with the solicitor on the other side, but received no notice to produce the books till yesterday—the prisoner has only been my man in possession in two cases, and they were within two doors of each other, a butcher and a baker—he did nothing more than receive the money.</p>

I bought half a pint of nuts, some of them fell; I stooped to pick them up, and in the interval the bundle was gone. The prisoner Smith was going out at the door when I missed it - she had just got up from me. I followed her into the yard; she went into the privy. Lowe stood in the yard with my bundle down by her side - I asked what she did with it; she said it was not mine, it was her friend's who was in the privy. I took it up; she held it, insisting that it was not mine. Vann and Waters came, and took her - she would not part with it till then. I had seen her drinking with Smith.</p>

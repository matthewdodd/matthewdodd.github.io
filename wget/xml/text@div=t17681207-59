I was in the Hall, and by the behaviour of the prisoner I thought him to be a pickpocket: he followed this gentleman very close, and made several attempts at the handkerchief, before he could get it out; I was close by him: and by the motion of his arm, I imagined he put it in the fore part of his breeches. Then he was making away out of the great door; as soon as he had past by me, I clapt my hand upon the prosecutor's shoulder; and said, have you lost your handkerchief; he felt, and said, he had: I said follow me: and we took the lad before he got out of the hall door, he had the handkerchief in his breeches.

I should have no objection to taking him again if I wanted a servant. I have heard he has been two months in the hospital since he left me.</p>

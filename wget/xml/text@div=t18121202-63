               <p>Q. On Thursday, the 22d of October, did Cox receive any rigging on board the Medway from the Lord Forbes - A. We received it from the Lord Forbes at the East India docks, and we were going with the rigging to Ashton's wharf, Blackwall.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, as you were going along did Cox do any thing with any part of the rigging that you had from out of the Lord Forbes - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received the Lord Forbes rigging where did you put it - A. In the main hold, and on our way to Ashton's wharf, Cox removed some of it from the main hold into the fore peak, and he bid me to assist him. I said, master, does this belong to you. He said, yes, it was given to him by a person. I am sure it all came from the Lord Forbes. We got to Ashton's wharf about four o'clock in the afternoon, and after she was moored Cox went on shore. I staid on board all night. Cox came on board the next morning at five o'clock, and between five and six Mr. Bellamy's man and son with a horse and cart, and the rigging that was put in the fore peak we put on shore, and from there into the cart, and the cart was drove off. In about three quarters of an hour after, I saw Mr. Walker; he came about these things.</p>

               <p>Q. What does your master deal in - A. Marine stores. I heard Cox say he had some rope and rubbish. I knew Cox was a lighterman in Mr. Grainger's employ. On the next morning, when the horse was in the cart, my master told me I had better take some string to tie the rubbish up. He told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020050"></xptr>me to go with the cart. I went to Ashton's wharf.</p>

            . I am one of the Thames police surveyors. On the 23d of October, between six and seven in the morning, I met with Bellamy's cart near Bellamy's house; in the cart was about six hundred pounds weight of rope. I stopped the cart, and sent for Bellamy. He came to me. I asked him how he got that rope; had he any document to shew for it. He said, if I go to his house he would shew me. I went with him to his house. He turned over a number of papers. He said, he had no document for this present transaction. I told him, I would go down to Ashton's wharf. He said, he would go with me. He went with me. I asked him a great many questions about the rope. He said, he had got the rope from Cox, the lighterman. He told me that Cox said he had got some old shakings and old shakings and old stuff, instead of being old stuff it is serviceable rope. He then said, if he had known it had been such rope as that he would not have sent for it.</p>

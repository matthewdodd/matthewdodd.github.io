             sworn. - I am a constable of St. John's Westmintler: On the 10th of October, about eight in the morning, I was at Kensington, and at the west end of the town: the prisoners passed me, one of them I had a suspicion of, Leonard, he had a bag under his arm, and Thompson had got something tied up in a smock frock; I let them pass me, and then followed them; I said to Burnham, you are the man, I believe, that brings fowls to town; he said, no; I told him, I suspected he had some about him; I searched their bundles, and found, upon Burnham, eight fowls, and upon Leonard, three.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not found the owner? - A. No; I have advertised them. Burnham said, that he and another man, not in custody, and Leonard, had taken these fowls from a gentleman's house, near three miles below Brentford.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to him to induce him to confess? - A. At that time he was charged with another robbery, and I believe he was induced to say so, because he thought the other prosecution would be set aside, if he owned this; but the Magistrate told him, he would give him no hope of it.</p>
               <p>Leonard's defence. We were employed by a man to carry them to the White-horse cellar; I had not been able to get any employment.</p>
               <p>Burnbam's defence. A man employed us to carry them to town; I never saw the man before in my life.</p>
               <p>Both <rs id="t17981024-52-verdict279" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Justice HEATH.</p>

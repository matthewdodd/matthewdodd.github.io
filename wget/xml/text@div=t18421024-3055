                  </hi>. I live at Woolwich. On Sunday morning last I missed a pair of trowsers from my bed-room—I had placed them there on the Wednesday and had not taken any notice of them afterwards—these are them—the prisoner lodged within about twenty yards of me.</p>

I was passing Mr. Booth's, the pawnbroker's door, and saw the prisoner standing outside—he told me to go in and see if the man was writing out the duplicate for the woman—I went in and he was (I had seen Boxer go into the shop)—when she came out I saw her deliver some silver and a ticket into his hand.</p>

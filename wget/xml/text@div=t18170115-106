             has part of my business - He is not my husband's executor. I have had no fresh agreement with my landlord since my husband's death, it is only an agreement among ourselves. I am a weaver, the prisoner worked for me, and on the 17th of January I lost the articles stated in the indictment out of my bed-room - He worked just by the bed-room, they were safe an hour before; the prisoner left my house a little before seven o'clock in the evening, he had only been at work one hour; there was work for him all day if he had come to do it.</p>
               <p>MARK GRAHAM. I am in business with my mother; my things were taken from the room above where the prisoner worked. I have seen them since at Mr. Sowerby's</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SOWERBY. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Brick-lane. On the 17th of January a coat was pledged at my shop, and on the 18th I took in a counterpane, it was pawned by a woman in the name of Davis; Graham claimed them.</p>
               <p>JAMES GRAHAM. I am the son of Mrs. Graham. On the 17th of January, while my mother was at tea, I let the prisoner in, he went up stairs into the workshop.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. On Friday, the 20th of January, I stopped the prisoner, at eleven o'clock in the morning, in White Horse-lane, Mile-end, he had a bag with him; I told him that I was an officer, and asked him what was in the bag; he said, he was my prisoner, and surrendered. The bag contained the skirt of a gown,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150049"></xptr>one cloak, one sheet, and two pair of pantaloons, Mr. and Mrs. Graham afterwards claimed them. He said that he had stolen them, and begged me to let him go. I found the duplicate of a coat, pledged on the 17th of January at Sowerby's, on him, I went there and found the coat.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

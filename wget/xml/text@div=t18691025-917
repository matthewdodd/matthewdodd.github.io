I am the wife of James Collier, of 44, Cornwall Street, and am sister to the prosecutrix—the prisoner came therein Sunday morning, 12th September, about 9 o'clock, just as we were sitting down to breakfast—I heard him ask my mother if she would allow my sister to go home, and he would behave better to her—mother said, never with her consent, in regard of his not giving her sufficient to eat—he asked my sister whether she was of the same opinion as my mother—she said yes, for she did not think he would ever behave any better—he said, "Try me once more"—I had his child in my arms, and put it down against the door, and he took it up and kissed it, and nursed it several moments—I called to my mother, and told her not to leave the two together, for he looked rather wild—I was going up the stairs, and I heard my sister say, "Oh!"—I came down, and mother said, "He has struck her with a knife"—my sister was then making her way to the front door, and he was coming towards her again, with the knife open in his hand, when I shut him in the kitchen, and kept him there—my sister was bleeding—I held the door and called to my husband to come down, but he would not, and I opened the kitchen door again, the prisoner <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> down hw neck handkerchief, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at 273, Cable Street—about 10 o'clock on the morning of 12th September I was called to 44, Cornwall Street, and saw both prosecutrix and prisoner—he had two wounds in the middle of his throat—one was superficial, injuring the skin only—the other was deeper and of longer extent, and was bleeding profusely, that was perhaps half an inch deep—I stopped the hemorrhage—I had him removed to the hospital—I did not notice any wound on his chest at that time—he did not complain of any—I subsequently examined his chest and found three marks—I could not give an opinion whether they were self inflicted or not—the prosecutrix had received a stab immediately over the collar bone—I should think the blow would have come strongly on the bone, because the covering of the bone was divided—this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would came such a wound—when I first saw the knife it was lying open on the table—the plaintiff had possession of it—the prosecutrix's wound has healed favorably—it might have been serious—there is always danger where the covering of the bone is injured—I should not call it a dangerous wound—it was of very slight extent—it was in a part that is dangerous—if it had misted the collar bone it would have been a very serious matter—it is just possible it might have been caused in a struggle—I should infer, however, that it had been done with some force.</p>

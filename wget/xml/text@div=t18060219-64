On the 21st of January, he came to my house to lodge, he had the two pair of stairs back room furnished, he took the place weekly, at three shillings per week, and he was to breakfast with me, and to settle with me for it at the end of the week; he went away on the 24th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you notice of his dislike to the lodgings, and that he meant to go. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time miss any part of your property and when. - A. On the 24th I missed my property; when he came to the lodging he said that he was a gentleman, and had a law suit in town, that he resided in Paddington, and it was too far for him to go up to his family of a night.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you missed from any part of your house any property. - A. On the 24th the sheets was missing, I did not miss the money till between ten and eleven o'clock, I was going to bed, I found my door unlocked; my wife told me about three o'clock the sheets were gone, when I came home, and the money was missing from my drawers, which stood of one side of my bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you had locked this drawer on the 24th. - A. I am certain of it, I went to the drawers that morning, and took five guineas out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the key of the drawers. - A. I always keep them, I saw no alteration in the drawer, except it was unlocked, it had not been opened by force.</p>
               <p>Q. What property did you leave in the drawer. - A. Sixty three guineas, two ten pound notes, and a one pound note; when I looked in the drawer, I found it was all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What room do you sleep in. - A. The one pair of stairs front room.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the prisoner could have no business there. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. His was the two pair of stairs back room. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not miss any rasors at any time. - A. Yes, a case of rasors; I believe these rasors were in the same room, they were either in my room or his room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner ever borrowed them of you to make use of them. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever return to your house again. - A. No, I never saw him from that time till the 3d of February, when I saw him in the House of Correction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your money, notes, or rasors, again. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there any more lodgers in the house. - A. Yes, one; he slept in the same room with Mr. Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Thompson. - A. The prisoner at the bar took the lodgings in the name of Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of your lodger. - A. Mr. Brooker, he lodges with me still.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw this man in the House of Correction did you say any thing to him. - A. I said how do you do Mr. Thompson; he says you have the advantage of me, I do not know you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with taking this property. - A. Yes, I asked him if he knew where he lodged on 21st of January, and where he left on the 24th, he said he did not know any thing of that, he had only been two or three days from the country, he did not know the town at all; he knew me extremely well the following day, when he came up to Hatton-Garden.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to prosecutor. Did you not say before the magistrate (I dare say it is in the deposition) that you did not recollect whether you had locked the room door or the drawer. - A. I said I was not sure, whether I had locked the door, I am sure I had locked the drawer.</p>
               <p>Court. In your deposition it says, that the key you now hold in your hand, and which is the key of the drawer, of which he is not certain that he locked it or not; therefore before the magistrate you were not certain whether you locked the drawer or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. From the time that I came to breakfast was I ever out of your presence. - A. Yes, during the time you went to write a letter, I asked you whether you was going out at that moment, you said stop for a moment, as you was going to write, and you asked for pen and ink, you was some time up stairs, I waited below for you.</p>
               <p>Court. (to prosecutor) Did you go out of the house while he was up stairs. - A. No, I waited for him a quarter of an hour, thinking he was writing a letter all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You was then upon your oath when you was before the magistrate, you was not certain whether you locked the drawer or not. - A. I am sensible that I had locked the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you more sensible now than you was on the 4th of February. - A. Perhaps they mistook what I said.</p>
               <p>Q. No, it was not a mistake, they read it over to you again; had you more than one servant in the house. - A. Yes, two, both maid servants, one of them is about ten or eleven years of age, and the other about twenty, they both live with me now.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the day was it that you took out the five guineas. - A. About nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he represent who he was, and where he lived. - A. Yes, he said he lived at Paddington, and had a little business in town; he said he was very ill, it was too much for him to walk back at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him when he was in the House of Correction. - A. Yes, my husband was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you. - A. Yes, and he begged my husband's pardon for not knowing him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him respecting this charge of the notes. - A. No, I did not know of the money being gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your husband or yourself usually lock the bed room door when you leave it in the morning. - A. I lock it myself, I generally get up last; I gave my husband the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you do not know whether he locked the drawers or not. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the drawers that day, after your husband took out the five guineas. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the bed room door was locked after your husband took out the money. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the bed room after the prisoner left the house. - Q. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing missing. - A. Yes, the sheets from his bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up into your bed room. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Brooker, that lodged in the same room with the prisoner, lodge with you still. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner (to prosecutrix) Did I not breakfast with you on the 24th. - A. Yes, you did.</p>
               <p>Q. I think your husband and Mr. Davis were present, Mr. Davis was exceeding troublesome and riotous; did not you say to me that your husband and Mr. Davis was intoxicated. - A. No, my husband was not intoxicated, I never saw them drink any more but one glass of rum and water, which you tasted.</p>

               <p>Court. Who kept the key of the drawer where the money was. - A. My husband, the key of my bed room I kept; I gave him the key of the door, not of the drawer.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHAPMAN sworn. I am an officer of Hatton Garden. On Tuesday the 28th of January, in the City Road, I met 
               <persName id="t18060219-64-person660">Vaughan</persName>
             the prisoner, and Mrs. Hill's daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take charge of him respecting any thing of this business. - A. No, I searched him, I found nothing that belonged to this case, I found about half a crown on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Any Bank notes. - A. Nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to lodge at the prosecutor's house at the time he mentioned, and came away also at the time he mentioned, I agreed to breakfast there; I staid there till the 24th, I got up in the morning to breakfast along with the man's wife, I never went out of the parlour, only through the parlour, I read the newspaper before I went out of the house; their house happens to be a very inferior, low public house, the tap is forward; and the parlour is backwards, you cannot see any one go up stairs, any one can go up stairs, without their seeing them, and they are very seldom any where but in the parlour; when I was there I saw a man of the name of Davis have five or six glasses of rum and water, they were intoxicated, they threw the toast about; the woman said he is drunk and mad, and my husband also; he is extremely riotous when he is drunk, but he is a good customer, we may charge him what we please. I never went up stairs, nor went any where except reading the paper, and then I was not out of their presence; they pressed me to drink, I said I never drink of a morning, he said it was not friendly if I did not drink with them, I stopped about five minutes in the tap room; after I went out I had an account of the death of my daughter at Salisbury, I was obliged to go to Windsor about the funeral, I did not return to London for three days; when I was apprehended not a farthing was found upon me, I was in a very distressed state indeed, as I am at this present time; it is not likely that if I had twenty-one pounds in Bank notes, that I should be in this distressed state, there was no duplicates found upon me; I declare most solemnly I was not in the room. I never took a note out of it, nor did I know where the money was.</p>

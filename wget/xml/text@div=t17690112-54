               <p>Bavin. This was about half an hour past nine o'clock at night. I had a hanger in my hand. I told him I had no stick. Immediately he catched me by my throat, and demanded my money. His words were, Give us your money; at the same time the other presented a pistol to my breast, and said, Or your life. I think there were three of them. I told them I had but a few halfpence, and gave them to Williams. Then Williams searched my pocket, and took out three or four shillings; he then snatched the hanger out of my left-hand, and gave it to the other. Then he asked me if that was all; I said it was. He then said, give me your togue; I think that was the word; meaning my great coat (as I thought by his taking hold of it by the sleeve); he pulled it off, and then wished me a good night. There were a pair of black gloves in my pocket. They went off towards London. The next morning I went to Sir

               <p>Prosecutor. That was a mile farther on the Brentford road.</p>

I told him I had none; adding, Look in my pocket. They both did. They took two handkerchiefs from my coat pocket, two books, and my great coat. It was a Pompadour Bath great coat. There was a paper snuff-box in one pocket. Williams took my coat, and the other man took the other things. I do not know the other man that was with him. After that a friend told me there was something in the Gazetteer. As soon as I saw it, I went to Justice Spinnage's office. The Justice said to me, You have been robbed of a great coat and snuff-box. This was about ten days after I had been robbed, which was on a Thursday, and on the Saturday after I went again: there I saw my coat and box. The Justice asked me if I should know the men that robbed me? I saw Williams: I then said, Lam sure he is one of the men that robbed me. (The coat and box produced in court, and deposed to.) But I could not swear to the other person, because he was behind me when I was robbed; but Williams was before me, and spoke to me. There was a pistol lying on the table, I knew that too.</p>

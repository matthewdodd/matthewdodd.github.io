The prisoner was in my service three or four months, as journeyman baker—he had to carry out bread—on 9th February I found eight half-quartern loaves, tied in a handkerchief and put in a tub in which yeast was kept—I stuck a piece of wood into the crumb of the bread, and covered them over as before—at a little before six o'clock, after he had accounted to me for the bread he had taken out, I called him, and found he was out—he ought not to have been out—I then went to the tub and missed the bread—I went out, and saw him going towards Deptford with a basket—I saw him untie a handkerchief, put it in his pocket, and leave the bread in the basket—he went towards Blackhorse-bridge, and stopped at one of my customers with two half-quartern loaves—seeing a policeman, I called out, "I have caught you at last"—he said, "Oh Sir, if you will forgive me I will give you all I have got"—I found some flour on him as well—I gave him in charge—he said he had only been doing it that week—the bread had been ordered by the customer—the policeman found the wood in the bread.</p>

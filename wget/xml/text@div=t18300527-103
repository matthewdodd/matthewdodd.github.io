            . I took up the prisoner on the 20th of April - I told him it was for pawning a shawl - he said he had done no such thing; that he had pawned a waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I said I would not go without having some judgment about it - I thought it was Smith's; I slept four nights at the prosecutor's, and gave my bundle at the bar - on the Monday, when I was going to bed, there were four sailors in the room I used to sleep in; next morning I asked for my bundle, and on going down the street I met Smith - we went to a public-house; she said she wanted to pawn the shawl, and asked me to take it - I said, "Why can't you take it yourself?" but I went- I brought the money to her, and she d-d her eyes, she would not have it; she wanted to get breakfast for a sailor chap - she then took me down the street to another gin-shop - I then took the shawl to the other pawnbroker; he asked if it was my own, and I believe I did say it was my wife's - I then went to the prosecutrix, and I was ashamed to tell her I had been with this girl, but I told Peter, the waiter, of it, and said, "Go, and see if it is Mrs. Gill's shawl."</p>
               <p>MRS. GILL. I believe he did take away his bundle, but I was not at home then nor when he returned - I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270048"></xptr>known him four years, and known him to bear a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 30, Princes Street, Lisson Grove, and am a dress-maker—I know the prisoner and his wife—I had left 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with Mrs. Tayon—on Monday, 3rd August, between 10.30 and 11 o'clock in the morning I went to the prisoner's house to see a young girl named Ellen, who was lodging there—the prisoner opened the door—I asked him if I could see Ellen—he asked me to come in—I went into the passage, he went</p>

               <p>into the parlour and got a piece of lead with a string to it tied round his finger, and a bottle with some stuff in it—he struck me on the nose with the lead, and threw the stuff out of the bottle over me, it went on my jacket and dress; none of it came on my face or hands, I was not burnt at all—he then seized me by the throat and dragged me into the parlour, and threw some more stuff over me from the same bottle—he said he would kill me before I went out of the house—he struck me on the shoulder with the poker—Mrs. Tayon was in the parlour at the time, no one else—I screamed out "Murder"—some young women and a young man at last broke open the door and got me out of the prisoner's hands—he had got me between the mantlepiece and the cupboard, standing before me with the poker and a knife in his hands—I gave him into custody the same day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licentiate of the College of Physicians, and Divisional Surgeon of Police—this cloak was sent to me on the 3rd by the Magistrate, to ask me what acid had been used to discolour it—I tested it, it is a strong solution of oxalic acid—I have not examined the dress.</p>

My husband is a tobacconist, at sykes-terrace, Mile-end-road—on Monday, 7th January, about half-past 8 o'clock in the evening, Brown came in and asked for half an ounce of tobacco—I weighed it for her, and put it down—she gave me a shilling—I tried it in my detec<lb></lb>tor, bent it, and gave it back to her as bad—she said she did not know it was bad—she went away without the tobacco—this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Very much like the one I bent and gave back to her—I cannot swear to it—it is bent in the same way that I bent the shilling I gave to her.</p>

On the evening of Monday, 7th Jaunary, I and a police-officer, <hi rend="italic">K</hi> 141, were together in the Mile-end-road in plain clothes—I saw the three prisoners in company—I know the tobacco<lb></lb>nist's shop kept by Pennill—I saw them together about fifty yards from that shop—that is in the direction of Mr. Riddle's—I saw them all go up to Riddle's window together, and Brown went in, the other two standing together a few yards out—I saw Brown come out—she went directly to the other two—they all three walked in company from there to the corner of Globe-lane—I saw Brown go into a tobacconist's shop in Globe-lane-Burns remained outside—I took hold of Burns, and told her she had bed passing bad money—White was standing a few yards off, at the corner, in the Mile-end-road—Burns became very violent upon my laying hold of her and she dropped these two shillings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the pavement—I saw them picked up, and they were given to me—she said, "A man gave them me" Brown then came out of the shop, and I secured her upon a charge of passing bad money—White was brought to the station, and on him was found a shilling, two sixpences, and four penny-pieces, good money—one of then sixpences is the coin which was shown to William Street, from whom I got this counterfeit shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—at the station White said, "I known nothing of the women," and the women said, "We don't know each other"—they were all charged with uttering bad money in company, and White said, "I know nothing of the women."</p>

               <p>the three prisoners together—I saw Burns go into the shop while the other two remained outside—she rejoined them and all moved together in com<lb></lb>pany towards Globe-road—I saw the women go down Globe-road, and White remain at the corner—sergeant Copping left me and went after the women; and while he was gone I took White in custody—I collared him, and told him I was going to take him into custody for being concerned with two females in passing bad money—upon that, I saw him put his hand into his right hand side pocket, and throw from his pocket this dog collar behind him—I picked it up—it is the collar that I showed to Street just now—when I picked it up White said, "Some other persons might have thrown it there"—ho said, "I don't know anything of any women."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Whites Defence</hi>. I work in the London Docks; I was taking a walk and met the two females; I spoke to the one that I knew; the other I had never seen before. We went into a public-house, and she gave me a six-pence; I took it and called for something to drink; perhaps that might be the sixpence. I stood at the corner while they went up the turning; I waited till their return, but I never questioned them as to what they were going to do, and they never told me; then the policeman came up and took hold of my hands, and said he would take care I threw nothing away, and then he took me to the station. About a quarter of an hour or ten minutes afterwards Copping came in with the collar, and said, "Here, here is the col-lar," and the other one took it from him. They never said anything about the collar on the first statement, it was only at the second statement they mentioned it. If I had not known this woman, I should not have been in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Leaf and Co., of Old 'Change; they are silk mercers, on a very large scale. On Thursday, 23rd Nov., about half past 1 o'clock, the elder prisoner, Isaac Lowenthall, came to my master's warehouse—there was a man and woman with him—they asked to see some watered silks, and I showed them about half a dozen pieces—one piece of goods was purchased at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—whilst I was showing them the silks, I observed the prisoner Isaac take hold of a piece of silk and hold it up—that had the effect of concealing the action of the woman from me, excepting that I could see she moved and stooped—the prisoner Isaac had been there on the Monday before, and purchased a piece f goods—he did not pay for it then—after these goods were shown to them on the Thursday, and they had purchased one piece, the man and woman went away—the prisoner Isaac remained, and said to me, "Do you know the name of Walker?" and showed me the invoice of the piece of silk he had bought on the Monday before, and which he had paid for in the counting-house on that Thursday morning, before I had shown them any goods—he remained a minute or two after the man and woman had gone away—we</p>

               <p>have a man, named Holland, employed to open the door, and as a sort of guard; and after the man and woman, and Isaac, were gone, I sent for Holland, because I missed a piece of black silk, containing ninety-one yards, which I had on the counter that morning, showing it to Isaac and his two companions—I did not at that time miss any other silk—I did not miss a piece of figured silk till it was shown to me by the police at Guildhall on the following day—those were two of the pieces of silk that I had had on the counter—one was ninety-one yards, the other was sixteen yards—that one had not been shown to them—I know where it was—it was on the counter behind me—I had not occasion to leave the place while Isaac, and the man and woman, were there—how that piece of figured silk went I cannot tell—the woman must have taken it—I was as close to the place where the figured silk was, as I am to this rail—there are two counters; one of them was behind me, and on that counter the figured silk was, and the woman stood behind me—on the following day I saw in the hands of the officer, King, the ninety-one yards of silk that I had missed, and the sixteen yards of figured silk which I did not miss till the officer showed it to me—I know this figured silk to be the property of my employers, because I had a pattern of it, which I took off a day or two before—this is the pattern, and this is the piece of figured silk—they exactly correspond—I know these ninety-one yards of silk by the mark on the paper, and the pencil mark on the piece of goods—the mark on the paper is my writing—it is, "No. 10, 20-inch black ducape"—the value of the two pieces is about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

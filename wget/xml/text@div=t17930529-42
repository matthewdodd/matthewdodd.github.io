Hughes for twenty pounds, I saw one of Mr Coutt's clerks whose name is Charlton, and I received<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290089"></xptr>a twenty pound bank note in exchange; I don't recollect the number of the bank note, when I had received it I returned home, I put the bank note loose into my breeches pocket, I had no pocket book about me at the time.</p>
               <p>Q Had you any other bank note about you at the time? - I had not. When I came home I went through the warehouse to the counting house, part of No. 17, on the ground floor; I took the bank note from my pocket and laid it down on my desk for Mr. Mead to lock it up; the note was first missed on Thursday morning afterward, the bank note was lost on Monday the 15th; the Thursday morning, subsequent to the Monday, which was the 17th or 18th, I called all the servants in the house and enquired of them if they had seen such a thing; I enquired of the prisoner at the bar, as of all the others, if they had seen a note? I told them that a bank note was lost, and I was very much surprised for I never lost any thing before from that place; the prisoner said he had seen nothing of it; the reason I laid it on my desk was, I had not the key of my small iron chest in my pocket, therefore left it for Mr. Mead to take care of it, there was one

             not present when I made this enquiry, he was ill in bed up stairs; I desired the prisoner at the bar to go up to him and ask him if he had seen any thing of it; the prisoner brought down the answer, so far as I can recollect, that Charles had seen nothing of it; I think those were the words.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recover your bank note again? - I received it by order of Mr. Newland from the File at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I think you say that you never lost any thing before? - I would not wish you to press that particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 15th of April you say you went with the draft to Mr. Coutts's? - I am perfectly confident it was of a Monday; and the reason why I remember the circumstance was I was at a funeral on the Monday before, in St. Martin's Church.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether your's is a wholesale or a retail shop? - We consider ours as a wholesale shop, but the doors of the warehouse frequently stand open.</p>
               <p>Q. You laid this bank note on the desk? - I did, and there I left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever the precaution given you of having papers loose in your pocket? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other bank notes on the desk? - Not that I know of; my attention was not drawn to any other.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say, that when you made the enquiry of these servants of your's, the manner in which you made it was, I have lost a bank note from that place; naming the desk, the particular place from whence it was lost? - It certainly was.</p>
               <p>Q. You asked your servants if any body had seen it; you was ignorant of the number at that time, therefore you could only describe it as a twenty pound bank note lost. Do you know a person of the name of Adams? I mean a cobler who lives in your lane? - There is a cobler lives there, but I don't know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. How many years has he lived there? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. He had his seat or stall in Pudding-lane, just by you? - He has a seat or stall close underneath the blacksmith's, opposite Mr. Mead's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who you left in the warehouse at the time you left this bank note on the desk? - Mr. Mead was in the counting house, and I don't know whether all the men were in the warehouse or not.</p>
               <p>Q. The warehouse has communication with the counting house? - It has; when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290090"></xptr>I went out of the counting house I met the prisoner at the bar; I gave him instructions when Charles, one of my men who was out, came home, to go to Mr. Lambert's on Ludgate-hill, that was a little after four o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. You directed your attention to the bank note that lay on the desk? - I did; the number I had not specified, because I had not seen it, it was laying down before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you much pressed with business? - A good deal; but not more than common.</p>
               <p>Q. I find that you forget something that was communicated to you, by your partners; your mind was so much engaged that you forgot to do what you was desired to by your partners.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been cautioned about carrying papers loose in your waistcoat pocket? - I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. In the hurry of business you had forgot to secure this note as your partner had directed; might not the same want of recollection induce you to clap it in your pocket? - Certainly not; I certainly did not do that; I did not lay hold of it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I should think, Mr. Mead, that in the hurry you were in you might possibly have sweeped it off the desk in your motion? - No, it was above the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in such a hurry as to forget one material thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The bank note was on the flat part of the desk above the sloping part? - It was.</p>

            ." And to the best of my knowledge the bank note is dated the 4th of April 179.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Charlton be so good as to tell me how many bank notes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290091"></xptr>you may have paid in the course of six or seven days after? - Some thousands. When I receive a bank note from a gentleman I take the Number and date, but when I pay it away I only put down the number, and I generally pay away the last note I receive first.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore what the date of the note was, whether the year 1791, 1792, or 1793, it is impossible for you to tell? - Not from memory.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you know that the same number occurs in bank notes of different years, therefore a bank note of 1792, may be of the same number of one of the same value, of the year 1793, therefore without the date the number is no criterion to make out the identity? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you pay away those bank notes you take in the course of the day, or those you do not? - In general those we take.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you do pay them away the same day, do you put down the date or only the number of them? - Only the number, because it is the custom of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say then any particular date or number of any note paid away that day? - Yes, we can, by referring to the person's name from whom I received it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you receive this from? - From a person of the name of Gressey.</p>
               <p>Q. Read it? -</p>
               <p>"Monday, 25th April. Received of Mr. Gressey, bank note twenty pounds, No. 4,822, dated 4th April 1793." Both entries are in the same page.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able, by these two entries, to say that the note you paid to Mr. Gordon was the note you received from Mr. Gressey? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Charlton, do you mean to say that you are positive you paid away that identical note you received of Gressey? - To the best of my knowledge, and from the books.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Mead. Have you not learned, that while you was up stairs a quart of oil was sold by some persons in your house? - I cannot tell that.</p>

               <p>Court. What month was it in? - It might be the month of April, or it might not; Mr Smith came in and asked me for to change a twenty pounds bank note; to the best of my knowledge I gave him two ten pound bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you keep the note? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any note of him? - I did; it was a twenty pounds bank note, but as for the number I don't know.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have lived in this man's neighbourhood a long time? - Eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask whether you ever knew an honester man? - Never.</p>

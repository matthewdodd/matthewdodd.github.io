            . I am a bricklayer - the prisoner worked for me. He was cleaning old bricks on the 16th - about four o'clock in the afternoon I went into the waste ground to make some lime-white, and found the cellar door barricadoed with some old doors, which had been over some bricks; I found the cellar door open, and saw the prisoner drinking out of the can - I do not know what was in it; I suspected he had been in the cellar, and on Saturday morning I requested him to call Mr. Rice's servant, and while he was gone I found the can, with about a pint and a half of rum in it - I had asked the day before what he was drinking, and he said water; between eight and nine o'clock the same Saturday afternoon I found him in Rice's cellar - he said he had been for some sand to make morter; I said, "We have no use for morter;" there was no reason for his going there - he denied all knowledge of the can; it was afterwards found buried.</p>

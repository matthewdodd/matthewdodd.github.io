               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, I had seen her twice before; she came into the shop to pass that bad shilling; she came into the shop, and asked for half an ounce of thread, it came to two-pence; she asked me if I could change her a shilling, I told her I could not; she told me it was not of any consequence, she was going over the way to the baker's, and she would bring me the money when she came back; I then told her I would get her change directly; she gave me the shilling; I went to the other end of the shop, and called my master, because I had had a charge before, that whenever that woman came into the shop, to stop her; my master came, and I told him who the person was; my master sent for the beadle; the woman continued in the shop till the beadle came.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What became of the shilling? - A. I delivered that shilling which she gave me into my master's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that it is the same shilling that you received from the prisoner, that you gave to your master? - A. I am positive of it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You keep a haberdasher's shop, in Thames-street? - A. Yes, the last witness is my servant; she called me down in the morning, on the 10th of October, and gave me a bad shilling; she said she took it of the prisoner; I sent her for the beadle, Mr. Comley; I looked at the shilling, I thought it was a bad one; I gave the shilling to Comley. While Comley was sent for, the prisoner said she would change that shilling, she had never offered a bad shilling before; I told her I could not accede to that, for if there were no passers of bad money, coiners would have no employment; when Mr. Comley came, he asked her if she had any more about her; she said, no; he told her then, she would undergo a very strict search, and if she had any, she had better discover it. After that we went up stairs, for the purpose of searching the prisoner; the staircase is dark; I went up stairs first, and opened the right hand door to cast a light on the staircase, and by that means we saw, as she was coming up to the top stair, she made something like a stumble; I saw her hand lay downwards towards the stair, and it gave me an idea that she had dropped something; Mr. Comley was behind, and he said, you had better have dropped this before you came into this house; he picked it up immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Comley pick it up? - A. Yes, he opened it in my presence, and in the prisoner's; it turned out to be seven bad shillings, rolled up with a piece of paper between each shilling; we turned out her pockets, and in her left hand pocket there was a pocket handkerchief, and four-pennyworth of good halfpence; in her right hand pocket were five or six shillings of good silver.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q You are a beadle of Queenhithe ward; were you sent for to Mr. Costen's house? - A. Yes, on the 10th of October; as soon as I came in doors, he said he would give me charge of the prisoner for uttering bad money; I asked the prisoner how she could utter bad money, knowing it to be such; I asked her if she had any other money about her; her reply was, no, she had none of any description; I told her she had better confess, I should minutely search her; Mr. Costen went up stairs first, and opened a door, and on the top stair I saw her put her hand down. I immediately said to her, you should have dropped this before you came into the house; I picked it up, and took her into the room to search her, and found they were seven bad shillings; they were rolled up in one piece of paper, with the paper between every shilling to prevent friction; I told her I thought it would bring her to some bad end. In her left hand pocket I found four-pennyworth of good halfpence, and in her right hand pocket I found five good shillings, and to the best of my knowledge four good sixpences. I delivered the money into the constable's hands; I delivered them all separate, the good and bad distinctly; I had one shilling delivered to me previously by Mr. Costen; I kept that by itself, and the other seven by themselves.</p>

Yes; I was sent for by the last witness to Mr. Costen's; the money was delivered to me, and the good money was ordered by the Magistrate to be given to the poor woman again, to keep her; I produce the one shilling, and the seven bad shillings; I know nothing more than she said she bought them of one Ellis, a man that lived up in Goswell-street, in a bye passage; we could not find him.</p>

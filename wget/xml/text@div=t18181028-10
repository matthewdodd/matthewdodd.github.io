            . I live at Edgley, in Berkshire. On a Friday, at the beginning of October, I saw the prisoner going through Uxbridge, riding on a gelding; I had received information, and asked him if he was going to Croydon fair, he said he was; the horse appeared very much fatigued. I said, "You have travelled very hard." He said he had come from Oxford. I said no more, but rode on to Hillingdon. The prisoner afterwards came there, and in consequence of what passed he was taken into custody. He told me that his master was coming on to the Ram Inn, in Smithfield, with three more horses. I went and enquired for his master, but could hear nothing of him. I returned to the prisoner, he asked me if I had seen his master? I said, Yes, as much as you expected that I should. He burst into tears, and said he was drawn into it. I said, "What then, did you steal it?" He said, Yes; he stole it that night off Abingdon common.</p>

On Saturday the 12th of March, between the hours of four and five in the evening, the witness, Mrs. Stragnell, informed us that the prisoner had taken from the door a piece of callico, on which

             and I went out and stopped the prisoner a small distance from the door; we desired her to come back, being informed she had got a piece of print; she said she had nothing, on which we brought her back into the shop; and on holding up her gown or apron, this piece of print was found hid under her clothes, she gave it me into my hand from under her clothes; I can swear it to be Mr. King's property, by the mark that is on it, it was laid on the outside of the door, with the other prints, with a string tied across.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you last seen it before it was missing? - Outside of the door on a box, there was a string across, but the prisoner slipped it from under the string, and put it under her cloak; they were not very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen it before it was taken? - In the morning, or perhaps it might be an hour before, they were left out all the day, we never all leave the shop at once, the mark is P. N. with two crosses underneath.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom was the mark made? - I cannot swear to the hand writing, but it is one of our young mens that is not here, I know the mark, that is our mark that we usually mark goods with.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss a piece of that size and pattern by the information of Mrs. Stragnell? - We did not miss it any otherwise, we have had a dozen of pieces of this pattern or more; the only thing I know it by is the mark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. You say that she slipped it away, and put it under her clothes; how do you know that? - By finding it on her.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that she slipped it away? - By the information of Mrs. Stragnell.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the 10th of March; did you observe any body with her that day? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray had you ever seen the prisoner in your shop yourself? - Not that day, I cannot say that I ever saw her before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear to that mark, who made it? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not a vast number of them pieces in your shop? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance might you take the prisoner from the door? - About fifteen or twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. She was with Mrs. Stragnell? - No, Mrs. Stragnell came and informed us.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at any time? - I think I remember something of her face; I was going by, and I saw her take that piece of printed cotton at the door, it was laying with other pieces on the board outside of the door.</p>
               <p>Court to Nicholls. Is it callico? - It is.</p>
               <p>Stragnell. This is a piece I see her take it from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it tied to any thing, or was it loose? - I cannot say to that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then? - I see her take it off, and put it under her clothes, and cover it over, and walked gently by the door, and I went into the shop and informed them, and Mr. Nicholls and the young lad went out; it was rolled on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300037"></xptr>wrong side so, but I believe this is the piece, I did not notice it much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it taken from her? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. You say that the prisoner covered it over? - She covered it with her gown, I believe, to the best of my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to her person? - She was not out of my sight till the gentleman brought her back and took it from her.</p>

            : the prisoner was hired the 15th of November last to accompany our porter with a truck, and two casks of liquor, from Monument-yard to Paddington, they went from our house between two and three: a truck is a small carriage drawn by hands; I waited till past ten, and was alarmed the porter did not return, having something particular for him to do the next morning: I apprehended the prisoner, and he declared he knew nothing of the matter, he told his serjeant that he was knocked down in Tottenham-court-road, and was robbed of ten pounds worth of halfpence; I told him it was very extraordinary that he did not immediately apply to us on his being knocked down to receive his wages, he said, he was so frightened, he did not know what he did, that was every reply I could get from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stockbroker of 1, Copthall-chambers—on Monday, 7th March, about half-past 3, Manwarren came to my office—I did not know him before—he produced sixty-eight shares of the Berlin Water Works Company; he called them sixty-seven, but I counted them and found sixty-eight—he said that he came from Mr. Cleggett of Billiter-square, whom I knew by repute—I drew out this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which Manwarren signed—I told him it was very late in the day, and that these shares were very seldom bought in, and I had rather wait till the morning, as it would be rather hard on Mr. Cleggett—he said that his orders were to sell them at once and bring away the money—I went to the Stock Exchange, and then went to Mr. Cleggett, to inquire if it was right—I returned to my office, found Man wan-en there, and asked him for the shares in order to take the numbers of them—he gave them to mo and I sent for a policeman—just before the policeman came in, I said I did not believe Mr. Cleggett had sent him—he said that two persons outside instructed him to come into the office to sell them, and I should find them waiting outside—I called the policeman in, and he and I took Manwarren down stairs—he pointed to two persons at the bottom of the court and asked him if they were the persons he meant—he said he thought they were, but that he was near sighted—Walters was one of those persons and the witness Bennett the other—we walked towards them, and they went into a public-house—we were about twenty yards from them—I went in after them and found them standing in front of the bar, drinking, and apparently in deep conversation—I asked Bennett if he knew Manwarren—he said that he did not, he had never seen him—not knowing each other, the policeman did not like to take them all three, but Manwarren finding himself in custody said, "Those are the two men."</p>

On 7th March, about half-past 3 o'clock, I was sent for to Mr. Smith's office, and found Manwarren there—Mr. Smith said that he had brought some shares for him to dispose of which he could not give a satisfactory account of—I asked Manwarren where he got them—he said that two gentlemen sent him there to dispose of them—I asked him if he knew them—he said, "No, I met them in the Kingsland-road, and they asked me if I would meet them at the Royal Exchange and do some business for them"—he gave me a description of the gentlemen and told me that they were waiting—Mr. Smith sent his brother out, and I want out, and saw two men standing at the bottom of Angel-court—I asked Manwarren if they were the men—he said that they were, but that he was very near-sighted—we went towards them, and they turned into a public-house—we went in and found Bennett and Walters in deep conversation—they turned their backs to us—I asked Manwarren if they were the men who had sent him in—he hesitated some time and then said that they were—I said it was very strange he should have described them so accurately as to the clothes they had on, and their pins, and scarfs—he made no reply—I asked them if they had any knowledge of him—they said, "No," and that they knew nothing of any shares—Bennett wrote his address, which was correct, and Walters gave a false address—I said Manwarren must go to the station on account of the possession of the shares—he said, "Am I in charge?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Then these are the two men who sent me"—I took them all three to the station—Walters did not go quietly, and I got the assistance of another constable—I searched them, but found nothing relating to the case.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 23, Hemsworth-street, Hoxton—I have been a licensed victualler—I never knew Manwarren till the 7th March—on Saturday evening, 5th March, I was at the Southgate Arms public-house, Southgate-road—Walters came in alone—I had seen him there on several occasions—he asked me if I knew what the Berlin Water-works were worth—I did not know, and took up the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and found that they were worth two and a half to three and a half—I said, "It is too late to-day, on Monday you can do something with them"—I either said, "I will go," or he said, "Will you go?" and we agreed to meet on Monday morning to go to the Exchange to see what they were worth—I asked him how many he had—he said, "Between sixty and seventy"—we were to meet at the same place at 10 o'clock—it was a quarter to 11 when he came—I asked him if he had got the shares—he said that a friend of his had got them who was coming with him—I asked him where the friend was—he said "On the road," or "Outside"—we left the public-house immediately and met Manwarren, to whom he introduced me as the party—I asked him if he had got the shares—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Allow me to look at them"—he pulled out a black pocket-book and produced a share, saying, "I have one here"—I took it and we went to the Royal Exchange, stopping first at a public-house and had a pint of beer between the three of us—the prisoners left me in the public-house, as I said it was too soon to do any business—I afterwards went on 'Change to find a porter's broker—he came back to the</p>

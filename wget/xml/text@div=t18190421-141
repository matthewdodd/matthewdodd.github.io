I first saw him about the 7th of January; he came to me with his brother James, who had before ordered a blue coat, waistcoat, a pair of breeches, and a pair of drawers, and to take them to No. 46, Shouldham-street, The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Make the clothes, I am a housekeeper, and live at No. 46, in Shouldham-street, Edgware-road," and that he would pay me on the delivery of them. I made them, and took them there on the 19th of January, about eight o'clock in the evening - I saw the prisoner's wife, and James, his brother there, and left the things. His wife said,</p>
               <p>"Can you give change for a 20 l. note," showing it to me; I said I could not give her change. I said I would try what I could do in the morning, and see if I could get her change. She said,</p>
               <p>"Do, for my husband wants some clothes in the morning." In the course of the morning of the 20th, I borrowed the money of Mr. Twining, my draper, and went to No. 46, Shouldham-street, with my little boy, and saw the prisoner, and his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Now state distinctly what passed - A. The prisoner's wife said,</p>
               <p>"Have you brought the change?" I said,</p>

I then put my hand into my pocket, and took out 13 l. 6 s. 6 d., and gave it to her - the clothes came to 6 l. 13 s. 6 d. The moment she gave me the note, I gave it to my son - I did not look at it. I told him to take it home to his mother, as quick as he could, as I had promised to send the 20 l. note to Mr. Twining. I then stopped to measure the prisoner. My son returned while I was there, and said,</p>
               <p>"Father, mother wants you immediately." - the prisoner was present. I then went home, and my wife showed me this paper - (looking at the bill) - this is it. I said I was deceived, for I thought it was a bank note for 20 l. I went back immediately to the house, and saw the prisoner's wife; the prisoner was gone. I did not get my money; I went to the house six or seven times that day, but did not see the prisoner. He came to me with his wife about eight o'clock the same evening, and said the promissory note was as good as the Bank. I produced it, and he said it was as good as the Bank; that he knew

             I met Owen, and asked him for the money. He said he had just taken a farm at Knutsford, and had no objection to my drawing a note on him at two months, and promised to pay it when due. He wanted it made payable at Messrs. Jones, Lloyd's and Co., but he had no account there. I said I dare say Chadwick would let it be made payable at his counting-house, which he did, and Owen made his mark to the bill. I left the bill at home, to be paid to any one I owed money to, and my wife gave it to the prosecutor instead of giving him money. I have every reason to believe Owen has an interest in a farm at Knutsford, or occupies one himself. He has deceived me by making it payable at a house he did not know. I am innocent.</p>

            . This bill and acceptance, all but the mark, is my hand-writing - I drew it by desire of the prisoner in Mr. Key's shop, who is a stationer, in Coleman-street, where we bought the stamp. The prisoner fetched a man into the shop to accept the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen these two persons together - A. About a fortnight before. The prisoner told me the man's name in his presence. I did not speak to the man myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man who made the mark see and know what you wrote - A. I do not know. He was in the shop, and made his mark after I wrote it - I showed him where to make his mark. Nothing was said about meeting the bill. I had taken a small warehouse at this time at No. 3, Staining-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the bill to be made payable at your house - A. I met the prisoner in Cheapside - he asked me if I did not remember one Lowndes? I said it was thirteen years since I had seen him. In consequence of what he said, I let it be made payable at my house, as he said he would see it paid. After two or three solicitations, I agreed to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. Q. What are you - A. A broker in the Manchester line. I sell goods on commission. I took the place in Staining-lane in December, for six months certain.</p>
               <p>Q. The time is not up yet, are you carrying on business there now - A. No, in fact I did not use this place at all; I found it inconvenient, and told Mr. Stone to tell the people I would not keep it. I received some goods in there - they remained there about a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear the goods did not come in in the morning and go out in the evening - A. Yes, I will. My warehouse was a small room. I have not paid the rent, as there are some fixtures; when they bring in their bill I shall pay it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Stone attend at the warehouse for you - A. He did - I knew nothing of Owen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give Stone authority to give any answer about Owen - A. I told him to say Lowndes had told me it was sure to be paid.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner wished to have the bill made payable at your house - it was not Owen's desire - A. No; I have seen no other bills of Owen's; I now live at a private house on Stamford-hill - I do not use any warehouse now. I took the warehouse to receive goods, but I found it did not answer.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How do you sell your goods - A. By pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the warehouse for six months, which are not expired - A. I think I took it for twelve months; they know where to find me, and have not applied for the rent.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You took it for six or twelve months, and have left it entirely - A. Yes. I am not a sworn-broker.</p>
               <p>JESSEE CARTER. I now live at Holloway. I know the prisoner - I do not know Owen. In January last I was in Coleman-street with Chadwick, I believe the prisoner was with us; it was the first time I ever saw him; he asked Chadwick to draw a bill for him on a person named Owen; we went into Key's shop and bought a stamp; Chadwick 
               <persName id="t18190421-141-person1479">drew</persName>
             the bill, the prisoner being a bad writer - the prisoner put his name on it. Owen said he could not write - it was accepted with his mark. Owen said he would make it payable at a banker's. He was asked if he kept cash there? he said</p>
               <p>"No, but I shall have it there when it comes due." The prisoner then, I believe, asked leave to have it made payable at Chadwick's warehouse, which was done.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know Chadwick - A. I have known him many years; he once kept the Duke Humphrey, public-house, in Earl-street, about eight years ago; after that, I believe, he kept the Waterman's Arms, at the foot of Westminster Bridge. I was never at his warehouse in Staining-lane.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had you known Owen - A. I did not know him, the man called himself Owen.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Chadwick must have heard him say so - A. He said his name was Owen.</p>

            . I am a stationer, and live in Coleman-street. In January last I remember the prisoner, Chadwick, and Carter coming to my shop; before I left them they asked permission to draw a bill in the shop - I did not notice them. I observed, that after Chadwick 
               <persName id="t18190421-141-person1481">drew</persName>
             the bill, the prisoner called a person into the shop, asked him some questions, and then asked him to put his name on the bill, which he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The man was in the shop half a minute, not more; he seemed very awkward and very unwilling; he did not mention his name.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole thing was manufactured before he was called in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You did not attend to what was going on - A. Not exactly; I had no interest in it - some questions were asked him about where it was to be made payable. I have some faint recollection about it being made payable at a banker's, and afterwards it was made payable somewhere else.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did this man take any part in it - A. He scarcely said a word while in the shop - he followed their direction; he did not come in with them. They looked about a good bit before they found him; they thought they had lost him, at last they beckoned him over.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a poulterer, of 158, Old Kent Road—on the morning of 1st March I was alarmed by a policeman about 1 o'clock—I had gone to bed about 11 o'clock, and had shut my shop up safely as usual—I went down stairs and saw policeman No.70 struggling with a man named Lun, who has been convicted at the Kingston Assizes—he brought him into the shop—they were both overcome by struggling—another policeman came up on hearing the rattle—an attempt had been made to break the door in, the panels of which were smashed—three window shutters were out of their places, and the bar had been wrenched down—thay had succeeded in getting access to the shop and were trying to take a fowl—I found a fowl with its neck pulled off—they could not get it through.</p>

On 1st March, at 12.40 a.m., I was on duty in the Old Kent Road—I saw the two prisoners and Lun and another one—I had been watching them some little time—they all came down the Kent Road together—they stopped opposite the prosecutor's shop—I secreted myself in a garden—Perry stopped 15 or 18 yards away, Lun and Page stopped opposite the shutters—the other man went on, and left Page and Lun standing by themselves—they went to the shutters—I heard a noise as if wood were cracking, and heard the shutters fall down on the floor—I ran across the road and caught hold of Page with my left hand and dragged him down; at the same time I got hold of Lun—Page escaped—I kept Lun till the prosecutor came down—I sprang my rattle—while I was on the floor with Lun two P Division policemen came—one of them secured Perry and the other ran through the square after Page—I have no doubt about the identity of either of these men—Page I am certain of—I think I can identify both the prisoners—I was in plain clothes—there were no other persons walking en the road about the same time.</p>

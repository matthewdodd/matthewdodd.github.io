I know nothing of the Prisoners, it was too dark to know them again; these Gloves are mine, the Hat was at pawn, the Gloves were in the Soldier's Barracks ; there were Marks of Handcuffs upon the Gloves; the Prisoners were brought out of the Country for Deserters, and had wore these Gloves under their Handcuffs .</p>

On the morning of the 22nd of Feb. a man came into the shop for an ounce of salts—the prisoner resembles the man—I cannot say positively that he is the person—I served him—about half an hour after, somebody else came in for the same quantity of salts, I think about half-past eight or a quarter to nine—I went to breakfast, previous to the second person coming in—when I went to breakfast I secured the shop door—I breakfast in the house—in conse<lb></lb>quence of some information, about half an hour after I went into the shop—the door was then closed, but the papers on the counter were in confusion, and two trays were removed from a glass case on the counter, containing eighty, ninety, or a hundred scent bottles, worth 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or rather more—this bottle, produced by the officer, exactly resembles one of those we missed, in pattern, size, and make—these four, produced by Kibble, I have no doubt formed a portion of them, and two of them have our private mark on them—we generally put a small card into the bottles—we do not take them out when we sell them—these five, produced by Ward, I have no doubt formed a portion of those stolen—we missed some exactly like them, in colour, pattern, make, and size—there are no marks upon them, but they are precisely the sort of bottles, this one had a ring and chain to it which have been removed—I believe these three, produced by Belcher, also to be a portion of those which were stolen.</p>

DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know where he has been lodging for the last six months? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the last place he was in was Vere-street, Clare-market—he lodged there about a month—he was lodging there at the time the rob<lb></lb>bery happened—I was there at the time the policeman came to search the place—at the time the prisoner left me I let him take a room full of furni<lb></lb>ture, and he was to pay for it by weekly instalments—I called on him every week for the money—he lived in West-street, Soho, after leaving me, and then went to Vere-street—when I called on the day in question, at Vere-street, for the money, his wife told me he had not slept at home that night—he is a married man—it was between four and five o'clock in the afternoon that I called.</p>

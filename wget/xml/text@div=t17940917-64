I was burnt out at the late fire, in Wapping; I am by trade a cabinet-maker; I was in Falcon-square this time, with a man I knew very well, and I told him I had lost my tools, and asked him to lend me some? he said he worked in Jewin-street, and if I would go with him, he would lend me a few tools; and I went with him to Jewin-street, and went into a building before him, and stopped till he came out, and he delivered the saw into my hand, and said, deliver me the saw again to-morrow, in the same place; I told him I would; and whilst I was carrying it away that gentleman came and took me. As to what he says about my offering to strike him, it is false, so help my God.</p>

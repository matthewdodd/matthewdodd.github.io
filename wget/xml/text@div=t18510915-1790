The prisoner and two other persons came there—the prisoner appeared very ill, and said she was very much frightened, and nearly run over in crossing the road—she wanted something to drink, and said she would have some shrub and cold water—I served her; she gave me a Victoria shilling—I put it to my mouth and bit it—the officer came in and I gave it to him—he took the prisoner away, and just after she had gone I saw another shilling picked up just where the scuffle was—she made a resistance at being taken—the shilling was picked up by a man in front of me—he said he was lucky, he had found a shilling, and he would spend it—he threw it on the counter—I took it up and bit it, and found it was bad.</p>

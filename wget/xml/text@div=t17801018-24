I seised him by the collar; he turned round, let the cloth fall, and struck me on the breast. There were ten pieces of cloth. After he had struck me he put himself in a fighting posture; I returned the blow, and he stumbled off the pavement, and then ran away. I pursued him immediately; he ran round the Mansion-house up Lombard-street, up a passage. When I came up to him I seised him by the collar; I knew him immediately to be the man, who had struck me and had the cloth. under his arm. I brought him back to the warehouse, and sent for a constable. A neighbour who saw the transaction took up the linen and brought it into the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man you first laid hold of and who dropped the pieces and struck you? - Yes, I am sure of that.</p>

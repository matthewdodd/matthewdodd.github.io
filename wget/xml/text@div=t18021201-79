               <p>Prisoner defence. A gentlewoman took me to the shop to by some cloth, which I was to make up; having made free with a little liquor, which I suppose Mr. Taylor observed, he made rather free with me, and in reaching over to me, to put his hand on my neck, he threw the piece of cotton off a stool; in the struggle, I picked it up, and said, I would take it to make my child a frock of, in a joking way; I am positive he might have seen me pick it up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Taylor. It is entirely false, there were several other women in the shop, and I could not have taken any liberty with her, any further than asking her what she had there, upon which she was very insolent, and went away neither was she in liquor.</p>

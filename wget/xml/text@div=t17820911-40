               <p>I know the prisoners; they robbed me on the 4th of July last, about nine or ten at night. I was at a private house in <placeName id="t17820911-40-crimeloc208">East-Smithfield</placeName>

I fell asleep, at about twelve they had taken my money, put it upon a chair, and had called in the watchman to look at it, they had a candle burning, they took eighteen guineas and two Spanish dollars. I awaked, and they asked me how that money came there, I asked them what business they had with it, and I went to bed again and staid till morning, I put up what money was left, there was forty guineas on the chair; I had fifty-six guineas, and a guinea in gold, and a guinea in silver, and two dollars in my breeches pocket, I earned it at sea; and at twelve o'clock they had taken eighteen guineas, and left me forty; that forty guineas was on the chair, I counted it, and missed the eighteen guineas and the two dollars. I went to bed with Sullivan again, the other went home; I only went to bed with one.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to go to bed again so quietly, when you found you had been robbed? - It was dark, and I had no where to go, I thought I might as well stay as go into the street.</p>
               <p>Court. When the watchman was there, and you found you had been robbed, why did not you charge him with them? - I do not know, I staid there all night; they did not take any thing more from me.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the watchman you had been robbed? - Yes I did, but they swore they had not seen a farthing of my money: I do not know the watchman's name. When I got up next morning, I asked this woman about my money, and she said she knew nothing of it, and she fetched the other, and they both swore very much, enough to fright me; I had them both taken up: I was sober and sensible, I had been drinking a little, I am sure I had the fifty-eight guineas in my pocket, and a knife and a key, which the landlord of the public-house brought me the next day out of his parlour, they were altogether in a jacket pocket, the money was in a cut purse.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutor. Was your coat all over mud? - No.</p>
               <p>- MAYNE sworn.</p>
               <p>I attend the public-office in East-Smithfield; Brady wanted to let the prisoners go, they were very much in liquor, I took them to the office and searched them; they had no money in their pockets nor in their rooms, except in Sullivan's room there was an old pair of woman's shoes just at the foot of the bed, I shook them, and heard some money jingle, and between the two soles I found four guineas in one of them, she said it did not belong to her.</p>
               <p>PRISONER SULLIVAN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have known the prosecutor nine months, he came to me and engaged me for the night, he was in liquor, and fell down in the mud; I asked him where he had been, he said he had been two hours and an half looking out for the house, he said two women had shoved him down. He sat down, and drank very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110052"></xptr> much in the public-house, and went home with me, and this young woman went home with me; he sent for a pot of beer, the public-house was shut up, when I came back, this young woman stood at the top of the yard, she said he was a very comical sort of a man; when I went in again he was asleep, and the money on the chair, I waked him, and he said he had been robbed; I called in the watch, and the officer of the night, and told them that the man said he had been robbed; the officer desired him to put his breeches on, and come along with him to the watch-house, and he would take charge of us; he would not go, he said he was not robbed. This man is only set on by people who want to swear away my life.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Did you ever cohabit with that woman before? - Yes, once or twice.</p>

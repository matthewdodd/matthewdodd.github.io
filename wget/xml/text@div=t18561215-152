                  </hi>. I am in the service of Savory and Sons, of Cornhill. On 17th Oct. the prisoner drove up in a brougham, with either one or two horses, and selected a gold watch at sixteen guineas, and a chain at twelve guineas—he also selected, but did not take away, six pairs of dessert knives and forks; they were to be sent up to him, but we were to wait to hear further before they were sent; we heard nothing more, and still retained them—he asked for a piece of paper to write a cheque for the amount—I made out the invoice, and received this cheque from him," William Stopher, 52, Cheapside. Please pay A. B. Savory and Son, 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on my account, Herbert E.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of No. 52, Cheapside. I have been solicitor to the prisoner—on 16th July last, close upon 1,880<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his was paid into my hands, to bis credit—it was paid to him in my presence, and left with me for his purposes—I had certain payments to make on his behalf, which I made, and rendered him an account about 23rd July, leaving him a balance of 845<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which, as he was going to Paris, he left with me, to be disbursed as he might orders—many orders came in, such as have been produced to-day, and I paid them—the last date on which I had any money of his was 20th or 21st Sept—on 17th Sept. I wrote to him at Paris this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he, at that time, had more than sufficient to cover the orders—it showed a balance of 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but on the 21st that balance was drawn out—from 21st to the beginning of Dec. I had no money belonging to him in my hands—I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to him on 15th Sept.—(<hi rend="italic">This was a request not to draw any more money till he heard from Mr. Stopher</hi>)—I had no money of his on 21st Nov.—I had paid 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the Court of Queen's Bench, in lieu of bail, of the money I had belonging to him, in an action in which he had been arrested for a debt—various letters passed; and negotiations ensued, with a view of settling that action, but they were abortive for a time—I had soon the prisoner's instructions to place myself in a position to defend that action if the sum of 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was</p>

               <p>not accepted which was tendered; in which case he would be entitled to about 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was the difference—as far aft I am aware, that was the only available sum in my power—I saw Mr. Stanbridge about 3rd Oct, and explained that to him—a sum of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid into my handa yesterday—I have some letters here which I received from the prisoner when he was in Paris, about 19th or 20th Sept.—this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is dated the 17th, but that is a mistake evidently, for the post mark is the 19th, at Paris; and it came in answer to my letter of the 17th—this is the last letter I received from him in Pane—I received some in London (<hi rend="italic">The letter being read stated</hi>, "I have drawn for the balance, and in all probability I shall never be in England again."—<hi rend="italic">Some accounts were here produced Mr. Murray</hi>)—this is the first accouut—no letter was sent with this.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was from Mr. Stopher to the prisoner, expressing his astonishment at his having again drawn on him when there were no funds, and informing him that he was rendering him<lb></lb>self liable to criminal proceedings.</hi>) The portmanteaus in my possession were full of clothes and jewellery—there were two gold pins—I had no authority from the prisoner to raise money on them—he told me repeatedly that he expected to have 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Kemp, the builder, who was giving the fancy ball, and who lends money—he is one of the firm of Kemp and Clay, bill brokers.</p>

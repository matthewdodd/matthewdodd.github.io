                  </hi>. I live at 1, St. Anne's-court, Wardour-street—I am a boot closer—I was at the Two Ships public-house, at the corner of Compton-street, Wardour-street, on 11th September, between 2 and 3 o'clock in the day, the prisoner, the deceased Radford, a tall man named M'Donald, and several others were there—I heard the deceased ask a tall, strong man, not M'Donald, about wrestling—after he had caught hold of his hand and brought him to the ground nearly, he wrestled for a few minutes in the public-house—I left the public-house in company with Rad<lb></lb>ford, and went into a urinal there—I, Radford, and a man named Crawford, were there for a minute or two—when I came out the tall man that he had been wrestling with stood outside, and the deceased <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fist and struck him—the tall man struck out again, and they went out in the middle of the read; they fought three rounds; both of them fell; Crawford went and separated them, and told them the police were coming, and the tall man ran away, the deceased running after him as hard as he could; he did not catch him—as the deceased went, he fell very heavily against a chemist's window-sill—he got up instantly—instead of running direct after the man he had been running after, he turned a complete half circle back again—the prisoner was then standing in front of the Two Ships public-house, and the deceased up and struck Davis, and Davis struck him; the deceased struck the first blow—he ran to Davis and struck him with his fist about the chest—Davis struck back directly; I should say there were about half a dozen blows exchanged between them when they were both on the ground—they got up again and had another round, in which the deceased make a blow at Davis; Davis immediately let his left hand go as well, and followed it again with his right</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220026"></xptr>

                  </hi>. I keep the Regent public-house, 29, Balsover-street—I was in the Two Ships public-house on the 11th of this month, between 2 and 3—while I was there the prisoner and Radford, the deceased, came in with a female—there were some other men in the public-house; I did not hear anything said about wrestling—I saw a tall man who had been drinking with Radford; I saw Radford take his hand as I thought to shake hands with him, but he said he squeezed it too hard, and it was spite; with that, another tall man came in between and said, "Oh, don't quarrel!"—the tall man whose hand was seized was not M'Donald—I mistook the two—I went out of the public-house first, but previous to that they called for two pots more <hi rend="italic">cooper</hi>—I saw Radford and the tall man fighting; I did not see them fall at all—I had a little child and it got down in the crowd, and when I got it up the tall man had his hand up and said, "I have done," and ran away—Radford ran after him very fast; he fell against Mr. Peppin's window—I saw him get up and walk across where he encountered Davis—I cannot say whether there were any words; I was not close enough; I cannot say who struck the first blow, but they fought; I saw them fall there in the first round—they got up and fought again to nearly opposite Mr. Dawson's public house—Davis then stood a little distance from the man, and struck a blow which, I think, caught him somewhere in the neck.</p>

I am a cheesemonger, of South-court, Great Windmill-street, Haymarket—I was standing at the corner of Great Pulteney-street, near Wardour-street, on 11th of this month, about 2 o'clock, talking with another young chap—I saw three men standing in the middle of the road, having a few words together—I did not take any notice of the conversation; the prisoner was not one of the men; it was M'Donald, the deceased, and the tall one he was fighting with first; the deceased put up his hand and began sparring at the tall one; they fought; they just had one round when the tall one ran down a street and the deceased followed him, running; I saw the deceased fall against Mr. Peppin's window—I then saw him come back again and meet the prisoner in the middle of the road—I did not hear what passed; the deceased turned round with his right hand and struck Davis; they both got fighting, and they had one round, and Davis hit him some<lb></lb>where in the breast and knocked him into the gutter; a few friends picked them up and they got at it again, and they went to the ground with a little wrestling—several friends picked them up again, and they got at it over again opposite Dawson's, and Davis struck the deceased somewhere in the body—the deceased staggered and pitched on his temple against the stones—he did not get up again—I do not know the prisoner at all.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 33, Dean-street, Soho—on 11th September I was called to see the deceased—my assistant, who is not here, had previously seen him—I saw him forty-eight hours after death—I examined the body—there was a contused wound, nearly an inch long, at the upper and outer part of the right temple—the parts around were much congested, and blood had flowed from the wound before death—the skin, at the right of the neck, was much discoloured and puffed, and when cut in two the cellular tissues beneath were much distended with bloody fluid—there was an abrasion as if a finger-nail had struck against the side of the neck—the skin was knocked off the knuekles—I found a ruptured vessel at the base of the brain, with effusion, which was the cause of death—that might be caused by a violent fell against a kerb-stone.</p>

            . My father is a livery-stable keeper, and lives in Frederick-place, Hampstead-road. On the 27th of April, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in his stable-yard, and saw the prisoner in the stall, with the mare - I saw him pat the mare, and order her a feed of corn - he said he should call for it in an hour's time - he told the ostler to rub her down, and take care of her; he went away with the bridle and saddle on his shoulder; he did not come back: the horse stood at my father's for a month, and was taken, on a Thursday, to Mr. Deacon's yard, opposite Buckingham-house, by my father: I went with him - he gave it to the head ostler there; I had never seen the prisoner before - I saw him again at Marlborough-street office, on the Tuesday after the horse was left at Deacon's: I had taken particular notice of him at our yard, seeing the bridle and saddle on his shoulder - I saw the same horse at Marlborough-street: the prisoner, at the office, had a coat on, and a jacket underneath; he had no coat on at our stables: I know it was on the 27th of April, because I booked the time the horse came in.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live in Bain-bridge-street. I was standing at the crossing at the end of Maddox-street, on a Friday or a Saturday - I think it was in April: I did not particularly notice the time of day; it might be four o'clock, or after; I saw the prisoner lead a dark bay horse or mare out of Maddox-street, across Bond-street, and back again; he came back a second time across Bond-street, into Grosvenor-street, nearly opposite Grosvenor and Brook's mews; I turned my head, and lost sight of the horse directly; and in eight or ten minutes a gentleman was asking about his horse - I went to Grosvenor and Brook's mews, but could not find the horse, and did not see the prisoner again, till be was in the custody of Brown, in Albany-row - I told the constable what kind of man he was, and what he wore, before I saw him - I had seen him in Bond-street seven or eight weeks before, and am certain of his person; I took particular notice of his face, and a round jacket he had on - I saw a mare at Marlborough-street, but cannot swear it was the one he was leading; it appeared to be the same - I could not tell whether it was a horse or mare in Bond-street.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the morning of the 7th of May, at the King's Head, Orchard-street, Westminster - he was drinking with some girls, and nearly tipsy; he came to me as I stood at the bar, and said, "Policeman, will you take a drink of beer?" I said I had no objection, and drank with him - he said, "I have a jacket here, I will sell you for 2s., if you like to buy it;" I declined - I looked at him, and having a bill in my pocket respecting Mr. Gregorie's mare, I saw he answered the description of the man, and asked if he had been in the country lately - he said he had - I asked if he had been to turn his master's hunters out; he said, "Yes: but Mr. Policeman I am going to answer no more question; I suppose you think you have a case against me?" I then requested him to go down to the station-house with me; he said he would, but afterwards swore he would not - I then took him to Queen-square office; the Magistrate desired me to take him to Bond-street, for Davis to see him; I left him in custody of another person at a public-house in Avery-row, and went to Davis - he went with me to the public-house, and pointed him out directly.</p>
               <p>MR. GREGORIE. I saw Davis the day I lost my horse; he sweeps a crossing on that spot - I observed him there immediately after I missed the mare, and asked if he had seen it - I did not find it till the Wednesday or Thursday, three weeks after; the prisoner was in custody in May, before it was found, and before I knew any thing of the witness Saunders; he was then discharged, there being no evidence to authorize us to detain him - I have not found the bridle or saddle.</p>

            . I am a dyer and glazer. I was in Maddox-street, about half-past four o'clock, on a Friday in April, about a fortnight or twelve days before I was examined at the office, and saw the prisoner leading a horse; I stood there about seven minutes, and afterwards missed the horse; Mr. Gregorie came up, and inquired if I had seen such a man holding such a horse - I did not know the prisoner before; I afterwards saw him in custody in a yard among twelve or fourteen more, and pointed him out by Brown's desire.</p>

            . I live with Dr. Addison, in New-street, Spring-gardens; the prisoner was my helper at Dr. Addison's stables, in Rams'-mews, King-street, Westminster. On the 27th of April the prisoner was at the stables, at twelve and four o'clock, and at six and nine o'clock - he has been there every day, from about Christmas, till he was apprehended; I had discharged him the morning he was taken - he sometimes slept in the coach-house, and sometimes away, if he had a lodging - my wife lives at the stables; I have only one room and a loft - I was out with the carriage on the 27th, from twelve till four o'clock - I found him there when I came home; I went out again about six, and left him there; in the first instance I went to Prescot-street, Goodman's-fields, which was out of our usual ride; it was on a Friday - he was taken up on the Monday week following; I went before Mr. Gregorie, and was asked several questions, but could not call to my recollection the several facts as to the time, being taken unawares - they asked me about four o'clock, and I could not recollect it, but I have since called to memory certain circumstances, which have corresponded; I took him into my employ after he was discharged, as he was destitute and without friends - he was with me till he was taken again; I have known him about three years, and have heard he was rather dissipated, and that I experienced myself.</p>
               <p>- GOODRICK. I am the wife of the last witness; the prisoner used to clean the horses and help in the stable - he slept in the coach-house till the last fortnight of his being with us; he then took a lodging in Windmill-street, but not having money to pay for his lodging, my husband allowed him to sleep in the coach-house; on Friday, the 27th, he was with us all day, till after dinner time - we dine between one and two o'clock - he never left; I sent him on an errand between three and four, and I gave him his tea in the loft, a little before four; he remained in the yard till a few minutes to half-past six, when he had to get the horses ready for my husband, and after that he was playing with my child in the yard - he was not absent all day.</p>
               <p>Q. What enables you to remember that it was the 27th of April? A. I was called up to Marlborough-street a fortnight after; I heard from the officers on what day the robbery was committed, and we recollected among us, (my neighbours and myself), that was the day, I had sent him for some raddishes; a person in the yard reminded me of it- he wore in the yard a dark fustian working jacket; he only wore a coat when out - I only sent him across the road for the raddishes.</p>

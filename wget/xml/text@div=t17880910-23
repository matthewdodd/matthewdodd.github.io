               <p>When the prisoner was arraigned he pleaded guilty; when he was thus addressed by the Recorder; I think it right that you should be fully informed of the consequences of your plea before it is recorded; if you expect to receive any favor from the court, or from your sovereign, on account of your pleading guilty, you may probably be deceived in that expectation, and the consequence of your pleading guilty, if it is recorded, will be exactly the same, whatever that might be, as if you was found guilty by a verdict of the jury; therefore it is for you to consider, whether you will abide by your plea of guilty, or take your chance of acquittal by a jury of your country: are you guilty or not guilty?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Gentlemen, I am guilty; when I found the gates open, I walked out of the gates; I saw nobody to hinder me or to stop me; I went at my liberty; I have three small children and a wife; they had no support; I had served my king and country abroad during the time of the war; and I thought it very hard to be kept here.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon your plea of guilty; the only thing the court has a power to do, is to give judgment of death against you; if you have any matter to offer in excuse, in that case it must go in the form of a petition to your sovereign; but if you have any matter to lay before the court it must be by evidence; then this prisoner pleaded, not guilty.</p>

I was formerly a haberdasher in Bloomsbury—the prisoner was my servant about eight months—I had a quantity of trimmings, and missed some on 7th Oct., which had been kept in a wardrobe—I asked the prisoner about them—she denied all knowledge of it—in a few minutes I heard a noise up-stairs, and thought I heard boxes open, and then a window—then the prisoner ran down stairs, I heard the back-door open, looked out of the window, and saw her in front of the house with a bundle—she placed it in a nook outside the house, so that I could not see it, then returned to the back kitchen door, went in, came out in a few minutes with her bonnet and shawl on, took up the bundle and left the garden—she had not leave to go out—I followed her—she stopped to speak to some females—I said, "Sarah, is that you? I want you; what is that you have got in that bundle?"—she said, "My things"—I said, "I want you to come back with me"—she came back and placed the bundle on</p>

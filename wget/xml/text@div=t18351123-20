I accompanied Sooley, on the 14th of November, to Southampton-buildings, and saw him in the act of tendering some money to the prisoner—I said perhaps he would refer me to the party he took it of—he said he knew nothing about it, it was a mistake—I asked Sooley, in his presence, whether the prisoner was the man who gave him the cheque—he said he was—the prisoner said nothing to that—I told him I was an officer, and he must consider himself my pri<lb></lb>soner—he then said if I would go with him, he would take me to the party he received the cheque of—I refused to go, and said he must pro<lb></lb>ceed with me, and not I go with him—I took him to Cox and Green-wood's in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—on the road, he asked me if I had not seen him, whether I should have detained the man who presented the cheque—I told him most likely we should, till we had ascertained the respectability of his character—he said, "O thought so, I should not like to see the poor fellow," or "man, get into trouble"—he also stated, that the cheque was found upon him, he supposed he must suffer, but he would not open his mouth to get any one else into trouble—I went in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with him to Cox and Company, but neither of us went in—Sooley went in to inform Mr. Pyle that I had apprehended the prisoner, and I took him to the station-house—when the Inspector was taking the charge, he asked him his address, which he refused to give—he was asked from whom he received the cheque, and answered, "From my friend Wood"—when asked Wood's address, he refused to give that likewise—he said, "I wish to give little trouble about it, I don't disown being the presenter of it"—I asked him if he had a pocket-book, or any papers—he said no, he had taken good (or great) care of them—I searched him, but found nothing on him but 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a knife.</p>

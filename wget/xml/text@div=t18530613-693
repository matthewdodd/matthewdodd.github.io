                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, of No. 189, Drury-lane. On 16th May, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning, I was awoke fey the police I meet down stairs, and found a shutter of the shop down, and a window broken—I missed three pairs of boots from the window, which were there the night before—the house was also safe when I went to bed, and the window was sound—my house is in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields.</p>

I am a lamp lighter, of 19, Kaingsgate-street, Holborn, On the morning of 16th May, about 10 minutes to 4 o'clock, I was in Broad-street, St. Giles's, putting out the lamps, and saw the prisoner crossing Broad-street from Drury-lane—I had seen him before that morning, about twenty yards from Mr. Jackman's—he had nothing with him then—he asked me what time it was—when I saw him a second time he bad some boots under his arm, and was coming in a direction from Mr. Jackman's.</p>

About 10 minutes past 4 o'clock I received information from Adams, who pointed the prisoner out to me—he ran and threw a bundle away, which I picked up, and overtook him at the top of Museum-street—I do not remember that he said anything—the bundle contained these three pair of boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went to Mr. Jackman's shop, and called him up, and then took the prisoner to the station—the bar of the shop window had been wrenched from its socket—that would require considerable force to do.</p>

            . I am a salesman, 123, Swallow-street. On the 1st of this month the prisoner came to my house, he asked me to buy a coat; I looked at it; he asked me three pound for it; he said it was his own; he found it near Bellfound. I asked him where he lodged; he said, at the Ship in Swallow-street; I told him I would go there and ask if he lodged there; he said it was of no use my going there, they would not take any account of it. I asked him what he had taken the buttons off the coat for; he said for a particular use. I would not buy it; he went out of the shop, and took the coat with him. I followed him as far as Grosvenor-street; I said to a person of my acquaintance, there is a man going with a box coat; I suspect he has stolen it. He went and fetched a constable. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

Glock bought two pigs, paid for them, and put them at the back of the shop about nine o'clock in the morning. The prisoner came in in about twenty minutes, and asked for two pigs, and mentioned some name which I did not understand, and said they were for a German. Glock has a brother. I asked him if there was one German or two. He said Yes, two brothers. I told him the pigs lay at the back of the shop, and saw him go out with them. He came to the shop again on Monday, not in custody; a crowd collected, and I do not know what passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This happened in Newgate-street - A. Yes; the business is generally over by eleven o'clock. The pigs were taken about a quarter to ten. It is common to send porters to fetch carcases to the carts. We expected to find him about the market on Saturday, but could not.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Dean. I knew the prisoner by seeing him about the market. I heard of this business. I had lifted the pigs on the prisoner's shoulder. I knew him as a porter about the market. I went to look for him between nine and ten o'clock, but could not find him. On Monday I was informed he was in the market, and went to him, got an officer, and said to him, "Martin, you took two pigs from our shop on Saturday." He said "Me! I did not." I said he did, for I lifted them on his shoulder. He said I must be mistaken, but he would go down to the shop; he went willingly, and staid there while I fetched the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you describe him as wearing a yellow handkerchief - A. Yes. He said he did not fetch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030014"></xptr>them from our shop, it was from Bowles's, which is opposite our shop - he is employed by Sadler, who keeps a horse and cart in the market.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He at first said he did not take them from that shop - A. Yes; and afterwards that he put them into a cart a few yards off, and if he saw the man he should know him.</p>

I went to Bowles's; they said they were not there. I then went to the opposite shop, and asked if a man in a brown coat had bought two pigs; he said there were two pigs belonging to the German. I said the man was a stranger to me. I took them, and the man gave me 6 d.</p>

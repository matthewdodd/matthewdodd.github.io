                  </hi>. I am footboy to Miss Anne Georgiana Kennys Tynte, of 66, Porchester-terrace, Paddington. About a quarter to three o'clock on the afternoon of 9th Sept. I went out to post a letter, and on my return I met the prisoner in the garden—her hands were folded on her breast—a little after four I missed five silver spoons and two silver forks, which I had put on the table at lunch, at a quarter to one—I went into the room as soon as I returned from the post, and removed the cloth—I did not miss the things then, but when I went to lay the cloth for dinner, at a little after four—the butler had removed the dirty things from the lunch-cloth—I did not notice whether they were there when I removed the cloth.</p>

On the morning of 18th Sept., about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner and two other girls in Orchard-street, Westminster—I took them into custody, and told them they were charged with stealing plate from Miss Tynte's house—as Clarke walked by my side to Paddington, she said, "Me and two other girls were singing at this house, and me and the other girl waited outside while the other one went in; we waited till she came out with something in her lap, which I thought was <hi rend="italic">grab;</hi> she asked us to go with her; we asked where; she said, 'To Gravesend;' we walked a little way, and she opened her lap, and I saw a great deal of plate, and spoons, and forks; we went to Gravesend, and she asked us to wait a little while by where the fire was; she went away, and came back in a little while with some money, and said, 'You had better go back, as I am going further in the country,' and we went back."</p>

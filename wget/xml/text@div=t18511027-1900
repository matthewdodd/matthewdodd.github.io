                  </hi>. On 24th Sept., about 20 minutes to ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Smithfield, a few yards from Long-lane, walking very quick behind a gentleman—having some previous knowledge of him, I turned round, and saw him take a handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket, and put it into his side-pocket, as I thought—he walked away very quickly—I pointed him out to a policeman, who took him into custody, while I went after the gentleman, but I could not overtake him—he must have gone into some shop—this is the handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

The prisoner has gone by the name of Smith—I have known him all his life—till within the last six months he has borne a very irreproachable character, and has got his living by hard work, at printing—I beg to say the handkerchief was his own, and given him by his mother—his mother told me she gave him the handkerchief the week before—I did not tee her give it him—I am a porter and messenger—it is two years and a half since I have had regular employ—I was before that eleven years at a manu<lb></lb>facturing chemist's, and am now paralyzed—this letter is not my writing—(<hi rend="italic">this was a letter the witness had handed to the Court, begging the Court to deal leniently with the prisoner, but stating nothing about the handkerchief being his own</hi>)—I authorized it to be written—I did not tell the person what to write—I told him it was in respect of the boy being in trouble; and as I had no means to employ counsel, I should feel obliged by his addressing a few lines, so as it would have some weight with your Lordship—I do not know what he wrote, but I expected he would tell the truth—he handed it to me after it was written, but I did not sign it myself—I read it over, and approved of it—there is nothing mentioned there about the handkerchief being his own—I thought that was sufficient to answer all purposes, believing him to be innocent.</p>

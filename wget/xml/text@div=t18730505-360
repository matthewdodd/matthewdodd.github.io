                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 48). I was on duty about 1 o'clock a.m. on 4th March, in the Euston Road—I saw the prisoner and two men who are not in custody standing together on the path between 155 and 153—they seemed to be conversing, but I was some distance away—the woman had a large bundle, which appeared at first to be a child under her shawl—I watched them for several minutes, and then went towards them—the prisoner walked round Euston Crescent, and into the road again—I showed my light in the faces of the two men, but as I did not know them I turned and followed the prisoner into Duke's Road—I stopped her, and asked her what she had got under her shawl—she said she did not know—I said "Where did you get it from?"—she said "One of those two men gave it me round the corner"—I said "Will you come back and show me which it was gave it to you?"—she said "No; I am going the other way"—I went on until I met another constable, and then I went back to try and appre<lb></lb>hend the two men, but they had gone—I went to the station and found these articles, the time-piece and two pair of boots, one pair not finished, tied up in the table-cloth—I asked the prisoner if she knew the men, and she said she did not.</p>

I live at 153, Euston Road, and am a boot manu<lb></lb>facturer—I was the last up on the night of 3rd March—I went to bed at 11 o'clock, leaving the house secure—the shutters of the drawing window were up, and a bar across—in the morning the servant came to me, and I went down stairs—I discovered the clock on the drawing mantel<lb></lb>shelf had been moved, and was standing on the top of the stairs—the draw<lb></lb>ing window and shutter had been forced open, the clock and several articles were gone from the adjoining room, and the boxes and drawers forced open—I went to the station and saw the property there—access had been gained to the drawing-room window from the area railings—this crow<lb></lb>bar was found in the dining-room; it is not mine—there were marks on the window which corresponded with it.</p>

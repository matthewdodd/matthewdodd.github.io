I am a tailor at 8, Wells-street, Whitechapel—I have a stable in Well close-square—about half-past 7 on 'the morning of 18th February, I missed a set of harness from there—it was nearly new—I had only used it about four or five times—I gave 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—one of my servants fastened up the stable in the usual manner the night before—I went round about 10 o'clock and saw it safe—the hasp of the pad lock had been broken, and also a portion of the wood-work—I also missed a sack with the name of "Crockford" on it—a few days afterwards a man named Thurley spoke to me—in consequence of that I communicated with Dunna<lb></lb>way, and went with him to Mr. O'Shea's, a small chandler's shop in Ber<lb></lb>mondsey-street, and there found my harness.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at 25, Dorset-street, Spital-fields—between 5 and 6 on the morning of 18th February, I was going down Wells-street towards the docks, near Mr. Lewis's stables, when I saw the prisoner and another man going towards Tower-hill; the other man was carrying a bag—I followed them, and noticed a ring, and the part of another, hanging out of the bag—I followed them over London-bridge, and the other man gave the prisoner the bag—they then went to Mr. O'Shea's, in Ber<lb></lb>mondsey-street—the shop was shut up—they put the sack down, and one of them sang out "O'Shea, "or something of that sort—I can't say which it was—I afterwards made a communication to Mr. Lewis—I saw a bill in his shop-window—it was a whitey-brown bag the men were carrying; a potato or corn-bag—there were some red letters on it, but I could not say what they were.</p>

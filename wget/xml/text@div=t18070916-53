On Sunday, June the 21st, about three o'clock I saw two men go into Mrs. Elliot's house, and they came out in about half an hour, the prisoner was one of them; he had a shabby hat on when he went in, and a good one when he came out, and each of them when they came out had a bundle and an umbrella; I saw their faces distinctly, they passed our house with their faces towards me; I supposed they were lodgers. In about half an hour some people assembled about the door, and then I related what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it afterwards that you saw the prisoner. - A. On the Wednesday following, I saw him at Tothil Fields prison, he was standing with others: I selected him out. I am sure he is the person I saw come out of Mrs. Elliot's, I knew him as soon as I saw him.</p>

            . I am a police officer. I went with the last witness to Tothill Fields prison, she selected the prisoner from among the persons who were there. On the Sunday afternoon the robbery was committed, I was near the spot in consequence of information. I went to the house, the house was open, and two or three people in it; I found the drawers had been broken open violently; I remained there till Mrs. Elliot came home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am informed that Mrs. Cherry saw the men about the place, she saw them go in and come out, and I am informed the same men were drinking at the Vineyard public house. I have witnesses to prove that I was at Shadwell from a quarter before three till a quarter before five. The Rev. Dr. Hawker preached a charity sermon there.</p>

Dr. Hawker preached a funeral sermon; there I saw him just about the time the clergyman came into the church, I took notice of him; Mr. Brown, a Shadwell officer, went round to several houses, and we could not see him, he and his companion ran up a street, we meant to take him in custody if we could see him.</p>

               <p>Q. The day before yesterday did you see Read. - A. Yes he called me out of the gate. He asked me if I was not against Long Stevy, he generally goes by that name. I said I was, he then said he was subpoened on behalf of the prisoner Stevens, he then said in a low voice, I cannot tell what I was subpoened for, I cannot say any thing at all about the time; I thought I did not want any conversation about it, I left him.</p>

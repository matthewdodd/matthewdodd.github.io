                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Gritten, a carver and gilder, in Tra<lb></lb>falgar-square, Charing-cross. About half-past five o'clock on the evening of the 14th of August I was in the shop, and in consequence of what a woman said, I went to my master's son's bed-room, at the top of the house, which is four pairs of stairs—I found the door shut—I went in, and found a dressing-case and a cloak against the door inside, tied up in a towel on the floor—I found the prisoner concealed in a recess in the room, behind a portmanteau—I seized him, and asked what he did there, he made some answer in French, which I did not understand—I brought him down and gave him in charge—the house is let out in chambers, and the street door is always open.</p>

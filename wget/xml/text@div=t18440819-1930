                  </hi>. I am landlord of the George the Fourth public-house, Old Street-road. The prisoner was in the habit of coming to my house—about eight or ten months ago I forbid him to do so—on Wednesday, the 17th of July, about eleven o'clock, he came—he was quite sober—he began very abusive language to me, insulting me—he said he would not allow me to put him out—he called me "thin face," or "lantern-jaws," or something of that sort—I said I did not wish to have anything to say to him, and told him not to annoy me in my business, I did not wish to be interrupted—I told him if he did not be quiet, I should take the liberty of putting him out—he said, if I attempted to come on the other side of the bar, to put him out, he would <hi rend="italic">muzzle</hi> me, and wring my nose out of my face—I called my servant girl to the bar, and went to the door to look for a policeman—I did not find one—I then went back to the bar again—the prisoner was before the bar—he used the same ex<lb></lb>pressions as before—a young man in the bar called for a pint of beer—I put it on the counter, and as I did that, the prisoner said, "Well, old Gill, you are glad to take my money, after all"—I said that I was not aware it was his money that I was taking, that I had taken it from another young man, if it was his money, I should take the liberty to take the beer back again, and give the man the money again—I did so, and returned the money—the prisoner stood still close to the counter, close to me—there was only the width of the counter between us, and he kept putting his head close to my face in a very insulting manner—I told him to stand off, and not insult me in my busi<lb></lb>ness—he said he would do as he liked—he was near enough to strike me, and was using threatening language—I took up a pewter jug that was stand<lb></lb>ing between us, to prevent his taking it up and striking me with it—he im<lb></lb>mediately caught hold of it with both hands—I held it very tight by the handle—there was, I dare say, a quart of water in it, and in the struggle some water fell over him—the jug was not used to strike with—I took it back and put it down in the bar—he immediately took a quart pot up and <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> it at me with all his might—it missed me—he then took a second and threw it at me—that missed me—I avoided it—he then took up a glass and <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> it at my head—it struck my head, and cut it very much—I was quite stupid at the time—a medical man attended me—the glass broke—these are the pieces.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bar-maid to Mr. Gill.

I went to 23, Robert-street—there was "Charles Downing, jeweller," on a brass plate—I knocked at the door for half an hour, but could not get in—I found that Downing had run away—I saw him at the police-court about the 20th Oct., and afterwards gave him in charge at his house, Princes-street, Lambeth—I have never received any money.</p>

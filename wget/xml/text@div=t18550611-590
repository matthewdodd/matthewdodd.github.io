Coventry and Co."—she asked if it was right—my partner said "Yes," and she delivered it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Gentlemen,—Having an order for two lady's neck chains, and having none by me that will do, I shall be obliged if you will send me four or six of the last patterns. My young man being out I was compelled to send my servant. I will return the others to-morrow morning. George Brown, Praed-street. ")—I asked the prisoner how long Mr. Brown had lived in Praed-street—she said she had only been in his service three months, and she could not say—I heard my partner say the chains would be sent, and the prisoner went away.</p>

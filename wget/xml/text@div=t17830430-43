             I thought wanted a horse, he asked me to go with him, I went with him facing the gentleman's house, I told him, I knew Mr. Weston, says he take the horse, and get what you can for him, I said, I should rather he would go in along with me, he said no, get what you can, but do not take less than a guinea; I went in, Mr. Weston said, he did not know that he wanted such a one, then he said, he would give me a guinea, I went out to the door, and told Wood, and he said, let him have it, I went into Mr. Weston again, and told him of it, when he came out to look at the horse again, the horse was gone, Wood had taken him away, I went round the corner, and there was Wood with him in his hand, I took the money and gave it to him, and told him I was going home, I was to get up in the morning to drive the team; the second day they came to me as I was driving the cart in St. Giles's, and told me about the horse, and I was taken up then, I sent for my wife, and I sent for Wood, and he was not at home, his wife said, he was at Smithfield, and she went again the next morning at twelve o'clock, he did not come home, about a fortnight after he sent for his wife, and took her away: I never was in any confinement before.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to tell Mr. Weston, that you had worn out this horse with smuggling? - He said, he would give me half-a-crown, if I could sell him for more than a guinea.</p>
               <p>Court to Weston. He has mentioned two circumstances, one is, that upon your biding him a guinea, he went out out to find Wood? - I recollect his going out to the door, but I did not hear him mention any other man at that time.</p>
               <p>What did he go out of the door for? - I cannot tell what it was, I thought it was affecting to go away.</p>
               <p>Court. Another thing, he says, that the horse was at the door, and when he came out he was gone round the corner? - The first time it was at my door, he went out and said, he would not take the money, he came in again and said, I believe you may as well have him; then the horse was out of sight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300094"></xptr> tied to the rails going down Gray's-Inn-lane.</p>
               <p>Whether he had removed him, or whether any body else had removed him you cannot say? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Weston. What is his character? - I have known him two or three years, I never knew thing amiss of his character.</p>

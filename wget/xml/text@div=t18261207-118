On the evening of the 7th of November, about half-past nine o'clock, the prisoner and two others came in - they asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs; I said we did not keep ladies' silk handkerchiefs - they said gentlemen's would do - there were seven silk handkerchiefs in a bundle, and I showed them to them; they said they did not like them - they prisoner then asked me to look for some cotton stockings, and, while I did so, she ran off with a silk handkerchief from a piece of flannel - my mistress came in, and said she had run off with a silk handkerchief; I pursued her some distance, and found her with it - a man assisted me to bring her back.</p>

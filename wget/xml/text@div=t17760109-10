The keeper of the inn told me the coach would set out for London on the next morning the 12th, and would arrive the same night at the Golden-Cross, Charing-Cross. I sent on Wednesday the 12th to the Golden-Cross for the bags; the messenger informed me that the parcel was not come, though there was a parcel in my name entered in the way-bill. On Thursday the bags were found by some workmen at a house in Aldersgate-street: the bags were cut open, and the goods were taken out; but there being some of my cards left in the bags, they brought the bags to me; upon this I wrote a list of the contents of the bags, which I carried to Goldsmiths-Hall, and had hand-bills delivered about, offering 20 l. reward for the discovery of my property: then I went post to Oxford; I found my parcel booked there. Upon the Monday following the prisoner was stopt by a pawnbroker; my pocket ledger, containing some bills, was found upon him, and some of my goods were afterwards found at the Castle on Smallberry-Green. The saddle-bags contained goods to the value of about 372 l.</p>

I am potman at the Prussian Prince—on Saturday night, 20th November, Mrs. Hall gave me instructions, and I went out and followed three persons—the prisoner is one of them—the one I was told to follow had a white wide-awake hat—he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> away a bent shilling—I picked it up, and put it in my left hand coat pocket, and he came up to me in Wellington Street, offered me a shilling, and said that the thing I had picked up was no good, it was a <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi>—the prisoner and the other man were then walking behind—I said that I would not give it to him, and kept it in my pocket—I missed the second man in Kingsland Road—he had not spoken to me—the prisoner and the man in the wide-awake came no to me and wanted me to show it to them, but I would not, and the man with the light wide-a-wake put his fist in my face—I said, "I am not following you"—I left them and crossed to the opposite side—they then went into the Woolpack at the corner of Thomas Street—when they came out, the prisoner came up to me and said, "Halloa, <hi rend="italic">chum</hi>, how are you getting on? I can buy you; I will give you half-a-crown for the thing you have got in your pocket, it is a <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi>"—I asked a policeman to take them back, but he refused, and asked me if I was the landlord—I said that I was not, but showed him the shilling—the prisoner immediately seized me with both his hands by my collar and said, "I will give you in charge for attempting to Pass bad money"—the constable refused to interfere, and I returned home and gave the shilling to Mrs. Hall.</p>

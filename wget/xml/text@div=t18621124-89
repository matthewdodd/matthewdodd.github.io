I live at 1, York-place, Walworth-road, St. Mary Newing<lb></lb>ton, and am a plumber—on 20th October, a little after 8 o'clock, I went to bed, being ill—my wife did not come to bed till 11—I was awoke by my wife saying that she had put her foot against something—I told her to get into bed again—she then gave a shriek, and I got out of bed—after I had lit a candle I went into an adjoining room, and saw the prisoner with a life-preserver in his hand—I made a start to seize him, and he struck me on my head with the life-preserver, and jumped out of the window—the candle was alight, and I could see his eyes and his beard—the blow staggered me, and I was obliged to hold the partition—I could not get away—the prisoner was brought back three hours afterwards, and I saw the constable take a number of things out of his pocket, among which was this part of a handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is the other half of it—he had a victorine round his mouth, covering a portion of his nose—I shall be a long while before I recover—I was too ill to appear last sessions—here is the effect of the blow (<hi rend="italic">producing a handkerchief covered with blood</hi>).</p>

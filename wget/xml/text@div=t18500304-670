                  </hi>. I am a composition-maker. On 27th Feb., between three and four o'clock in the morning, I was in the British Coffee-house, having some breakfast—the prisoner came in, and sat opposite me—I never saw her before—she took up a fork, put it into my plate, and took a portion of what I was eating—I said I did not like my food to he touched, I would</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the British Coffee-house. On the morning of 27th Feb. Humphreys came in—he had some coffee, and eggs and bacon—the prisoner came in, and sat on the opposite side, by the side of a friend of his, who came in with him—she had part of the bacon and eggs that his friend was eating—he cut it off, and put it on a piece of bread, and gave it to her—I did not see that she had any of the prosecutor's, but I heard him accuse her of it—I went to see what it was, and I saw her with a fork in her hand, and before I could get to her she made a <hi rend="italic">job</hi> at his head with it—it was the fork which his friend had been eating with.</p>

               <p>I am a gangsman, I am ignorant with regard to the robbery.</p>
               <p>- HOSTILL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman from the ship to the craft; I watch for Captain Starkey, about half after nine in the morning on Wednesday the 19th of November, I catched this man in the craft that I had in my charge, a lighter.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that lighter contain? - Seven hogsheads of sugar. He was filling a small bag by the side of a coal bag.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get at the sugar? - He broke the cask open, the other witness see him, and I jumped into the craft off the keys, and I said to the man, what business have you in the craft? I had just come down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body left in the craft when you left it? - There was the king's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080200"></xptr>watchman on the key; there was nobody left in the craft. This man was sitting in the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this man put any of the sugar into the bag? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How much might he take in all? - About eight pounds, it is here. He spilt about a dozen pounds of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you left it before? - About five minutes, he watched the cask while I went up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the public house in sight of the craft? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the sugar? did you take it from him? - Yes, I took it from him; I gave it to the constable that has it now in his possession, Mr. Hunter.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me at all to whom this sugar belonged? - No, I cannot; I had the charge of it, but I do not know the owner of the sugar. He throwed the bag on to the Tower-stairs, and I jumped after it.</p>
               <p>Q. That was when he see you, I suppose? - Yes, and I jumped after him, and he wanted to hustle me out of it; he jumped down to pick up the bag before I could get at the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. But you secured the bag? - Yes, I secured the bag.</p>

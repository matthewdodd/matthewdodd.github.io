On 11th February, about 1 o'clock in the afternoon, I was on my beat at Notting-hill, and saw the two prisoners and another man, in Vicarage-gardens—they had nothing with them then, but they were looking down the areas—about half-past 2 I met them in conversation, and walking very fast—Day had a bundle under his arm—I went across the road, and said, "What is this?"—Day immediately threw down a tea-pot out of a handkerchief, and ran away with the handkerchief in his hand—the other two ran in different directions—I followed Day, calling "Stop thief!"—he was stopped by a young man, and I took him in custody—he said that he picked the tea-pot up in the road—I saw Lee at the station on the 24th with a man in plain clothes, whom I had not previously seen, and identified him immediately—I did not know him by sight.</p>

            . I live in the parish of Heston, and keep the house; the prisoner Looseley lived with me. On the 19th of January we went to bed a little after nine o'clock. I had seen the house fastened myself, the doors were locked and the windows shut. I heard nothing in the night. I get up between five and six o'clock, it was then dark; I had a candle, and missed a flitch of bacon, which had laid under the kitchen window. I found the shutter unkeyed, inside, and let down; the casement was taken out and lay two or three yards from the window. I found Looseley at home in bed; I sent for a constable and took him. When we went to bed we latched his door, and in the morning it was open, which rose my suspicion. I charged him with it, he said he had not been out of his room. I asked him how his door came open? he said he had not been down. I found the bacon the same day at Burr's house; he was taken in about half an hour.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I remember the house being fastened; my husband called me up, I found the shutter down, the casement taken out, and put near the door; it must have been done by a person inside. The bacon was gone. I fastened Looseley's door the night before, and in the morning it was open; he denied the charge.</p>

He was taken, and said Looseley was to get him some bacon and place it where he could find it; he shewed me where he took it from, which was by the railing of Search's garden.</p>

            . I keep a public-house at Heston. On the 19th of January about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came in and were in company about a quarter of an hour, then Looseley went away, and Burr stopped till about eight o'clock; my house is half a mile from Search's. Burr went out when somebody whistled outside, he had a bag. I do not think it was much after eight o'clock. I saw them whispering gently together at my house.</p>

               <p>BURR's Defence. I had a pint of beer at the house; the clock struck nine as I came out. I went to Hounslow to see one Crips. I saw the bacon in the path at Lambton.</p>

               <p>His Lordship in recapitualating the evidence to the Jury, stated, that if Looseley, alone, was accused with this offence, he should direct an acquittal, as it was evident he did not break and enter; but if the Jury were of opinion that both were guilty, he recommended them to find that verdict, and he would submit the point to the consideration of the Twelve Judges, whether as both shared in the crime, both were not equally guilty.</p>

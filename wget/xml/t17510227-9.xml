I got up and push'd out after him, and laid hold of him before he got thirty yards from the door. He had it under his arm, then he drop'd it, and got out of my hands and ran away: I cry'd out, stop thief ! and he was stop'd in running about 150 yards, but I was close by his heels all the way He was never out of my sight.</p>

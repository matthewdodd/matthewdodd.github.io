I am a labourer in the service of Mr. Perkins—on the 30th of April I saw Rendall in the farm-yard, between one and two o'clock—I saw him take a truss of hay up from the ground and put it in his wagon—there was no other hay in the wagon at that time—I then went to dinner and when I came out I noticed the wagon again—there was then two trusses of hay in it—his wagon was not above eight or ten yards from the hay-loft—I saw the hay which was afterwards brought from Wands-worth, and it was very similar to what Mr. Perkins had—I made the rick myself and had used a great deal of it.</p>

I am a labourer and live in Gray's-inn-place, Holborn—I was a stranger to Rendall, but I overtook him driving a wagon near the Old Ship at Richmond on the 30th of April—he gave me a ride in his wagon, and after I had been in a few minutes he asked me to drive the horses and hold the reins—he went to sleep on the wagon—I moved the tarpaulin and saw some hay under it—I went on to the Plough at Wands-worth—we got out there to have a pot of beer—we got there about four o'clock, and remained about a quarter of an hour—when I came out of the house I saw Rendall talking to Woodland who is the under ostler there—they were standing under a shelter outside the house where persons sit down—I went to the wagon again and found the tarpaulin was lying down flat, and what it had covered was gone—I went into the tap-room again and soon after Daley, the officer, came in—Rendall was sitting alongside of me—the officer asked for Barclay and Perkins's drayman—Rendall said nothing, but the landlord came in and pointed him out—the officer asked Rendall if he had any hay on his wagon—he said he had none—the officer said he must go out and see about it.</p>

I know nothing about any hay"—Daley told him he could prove he had hay—he said he had no hay—Daley told him if he denied it he must arrest him, and he must cottager himself in custody—the two prisoners were taken to the station.</p>

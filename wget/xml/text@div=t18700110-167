On Sunday evening, 26th December, the prisoner was at my father's house—he left about 2.15 in the morning with his son, Daniel, and me—when we got into the street (Lever Street) the prisoner said, "You will hear a report," and after we had gone about twenty yards I heard a report of a pistol, and saw a flash, and two or three minutes after<lb></lb>wards I saw the boy Daniel on the ground—he had been standing in the middle of the road, about a yard from the prisoner—I had been with the prisoner the whole evening; but had not seen a pistol in his possession, nor did I hear him say anything about one.</p>

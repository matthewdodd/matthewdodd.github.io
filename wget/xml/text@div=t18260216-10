            . I am a watchman. On the 14th of February, about twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner coming through St. Paul's Church-yard, with a piece of beef in one hand, and his shoes in the other; I asked how he came by it - he said what was that to me - he would not tell me; he then threw the beef on the ground; I sprung my rattle - De Buss came out of Paternoster-row, and picked it up.</p>

I saw a piece of beef at the watch-house - I should think it belonged to my master - I had cut it out of a quarter of beef myself - it weighed about 24lbs. Mr. John Swan is a commission salesman, and lives in Newgate-market; my master carcases beef, and sends it to him to be sold; there is no one here from Mr. Swan's. I weighed the piece of beef when it came back from the watch-house; it weighed rather more than I have stated; it had not been weighed before. I think there is no doubt it was the same piece of beef.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the market for a few things; I then went into the Hope public-house, and there I saw a friend - I went with him, and had some more beer, and stopped till about half-past eleven o'clock; a man stood at the end of Newgate-market - he said to me,"Do you want to buy a good piece of beef?" I said, "I do not know;" he said, "You shall have this for 4s., and I gave it him for it;" the watchman detained me, and I being in liquor gave him the answer I did.</p>

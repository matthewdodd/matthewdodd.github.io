               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; this is a case, the most painful that has come before you this sessions: you have heard this is a robbery; a robbery not committed in the usual way, not by force or violence to the gentleman who was robbed, but by those means, which I am sorry to say, the experience of this place, and other courts of justice, has proved, are but too frequent in these days; I mean Gentlemen, by threatening to charge an unnatural crime. Gentlemen, on the law of this subject, whatever doubts may have been entertained formerly, thank God, there will be none to day; we have it settled by all the Judges, that if money is taken from the person of any man by threats, either to affect his character or person, by which he is induced to part with his money, that constitutes the crime of a robbery, the same as if he had been knocked down; and indeed God forbid it should not; for such an attack to a man of character is worse than a publick robbery. Gentlemen, the prosecutor Mr. Drummond, is a very respectable <rs id="t17860426-11-viclabel55" type="occupation">wine merchant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17860426-11-victim234 t17860426-11-viclabel55"></join>, in Sackville-street, Piccadilly; in the course<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260033"></xptr> of his business, he acts occasionally for gentlemen as a banker; it happened that my Lord Sempill, who keeps money with him in that way,

             a draft for eight guineas, and a short time after another for one pound sixteen shillings, these drafts were presented, when Mr. Drummond's hair was dressing, and he did not file them, but neglected to take care of them; he heard no more of them till about a month ago, when two persons, soldiers, one of them the prisoner, came to Mr. Drummond's house with two drafts, upon looking at them, it did not occur that they had been paid, but he concluded they were drawn for some of my Lord's servants, and that they had lost them; the soldier said, he did not present them for payment, but finding them, he brought them home; Mr. Drummond gave each of the soldiers a shilling a piece, and away they went. On the 5th of April, Mr. Drummond was in the Park, and there was a great disturbance in the Park, which

             the attention of every body, and of course, of Mr. Drummond; upon enquiry, he found that a man was detected in woman's cloaths, and that that was the cause of the riot; on returning home, Mr. Drummond was accosted by a man who since turns out to be the prisoner, who said, how do you do, Sir; Mr. Drummond had no recollection of his person, and said, who are you? says the prisoner, do not you recollect me, I am one of the two soldiers that brought the drafts, and say she, you behaved very ill and very shabbilly to us, and gave us only a shilling a piece; Mr. Drummond said, he thought he had given them enough; but however, Mr. Drummond gave him a shilling more; then the prisoner used this expression, if you do not give me more, I will swear an unnatural crime against you, and that you lost the drafts when you was with me in the Green Park; I can swear to your person, from having seen you at your own house before, when I brought the drafts. Mr. Drummond, you may conceive, was unusually alarmed; and upon these occasions, one sets one-self to consider what one should do; I am sure it has often puzzled me, how I should behave on such an occasion; knock him down one of my friends suggest; why that would be equally dangerous, that would be called retaliation; should a man do as Mr. Drummond did, give him something; why that is an encouragement to all these scoundrels of the guards; otherwise, the best way might be, to give them something and get rid of them; that was Mr. Drummond's case, he did not chuse to be annoyed by this man, he gave him four shillings; the fellow said that would not do, he should go home with him, he would have more money; Mr. Drummond was obliged to submit, he begged he would follow at a distance; in short Mr. Drummond went home, and there he got some more money, two guineas which he gave the prisoner; this however did not satisfy the prisoner, for the constant experience of these cases is, that when once they have made a footing, so as to induce people to give them a farthing, they are never satisfied, because, they know that every additional shilling that is given, is an additional abatement of that story, which is to be told to the Jury; the prisoner desired Mr. Drummond to make an appointment to give him some more money, Mr. Drummond did so; the prisoner desired Mr. Drummond would be very cautious to attend to his appointment, or else he should visit him again; Mr. Drummond disclosed what he had done, to Lord Sempill, and some other gentlemen, and that very day the prisoner was taken up; when the prisoner was taken and examined at the Publick Office, in Bow-Street, he told this story; that Mr. Drummond had lost the drafts, while he was commiting indecent familiarities with another soldier, of the name of Wetherhill, who was the man that went with the prisoner, when they carried the drafts; upon this Wetherhill was examined, and he entirely disclaimed the whole story, and said he never saw Mr. Drummond, till he went to his house with the prisoner with the drafts; another circumstance is, when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260034"></xptr> this man made the charge in the Park, Mr. Drummond told him that there was a reason why he should be the last person in the world to be charged with such a crime; but Wetherhill will come here, and tell you there is no truth in the story told by the prisoner. If the prisoner should be unwise enough to-day to affect Mr. Drummond's character, by so foul a charge, Mr . Drummond lives in this country in a way that he can produce the most reputable witnesses to his character, and that I should think will go a great way in directing your judgments; but the Court will tell you, that I cannot call such witnesses, unless the prisoner makes it necessary; but if I do call them, they will shew you that Mr. Drummond is not, nor cannot be the man that the prisoner represents him. Gentlemen, I shall call my witnesses, and if you find this man has made this charge with a view of extorting money, you will pronounce a verdict of Guilty upon the prisoner, and leave him to the vindiction of the law, to be made, perhaps, a public example to a nest of men, who, instead of being the guardians of the public, are by much the worst subjects the King has in his dominions, and by much the worst set of men in this metropolis; so that in future honest men walking in the Park may not meet with these sort of attacks; but however, Gentlemen, your province, to be sure, is only to pronounce him guilty, or not guilty, from the evidence that shall be laid before you; and I know, from the experience I have had of you, that you will give the greatest attention to that evidence, and decide according to your consciences; I ask no more at your hands.</p>

            , dated the 30th of December, 1785; another for one pound eighteen shillings, in favour of Mr. Thwaites, dated the 11th of January; these drafts had been presented, as it frequently happened, when I was in the room dressing, and I sent the money down by the servant; when I went to the counting-house, I entered the drafts as usual; not being in the counting-house then, I did not take them, and what came of them I do not know; but I omitted to draw the pen through the name, and put them in the drawer to present them at the Bank. About a month ago two drafts were brought to me in my wine vaults.</p>
               <p>Court. About what time were the drafts presented and paid? - They were at two different times, and shortly after the times they bore date, within a day or two; they seldom are longer than a day from being presented; those two drafts were brought to me when I was down in the wine vaults; I asked if Joe was at the door, (Lord Sempill's servant) the servant told me no, that two soldiers had brought them; it struck me immediately that Joseph had lost the drafts; I came up, and spoke to the soldiers.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner at the bar one of those soldiers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was Wetherhill the other? - I cannot say; I could not even have said the prisoner was one of them, if he had not made that attack upon me afterwards; I went and spoke to the two soldiers, and told them I would not pay the drafts; upon which one of them answered, that he did not present them for payment, he said he found them.</p>
               <p>Was that said by the prisoner at the bar? - I cannot tell; still thinking that some of Lord Sempill's family had lost the drafts, I went to the compting-house, and wrote upon them, not to be paid; I sent the soldiers to Lord Sempill's, and about an hour after they came back to me, with my Lord's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260035"></xptr> own servant,

               <p>Did the servant say you must have lost them yourself, in the presence of the two soldiers? - No, it was in the cellar; I came up to the compting-house, and shewed them the drafts from the books, that they were entered and paid; I told them that the drafts were of no consequence, but as they had brought them home, I gave the soldiers a shilling a-piece for their trouble.</p>

               <p>Court. When you first went up to speak to these two men about the drafts, was any body present? - My servant,

               <p>Was he present when you sent them to Lord Sempill's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they, or either of them, make any objection to going to Lord Sempill's? - No, none.</p>
               <p>When did you see the soldier again? - I saw no more of them till the 14th, which was Good Friday.</p>
               <p>When you gave them the shilling a-piece, did they say any thing before they left you? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Did they make any complaints? - No, not a word; on the 14th, I went down to St. James's Park, about eight in the evening, and walked towards the Queen's House in the Mall; there were a great many people walking at the time, and on returning, there was a noise in the Green Park, and the people that were in the Park crowded to see what was the matter; the noise was a little above where the centry stands in the Green Park; I went up, and found, on enquiry, that it was a man taken in woman's clothes; and upon retiring from the crowd in St. James's Park, in order to go home, the prisoner followed me; he came up to me, and said, how do you do, Sir? I did not know him at all; I asked him who he was, and he said, did not I remember the two soldiers that came with the drafts some time ago.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you left the crowd? - Yes; I returned through St. James's Park to go home.</p>
               <p>You chose to go through St. James's Park, sooner than the Green Park? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Park. Was the prisoner in his uniform? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner follow you? - Yes; I asked him who he was? he replied, did not I remember the two soldiers that came with the drafts some time ago; I answered, yes; but I do not know that you are one of them; upon which he said, I am the one that found the drafts, and you behaved very shabbily, and not like a gentleman, in giving us only a shilling each; I told him I thought it was enough, as I had shewn him Lord Sempill's book, that the drafts were entered, and were of no consequence; that he might have the drafts instead of the shilling. He said that was too little, and he must have more; I told him I would give him no more; but on his still insisting, I put my hand in my pocket, and gave him a shilling, and told him to go about his business; by this time, I had got into St. James's Park; the soldier was still following me, demanding more money; I repeated I will give you no more: he then said, if you do not give me some more money, I will swear an unnatural crime against you, and that you was with me in the Green Park when you lost the drafts; I can swear to your person, from having seen you at your house when I brought home the drafts. I walked on the footpath; I was much alarmed, and left he should have made his threats heard in the streets, I turned towards the Queen's House, by the tail of the Green Park, and stopped almost opposite where the two centinels stand, on the north side of the Queen's House; I told him I had only a half-crown and three sixpences, which I gave him; he said that would not do, he must have more; and then he said, I will go home with you: I told him that I did not know I had any if I was at home, but on his insisting, I then told him,</p>
               <p>"Meet me any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260036"></xptr> where that you please on Monday in particular, and I will give you a guinea," thinking by this means to make him desist, and get rid of him for the present, and bring assistance to apprehend him; finding all these means ineffectual, I told him I was a very improper person to accuse of such a crime, for a reason which I told the prisoner; he still insisted on having more money, and going home with me; I told him then to follow me home at a distance; when we had gone a little way, I saw him beckon to another soldier, and he said, there is a man that I know, he will go with us; I replied, you may bring whom you please. When I came to the end of Sackville-street, in Piccadilly, I told him to stand by the wall of St. James's Church-yard, while I went home for the money; in place of doing that, he followed me home to the door, and I came out, and gave him two guineas a little way from the door in Sackville-street: he then said, when shall I call on you for more? I told him I had given him too much; he still said he would call again; I then said, meet me at the Green Park-gate at St. James's Park on Monday night at eight o'clock, and I will give you another guinea; with the same intention I have said before, of apprehending him; and I made a point to consult my friends what I should do; the prisoner said, Sir, be sure to keep your appointment, or I shall call in a few days. Early the next morning, I went to Lord Sempill's house - Court. Properly speaking, we cannot hear from Mr. Drummond any thing that he said or did. - On the Monday evening I went to the place of appointment, and took with me Mr. Morant, an officer from Bow-street.</p>
               <p>What passed between you and the prisoner at the bar when you met him on Monday night? - It was some time after eight before the prisoner came; he came up to me, and asked me, in the same manner, how do you do, Sir? I said I was very well; he said; do not you recollect me; I said I had good reason to know him; that I knew him perfectly well, that he had used me very ill, and he said in what, I said in threatening to charge such a crime against me, and extorting money from me by those threats; the prisoner upon that said, he had been at my house on Sunday; Mr. Morant came up, and took him into custody; when we went to the bottom of St. James's-street, he asked me to let him have a coach, and not send him to the spunging house; I said you are going to Sir Sampson Wright's, and he may send you where he pleases; he replied, then he may send me to the devil.</p>
               <p>When was you examined at Bow-street? - On the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say for himself at Bow-street? - As nearly as I can recollect, he said about two months ago, he was standing in St. James's Park, by the rails of the two Parks, that I came up to him and asked him what o'clock it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the examination taken and returned of the prisoner in writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it signed by him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The examination sent for from Bow-street.)</p>
               <p>Court. Have you told us all you know excepting the examination of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any counsel for the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Then I will ask Mr. Drummond one or two questions. When the man first told you that if you did not give him more money, he would swear an unatural crime against you, what was the impression that it made on you? - I was very much alarmed indeed, I hardly knew where I was going, or what I was about for some time, having heard of several things of that kind before, it struck the more terror into my mind.</p>
               <p>What was the immediate mischief that you apprehended? - I thought he would take me into custody, and swear against me that crime.</p>
               <p>There were a number of people in the Green Park? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did it occur to you to return back to that crowd of people, or to apply to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260037"></xptr> centinels, or any person for assistance? - If I could not have got rid of him by fair means, so as to get quit of him that night.</p>
               <p>What was the reason of your turning to the Queen's house, instead of turning homewards? - I was afraid he would have made an uproar in the street, or have seized me there.</p>
               <p>Did it not occur to you, that in the street, you might easily have procured assistance? - I thought he might have seized me in the street, he being a much stronger man.</p>
               <p>Then you had an apprehension in your mind of immediate violence from him, if you did not give him what he required? - Most undoubtedly I had.</p>
               <p>Under what apprehension was it that you gave him the four shillings? - To get quit of him.</p>
               <p>But what apprehension if you did not? - I cannot exactly say, I was really in terror, I thought he would do something to me if I did not.</p>
               <p>Have you any kind of recollection by what means these drafts could have been lost out of your possession? - No other way than by putting them in my pocket in my own room, and as I frequently went to the Green Park, to the Park-keeper's house, and drank some milk of a morning before breakfast; I know of no other way that they could be lost.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is on account of your health I believe? - No, Sir, I am very fond of walking in a morning, I used to go very often, I am generally pretty much confined in the day, and I like to walk in a morning.</p>
               <p>I think you said your servant was present, when you first spoke to the soldier about the drafts, and you sent them to Lord Sempill's with the drafts, and that my Lord's servant came back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Should you have any recollection of the other man that came with the prisoner? - No, I knew him when I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Put your questions to me, and I will ask the prosecutor, if there is any thing I should ask him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, not particularly, only to speak for myself; I wish that Wether-hill, the other soldier, should be called.</p>
               <p>Court. He is here I understand, and if he is not called for the prosecutor, you certainly have a right to call him yourself.</p>

               <p>How soon did you see the prisoner after? - Last Sunday was a week, which was Easter Sunday, he came with a note, and asked if Mr. Drummond was at home; I asked him which, Mr. William, or Mr. David; he said, you remember my bringing two notes with a soldier some time ago; says he, it is him that I want; says I, he is not at home, and may not come home all day; says he, then you may take the note to his brother; says I, it is not his brother but his uncle; says he, take it to him; I said his uncle has no business with his notes; but I took it up stairs to him, to satisfy him; but I did not give it to Mr.

               <p>Court to Allen. Is this what the prisoner said at Bow-street, and did you take it down yourself? - It is just as he said, word by word; I wrote it myself as he delivered it, I saw him sign it.</p>
               <p>Did you read it over to him? - It was read by me to him before he signed it.</p>

               <p>How long have you been a soldier, distinguished from a drummer? - Three months ago.</p>
               <p>Do you remember going to Mr. Drummond's in Sackville-street at any time with two drafts? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it? - At the time I was at the recruit-house learning my exercise, after I had inlisted as a soldier.</p>
               <p>Who went with you? - The prisoner Harwood.</p>
               <p>What did you go for? - To enquire about the notes that I had found.</p>
               <p>When had you found them? - I found them six months before I was a soldier; I had them by me all that time, I did not think any thing about them; I shewed them to the prisoner, and asked him what he thought of them? he said he thought if he had coloured clothes, He could draw the money; I told him I would not think of any such thing, but that if he pleased he might go with me to Mr. Drummond's at Charing Cross, and enquire about them, and he appointed the next day, but he did not come till about a week after.</p>

               <p>Where did you both go to make the enquiry first? - To Mr. Drummond the Banker at Charing Cross, and he directed us to Sackville-street; we went both together; we saw the servant first, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260040"></xptr> went and carried the notes to Mr. Drummond, and he came out and told us to go up to Lord Sempill's, and ask him about the notes, as the notes came from one Lewis, his servant. We went there, and saw the servant; we were to go and enquire of them how they had been lost; we saw Mr. Drummond before we went, and he wrote down directions where to find my Lord, and wrote upon them, not to be paid.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner go with you to Lord Sempill's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were informed there that the drafts had been paid? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who went back with you to Mr. Drummond's? - The servant of my Lord, and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any conversation that passed, as you was going along? - I told the servant I found these notes in the Park.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him how long before you had found them? - I cannot recollect that.</p>
               <p>Tell us, as well as you can recollect, all that passed, in your way to Mr. Drummond's? - We did not say any thing to the servant hardly, excepting telling him we found them in the Park; when we came back to Mr. Drummond, we went up stairs to the compting-house, and he looked over the books, and found the notes had been paid, and gave us a shilling apiece for our trouble.</p>
               <p>Did you and the prisoner go away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you make any complaint, or say any thing else? - No.</p>
               <p>You expressed no discontentment? - No; then we went to the sign of the Madman in St. James's street, and there we had a couple of pots of porter, and then I parted with him.</p>
               <p>At that time had you ever seen Mr. Drummond before in your life? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner claim any acquaintance with Mr. Drummond? - No; he said to me that he had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Did he say so expressly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any person with you at the time you found these notes? - No, I was by myself, in the Green Park.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner at the time you found the notes? - Yes, I have known him for a year or two.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Mr. Drummond again till after the prisoner was in custody, upon any occasion whatever? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any conversation with the prisoner about Mr. Drummond, or about his character? - No, never at all.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the prisoner after that day you was at Mr. Drummond's, till he was taken into custody? - I never saw him till yesterday.</p>
               <p>Did not you see him at Bow-street? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. You was with Harwood twice at Mr. Drummond's house about these drafts? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which of you conversed with Mr. Drummond? - Harwood; I told him to converse with him, because I have an impediment in my speech; the second time, I believe neither of us spoke a word to Mr. Drummond; he told us the notes had been paid.</p>
               <p>You had full opportunity then, both you and particularly Harwood, who talked to Mr. Drummond, to know him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner, after you left Mr. Drummond, either of the times, or at any other time, express any intimation that he had seen Mr. Drummond before? - No, Sir; he spoke of him as a person that he had never seen before.</p>
               <p>And that after the last time you had seen Mr. Drummond? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect going with Mr. Drummond in the Park any time lately? - Yes, I saw Mr. Drummond at the office, I had no warrant, I was ordered to go to the sign of the Goat, to wait there till I was sent for, that was in consequence of an application from Mr. Drummond; I was ordered to come there again at seven on Monday evening, I went at seven, I saw Mr. Drummond, he desired I would walk into the Park near the new iron rails, next the Green Park, and there to remain till he came into the Park, and to keep my eye upon him when he came in, I told him I did not know that I should know him, but when he first came into the Park, to go strait across which he did, he walked near twenty minutes, he crossed me again, and said he would go into the stable yard, he returned again, and as soon as he came back by the rails, I saw Mr. Drummond and the prisoner at the bar together, I then made up to them as soon as I could, and Mr. Drummond said, says he, you have extorted money from me by threatening me; I then told the soldier he was my prisoner, I must take him before a magistrate;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260043"></xptr> the soldier answered me, he was not a gentleman, he was sure he would never use him so, to take him into custody; he then walked on through the stable-yard by the guard-house, and the prisoner said, do not go near the guard-house door, accordingly we came into St. James's street, and then I had a coach; the prisoner asked me where I was going to, and I said to Sir Sampson Wright's; the prisoner then said he does not mean to swear a robbery against me does he? he should consider me, my pay is but very low.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Do you wish to ask the officer any question? - No.</p>
               <p>The Rt. Hon. Lord SEMPILL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am acquainted with Mr. Drummond; on Saturday morning, I think about eight o'clock he came to me, and was in great distress, and asked my advice, I told him.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot permit you, my Lord, to relate the particulars of that conversation, as the prisoner was not present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have done.</p>
               <p>Court. Now prisoner, this is the proper time for you to state what you have to say in your own defence; you know what the charge is against you, and you have heard the evidence.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Please you my Lord, in the month of February, I was coming through St. James's Park, and I met Mr. Drummond, and he said to me, soldier what is it o'clock? that was the word he said to me, I told him I did not know; he then asked me to stop, and asked me if there were any common women in the Park, I told him I did not know; he told me to look for one, but I would not; then he unbuttoned his breeches and at the same time attempted to take hold of my breeches, and I began to make a noise, I said oh fie! Mr. Drummond; he put some silver into my hand, and left me; I saw no more of him till I went with the notes, and then I saw no more of him, till there was a disturbance in the Park, and then I said, Mr. Drummond, Sir, how do you do? says he, do you know me? I said, Sir, I went to your house, and do not you recollect ill-treating me so in the Park, about two months back? he said yes; and he desired me to make no disturbance, and he gave me one half crown and three sixpences to make no disturbance, and I went to him to his house, and he gave me two guineas; he desired me to meet him on the Monday night, and he would give me another guinea; I was on duty, and I wrote him two notes to let him know I could not meet him; when I came into the Park to get the guinea, this gentleman was with him, and took me up for saying I should swear an unnatural crime to him, which I never mentioned any such words.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses to call? - I have no witnesses, there was nobody but our two selves.</p>
               <p>Have you any body to give you a character? - No, I have no friends in town.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I wish to call witnesses to contradict this.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not see that there is any charge against Mr. Drummond but the prisoner's defence; and that is unsupported by any evidence but the prisoner's own allegation.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the nature of this robbery being an uncommon one, has been stated to you by the learned counsel, who opened the prosecution; and it differs from the common generally received idea of robberies in this; that in these cases, no personal violence is actually used, nor is there any immediate threat of bodily harm, which are circumstances that in common cases constitute highway robberies; when, therefore, the first case of this sort occurred in a court of justice, considerable doubt was entertained, whether an indictment for a highway robbery (which implies the idea either of actual force, or fear, as it was generally understood, of life, or bodily injury) whether an indictment for that offence could be supported by circumstances, similar to those which are now in evidence before you, and charged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260044"></xptr> on the prisoner; on the first case of that kind it was reserved for the solemn opinion of all the Judges, upon a question of law being a subject of great importance; for on the one hand it was of consequence that the law should not be improperly stretched to a case to which it did not apply; on the other hand the publick was concerned in the punishment of a crime, which, if not a highway robbery, was certainly not of a less magnitude. The Judges were unanimously of opinion, that upon the principles of law, and former decisions, it did sufficiently come within the law to constitute the offence of a highway robbery, and that that terror, and apprehension of mischief, following the refusal of money, though not a threat, or actual violence in the person, was yet a sufficient threat in point of law, to constitute the offence by putting in fear; therefore under that description, and considering this fear, as coming within the meaning of the law, it was unanimously determined on that occasion, to be a highway robbery in point of law: upon that the prisoner received judgment; but being the first case, it was not carried into execution. Another case has occured within my knowledge, in which a prisoner was convicted and executed for that offence. In considering this question it becomes of considerable consequence, because the life of a prisoner on the one hand, and the character of the prosecutor on the other, in a point not less valuable than life, are materially affected; therefore I have no doubt, that you have paid that attention which the nature of this case requires; and it is the more necessary, because the cases are generally to be decided, and the truth come at, more by minute circumstances connected with the conduct of the parties, than by the direct allegations of the parties either of the one side or the other; for the prosecutor who comes to charge this particular kind of highway robbery against the prisoner, certainly comes with so strong a bias on his own mind, and with so great an interest in the verdict, that it is fortunate for justice, and the prosecutor himself, where circumstances occur, so far to remove that sort of doubt from the case, which otherwise would rest upon it, if it stood on the prosecutor's own oath, standing on that situation, whatever the character of the prosecutor may be. You are therefore to consider, whether you can make out circumstances from the testimony of other witnesses, and from clear and indisputable facts, to remove all darkness from a case that is frequently involved in great obscurity. Mr. Drummond is the first, and from the nature of the case, the most material witness. [Here the learned Judge repeated his evidence, and added] With respect to the impression of the prosecutor's mind, it will go the full length, and rather further than the case I mentioned to you, and there cannot be the least doubt in point of law, that this charge made by Mr. Drummond, is sufficient to support the indictment; and Mr. Drummond's conduct is a proof how difficult it is to judge properly at the moment; most undoubtedly he was led to give the money through fear, which was the most indiscreet thing he could have done; for giving way to the first attack of this kind obliges the party either to lay under perpetual contributions to people of this sort, or make the complaint under greater disadvantages; and it is always a disagreeable situation to fall into; but it is a situation to which men with the best intentions, and the most reputable characters may fall under such an accusation; therefore, the mere circumstance of yielding to the impression of fear in the moment, ought not to carry the presumption of any thing like guilt in the party: the indecent conduct is disproved, independant of the prosecutor's evidence; not only by the evidence of Wetherhill, but this going to Lord Sempill, was an additional proof that they did not know Mr. Drummond before; if therefore you believe the prisoner obtained this money from Mr. Drummond by those threats, and that he delivered it under the impression of fear, which he has stated, from fear of injury to his character, of being apprehended for a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260045"></xptr> capital crime, or from an apprehension of personal violence; in that case, you will find the prisoner guilty: but if you can conceive the smallest ground for supposing there is any truth in the story of the prisoner, which would give any colour for his applying for money; or if you have any doubt of the truth of Mr. Drummond's story, in that case you will acquit the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Drummond having been under the painful necessity of bringing forward such a prosecution, it certainly is but justice to him to say, that his character is free from the smallest degree of imputation whatever; and there cannot be a shadow of doubt on any man's mind on the subject.</p>

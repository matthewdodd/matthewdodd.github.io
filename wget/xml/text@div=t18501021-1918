                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Stiff, of 2, Streatham-place, Brixton, printer. On 24th Sept. I was alone in the house; and about five o'clock a very dark man came and leaned over the gate—I was at the bed<lb></lb>room window, and he said, "Is this No. 3?"—I said, "No; it is on the left hand"—he went that way, but I cannot say whether he went in—he came back, and said, "I have made a mistake; is not this Mr. Stiff's?"—I said, "Yes, sir, it is; what do you please to want?"—he said, "There is a person you know, nigh Fleet-street, has met with an accident, in getting out of an omnibus, she fell on her head"—he did not tell me who the person was—I should not know him again, it was not either of the prisoners—he said, "You are to take a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> directly"—I locked up the house, and every place I could think of, took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at Brixton Church, and went to 334, Strand, the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Times</hi> Office, where my sister was—I saw her directly I got there, and, as far as I could ascertain, no accident had happened to her—I returned with her and the porter, in the same <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> to Brixton—I got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> first, and saw a light in my bedroom—the porter then got out, got two or three men, got a ladder, and got in at the window—he opened the front door, and I went in, went to my bedroom, and saw a light on the floor against the window—there are no shutters—I missed a fur coat from the passage, which I had seen safe at five o'clock, when I went out—from the parlour I missed the cruet-stand; and the silver tops, the top of the mustard-pot, and two pep<lb></lb>per boxes, were wrenched off—the lid of the piano was wrenched open, and Mr. Stiff's gold box taken out from there, where he usually kept it—I went to my bedroom, and missed 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold from a drawer, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, belonging to me; and another 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold in a red bag, and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in halfpence, belonging to me; and a silver watch</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer to Mr. Stiff. Taylor was in his employ at the time this happened, and Costello was so about three months before—Taylor worked at the printing-office at Brixton, about 300 yards from the dwelling-house—two or three weeks or a month before the robbery, Taylor told me he had put Costello <hi rend="italic">on to</hi> Mr. Martin's—Mr. Martin is Mr. Stiff's foreman—the day after that, he told me that they were disturbed by a cat, and all cats ought to be stuck with a knife—about a week before this robbery, he told me he should put Costello <hi rend="italic">on to</hi> Mr. Stiff's—he said he went, and tried the key to the lock in the Strand, and had not a key big enough; but Costello had—on the night this robbery happened, we left work at five o'clock, and Taylor went away—he said he was going to the Crown and Sceptre, and would wait for us—the rest stopped till about a quarter to six—I then went to the Crown and Sceptre, about thirty yards off, and saw Taylor there—we had some porter, and stayed till about half-past six—Taylor then went down Brixton<lb></lb>hill with his father—I heard of the robbery next morning, and recollect a man named Haydon telling Taylor that Mr. Stiff had had his house broken open—Taylor laughed, and nodded his head, and turned quite red—the same morning Taylor told me he was going to Drury-lane to get his <hi rend="italic">whack</hi> of the money—the same evening he came to me, and said, "Be on your guard; you will have the <hi rend="italic">pigs</hi> on you all down the road"—I did not exactly know what he meant, and said, "I have nothing to fear or care"—I have heard him say that <hi rend="italic">pigs</hi> means "policemen"—he said he should disguise himself, and take the other road; and before he went I saw him tie a handkerchief round his neck, which was contrary to his usual dress—it went round twice, and came over his chin—I did not make any communication to Mr. Martin of Mr. Stiff—I thought he was joking.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector P.</hi>) I examined Mr. Stiff's premises—there are a pair of large folding coach-house doors, and at the top of one of them there was a hole cut; apparently it bad been done some time—any person, by laying hold of that hole, and putting their feet against the door, could open it sufficiently for the bolt to fly away from the staple—two inches below that the door was split, as if there had been some violence—there is a door in the coach-house into the wash house, the latch of which was slightly bent, and it could be pushed open—the next door, leading from the washhouse to the kitchen, had the beading broken off, and there were marks such as such an instrument as this chisel would make (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was delivered to me, having been found in the front parlour—a brick was out at the side of the washhouse and kitchen-door; and a person, by putting their hand through there, could reach the bolt and open it—the door leading from the kitchen to the rest of the house had the lower panel out, so that a person could put their hand through and undo the the bolt—it appeared to have been done with such an instrument as this—I did not notice that any locks had been picked—I took Taylor next day, and told him what he was charged with—he made no reply—in consequence of information I took Rie and Haines to Newgate, introduced them to a party of twenty prisoners or more, and Haines picked Costello out from among them.</p>

On 24th Sept, from twenty minutes to half-past five o'clock, I went to Mr. Stiff's with some milk, and knocked at the door three times; I waited a considerable time between each knock—as I was coming out of the gate, I met Adams just out<lb></lb>side the gate—he said a sad accident had occurred, and I could not enter the house, the parties were gone—I asked what accident it was, and he said, "Oh! I shan't tell you now, but to-morrow very likely you will hear"—there was another man two or three yards off, leaning against the fence, and Adams walked off with him down Streatham-place, and I went on to Streatham—I could not be positive who the other man was, but to the best of my belief it was Gosling.</p>

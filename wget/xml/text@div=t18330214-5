On the 11th of February, about a quarter past ten or eleven o'clock at night, there were five snuff-boxes in the window; I was in the parlour - the shop shutters were open; I heard a noise at the window, jumped up immediately, and ran to the window; I saw the prisoner put down the glass and run away - I am certain he is the man; I never lost sight of him; my husband was in the parlour with me - he ran out and seized him close at hand. I had seen the glass secure just before, and found it had been cut - it was perfectly whole before; five snuff-boxes and thirty-six cigars were taken from inside the window - three of the snuff-boxes were afterwards picked up close on the spot, and nineteen of the cigars.</p>
               <p>JOHN NOEL. This is my dwelling-house. I did not hear the window break - my wife alarmed me; I ran out immediately, and seized the prisoner about twenty yards from the house; I never lost sight of him after he left my door - there was another person running with him who escaped, as they separated. The Policeman picked up the cigars - I followed him till I saw the Policeman take him.</p>

            , a carver and gilder - I live in the neighbourhood. I was passing by Noel's house on the night in question, and saw the prisoner standing at the window, and another lad, in a dark place, two or three doors further down; I went on to the butcher's shop, and found it shut - as I came back the prisoner and another were coming at full run from the prosecutor's house; the gas lamp was lighted, and the gin shop gave a full light: I could distinctly see his face - he ran by me, and threw the property down close at my side. I immediately went back to the prosecutor's, and said, whatever he had taken he had thrown away in Britannia-street - the Policeman took the lantern, and found nineteen cigars and three boxes there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came from Maidenhead that morning - I was going home at a quarter to eleven o'clock, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw two men running by Tenter-row - I ran after one of them, and at the bottom of Britannia-street, I ran up Plummer-street: they then said they had run round a turning by the public-house; I lost sight of them, and stopped in the street; the Policeman ran by me, turned round, and said, "Have you seen them run this way;" somebody said No; he then caught hold of me.</p>

On the 28th of November, I found a cap and frill folded up in paper and put in a closet, which created my suspicions. He slept in the premises to take care of them. The same evening, after the shop was shut, I looked through the shutter, and saw him go to the glass cases, and take the lace boxes. Next morning I got an officer, watched him out, and stopped him in Lincoln's-inn-fields, as he was going towards my other house, in the Strand. I asked him for the key of the shop, he gave it to me. I told him to wait till I returned. I went to the shop, and found the cap and frill were gone from the closet. I returned, and asked him what he had done with the cap and frill, he said he had got them. I asked what business he had with them, he said he was going to give them to his sister. I beckoned to the officer, who came and took him, and found the frill, cap, and nine yards of lace on him. He said, he was sorry for it, and he never took anything before.</p>

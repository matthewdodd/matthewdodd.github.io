            . I live in Holborn with my father, a hatter and hosier; on the 13th of November, some women came into the shop, the prisoner was not one; I followed those women, the prisoner at the bar was following them; I heard no conversation between them; just at Staples Inn Gate, they joined, I saw the women put some articles into the prisoner's lap.</p>
               <p>What do mean by articles? - Sundry things; the prisoner was pushing down towards Castle-yard, I stopped her, and asked her what she had got in her apron; she told me, old cloaths; I pushed her cloak aside; the first thing that occured to me, was the silk stockings, and other things she stole from my father's; I brought her back to my father's, the other women made their escape, they were well dressed, she said she had picked them up, it happened to be a rainy, dirty day, and they were not the least soiled; this alamode was in her lap, as was the other property that was found, and delivered to the owners.</p>
               <p>Did you see this alamode put in by the women? - I did not see the alamode in particular, but I saw them put in some articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>This was by Staples Inn Gate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw the other women? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why not secure them? - I had no assistance; I was not quite two yards from them, when they were put into her lap; whether she spoke I could not tell; at the justice's, she said, first she picked them up; and at another examination, not the first, she said, they were given her by those women.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner said nothing in her defence. The following persons were called to speak to her character.</p>

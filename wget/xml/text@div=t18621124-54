I am a merchant, carrying on business at No. 10, Cloak-lane—on the 4th of November I had several pictures in my office—I went out somewhere about the middle of the day—the five pictures (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I left there—I returned in about a quarter of an hour—the pictures were then gone—I had a latch key—I think, probably, I left the door open; I do not think I locked it—the value of the pictures is about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Folkard, pawnbroker, of No. 16, London-road, Southwark—I have seen the prisoner White before—he pledged two of the paintings produced on the 4th November—it was about noontime—he pledged them for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the name of Archibald White—Atkins pledged two other paintings later in the day, in the name of John Atkins—I knew the prisoners before—I had seen White before, pledging—I declined to take the pictures at first—I questioned White as to the ownership of the pictures—I told him I could not take them unless he got a note from the owner—he said he was sent by a young man who lived in his father's house, who was something of an artist, and had a quantity of paintings, and he wanted money—I said, "If that is the case, you must bring a note from him authorising me to take them in;" and he did so—when Atkins brought the pictures later in the day, as I lent a less sum, and as they did not appear, according to my judgment, to be such valuable paintings as the other two, and he appearing much older, I did not take any notice of that—I lent him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them—having had information, I sent for a constable.</p>

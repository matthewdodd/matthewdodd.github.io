The prisoner was in my employ up to the 20th of September - it was his business to receive money from different tradesmen, to whom I trust goods; he was to enter the sums received in a book in which the names are entered, and to hand over the money to me when he came home. Teece is a customer of mine; I have the book here, which the prisoner kept, and in which he ought to enter his accounts; he has not entered the sum of 8s. on the <rs id="t18271025-96-cd573" type="crimeDate">17th of July</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. This was in the course of tally-trade, was it not? A. Yes. I cannot tell how many persons he had to collect from, perhaps one hundred and fifty. I have other persons who collect money - I do not mean to state their accounts are always correct; I have found them to bring me more money than they have put down; he brought home on the 17th of July, 24l. 9s. 8d. - it did not include the 8s., for I have gone all over the account: the cash he paid that days was 4s. more than he had entered.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Have you discovered any other sum deficient in the entry that day? A. Yes, there is one other sum I have discovered. The prisoner left my service suddenly - he has not accounted for this 8s. since; he was apprehended ten days after he left me - he came to my shop on the 25th of September.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he come for? A. To demand his wages and clothes; I said I should not give them till I had looked over his accounts; he said I had no right to detain his clothes, he should bring an officer; I said he might do as he liked, I should be satisfied before I gave them up - I have not given them up. He had been in my service about twelve months - it was my intention to discharge him, in consequence of his irregular habits.</p>

            . I am the wife of Thomas Teece, who is a carpenter, and lives in Garden-place. I paid the prisoner 1l. 17s., at different times - I paid this 8s. on the 17th of July - here is the receipt he gave for it - it was for Mr. Thompson.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Thompson; the prisoner was in his employ till the 20th of September; he went away that day - he had not been discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had there been any dispute with him and you about the irregular time he came to sleep? - A. Yes; my orders were, to admit no one after ten o'clock- he was out all night frequently, and used to return in the morning; I locked him out two or three times; we had some words about it; I know the nature of the business the prisoner had to transact - errors will sometimes happen in it - it does sometimes happen that more money is paid to my master than is down in the book.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Are not these things made right soon afterwards? A. Yes; it is set right the following week - the prisoner never gave an explanation of this 8s., to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. As I understand you, the errors in the book would be detected by looking at the book itself? A. Yes, if there was more paid than was put down in the book; I have known such errors so detected; or by going round the next week, we can see by the bill that more was received than was down; Mr. Teece still continued on his list.</p>
               <p>JANE TEECE re-examined. He called after the 17th of July, but that was the last time I paid him, as it was not convenient.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master has been in the habit of putting down in his ledger such, and such a sum of money received, to make the book right, and he has done so when there have been errors; this book lasts thirteen weeks, and here are seven out of the thirteen wrong.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMPSON re-examined. Q. Who keeps this book? A. A young man named Chapman; here are seven weeks wrong, but the error was detected immediately I looked it over - it was an error in his putting it down, but he is a very bad scholar; the prisoner knows that; and is a very good scholar - here are thirty-six weeks of his without a mistake; he has contrived to make the accounts agree. I have no reason to suspect Chapman of dishonesty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not the duty of the prisoner to put down on the bill the sum he received? A. Yes - I do not go round to their houses, or I should have detected the mistake - he would go till the bill was settled.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you made a minute of the 4s. which was overpaid? A. Yes, here it is.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 83, Whitechapel-road—Jeremiah Roscow was in my employ, as a mattress-maker, during the whole of last April—I have seen some carpetting which was found at Mr. Dawson's—this is it—this is what is called a Persian carpet—it was in my possession in March last—I never sold it—I should have been able to tell if I had—Jere<lb></lb>miah Roscow had access to the carpet-room, to go up to the mattress-room—he had no business with the carpet at all—I have seen two counterpanes, a quantity of linen, and sixteen or seventeen bed<lb></lb>ticks, value 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12.—here is some bed<lb></lb>lace and tick that was given to Jeremiah Roscow, to make up—the lace he ought to have returned—I believe all this to be my property.</p>

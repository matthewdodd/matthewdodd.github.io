                  </hi>. I live at Everett's Place, St. George's-in-the-East—about 1 o'clock on the 25th of March, I was in Backchurch Lane, going home—Mr. Telford's daughter's husband was with me—we met three men; I stepped off the pavement to make room—the prisoner Bryan lunged at me with his shoulder—I said "Why did you do that old <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>" and he up with his fist and hit me in the mouth—it was light enough for him to see that I was an old man—he knocked me down—I got up; be knocked me down again; I then sat on a step—Telford then said to Bryan "What made you hit the—old man"—Bryan then struck at Telford, who stood in his own defence and struck Bryan—they kept on tussling, and Bryan came and laid hold of me and knocked me about—Telford went away to get assistance, Bryan held me, and one of them tried to get his hand in my, pocket—at least three men were there—I am sure the prisoners are two of them; I kept my hand in my pocket on my money—I had is. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some' half-pence—I called "Murder "and "Police," and some women did so out of their windows—they then all ran away; after I got up I saw a policeman coming with Bryan in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I was walking with Cheeseman,' when I saw two big <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> coming along singing; I stepped off the pavement—Bryan shoved Cheeseman by the shoulder, and when he went to speak hit Mr. Cheeseman in the mouth, he fell and got up again-Bryan hit him again—Bryan hit him again—I said "You ought to be ashamed of yourself to hit an old man like that"—three or four men then laid hold of me, and Bryan put his hand in my pocket—I had not then struck any<lb></lb>body,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090009"></xptr>
               <p>nor had the old man been guilty of any violence; he could not speak—I ran away and fetched a policeman—when I got back they were all running away—there were six or seven of them—I recognised both prisoners—I will swear to Murphy being there as well as Bryan—Murphy kicked the police<lb></lb>man in the leg—the policeman then let Bryan go and caught Murphy.</p>

I was called by Telford to go to Backchurch Lane—I saw Cheeseman standing up against the wall, bleeding from his hands and mouth—the two prisoners were near him, and another man walking very fast, about 3 yards away—Murphy was one—I laid hold of Bryan and Murphy kicked me three times and said "A knife for a d----<hi rend="italic">copper</hi>"—I then apprehended him and took him to the station—Bryan afterwards gave himself up and said he struck the old man and not Murphy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil and colourman, at 39, Collett-place, Commercial-road. On 23rd Nov., the prisoner brought me this note—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Mr. Green, be so good as to lend Mr. Choat 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay the expense of the cart breaking down.—Henry White.")—I knew Mr. Choat's name as a customer of mine, but I cannot say that I ever saw him—I knew White, and gave the prisoner the 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I never saw him till he gave me into custody. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am quite certain he is the man—I cannot say that I had ever seen him before, but I knew him again directly I saw him—it was between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day that he came—I think he had on a smock frock, and a cap—I do not think there was any one in the shop but me—I was busy when he came—he was not there more than two or three minutes—I did not at first tell the Magistrate that this happened on a Thursday, and then correct myself and say Saturday; I will not swear I did not, I do not recollect anything of the sort.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How long have you known me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between six and seven years—you have helped me to load carts and wagons at different times when I have been at market—when you have been out of the way I have employed different people—on 23rd Nov. I came to Whitechapel market with straw—I did not see you that day—some days afterwards when I came up, you told me that you had been loading Mr. Long's scum cart from Kent on 23rd, and that when you came to the market I had gone on to the Borough, and you then went to load a cart in Bishopsgate-street—you accounted to me for your time on the 23rd in that way—when you told me this I had heard that somebody had been to Mr. Green's, and got this 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told you I had suspicion.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on 4th Dec.—I told him I wanted him to come with me—he asked what for—I said, "For obtaining money from this gentleman, under false pretences"—Mr. Green was with me—the prisoner said, "I have obtained no money, neither do I know that gentleman, for I have never seen him before"—Mr. Green had pointed the prisoner out to me as he was loading a wagon with dung for White in King-street, Poplar.</p>

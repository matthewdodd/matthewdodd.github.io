                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, at 3, Garden Row, London Road—about 10 o'clock at night, on 3rd February, I was passing St. George's Church, coming from my work—I felt a hand in my coat pocket, where I had a handkerchief and rule—I put my hand in, seized the hand, and held it—it was the prisoner's hand—he had the rule in his hand—the handkerchief dropped on the pavement—he struck me in the eye to release himself, and I gave him into the custody of a constable, who came up immediately—I was not the worse for drink—I had had two glasses of whiskey and water at Hackney, but nothing since.</p>

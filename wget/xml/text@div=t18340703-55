The prisoner was five weeks in my service - she was only engaged for a month - on the 30th of May, she was leaving - I observed her pocket very bulky - we were looking for a spoon which was lost - I said I must have it found before she left - I saw something very bulky in her pocket - I said, "You have something very large in your pocket, what is it?" - she said it was only her handkerchief - I said, "It is something hard; you had better come out, and let me see what it is" - she stopped a little behind, and at last came out - I said, "Allow me to see what it is; you had better bring it out; it is more than a handkerchief" - she hesitated; then pulled out some cuffs and collars, and black-lead done up in a paper - she dropped some velvet, where she stood, by the side of a platewarmer; but that was not seen at that time - the property in her pocket was mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Her connexions are very respectable? A. I understand so, and from that motive I took her - I believe the family are reduced - she was servant of all work - she received more wages than she could possibly expect, according to agreement - I paid her nothing - I did not pay her any money, except what I gave her - I did sometimes give her money - if I sent her to dine with her aunt, I gave her a shilling - I gave her money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030034"></xptr>to spend - she received in my house 13s., or thereabout, within a trifle, from gentlemen who lodged with me - I hired her on these terms - some gentlemen were coming to lodge with me; they were very generous persons, and I knew she would receive money - the articles produced are my property - she took them out of her pocket - the shirtcollars were taken from a paper of many dozens - I kept a shop, in Newgate-street, sixteen years - the house is now pulled down - they are part of the stock - I have marks sufficient to know they are mine - I know my own work on some of them - I engage a sempstress to work for me - I can swear they are my property; it is my shape, my cutting out - I always cut out every thing - I am quite positive I cut out that collar - this calico was in her box - this velvet I can swear to.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you articles of the same description as those produced? A. Yes; I have - there are some remaining of the same texture - I kept the articles in a box, on a high shelf, in a sort of kitchen - the articles are worth 12s.</p>

             (City police-constable No. 56). I apprehended the prisoner and produce the things - the five collars and pair of cuffs were produced when I was fetched - I received them from Mrs. Acocks.</p>
               <p>MARY ACOCKS re-examined. I have lost a good deal of property before - I never preferred a complaint against any servant - a man robbed my shop fifteen years ago - I prosecuted him - I have not prosecuted any body since - a woman stole a watch from a gentleman in my house; I went to Guildhall about that; I have no recollection of any other case - this girl was brought to me as a country girl, from Plymouth; and the mother is a sempstress who worked for me - she said the prisoner had arrived from Plymouth, but I found it was all a trick - I sometimes take a servant a month on liking - she was going - it was her wish to go, as she knew I had found out she had not come from the country.(

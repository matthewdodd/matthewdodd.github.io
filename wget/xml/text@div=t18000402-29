             sworn. - I am a constable; Allen, the watchman, fetched me to Mr. Bloomfield's house; I went there, and made the prisoner get up; I first asked him where his clothes were, he told me they were on the ground; I took up his coat, and being weighty, I put my hand into the pocket and found a quantity of penny-pieces, and halfpence, amounting to eleven shillings and five-pence halfpenny; and in his waistcoat-pocket I found a stick of Spanish liquorice, and a paper of pins; I took the bed off the bedstead, and next the sacking I found two brown paper bags of lump sugar, one parcel of moist sugar, and a parcel of tea; I then went to the other side of the bed, and I found a parcel of tea in a paper which the watchman had seen in the bed; I then went to the drawers, and found a parcel of halfpence and farthings, to the amount of upwards of two shillings. (Produces the property).</p>

               <p>ANN BLOOMFIELD sworn. - I am the wife of Henry Bloomfield: I saw my husband shut up the shop that night; he locked it up; there are sliding shutters in grooves upon the counter; and there was a little place where he got in, between the window-shutters; a little place that we could not suppose a man could get in at; there were no paper parcels in the shop when we went to bed; we were alarmed between two and three o'clock; I got up and saw some parcels containing tea and sugar; it had been put up in parcels in the course of the night; I had left a great deal of copper in the till, I cannot tell to what amount; there was enough taken out for me to miss them; there were a quantity of penny-pieces among them, I cannot say how many; the bag that the sugar was in I made up myself; the prisoner had lodged in our house thirteen months, he is a journeyman tailor.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these articles, and see if you know any of them? - A. I have every reason to believe they are mine; these are the same kind of bags that I make up; I missed both green and black tea, the canisters were not so heavy as they were when I left them the night before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I went up to go to bed I found the halfpence and the pins and the Spanish liquorice concealed in the closet; I immediately took it up, and put it in my pocket, with intention to enquire about it the next morning, but was prevented by being distubed by the watchman; as to the tea and sugar, I never saw it till the watchman came to disturb me. As for the halfpence that I had in the drawers, I had taken some time before; they are bad halfpence that were not current.</p>
               <p>Constable. The place was big enough for me to have got in.</p>

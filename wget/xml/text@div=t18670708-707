               <p>had dined between two and three, and had nearly half a pint of stout and two glasses of port wine; that was all I had drank the whole of the day—about a quarter-past five I was proceeding from Roehampton to to Putney Heath—that was the road I had been constantly in the habit of going on certain Wednesdays, not every Wednesday—my attention was called to some footsteps of persons walking behind me in the same direction as myself—I heard them before they were in sight—they were the footsteps of more than one person—there are gas lamps in the road, about 180 yards apart; it was between two of these lamps that I heard the parties coming behind me—I turned round to look after them, and by shading my eyes with my umbrella I got a very fair view of their faces as they approached the first gas-lamp I came to—I then passed that lamp, and about forty yards beyond the parish lamp is the lamp of Ash<lb></lb>burton Lodge, and between the parish and that lamp I looked round about three or four times to have a view of the parties who were coming behind me—seeing a recess at Ashburton House, I stood up in it, shading my eyes with my umbrella, and only ten feet from Ashburton Lodge lamp I had a full view of the men from the parish lamp to the Ashburton Lodge lamp—the prisoner was the near side man and the shorter of the two—I watched them as they approached me, came opposite to me, and advanced beyond me—I stood still until they had passed from twelve to twenty yards; I then walked after them in the same direction for about seventy yards—they then parted company, the prisoner turning to the near side, the taller one into the road—the prisoner approached me with a few hasty steps, and with a polished instrument, loaded, an instrument glazing in the gas-lamp—he struck me on the left side of the head, cutting my left ear open; he then struck me two blows with the same weapon on the right side of the head, giving me a wound of about two or two and a half inches long, from which the blood flowed freely; he then struck me on the top of the head—meanwhile his companion came up and wrested from me my umbrella, with which I had endeavoured to defend myself—having lost my umbrella, I pressed my arm and hand against my side, so that my assaitant behind should not get his hand in to feel the bulk of cash I had—he drew his hands down my side, and felt a weight in my skirt coat pockets; they were very bulky—he tripped up my heels, and I fell on my back; I rolled over on to my left side, so as to give them all the trouble I could, for the sake of getting time to protect my cash—in rolling over I threw my right arm over, and the prisoner caught me a blow on the thumb with the life<lb></lb>preserver, which gave me a bad thumb for three months—the prisoner then stood on my neck with his right foot, and his left foot on the bottom of my bowels—the man behind mo raised my overcoat and seized my undercoat, and ultimately tore out the skirt-pockets in this way (<hi rend="italic">producing the coat</hi>); he tore up the two sides and then across the top—while the pri<lb></lb>soner's foot was on my neck I had some difficulty in breathing, and I offered some resistance—he then struck me three hard blows in front of my head, breaking it in three places—I coolly said, "Take all, but don't murder me"—I repeated this twice, knowing at the same time that what they were tearing from me was of no value—I was not struck afterwards—they left me immediately, tripped over a little rill of water at the side of the road, and scampered across Putney Heath—there was a ledger and a book of poems in my skirt-pocket, both bulky—I picked up my umbrella and a glove; I had a thick riding-glove on this hand, and the other glove was off—after finding my umbrella and glove I walked to the Green Man</p>

               <p>driven in a fly from the hotel to the doctor's that night—the driver never asked me if I should know the men if I saw them—he never spoke to me—it is not true that I said to him I should not know the men again—I never talked to the man—I did not say to Superintendent Butt that I should not know the two men again if I saw them—I never said so to anybody—no entry to that effect to my knowledge was made in any book at the station—I have never expressed myself to the effect that the man who robbed me was in the service of Young and Bainbridge—at one of the hearings before the Magistrate I asked to be allowed to retire from the case—I assigned as a reason that there were two or three persons who I expected would have identified the prisoner, but they did not—there were two men who said they saw the men and could recognise them again, but on being shown the prisoner they could not identify him—it was not in consequence of that that I said I would rather withdraw from the case—that fact was brought to my knowledge before I told the Magistrate so, but that was not my reason for wishing to retire from the prosecution—I did not assign it as the reason—I gave a reason—it was that I was not prosecuting from any revengeful feeling, although I got the worst of the fight—I considered I got the best, and as the public were not support<lb></lb>ing me in the prosecution, I would rather withdraw from it—I was prosecuting on public grounds, thinking that such a man should not be ✗<lb></lb>large, and as I was not being supported by any other witnesses I thought I would retire from the prosecution—I did not put the police to watch any of Young and Bainbridge's servants—I gave no such directions—I did not give them directions to watch for a certain man there—I did not tell the policeman Meiklejohn to watch at Young and Bainbridge's—this arises from the circumstance of my seeing some loose men at a public-house where I called on my journey, and I wanted to know whether those men lingered about the premises the whole of the day, and it was proved that they did—that was simply to know their whereabouts—they were none of them Young and Bainbridge's servants—I did not mention a man formerly in Young and Bainbridge's employment of bad character—I say most em<lb></lb>phatically that I gave no instructions to any of the police with reference to a man formerly in Young and Bainbridge's employ whom I suspected—this occurred in January—I was not taken to identify the prisoner till the 9th March—the police did not tell me they had a man in custody—it arose in this way: I inquired if there were not some men in prison who had committed robberies in the neighbourhood of Wimbledon; I was told there were, and I said, "No doubt these are the men who robbed me"—I went to Newgate, and the result you know—the man I picked out was engaged in the Wimbledon affair—I said before the Magistrate that the man who robbed me had on a funnel-shaped hat, that is a hat similar to my own; they both had funnel-shaped hats, I mean an ordinary hat—the Magistrate said he had never heard it called a funnel-shaped hat before, 'that he had been wearing a funnel-shaped hat all his life and had not known it—I cannot say positively whether the man who attacked me had hair on his chin—he had no whiskers, but he lowered his head and threw his chin into shadow, so that I could not tell shadow from hair—I have measured that place since—it was a drizzling rain that night and dark—there was no moon, at least there was a moon, but it was cloudy and it was not out—I went a second time to Newgate to see the prisoners walk, because I knew his gait so well, and, being so serious a matter, I could not be too strongly impressed that I was right—the second visit made me still more</p>

               <p>positive, if there was any room for it, because I noticed the man's legs, his shoulders, his neck, and his gait particularly—the taller man made longer strides—the prisoner tried to walk in his step, and he walked a little out of his usual stride—I have not been discussing this matter with any of my friends nor with the police—of course I have thought a good deal of it—it was pretty nearly beaten into me, it nearly cost me my life—I cannot say that I have been thinking over the matter much further than turning the man over in my eye, and satisfying myself more and more that he was the man—I had described the man minutely to two or three persons before I picked him out—I should have retired from the prosecution even at the last moment if any doubt had crept into my mind—I should not hare with<lb></lb>drawn from it if I had had the Magistrate's permission to do so, because while I was addressing the Magistrate, Mr. Mayo, the prisoner's solicitor, was also addressing him and challenging me to identify the prisoner, and I immediately said I should consent to the case going on—if Mr. Mayo had not interposed I should have retired, to have saved the trouble of prose<lb></lb>cuting, and I know what that trouble is—this is the third session I have been here—I was attended by two doctors—Dr. Jefferson is the only one here—I did not say to either of the doctors that I could not identify the men who had robbed me—I should say I had never seen the men before that night—certainly I had no occasion to mark him—I may have seen him.</p>

                  </hi> I recollect leaving the house with Dr. Jefferson to get into the cab after my wounds had been dressed—he was close to me, ready in case I required assistance—I cannot say that he had hold of my arm—he was by my side—I went into the cab, he kept by my side the whole distance to the cab—the driver simply asked where he was to drive me to, nothing more—I told him my address—he did not say, "Should you know the men if you were to see them again? "nor did I say I should not—I never spoke about a horse or its colour—I never on any occasion said to him that I should not be able to identify the men.</p>

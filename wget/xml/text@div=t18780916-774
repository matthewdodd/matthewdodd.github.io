                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Casson, of Turner's Court, Bow Street—on Tuesday, 13th August, I saw the prisoner in the court, he had something in his hand, like a pistol, showing another boy how to fire it—shortly afterwards my little girl was brought in with a wound in the cheek which was bleeding, I took her to the doctor—she has quite recovered.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Turner's Court and saw the prisoner there, there were four little children there—the prisoner had a pistol in his hand show<lb></lb>ing it to a boy, and said, "You fire it"—the boy said, "No, I shall not. I am frightened of the police"—one of the little girls kicked him because he would not let us go by—he said, "I will shoot you all," and he let the pistol off in the little girl's face, and hit her.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital, the child was brought there suffering from a punctured wound in the right cheek—I administered chloroform and extracted a small shot; it had gone in about three quarters of an inch in an oblique direction, and had lodged underneath the edge of the bone; I believe she has quite re<lb></lb>covered—it has left a mark—if it had hit her in the eye it would have put it out—there was a slight graze behind the right ear, which might have been caused by a second shot</p>

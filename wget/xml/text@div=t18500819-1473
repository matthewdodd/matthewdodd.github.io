                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my employ, at a marble paper glazer, about two months—he came about May—I took stock the latter end of June or the beginning of July, and missed some paper—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine—it is marked for exportation, that I might get the drawback—it was in my premises on Friday, 26th July, when I left to go home—it was kept in my stock-room—the prisoner had no access to that room—he had no right in the warehouse—he had no authority to take paper away, or to sell it, or part with it—the value of this is 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

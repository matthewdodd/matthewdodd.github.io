                  </hi>. I am servant to William Hobbs, farmar, of Green-street, Enfield. On the 19th of March, the prisoners were cutting chaff in the barn, they were his labourers—Fenson was going out with a waggon and three horses to London, to fetch a load of grains—the allowance is about thirty pounds of hay for three horses, and a bout three quarters of a pack of corn—just before he set off from the yard he took a bundle of hay, about fifty pounds, and put it on his wagon—he went into road—I</p>

               <p>went and told him he was a pretty fellow to take the hay away—I took the hay back again into the barn—I gave Hallard the hay in the morning to cut into chaff, but it was Fensom that took it and put it on the shafts of the wagon—he was to take thirty pounds—but I gave him that and the corn before this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Hobbs, of Green-street.

                  </hi>. I was going to Hartford fair to buy a few cattle at this time—it was Ballard's business to cut the chaff and hay—he had no authority to give out any hay—I always sent out quite sufficient.</p>

Ballard took the hay from the back part of the barn, where Goosetree had thrown it, over the board of the barn—Ballard put it forwards, and laid it close to the door—it was out of my sight when he brought it forwards towards the door—there could be no object in bringing it so near—Ballard was working in the same barn, a little distance from the door—it was not brought near the chaff-bin, where he was cutting, but nearer the door of the barn.</p>

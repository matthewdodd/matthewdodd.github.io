The next day he sent me a letter to meet him the day following at Mr. Green's, and he would inform me of his misfortune: and then he told me he had the misfortune between the bank and my house of having his pocket picked. I took him home to my house, and pressed him as much as possible to know what he had done with the money, but he denied he knew any thing of it. In about half an hour a person came and acquainted me that my man had been trading on his own account, and that he had a cloak made by Mrs. Morris. We kept him from 6 o'clock till 11, and he still kept in the same story, that he did not know any thing of the money. Then he desired to speak with my partner, and he said he would confess every thing, and he confessed where he had lodged the money, and we found part of it; and he owned that there was a box of goods of mine at Mrs. Long's by Oxford Market. I was there and saw several remnants of my goods; Harman confessed the taking them out of my house, and that

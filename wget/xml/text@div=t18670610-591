                  </hi>. I am a money-changer in the Poultry—the prisoner was my confidential and only clerk—it was my custom about half-past four each day to send money from my establishment to the bank, and to receive it back in the morning through the prisoner shortly after nine—on the afternoon of 8th May I and the prisoner counted the Napoleons—his counting agreed with mine—he took those Napo<lb></lb>leons in the afternoon to the bank in a box—he had a key of that box, and I also had a key, but no one else—on 9th May I arrived at the Poultry about twenty minutes past nine—all the gold was in the window, as if it had been counted, and the prisoner was just counting a little silver—he could not have counted it in the time—the money is usually placed in the window about ten o'clock—I sent the prisoner to the bank to see if some drafts had been paid, and while he was gone I counted the Napoleons, and found three and a quarter short—when he returned I asked him to count them and tell me what he made them; he made them three and a quarter short, and I asked him how he accounted for it—he said he could not say, he did not know, but after thinking one or two minutes he said, "Oh! I know of three"—I said, "What do you mean? you know of three?"—he said, "I sold three this morning"—I said, "Where is the money for them"—"Oh!" he said, "it is all right; I sold them to a friend of mine"—I said, "What do you mean, a friend of yours? you have no right to sell any things to a friend of yours,"—he said, "It is all right, he will bring it round in the course of the morning or afternoon"—I asked him who this friend was, and he said, "A person named Evans, of Throgmorton Street"—I said, "I shall go round and ask him for the money"—the prisoner turned very pale, and said, "For God's sake don't"—I said, "What do you mean?"—lie said, "I will get it myself, it is all right"—I said, "Excuse me, I wish to see this Mr. Evans"—he begged of me two or three times not to go, and then said, "I must tell you that I have told a lie; the fact is that the day before yesterday, when you were absent, your brother came in, and I asked him to remain while I went over the way to get something to eat, and when I returned I found three missing, they were right before"—I told him I knew they were right the night before, and that I should go for my brother—he said, "I will go for him, let me go"—I said I would go myself—he is employed by Mr. Michael Abrahams, in the Old Jewry—I fetched him and brought him face to face with the prisoner and said, "Now what have you got to say?"—he could not say anything, and I gave him in charge.</p>

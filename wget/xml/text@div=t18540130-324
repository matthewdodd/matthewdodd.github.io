                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Crystal Palace Hotel, Norwood. On Saturday, 7th Jan., I saw the prisoner at the bar; he asked for a pot of porter; it came to fourpence—he gave me a sovereign; I took it to Mrs. Masters for change, which I immediately gave to the prisoner—Mrs. Masters then said it was counterfeit; I do not know whether he heard that—I took it to him, and said, "You gave me a bad sovereign, give me back my change"—he said, "Oh! have I, miss?" and paid for the beer a sixpence—he was immediately given in charge—I had not lost sight</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Crystal Palace Hotel; Mr. Masters is the proprietor. On 7th Jan., about half past 6 o'clock in the afternoon I saw the prisoner there, and heard Mrs. Masters call out "Miss Balls, this is a bad sovereign"—the prisoner could hear that, and I ran and stood by the side of him, and took the sovereign up, gave the pri<lb></lb>soner in charge, marked the sovereign, and gave it to the officer—on Mon<lb></lb>day, 9th Jan., two days afterwards, I gave another counterfeit sovereign to the same officer; I received it from George Eames, our potboy—I did not see how he came by it—he pointed out the place where he found it; that was the exact spot where the prisoner had stood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You do not mean to swear to the exact spot when there were 100 people there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, as near as I possibly can—I made no mark at the spot—it was on Sunday evening when the potman showed me the place—I got the sovereign on the Sunday afternoon—I was drawing beer and serving customers—there were three persons drawing altogether—I was too busy to look after what the potman was about—we were very busy; but we carry on our business so systematically that there was no confusion at all—I withdrew from the place where I had been drawing, and came to another part—I called the policeman in; he was on his beat, about fifty yards off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman, at the Crystal Palace Hotel, Norwood. I saw the prisoner given in charge on the Saturday afternoon, and observed at what spot he was standing—on the Sunday morning, about 9 o'clock, I was sweeping out the front of the bar, and found a counterfeit sovereign in the straw, at the place where the prisoner had stood—the house had been open on the Saturday night till about 11 o'clock—I laid the sovereign on the counter, showed it to Miss Balls, and then put it in my pocket, and in the afternoon gave it to Mr. Walker, when he came.</p>

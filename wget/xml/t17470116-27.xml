               <p>UPON reading the Indictment, the Council for the Prisoner objected , that an Intention to defraud a Body Corporate, was not within the Meaning of the Act of Parliament of the Seventh of His Present Majesty, which declares it Felony, falsely to make, forge, or counterfeit, any Acquittance or Receipt, for Payment of Money; or knowingly to utter or publish the same, with Intention to defraud any Person whatsoever: That the South-Sea Company cannot fall under the general Description of the Word Person, mentioned in this Act. [Which Point was reserved to the Prisoner, in Case he had been found guilty. And then the Council for the King proceeded.] That the Prisoner was now called upon to answer for his Life for an Offence of a dangerous Tendency, an Offence that the Law has made capital, the forging of a Dividend-Warrant in order to defraud the South-Sea Company .</p>
               <p>The Prisoner was one of the Clerks of the South-Sea House, in an Office called the Pay-Office, and they make their Payments in Consequence of Warrants brought to them for that Purpose; these Warrants are brought by the Proprietors, or Persons for them, into the Treasury, the Method of which is as follows: The Cashier in a Morning pays into the Hands of the Pay-Clerks a certain Sum of Money; if in the Evening they bring Warrants importing the Sum delivered to them, he ballances the Account that Day with proper Vouchers; if they do not bring Warrants to the Amount of the Sum received, they are to return so much of the Money as has not been applied in Payments.</p>
               <p>The Fact for which the Prisoner is charged, is the altering of a Dividend-Warrant, by adding the Letter y to the Word Eight, to make it Eighty, and by the Addition of a Cypher to the Sum 8 l. to make it 80 l. and the Addition of a Cypher to 400 l. to make it 4000 l. which Alterations are an uniform Multiplication by 10.</p>
               <p>The Fact laid in the Indictment is so long ago as February was a Twelve-month, and the Discovery was made no longer ago than October last. In the Month of February, 1744. Mr

               <p>Hayne. Yes, Sir.</p>

               <p>Q. From whence is this Dividend Warrant drawn?</p>
               <p>Hayne . They are wrote from our Dividend-Book, and that is in the Dividend-Book.</p>

               <p>Hayne. It was from this Book, or a Copy from another.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to swear that Warrant was made from that Book?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council for the Defendant. This Warrant before you, is it of your writing?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. Is it as you wrote it, or has there been an Alteration made in it?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I am satisfied there is an Alteration .</p>
               <p>Q. How was it when you wrote it?</p>
               <p>Hayne . It was Eight for the Interest, and the Principal 400 l.</p>
               <p>Court. Be so good as to read it as you wrote it.</p>
               <p>Hayne. Rowland Rogers, Esq; Pay to Wm Derisley the Sum of Eight Pounds on 400 l. Stock. It is now Eighty by the Addition of the y.</p>
               <p>Council. Are you sure that the y is not of your writing?</p>
               <p>Hayne . It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it stand as you first wrote it, the Sum of 400 l.?</p>
               <p>Hayne. No, it is now 4000.</p>
               <p>Council. How was 400 expressed?</p>
               <p>Hayne. First it was expressed in Figures, 400 l. there is the Mark of Pounds, an L.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it now?</p>
               <p>Hayne. It is the same with the Addition of an o; what was before 400, is now 4000.</p>
               <p>Council. Give me Leave to ask you again, first, Is the Figures 400 your own Hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Yes, the 400; but with regard to the last Cypher, that makes it 4000, I take it not, because it does not stand in Course with the rest.</p>
               <p>Council. Have you any other Reason, with regard to the Figures 4000 l or what Reason have you with regard to the Letter y added to the Eight, of being sure, or being of an Opinion, that the y and Cypher is not your Hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Sir, the y is quite different to what I write , and crowded more than I should have cared to have done in a Warrant.</p>
               <p>Council. Now with Regard to the additional o, that follows in the Sum 400, What Reason have you besides what you gave? You said the last o was out of the Line; What Reason have you besides being out of the Line?</p>
               <p>Hayne. The Manner of the o is different.</p>
               <p>Council. Now I would add, whether you have taken any Notice of the Figures in the Margin?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I can't be quite so positive as to the o in the Margin, as the o in the 400.</p>
               <p>Council. Do you know whose Hand-writing was the Figure of 8?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Mine, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council So then you not only filled up the Warrant, but put in the Figures?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Yes, Sir, we have examined this Warrant after it was wrote, three several Times; Mr Fowler and I both examined it and signed it.</p>
               <p>Council. Are you positive you examined the Import of the Warrant before you signed it?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. What did you examine it by?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I believe by this Book.</p>
               <p>Council. What Reason have you to take it to be this Book?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Because this is the Book by which we pay.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose Custody is this Book?</p>
               <p>Hayne. 'Tis in the Custody of him that belongs to the Book, and takes Care of the Key.</p>
               <p>Council. Are you one of the Officers?</p>
               <p>Hayne. No.</p>
               <p>Council. Are you sure that Book has not been altered since?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Sir, 'tis plain here's no Alteration in it.</p>
               <p>Council. Why do you say that the Book to pay by is part of the Book to pay by?</p>
               <p>Hayne. This Book takes in all in D.</p>
               <p>Council. Do you generally examine by this Book that you call the Pay-Book?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I rarely miss.</p>
               <p>Council. Have you any other Reason?</p>
               <p>Hayne. 'Tis my general Practice; and I look upon it to be safest for the Company.</p>
               <p>Council. So then by the Form of the Letter y, and the Form of that last Cypher, you think 'tis not your Hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Council. What Reason have you to think that the o in the Margin is not your writing?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160024"></xptr>Hayne . I compared those Sums together from this Book, and had it been 80, it would not have agreed with this book.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of making Figures in the Margin?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I look upon it to be more ready for the Payment of Interest.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever make the Sum in the Margin different from the Body of the Warrant?</p>
               <p>Hayne. We write in the Body of the Warrant the Words at Length, and the Margin in Figures.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make out a Warrant of Eight Pounds for Mr Derisley ?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. Can you tell at what Time of the Year you make out these Warrants?</p>
               <p>Hayne. We fill them up half yearly.</p>
               <p>Council. Can you recollect between the Time of shutting and opening the Books, that that Warrant was not, or could not be, actually taken out?</p>
               <p>Q. After you have wrote it, to whom do you deliver it?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I generally examine the last Examination but very little before delivering our Warrants.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the other Officer to whom you deliver them?</p>
               <p>Hayne. There is one Fenboulhet under me.</p>
               <p>Council Can you recollect after you had compleated that Warrant to be delivered into the Hands of the Clerk, who that Clerk was to whom it was delivered?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I can't say to whom it was delivered.</p>
               <p>Council. Nor you don't know where it was during all that Time?</p>
               <p>Hayne. It was in our Custody all that Time.</p>
               <p>Council. Did any Body keep the Key of that Box where it was?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. Had any other Clerks recourse to that Box?</p>
               <p>Hayne. There were two of them, but I can't tell which.</p>
               <p>Council. So that after you had delivered it out you cannot tell? Had it any Date after you had delivered it out?</p>
               <p>Hayne. No.</p>
               <p>Council. Have you ever heard that such Things have been done, that Warrants have been altered?</p>
               <p>Hayne . I might before have heard, but not with my Certainty.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you know Mr Shuttleworth ? Did you never hear that he has done such a Thing?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I heard such a Report, but I never heard all the Particulars.</p>

               <p>Derisley. My own Hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what Occasion did you write your Name upon the Back of that Warrant?</p>
               <p>Derisley. In order to receive the Dividend; now 'tis a Warrant for 80 l. when I had it, it was for 8 l. only; I received the Sum of Eight Pounds of the Clerk, and I left the Warrant with the Person that paid me. I can't remember the Clerk that I received it of.</p>
               <p>Council. You have been a Proprietor some Time; Do you always sign your Name in the Book?</p>
               <p>Derisley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you at the Time you signed that Receipt, compare the Warrant with the Book?</p>
               <p>Derisley. I read the Book I signed, and read the Warrant I signed, and the Warrant and the Book corresponded.</p>
               <p>Q. How much Stock had you at that Time?</p>
               <p>Derisley. Four hundred Pounds, which is the only Sum I ever had in that Company.</p>
               <p>Court. You have been often there I suppose? Did you always receive of the same Person?</p>

               <p>Woolley. Every Morning 'tis my Business to issue out Bank-Notes and Money to the Clerks, to enable them to answer the Demands that might be made in the Office, by the coming in of the Dividend Warrants. When the Business of the Day is over, then we call upon them for the Notes, they have left; then the y proceed to make up their Accounts; and the Method is, they sort the Warrants, when that is done, they list these Warrants in the Pay-Book, to see what the Total amounts to, then they bring them to me, then I give them Credit, and allow them in the Account, the Sums wrote upon the Back of their Bundle of Warrants, signed by the Pay-Clerk, or with the initial Letters of their Names; first they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160025"></xptr> give the Name and Date, then the No. and Dividend, and then paid so many Warrants amounting to so much Money .</p>
               <p>Council. Is that the Method?</p>
               <p>Woolley . Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. That being the usual Way, Do you ever give Credit without Warrants being thus described?</p>
               <p>Woolley . No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Woolley. The whole of that Endorsement, the 11th of February, &amp;c. except what is by the Examiner, is of Mr Pelling's Writing.</p>

My Lord, we have an Office belonging to the Treasury called the Examiners-Office; the Business of these Clerks is to check the Accounts that the Pay-Clerk makes of the Warrants; upon the 11th of February, 1744.

               <p>Council. How many Pay-Clerks were they? What were their Names?</p>
               <p>Woolley. Mr Gosling, Uther , Heister, and Mr Pelling. This Bundle was about ten Days before the Clerk had entered them.</p>
               <p>Council Is it usual to lay so long?</p>
               <p>Woolley. No, Sir, they should not.</p>
               <p>Council. I am afraid it is but too common a thing for Clerks to exchange each others Places, and lend Warrants one to another.</p>
               <p>Woolley. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. From the 11th of February, can you tell how long it might lie in your Office?</p>
               <p>Woolley. I cannot tell .</p>
               <p>Council. Then it might be near a Month; nor you cannot tell to what Examiner you delivered them to?</p>
               <p>Woolley. After the Bundle has been past by the Examiners, they are kept in a Room under the Care of one Mr Gostling .</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to say, whether this Receipt was in the Bundle?</p>
               <p>Woolley. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Council. I would ask you one Question, Who makes your fire for you?</p>
               <p>Woolley. There is a Man on Purpose that comes every Morning in the Winter to make a Fire.</p>
               <p>Council. So that, during all that Time he is in your Office, he goes backward and forward, and he may let in whom he please?</p>
               <p>Woolley. He should not.</p>
               <p>Council. I would ask, whether any body could not come backward and forward, whether you could have any Check upon him? What Time is he there?</p>
               <p>Woolley. About eight o'Clock, and I am there about nine myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever miss any thing out of your Office?</p>

               <p>Woolley. No, I never missed any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. When was Mr Pelling first charged with this Fact?</p>
               <p>Woolley. I think in October.</p>
               <p>Council. Was he not examined by a Committee of Directors? Was he at Liberty all this Time?</p>
               <p>Woolley. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Times was he examined?</p>
               <p>Woolley. He was before the Committee, and examined for some other Fraud; and as this Fraud was found out, they sent and took him up.</p>
               <p>Mr North . This might be nine or ten Days.</p>
               <p>Council. I suppose there is an Opportunity of going into your Office before the Papers are carried away, and another Clerk of the Office that actually gave in the Receipt, might take out the Receipt out of Mr Pelling's Bundle. What was Mr Shuttleworth?</p>
               <p>Q. to North. What became of the Prisoner after his former Examination?</p>
               <p>North. To the best of my Remembrance he said he was ill, and went down to his House in the Country; I think some Holiday intervened, and there was a Day appointed for him to come to the House: The Committee apprehended he was sled, he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160026"></xptr> sent for, and they brought him up to Town; his Commitment was the 13th of November.</p>

            . Did you at any Time find any thing wrong with regard to that Warrant?</p>
               <p>Hassel . On the 31st of October I made the Discovery of this Fraud.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the Warrant when you found it out?</p>
               <p>Hassel. I laid it by carefully, till it was laid before the Committee, and upon Tuesday the 4th of November, it was laid before them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first Discovery of this Warrant of Derisley's ?</p>
               <p>Hassel. Yes; there was a Warrant also found out in the Name of one Hill, and then Alderman Baker issued out Warrants for apprehending three or four others; Tew, Rouse, and Clark were taken into Custody, but the Prisoner was in the Country at that Time.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it Mr Alderman Baker issued out his Warrant for the Prisoner upon this particular Affair?</p>
               <p>Hassel. As to the particular Time, I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all three of them charged with Facts?</p>
               <p>Hassel. No, Sir, it was only on Suspicion, nothing was proved.</p>

               <p>Rouse. Four Years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you now?</p>
               <p>Rouse . I have been suspended for some Time, I was in the Examiners-Office, our Business was to enter the Warrants that are fetched out of the Treasury from Mr Woolley ; we enter them into Books that are kept for that Purpose. I was there from the Year 1742 to 1746.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you look upon this Warrant? Did that Warrant upon any Occasion come into your Hand?</p>
               <p>Rouse. It came into my Hand in this Bundle.</p>
               <p>Council. How do you understand it was in this Bundle?</p>
               <p>Rouse. Because I copied them in that Book.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you receive it from?</p>
               <p>Rouse . I received it from Mr Woolley; looking to the Book, I found it was fetched from Mr Woolley by Mr Tew . When they are brought into our Office, they are put into a Glass Case; these 155 Warrants are divided into two Parcels, I entered of the Bundle from A to K.</p>
               <p>Q. Who received this from Mr Woolley.</p>

               <p>Court. So you entered so much of the Bundle as from A to K?</p>
               <p>Rouse. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what Time?</p>
               <p>Rouse. I cannot say at what Time; as soon as I was out of Business, I took this Book to do.</p>
               <p>Council. Are all Warrants from A to K in that Book?</p>
               <p>Rouse. Yes, and the rest in the other Book. I have examined every one of these Warrants, and I found it there last Week.</p>
               <p>Council. Can you be certain, that particular Warrant of Mr Derisley's was there?</p>
               <p>Rouse. I found it in the Bundle, and entered it into the Book; I cast up all from A to K, and Clark cast up his Part from L to Z; so we cast up the whole to make up Mr Pelling's Account.</p>
               <p>Q. How much does your Part amount to?</p>
               <p>Rouse. From A to K, 69 Warrants they come to 1463 l. 10 s. 9 d.</p>
               <p>Council. Are all the rest of the Warrants truly entered?</p>
               <p>Rouse. Yes, Sir, I have examined them myself with these Warrants.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know upon what Day you made these Entries?</p>
               <p>Rouse. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Council. Can you recollect how long this Warrant lay in your Office?</p>
               <p>Rouse. Sir, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Council. How many People have Access to your Office?</p>
               <p>Rouse. There were only four of us.</p>
               <p>Council. I suppose you admit other Clerks in occasionally?</p>
               <p>Rouse. I have seen Mr Heister and Pelling in the Office upon different Accounts.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Memorandum what Day you received these Bundles?</p>
               <p>Rouse. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. Then, according to Accounts, I have heard Examiners have been guilty of these Frauds.</p>
               <p>Rouse. There have been those Things done.</p>
               <p>Council If the Clerk gives in a Number of Warrants to the Deputy-Cashier as Vouchers, and when the Number is short, Who comes to makes it up? Is it that Clerk that gave it in to the Cashier?</p>
               <p>Rouse. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. Supposing that Mr Pelling had delivered in a Bundle that did not contain so many as is marked on the Back-side, Whose Business is it to bring in the Receipt to make it?</p>
               <p>Rouse. Mr Pelling's. Whosoever is the Person that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160027"></xptr> finds out an Error, informs the Persons whose Warrants they are.</p>
               <p>Council. If this Bundle had been deficient, would you have told Mr Pelling, Sir.</p>
               <p>Rouse. Yes; Mr Heister was ill in the Country, and he wanted a Warrant of 30 l. I asked Mr Pelling what I should do for it; accordingly Mr Pelling gave me a Warrant of 30 l. which I entered in the Book; after that, I acquainted Mr Heister with it, and he gave me a 30 l. Warrant in the Room thereof, which I gave to Mr Pelling.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the Prisoner desired you at any Time to do any thing to these Books?</p>
               <p>Rouse. On the 14th Day of October, he and I were both attending upon the Committee, expecting to be called in, and finding the Committee was broke up, he speaks to me, says he, I want to drink a Glass of Wine with you; we went to the Nags-head in Leaden hall street; when I came there, he said, I have got a Thing to beg of you to do for me; then, says he, you must keep it a Secret: Upon which I asked what it was, he told me there was an Entry in the New Annuities, No 22, in Page 80, or odd, to alter from an 80, to an 8; I says, how can that be, when I am out of the Office to do any thing; he said he could help me to the doing of it, I told him I would do nothing at all, and the Reason why that I lost my Place of 50 l. a Year, was by doing what little I had done for him; he told me in Answer to that, in case that I did not do it, I must expect to hear of his Death.</p>
               <p>Q. What followed after this?</p>
               <p>Rouse. We parted directly, he said he would have me to consider of it, and he would see me again at the next Committee-Meeting. I for some Time had received of him 12 l. 10 s. for my Quarter, I gave him a Note for it when I received my Money, that he should stop it; upon our being taken up, he gave me my 12 l. 10 s. Receipt up, I got him to give me the Money before Quarter-day, and I gave him a Receipt for it, and he gave me up the Receipt afterwards without any Money.</p>
               <p>Council. Did he tell you why he gave up the Receipt?</p>
               <p>Rouse. He gave up the Receipt as a Gift, as I had done him Services, I suppose that was the Design. When the Committee met afterwards, he came to me again, and said, Mr Rouse, as it will be of no Service to you to keep the 12 l. 10 s. Receipt, I desire you will give me another Receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Rouse . The Day after our meeting, I had anti-dated it to August, it was due at Michaelmas .</p>
               <p>Q. When was your Meeting?</p>
               <p>Rouse. Our Meeting was the 28th of October; when he found I would not do him that Service he wanted, the Thursday after the Court ended, he desired me to give it him back again, and said it would be paid in to the Company as so much Money.</p>
               <p>Council. What Time was it you gave the other Receipt?</p>
               <p>Rouse. The Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was by?</p>
               <p>Rouse. No-body by, it was in the Office where we were attending the Committee.</p>
               <p>Council. But at the first Time you told him you could not do him the important Piece of Service he wanted, was he taken up the 14th of October?</p>
               <p>Rouse. We were only then suspended.</p>
               <p>Council. After he had tempted you to do the thing you apprehended to be wrong, he still appeared at the South Sea House?</p>
               <p>Rouse. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. At the Time he gave up the Receipt, I ask you, when you refused serving him, whether he asked for the Receipt?</p>
               <p>Rouse . He desired me to consider of it.</p>
               <p>Council. Are you discharged from the Company's Service?</p>
               <p>Rouse. I have never been there, nor the Gentlemen never sent to me but upon these Affairs.</p>
               <p>[The Warrant that Mr Rouse referred to, that the Prisoner desired him to alter, was not the Warrant he was indicted for forging or uttering.]</p>
               <p>Fleetwood Clark . This Bundle of Mr Pelling's that I think was delivered into the Examiner's Office, and Part of the Entry made from A to K, and the other Part from L to Z, there is Part of the Entry by my own Hand, and the other Part was entered by Mr Rouse .</p>
               <p>Q. What is the Amount of Mr Pelling's Parcel?</p>
               <p>Clark. The Amount of the whole is thus: 155 Warrants, 2806 l. 12 s. 6 d.</p>

            . I ask you again, Are you certain with respect to the Number of these Entries?</p>
               <p>Hassel I have examined these Entries in the Journal, Warrant by Warrant, and the Sums from A to K, 69 Warrants, 1463 l. 10 s. 9 d. from L to Z, 86 Warrants, 1343 l. 1 s. 9 d. the Total, 155 Warrants, 2806 l. 12 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. to Fleetwood Clark. At what Time did you belong to the Examiners-Office?</p>
               <p>Clark. About four Years, till I was suspended in December last.</p>
               <p>Council. How long may Warrants lie in your Office?</p>
               <p>Clark. Two or three Days, sometimes more, sometimes less.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160028"></xptr>Council. Have any other People any Recourse to your Office?</p>
               <p>Clark. They sometimes do come in, the Warrants are locked up in a Glass Case .</p>
               <p>Council. Have any body Access to your Office?</p>
               <p>Clark. Mr Heister has borrowed the Key upon some Occasions.</p>
               <p>Q. For what Purpose has he borrowed the Key?</p>
               <p>Clark. It may be to charge a Warrant, or to that Purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him do it? Have you seen him make use of it, and take out a Warrant?</p>
               <p>Clark. I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Council. I would ask you, Mr Clark, upon what you have said, if a Man had put a Warrant into his own Bundle, whether he might not, within the Compass of two Years, get it back again entirely?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes, Sir, and I believe he might have got it out during his Suspension, he was employed in examining the Warrants.</p>
               <p>Council for the Defendant. So he had Liberty from the Committee to examine his own Warrants after he was under Suspension.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. I want to know why it should be Matter of Wonder to you, when it should be in the Presence of other Clerks, the Man is charged with something of Fraud in his Office, why is it not natural for the Company to give him that Liberty to make up his Accounts?</p>
               <p>Clark. Mr Pelling and Rouse both did look over the Warrants, there were People in the Office at the same time, and he has gone out with a Warrant into the Treasury to Mr Woolley.</p>
               <p>Council. Was Mr Pelling so closely watched, that he could not have taken a particular Receipt or the whole Bundle?</p>
               <p>Clark. He might have taken away the Bundle, if there had been twenty in the Office.</p>
               <p>Council. Before this Suspension, these Receipts must have been in the Glass a Year or a Year and a Half.</p>
               <p>Clark. They are put afterwards into little Cupboards.</p>
               <p>Council. Has it been usual to have Keys to look into those? Who is the Person entrusted with this Key?</p>
               <p>Clark. Four Men, called the Examiners of that Office.</p>
               <p>Council. Suppose it be asked to lend that Key, has it been done?</p>
               <p>Clark. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Council to Woolley. Do you understand any particular Person at this Time did watch over the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Woolley. There was always some Body there.</p>
               <p>Council. That you cannot say, as you was not always there - Mr Woolley, I wou'd venture to ask, you are a Man of Candour, Do you think if a Person had a Mind to have got a Warrant away, he could not have done it?</p>
               <p>Woolley. I believe he might.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pelling . Prisoner, What do you say in your Defence?</p>
               <p>Pelling. I have not, my Lord, the least Remembrance, either of Mr Derisley, the Gentleman to whom the Warrant was payable, or of the Warrant itself. What Evidence therefore of Innocence can your Lordship expect from me of a Fact I am thus totally ignorant of: of the Forgery of a Warrant which is not so much as proved to have been, because it never was, in my Custody. - I have had the Honour, my Lord, to serve the Trustees of the forseited Estates of the late Directors, and the present South Sea Company, for upwards of 25 Years; and in that Station I every Year paid many thousand Warrants; but other Gentlemen, my Lord, served in the same Station: By what Hands this Warrant was paid, or by what Hands it was altered, is a Question I cannot, and is in their Power only to say; but this, my Lord, I can with Truth say, that if the Care of the Gentlemen entrusted with my Warrants had been equal to my Innocence, neither your Lordship, or the Gentlemen of the Jury, had been troubled with this Trial.</p>

               <p>Rone. In my House, Sir, he appeared publickly; the Constable, after he had executed the Warrant, he left him while he went to Barnes and dined; he only said to me, Mr Rone, take care of Mr Pelling against I come; and I did not take any Charge of him, I left him, and the Constable did not return till three in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>Council. Then Mr Pelling might have went off?</p>
               <p>Rone. Yes.</p>

            , Esq; How long have you known Mr Pelling?</p>
               <p>Harvey. Six Years.</p>
               <p>Council. Do you think that he is capable of being guilty of Forgery?</p>
               <p>Harvey. He has past Accounts of mine, and he has always behaved very well, and I have never found him wrong in any thing.</p>
               <p>Council. Do you believe that he would be guilty of Forgery?</p>
               <p>Harvey. I never heard any thing like it of him, by his general Character in the Neighbourhood. I live at Comb, and he has past several Accounts for me; and he has been a Tenant of mine.</p>
               <p>Council for the King. I dare say there's no Person in the whole of your Acquaintance, that you think will be guilty of Forgery?</p>
               <p>Rosomon Saunders. He has lived about five and twenty Years in our Neighbourhood, and bears a very just honest Character. I am left in Trust for some Part in the South-Sea, and he has always done very fair by me.</p>
               <p>- Belcher . I have known him 30 Years, I always took him to be a very honest Gentleman, and he always bore the Character of such a one.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any Dealings with him?</p>
               <p>Belcher . The Gentleman had the greatest Part of a House of mine in Broad street, and the Reason of his leaving me was because the House smoaked; he took the House of me four Years ago last Michaelmas .</p>

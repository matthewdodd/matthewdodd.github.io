                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Citypolice-constable, No.</hi> 274.) About half-past four o'clock, on the 28th of July, I observed the prisoner, another young man, and two boys, following a lady down Newgate-street—one of the lads slipped his band into the lady's pocket, pulled out something, and handed it to the prisoner—I did not then see what it was—I followed them across Newgate-street, and down Bath-street, which leads to St. Martin<lb></lb>le-Grand—I caught the prisoner and another, who made his escape by vio-lent resistance—I saw a blue purse in the prisoner's hand—he was showing it to his companion—I threw him on his back—he made violent resistance, and kicked me violently when he was on the ground—I was endeavouring to get the purse from him—he sprung up, and I did not see any purse in his hand then—I saw a jerk of bis arm—I had seen and felt the purse in his hand, but I did not see it go.</p>

I was in Newgate-street on the 28th of July, about a quarter post four o'clock—I bad a blue purse in my pocket, with ivory slides—I had put it into my pocket about ten minutes before it was lost—I had carried it in my band before—there was a half-crown and a shilling in it.</p>

            . I am a watchmaker, I live at Holborn Bridge. About the latter end of February, I was sent for by the prisoner to the Wheelers Arms, in Cloth-Fair. I found Little with him. I have known them both about two years. When I came there, Jordan said, he had a watch to dispose of, and asked me to look at it. He told me, it was a gold watch; but, upon examining it, I found the outer case was only metal gilt. He asked what I would give for it? At first, I said, I did not case to have any concern with it. At last, it was agreed he should have what money the gold box would fetch. After having it examined at the silver smiths, I allowed him one pound eighteen shillings for it. When I came back, I brought back the metal case, they let me keep that; they said, it would be of no use to them; then I got the metal box made for a movement, intending it for my own use, and put another name over it, by way of precaution; for I acknowledge, I suspected it was stolen. I went and offered to pledge it with Mr. Pharez. Mr. Pharez took off this false piece, and began to question me about it. I said at first, I had it from Gray. But when I was before Sir

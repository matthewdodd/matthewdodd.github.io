On the 9th of October, about half-past one o'clock, the prisoner came and purchased a silk handkerchief, which came to 6 s.; he put it into his pocket, and offered me a 1 l. Bank note. I asked him his address? he said,</p>
               <p>"Harrison, Cockspur-street." I asked him what number? and he said No. 5. I thought the note did not look like a good one, and took it to my husband, who was at dinner in the back room; he gave his opinion on it, and then took it to a neighbour - I had written the name and address on it before I gave it to him; I am sure he said No. 5, Cockspur-street. I told him I had sent out for change, but he said he was rather in a hurry, and wanted to go to Portland-place, and that he would call for the change as he returned. I refused to let him take the handkerchief, as I said I thought it might not be good; he left the handkerchief and went away, but was brought back by my husband and Mr. Savage, in about ten minutes - he offered to give me another note, but I refused to take it. Savage told him it was a bad note. Then he said I had taken the wrong address, for it was No. 1, Cannon-street - I do not recollect that he said where Cannon-street was. I told him that I understood him No. 5, Cockspur-street - he denied telling me so.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that he said No. 5, Cockspur- - A. Not any.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When I said you had taken the wrong address, you seemed agitated, went into the parlour, and said you did not know whether I said Cannon-street - A. I did not. When he came back, he asked me what address I had written on it? I said No. 5, Cockspur-street. He said I had put it wrong, for it was No. 1, Cannon-street.</p>

            . I am the husband of the last witness. On the 9th of October she gave me the note, and I took it to a neighbour to see if it was good; the prisoner was in the shop when I went out - I did not hear the conversation between him and my wife; when I returned he was gone. I went after him with Savage, whom I had taken the note to. I overtook him in Norton-street, shewed him the note, and asked him if he had paid it. Savage held it, and told him that he had put the address on it, Harrison, No. 5, Cockspur-street. He said that was wrong, for he had not given that address, but had given No. 1, Cannon-street. We said he had better go back to the shop, which he did, and insisted that he had given No. 1, Cannon-street; I believe he requested us to go there with him. I asked him if he knew any person in the neighbourhood? He said he knew a Mr. Emerson - I knew Emerson - he is a coal-merchant. I said if he would go over to the public-house, I would fetch him. I then got a constable, who went with me to the prisoner in the tap-room. Emerson came, and I asked him if he knew the prisoner; he looked at him for a moment, and then said,</p>
               <p>"I know you, Yes, your name is Payne;" the prisoner said,</p>

He went back with us to the shop, and then denied giving the address that was on the note. Mr. Bolding's son was in the shop, and said what his mother put on the note was true. The prisoner said he gave No. 1, Cannon-street - the boy said,</p>
               <p>"No, you did not, it was No. 5, Cockspur-street." The prisoner denied it, and insisted that he said No. 1, Cannon-street; the boy is about twelve years of age. The prisoner wanted us to go with him, but we said we could not, and it would be better to send for a constable; we sent for one, who took him. Previous to that, Bolding had sent for Emerson to the public-house. He told the prisoner his name was Payne, and said,</p>
               <p>"You rascal, you ought to be ashamed to send for me;" some altercation took place between them. He offered to satisfy us for going home with him - I refused.</p>

When I lived with General Harrison, he was in the habit of giving me old clothes; a man whom I had several times sold clothes to, was coming by a public-house near where I live, and I sold him a coat, waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons for 17 s.; he gave me a 1 l. note. As I was going to Portland-place, I went in and bought this handkerchief. I waited above half an hour for change, then took the handkerchief from my pocket, and said I would call as I returned. When I got a little distance from the house two men came up, and asked me about the note - they said it was a bad one. I said I had got another, and perhaps that was bad too; I shewed it to them - they said it was a good one, and returned it to me. I told them where I lived, and asked them to go home with me - they took me to Marlborough-street office. They have since been where I said, and found that I did live there - I am innocent. I sent for my brother-in-law, but he does not like me, and would hang me if he could - it is him that has brought me here.</p>

               <p>On the 4th of June, as Lucas and I were standing in Holborn, talking about some business, three men passed us between five and six; as soon as the prisoner passed us he crossed the way, Lucas said, that fellow has got something, I went through a court and overtook him in St. Giles's , and Lucas held him, and I pulled this piece of ribbon out of his pocket, and the prosecutor owned it.</p>

               <p>I was with Dixon at this time, and I saw what he has said.</p>
               <p>(The ribbon produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know the ribbon, it has no mark but the figure of twenty, one of my young men had been using it twenty minutes before, I know it by the quality of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290139"></xptr> the ribbon, and by missing a quantity that corresponds with it, I cannot recollect any other mark but twenty, that was the measure of the ribbon.</p>
               <p>Court. Had the prisoner been in your shop that day? - I think not.</p>

               <p>On the day of this unfortunate affair , I met a young man who was going to buy some hair ribbon, when he returned he gave it me, and these men came up and said , I stole it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

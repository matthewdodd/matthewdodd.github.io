               <p>Q. Did they pick you up, or you them?</p>
               <p>Stears. We neither of us picked the other up; I was going along the street, and they spoke to me, and I went into the room with Jacobs, the other fetched a tankard of beer, and I gave her three-pence for fetching of it; she went out of the room directly, and I was with the prisoner there near half an hour; after I had been gone from her, I went to the Three Nuns, and had been there half an hour before I missed my money.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you miss?</p>
               <p>Stears. Sixteen guineas and a two-guinea piece.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you meet with them first?</p>
               <p>Stears. At about half an hour after ten at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your money about you then?</p>
               <p>Stears. I am sure I had just before I came to them in the street. I had received best part of it that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Stears. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the prisoner afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Stears. I found her in Darkhouse-lane at the Three Tuns, and took her up by the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Darkhouse-lane from the house where you and she were together?</p>
               <p>Stears. I believe they are a mile distance; we took her to the watch-house and searched her, and found two guineas and half upon her, and upon the bench where she sat in the watch-house I found a two guinea piece. (The two-guinea piece produced in court).</p>
               <p>Q. Is it so remarkable a one that you can swear to it?</p>
               <p>Stears. Yes, I can; it is my two-guinea piece, I have had it almost two years.</p>

            . I am constable; on Friday was se'nnight in the morning about four o'clock I was sent for to Billingsgate watch-house, there the prosecutor charged me with the prisoner, saying, she had robbed him of sixteen guineas and a two-guinea piece, and said he had found two guineas and a half upon her; I asked him if he thought she had any more about her? saying, we could soon search her, she was as ready to strip as he could want her. I ordered all the men out, and called some women in, they stripped her naked all but her smock and her stockings, upon turning her about there lay the two-guinea piece upon the place where she sat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else near enough so as to lay the two-guinea piece where you found it?</p>
               <p>Weedon. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear it drop from her?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to your shop about the middle of March last - A. To the best of my knowledge she is very much like her.</p>
               <p>COURT. She came into your shop, when - A. About the 14th or 15th of March. I recollect the woman coming to my shop before that time; I had given her change for a a pound note about a fortnight before that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. That must be about the beginning of March - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen the prisoner at the bar, and had given her change for a pound note - A. Yes, to the best of my recollection. I asked her no questions for that note, but gave her change. I saw her again about the 14th or 15th of March, she came into my shop, she asked for two ounces of tea, and a pound of sugar, I weighed her the tea, and gave her the sugar on the counter, and she presented me a one pound note in payment; I looked at her, and I thought I knew her again; I thought I had seen her in the shop before; I asked her name and place of abode; she gave me the name of Mr. George, No 9, Frederic-place, Hampstead-road, and that place not being above half a quarter of a mile from my house I did not scruple of taking the note at all; I took the note, and wrote upon it before I gave her the change.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this note, sir, and say whether that is the note - A. This is the note, it has my hand-writing upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, you say you believe that the person that gave you this note was the same person that gave you a note before - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe so. Have you any doubt that the prisoner at the bar is the person, from her features, and her height - A. I have no doubt that she is the same person, to the best of my knowledge and remembrance it is her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Can you swear positively it is her. Do not be in a hurry. Look in the woman's face - A. To the best of my recollection it is her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. Do you mean the same person who uttered the former note as the person that gave you this note - A. Both.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that she is the person that uttered to you the second note, this note - A. No, she is the same person to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt upon the subject - A From all appearance I have no doubt of it. She was a stranger to me, though she was in my shop twice.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you observe what the gentleman means. I ask you whether you have any doubt upon the subject that the is the same person - A. I could not swear positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you, or not, swear positively that she is the same person that tendered the same note - A. I believe it is, from her appearance and her height, and her features, though she had a large bonnet on at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it - A. I can say no more than what I have said.</p>
               <p>Q. If you have a doubt say so; if you have not, say that. Look at the woman, and say whether you have a doubt or not - A. Why, I have not much doubt of it. I cannot say but I have some doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, do answer a plain question. Have you any doubt that she is the same person or not - A. Not much doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have a direct answer - A. I have some doubt; not much doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have some doubt - A. Not having seen the woman but once before I have some doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say, like an honest man, now, that you have a doubt - A. I can say no farther than to the best of my knowledge and recollection.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean to say that it is the same woman to the best of your knowledge and recollection - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q If you had met her in the street should you have known her to be the same woman - A. Not without I had taken particular notice of her.</p>
               <p>Q. I asked you if you had met her in the street, whether you should have known her to be the same woman - A. I believe I should.</p>

Yes, sir, I did, as near as I can recollect the time, from the 5th to the 8th; on this transaction she came to my shop, I cannot say exactly what the article was she bought, some small article; it came to one shilling and four-pence or one shilling and six-pence; I cannot say what. She gave me a one pound note. I took the note in my hand, and not finding the salvages smooth, there were two rough sides. I suspected the note. My wife said, where does the young woman live. The prisoner answered, Jones, Collam-street. I wrote that upon the note.</p>
               <p>Q Now, look at this note - A. This is my handwriting. This is the note. I have not a shadow of a doubt, that is the note I received of the prisoner. There was nothing wrote upon the note when I received it.</p>

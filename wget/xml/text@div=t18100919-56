               <p>Q. Was she able to speak at that time - A. No. There was a great deal of blood upon the bed. I sent Watkins for the docter. I looked all over the room to see if I could find any instrument that it was done with, I could not find it: I came down stairs, and looked if I could find it upon the stairs, I could not; I went up stairs again, I could not find it; I came down stairs and held my light up, I looked the other way to see if I could see it in the passage that leads into Saffron-hill; I saw something moving up and down upon the steps in Saffron-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that near No. 5 - A. Yes, within five yards of the door that comes out into his passage, I directly held my lanthorn up, it moved from me, I pursued it, I saw it was a man; I sprang my rattle and holloaed out stop him. A man coming up Saffron-hill stopped him, his name is Cootes, he knocked him down; my brother watchman catched him by the collar, as he was on the ground; I said to the prisoner, how could you do such a rash act as you have done; he said, what I have done I shall be happy if she is a dead woman, and I shall die a happy men. I took him to the watchhouse, he said the same there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, on this Tuesday evening, hear the cry of murder - A. Just as I was going the hour of half after twelve, I heard the cry of murder; I went directly down Union-street, and just as I was turning, Watkin's said, it is murder in Onslow-street. I went to No. 5, Onslow-street, with Watkins and Winterburn, I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you find in the room - A. The brother of the prisoner, and the brother's wife; there was no light there, I begged my partner to give me a light; I lit my lanthorn, I saw, then, blood all over the bed, and the woman lying with her throat cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that woman was - A. They called her the prisoner's wife, the brother and sister both said it was his wife. The prisoner was not there then.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known this woman before - A. I saw her two or three nights before, they had two or three words before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear their names - A. I heard their names were Griffin. When I was there three nights before they had words; he said it was his wife, and the landlady below said it was his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon seeing her upon the bed what did you do - A. I went down stairs and went in search of the prisoner, I went into Castle-street and just as I turned into Onslow-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190033"></xptr>again, my partner's rattle sprang, I saw the prisoner running, and Cootes after him; he hit him on the side of the head and the prisoner fell down; I catched him by the collar and took him to the watchhouse; on our coming up Saffron-hill, he said, he hoped she would be dead; he said the same at the watchhouse; from there we took him to prison, then he said, he hoped she was dead, or would be dead when we got back.</p>
               <p>- FAULKENER. I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prisoner's lodgings, No. 5, Onslow-street - A. I did, in company with Mr. Skinner, the doctor. When we got there, I saw the woman lying on the bed with her throat cut; she was setting up on the bed when I went in, she was held up by two men, whom I did not know; the doctor ordered that she should be laid down; he examined the wound and said he could do nothing for her, that she must be taken to the hospital as soon as possible; she was then held up by me and another; I asked her who it was that had done it.</p>
               <p>Q. She was then in a dying state was she - A. Yes; the doctor said he was certain that she could not make me any answer, she could not speak. I then asked her if her husband had done it, she nodded her head twice; I asked her if she was sure that her husband had done it, she nodded her head twice again; I asked her what it was done with, she pointed with her left hand towards the foot of the bed; and turning over the bed, between the cording of the bed I observed the razor lying on the floor; in the manner that I hold it was open; there is some blood on it now, and there was some blood on it then, and there is the name of Griffin on the handle of the razor. I requested a man that was standing at the foot of the bed to pick it up, he did, and gave it to me. I held the razor up to the woman's face; I said, mistress, was it done with this, she nodded her head twice; I asked her again if she was sure that her husband had done it, when I had the razor in my hand, she nodded her head; I asked her if she was sure that she did not do it herself, and she shook her head; I asked if he was her husband, she nodded her head; I asked her no further questions. She appeared to be sensible for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards; before we moved her she endeavoured to speak to the brothers wife, but could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the brother's wife there all the time - A. All the time I was there, and the brother was in the room with me, and the doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you assist to carry her to the hospital - A. I did; she died between there and Holborn-bridge, in the city of London, in the parish of St. Andrew's.</p>
               <p>Had you known the prisoner before - A. I am not positive whether I had seen either of them or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her name mentioned - A. I did not, while I was there. The brother's wife accompanied us to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The prisoner was not present at the time that you put these interogatories to the deceased - A. No, I did not see him untill the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SKINNER, Q. You are an apothecary - A. Yes; I was sent for to the poor woman; when I came there I examined the wound, I found there was a compleat separation of the wind pipe, and the wound being so extensive in depth and breadth, I could render no assistance whatever; it was evidently mortal, and she was then sinking very fast for want of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the cause of her death - A. Yes. I desired her to be taken to the hospital; I thought it was better for her to die any where else, than in the filthy room where she was then lying. She smelled very strong of liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before - A. Yes; I attended her five or six months before, of a uterine hemourage; I knew her name was Griffin, that was all, that she was the wife of Griffin. When I was called at that time, she was very much in liquor, and the room smelled so much, that my mouth was full of water; and she smelled very much of liquor this time.</p>

He was not, I saw a great deal of blood upon the bed, I desired them to lift her up; I then asked if any doctor was sent for, they told me there was; the surgeon came while I was there; I then took the candle and searched for the instrument, and just at that time there was a cry, that the man had gone up Hatton-garden, then I quitted the room, and went in pursuit of the man, I found him in the watch-house in Hatton-garden. I asked him if he had not done a pretty thing; he said, he had, but do no talk to me here, I shall be talked to in another place; he did not say what the job was. I searched him and found nothing upon him; I looked at his hands to see whether they were bloody or not, they were not, I then took him to the New Prison, going along, he told me that she had been out all the night before, and him, his brother and his wife, had been in search of her, he met her in the gin shop, at the corner of Charter-house-lane, they went in and had some gin together; and they went to another house and had four or five pots of beer, it grew late and they came home, then we had got near on to Clerkenwell-green. As I was going to take him to the New Prison, he said d - n it, Cook, you know me very well, let us go and have something to drink; I told him we could not have any thing at that time of night; he said, Yes; I declined having any thing. I then, going along, told him it was a bad job for him; he said, he hoped she was dead, he would not mind being hanged, as to-morrow, for he should die a happy man, he said, how should I like another man to go along with my wife; I said, not at all; he said, that is the reason I done it; he said, she had been out all night, he had been looking for her all night, and part of the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not tell you that she had been with a man all night, and that she told him he would give him a good wapping - A. I think I recollect his saying, that she told him, that one Jem would give him a good wapping, she had been out all night, I do not recollect any further.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. What is become of the sister - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the deceased, the prisoner's wife - A. Yes; the prisoner called her Nance; I had some business to do for them about five months before, I had a warrant to serve for the man and woman, and he called her Nance four or five times.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190034"></xptr>Q. Did not he tell you that she had been profligating with Jem - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear him say, just before they returned home, they went into a public house, and two young men had taken indecent liberties with her - A. No, that is the evidence of the brother and his wife.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner in the watchhouse - A. Yes, I asked him his name; I then said to him, how came you to be guilty of such a rash act as this; he answered, how would you like to see another man brought under your nose, he then said, that she was dead, or that he should soon hear of her being dead, he did not mind being punished, he should die a happy man.</p>

            . I was officer of the night; the man was given into my custody; I heard him make a reply, when he was questioned how he could do such a rash act, I only understood that he feared she was not dead, if he heard she was, he should die with pleasure, or similar to that, I will not say that he used these words precisely.</p>

            . Q. I believe you are constable - A. Yes, I apprehended the prisoner; the first word he said when I got hold of him was, let me go; directly after, he said, he did not mean to go away. When we got into Saffron-hill, he said, he was very happy. At the watchhouse he said, he was very happy, he was, upon his soul; he said, how would any of you like it, if your wife was to bring a man home before your face.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cook. Look at the deposition that you made before the magistrate, and see whether you recollet every thing you see what you said there is that true - A. It is, I omitted saying he would give him a good wapping, and she had been out all night. That account is perfectly true; I recollect it now.</p>

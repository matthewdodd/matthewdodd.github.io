            . I am a Police-officer, I stopped the prisoner on the morning of the 7th of December, in Tottenham-court-road, with these three saws and other tools - it was more than a quarter-past five o'clock; he gave no account, and I detained him till I knew whose they were - he told them that he got them from Mr. Jackson, in Charlotte-street, and that he himself lived in Bainbridge-street, St. Giles' - I went there, and found it was not true.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A person came up, and asked me to carry these tools to the Strand; the officer asked what they were - I said tools, but I hardly knew what.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in George-street, Foley-place. About eight o'clock in the morning of the 17th of November, I was standing in George-street, and saw the two prisoners come up the steps of the prosecutor's cellar—Sale had a prickle of bottles on his head—he walked up George-street, and Wager walked behind him—they went to Mr. Derrick's—I saw them go in, and is about ten minutes they came out, and they had neither basket nor bottles then.</p>

I lost my poultry some time in March that year; I discovered the loss in the morning, about seven o'clock - I saw it all safe overnight, when I locked the door, and took the key - I missed a goose, a gander, eleven fowls, a duck, and I think twenty-four eggs; the out-house door was not broken open; there is a window to it, and part of the glass had fallen out of the frame - the persons appeared to have got over the wall, knocked off some of the tiles, and then brlken the window frame, and so got in -I had a dog to guard my premises, and that dog was killed; I found it had been beaten - he died in two or three days after; I saw the marks where they had got down by the windows - there were the marks of the nails of shoes, and I think they were the marks of more than one person, but whether it was more than two I cannot say; I found all my poultry the same evening, in the possession of an officer, and found Joseph Wren in custody - he was tried afterwards; I am quite certain the poultry was mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. This was two years ago? A.

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 17th of March, 1830, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was going along the Lea-cut, about a quarter of a mile from Tickner's - Prendergrass was with me, and we met three men approaching us; I have every reason to believe the prisoner was one of them - I have no doubt of it; one of them, named McEwin, had a sack across his shoulder - I stopped him, and the other two,(Wren and the prisoner) walked on: I sent Prendergrass after them, and they both ran away as hard as they could run; I found in the sack a goose, a gander, seven or eight fowls, and a duck - some of them had been recently killed, and were warm; I laid hold of McEwin - he knocked me down, and got away - Prendergrass did not succeed in taking either of the others; then he and I went to a house on Bow-common, kept by a man named Wilson - it is rather more than a quarter of a mile from the place; I saw a woman in the house - I remained there about fifteen minutes, when two men entered; I was in the kitchen - they ran into the parlour: I have no doubt the prisoner was one of the men, they ran away; he had a green jacket on - that was the prisoner, and the same man appeared in the parlour with Wren; he said,"Oh, my God, here are officers here," and both ran out as hard as they could - I pursued, but did not catch them- they got into the fields; I went to various places after the prisoner, but could not find him - Wren was taken the following morning; I searched the house, and found two hens in a cupboard in an up stairs room, sitting on some eggs - there were about twenty-four eggs, which had a cross on them in ink; I showed the hens and eggs to Tickner the same day, and he claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you positively swear the prisoner was one of the men? A. I have no doubt of it from the recollection I have - it is so long since I would not positively swear it; I found a rent-book in the house with an account of some rent which had been paid.</p>

            .

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you leave the house yourself immediately after the officers had been there? A. I was not there - I did not live there at all; the date in the book is not 1820. but 1830; it is a figure of three - that is the way I write; I let the prisoner the house, but how much he occupied himself I do not know - I went there once to receive my rent; there were people there: I cannot say whether they were lodgers - there are two rooms and a kitchen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you examined against Wren? A. No; I gave evidence at Lambeth-street about two months ago - that was the first time I told any thing about it - I think I had told Lea or the prosecutor what I had seen, but am not sure.</p>

             was my father, and lived at my house. My countinghouse was broken open about the 17th of February, 1830 - it communicates with the house, and is part of the house - there is an internal communication: it is in the parish of <placeName id="t18320906-8-crimeloc51">St. Leonard.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Who paid the rent of the house? A. I paid the rent of the whole; my father had nothing to do with the counting-house - I paid the rent of the house, and lived in it.</p>

            . I searched the prisoner's house on the 17th of March, 1830, and found the top of a mahogany table under the bed, on the floor, and two more pieces belonging to it- I also found a gardener's knife with a silver ferrel on it. which I have not here, also a quantity of seeds, and about a peek of scarlet beans, part of a Latin dictionary, and Johnson's dictionary.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found these things with the rest? A. Yes; I saw a woman at the house, who I have since seen at the office, when the prisoner was taken - she passed for his wife; I saw two men come up to the house, and run away, on the 17th of March.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you believe the prisoner to be one of those men? A. Yes.</p>

            . I will not positively swear to the top of the table - I believe it to be mine; the seeds have my hand-writing on the papers containing them, and are part of what were stolen that night; this Johnson's dictionary belonged to my late father - I know one was lost, but the covers are taken off and I cannot identify it; here are a few leaves of a Latin dictionary - we lost one.</p>

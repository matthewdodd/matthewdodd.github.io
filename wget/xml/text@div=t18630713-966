I am a boot and shoe maker, of 5, Bradley-terrace, Wandsworth-road—on 4th June I went to bed at 12 o'clock, fastened up my house, and saw that all my property was safe—next morning, about 6 o'clock, I came down and found the kitchen window and shutter open, and the things all gone—an entrance had been effected by getting over a wall at the back and opening the shutter and window—I saw the things at Wandsworth police-court the same day—the window and shutter were closed, but not fastened.</p>

I live with my brother, at 9, South Lambeth-road—on Friday morning, 5th June, about half-past 6 o'clock, I saw the prisoner go to a hole in a field which is fenced in, take out these things, and run away—I ran after him, and asked him what he had got—he said, "A bit of bread"—I said, "Let <hi rend="italic">us</hi> look?"—he refused, and I followed him—he put the bundle down and ran away—I went and told the police, and he was taken—I took the things to the police.</p>

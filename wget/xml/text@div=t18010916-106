               <p>THOMAS WILLSDEN sworn. - I am a turner: On Tuesday, the 28th of July, between four and five o'clock, at the top of Wilderness-row, I met the prisoner with something in his apron; turning my head round, I saw it was a piece of beef; I went to the butcher's shop, and missed a piece of beef which I had seen there before; I immediately went after him, and asked him what he was going to do with that beef; he said, a man had given him six-pence to carry it into Wilderness-row; I brought him back to the shop; the beef was delivered to Littlewell.</p>
               <p>JOHN LITTLEWELL sworn. - I am a butcher; I was killing some sheep at Mr. Sylvester's brother's shop; I heard that Mr. Sylvester's shop had been robbed; I ran up to the shop, and found him in custody; I weighed the beef, and it weighed twenty-seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Sylvester. I was not at home at the time it was taken; I saw the beef the next morning; I am sure it is my property; I had no other ribs of beef.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Willsten). Are you fine the piece of beef you took from the prisoner was the same that you shewed Sylvester? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to look for work, and a man in a smock-frock asked me to carry this beef into Wilderness-row, and he would give me sixpence. <rs id="t18010916-106-verdict543" type="verdictDescription">

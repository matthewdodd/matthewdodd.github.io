                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Upper Cornwall-street, St. George's—the prisoner keeps a pork butcher's shop in Charles-street—on Saturday night, 18th Jan., I went to his shop to fetch a saveloy, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner served me—I put down a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I thought it was a good one—the prisoner took it up, bit it, examined it, and said, "This is not a good one"—I said, "Give it me again, I will change it where I have taken it"—he said, "You shall not have it"—those words were repeated several times—we got into conversation together—I insisted on having it—he refused to return it, and walked backwards and forwards at the counter—the sixpence was then in his hand—he came back again towards the counter opposite to where I stood, and put it down on the middle of the counter—I thought he put it for me to take it up—I instantly tried to take it up, and touched it with the first finger of my right hand, and he chopped off the end of my finger—the six<lb></lb>pence went over the counter, and the end of my finger after it—my thumb was wounded as well—I said, "You wicked wretch, will you give me my six<lb></lb>pence now?"—he said, "No, and if you do not go away I shall make you fare worse than you are," and he went towards the door—a gentleman came and took me to the doctor—I went to the station—Dr. Ross came and dressed my would—I was afterwards taken to the hospital, and a piece of my finger was obliged to be cut off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a portrait and landscape painter—I went into the shop, and heard Mr. Parker say, "You villain, where is my sixpence, you have cut my finger off"—the prisoner came round the counter laughing at her, and said "D----n you, get out, or I will serve you worse."</p>

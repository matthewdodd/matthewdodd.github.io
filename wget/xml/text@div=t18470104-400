                  </hi> I am landlord of the Red Lion public-house, in Red Lion-street, Spitalfields. The prisoner was my potman for about eleven months—in consequence of something that was said to me, and what I ob<lb></lb>served, I sent the prisoner up stairs on the morning of the 29th of Dec.—I followed him up—I went into a room and concealed myself under a bed—I had found a bottle concealed under the sofa about five minutes previously—it contained half a bottle of rum, the same as I had in my stock—the prisoner came into the room and placed a bottle-back under the sofa, and went down stairs—when he left the room I got out and book up the bottle—it was the same I had seen before, but it was then empty—I went down stairs to the long room, and showed the prisoner the bottle—I said, "I have found you out at last"—he said, "I know I have done wrong; I have only had two half-bottles since the time you accused me of taking the brandy; here is the key of the cellar"—he went down and showed me how he opened the cellar, and said he had had the key ever since he had had the brandy, which is sixs months ago.</p>

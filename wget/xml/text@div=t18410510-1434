                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Darke, a hair-dresser in Bridge-street, Westminster. On the 19th of March, the prisoner came to get his hair curled—it came to sixpence—he gave me half-a-crown—I gave him the change—I put the half-crown in the till, and afterwards found it was bad—I then put it at the back of the till, with some papers, where there was no other money—on the 14th of April, he came again to have his hair curled—it came to sixpence—he gave me a bad five shilling piece—I called my husband, and gave it to him—the prisoner said he had taken it, and would give my husband one shilling to let him go—my husband gave him in charge, and gave the officer the half-crown and a five-shilling piece—no one had access to the till but myself and my husband.</p>

            . I am a harness-maker, and live in Edgware-road. The prisoner came to my shop on the 8th of May, about seven o'clock in the morning, with Biddle, who was tried here last Sessions; they brought some harness to my house; I was not at home at the time, and they took it to a neighbour's who detained it - it was then brought to my shop, and the officer told me to detain them when they came; I told them I must detain them, and the prisoner ran away; the other was taken - I am certain of the prisoner.</p>

I was sent for on the 8th of May, to take two men on suspicion of stealing some harness; as I was going to Mr. Harlemore's shop, the prisoner passed me; Mr. Harlemore came out and gave me the other, and he said, "That is one gone past you;" I pursued but could not overtake him.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hendon. I apprehended the prisoner on the 6th of September - I said, "You know I had a warrant against you for stealing harness from Mr. Buckingham, and why had you not got further out of the way;" I said, "I blame you for taking it of your brother's master, who has employed him so long;" he acknowledged to being a party to the robbery, and said, he was very sorry he should have done such a thing - I had not made him any promise or threat.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

My house was broke open on the second of this month, about nine in the evening. My wife and I went out at half after seven o'clock; it was then dusk; I saw all the doors and windows fast myself; we left no one in the house. We returned at half after ten, when we found the house broke open, the lock of the door was broke, and a pannel drove out of the wainscot: there were taken away a carcass, three legs, and two necks of mutton, half a buttock of beef, and part of a neck of veal. I got a search warrant and a constable, and searched Cross's lodgings, where I found part of the neck of veal. I can swear it was mine, I cut it myself, it was particularly cut, I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there no two butchers in London that cut veal exactly alike?</p>
               <p>Willmot. No, I do not believe any two butchers do; I can positively swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it raw or dressed?</p>
               <p>Wilmot. Raw.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell it after it was dressed?</p>
               <p>Wilmot. No, there is no swearing to it after it is dressed; it was the same end of the neck that I lost. There were two legs of mutton found on Storer, by the evidence.</p>

            . I am an officer of Clerkenwell parish. I went to search the house of the evidence and Cross, under the warrant, in Cross's lodging, we found a piece of neck of veal; the prosecutor owned it directly. I took Mincher, the evidence before the Justice; there he confessed who committed the robbery We went to search Storer's lodging: when we came opposite the house, a woman opened a window in the next house, and cried out, murder, and thieves, and said, there was a man breaking into her house, for that his foot had come through the ceiling. We went into that house, and found Storer, and two legs of mutton hid there, which the prosecutor owned: he had been going along the top of the house, and his foot broke through the ceiling.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear to the legs of mutton, they are my cutting.</p>
               <p>Dinmore. They all confessed before the Justice, that they committed the robbery, and told the manner in which they did it: they said, one held up the knob of the door, another set his back against it, and a third bumped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177504260028"></xptr> open. There were no threats or promises used to induce them to confess, that I heard: I was there all the time.</p>

             and Cross and I went on Sunday night, and broke open Mr. Wilmot's shop, and took a whole sheep, three legs of mutton, and two necks of mutton, half a buttock of beef, and a neck of veal: there was a latch to the outer door, we opened that; it was the shop door we broke open. Finding nobody at home, I laid hold of the brass knob, and while a coach was going by, the two prisoners bounced it open with their backside; we took the meat away, and hid it, and then got a bag. I cut the carcass in half, and sold half of it for five shillings. Storer sold two of the legs of mutton, he was paid before hand for it, he took it to the people, they were not at home, so he kept them at his own house, and Dinmore came and found there and found Storer in the cock-loft. We dressed part of the veal, and ate it, and Wilmot came and found the rest of it; we ate the beef on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you do this?</p>
               <p>A. About a quarter after nine. We had no candle; we know the way of the shop; we lost one of the necks of mutton going along; the other necks of mutton were eaten by the hogs, for we hid them in a place where people keep hogs. I am a Collar-maker, I live just by the shop.</p>

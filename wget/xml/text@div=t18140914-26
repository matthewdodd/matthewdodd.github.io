On the 20th of August, the prisoner came to my house between twelve and one o'clock. I came home to my dinner. The prisoner asked me to purchase the duplicate of a watch. I said, Taylor, what do I want with a watch, there are two hanging there. I shewed him the two watches; they were hanging over the mantle-shelf; he said he wanted money for this duplicate; he must have money. He asked me if I could inform him where a Jew lived, that he might sell this duplicate. I said this is the Jews sabbath. It was on Saturday, at half past twelve o'clock. The Jews will not purchase until their sabbath is over. I sent him to Hyams, a Jew, on the ruins. Then the prisoner left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room with you besides the prisoner - A. My wife was. It being dinner time after the prisoner went to the Jews, I had my dinner, and went away to my work; it was then about half past one o'clock. My watches were both hanging there when I went to my work. The prisoner went away almost immediately when I directed him to the Jew. About four o'clock my wife came to me at my work, and said Taylor had been there after I was gone. She told me my watch was gone, and Taylor had taken it. I went home, and took Taylor with me. My wife told me where he was drinking. I went and took him home with me. I said nothing what I wanted with him until I got home. Going along, he said he was surprised why I should have the impertinence to detain him from his business, I being an officer. I had no staff with me to secure him in the open street. When I got him to my home, I put on my coat, and told him I was a constable. I took my staff out, and said I must search him. I searched him; I found nothing on his person whatever. He began to be very impertinent to me. I sent for a brother officer to assist me; we secured him. We went to the house where two men were in company with him drinking. Me and my brother officer took the prisoner to the Rose and Crown, the corner of Dartmouth-street, where the prisoner had been drinking with the other two men. We searched one of the men that were drinking with him. The man that we found and searched had offered this watch to pawn at Mr. Thompson's, a pawnbroker. Mr. Thompson was ordered to deliver the watch to me by the magistrate. This is the watch; it is one of the two that were hanging over the mantle-piece. Mr. Thompson delivered this watch on the Thursday after the Saturday I lost the watch.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 20th of August last, the prisoner coming to your house - A. Yes; he was there twice; the first time was between twelve and one; he asked my husband to buy a duplicate of a watch. In the afternoon, he came a second time, in company with another man. The first time he came alone. When the prisoner went away the first time my husband was at dinner. My husband went to work between one and two; when the prisoner returned, it was after three. A soldier of the name of Brown was with him; they came to see a woman that lodged in my house, up stairs; she happened to be in my room. They all three went up stairs. She was speaking to me at the time they came to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When your husband went out were the watches all hanging up there - A. They were; they were there when they came at three o'clock; I am certain of it; they were hanging over the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay up stairs - A. About ten minutes. Mr. Taylor came down to my room; he might set there about half an hour; he then asked me to go to let them know he was going. I did. I went up the first staircase and called them; they came down stairs with me to the street door.</p>

            How long might you stay up stairs - A. It might be five minutes on the first landing. We then came down all three together. The prisoner was then at the street door; he was waiting for Brown. The two men then went away together. In about ten minutes after they were gone I missed the watch from the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed one of the watches from the mantle-piece - A. Yes. When the prisoner went away, and Brown, the young woman went up stairs directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that when the two men were there she was not in the room - A. When they came she was there, but not afterwards. When Brown went up to her she was not in my room. When Brown came down, she came to the street door with him, and when they were gone she went up to her own room immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, between the time of their going and you missing the watch, had she come into your room - A. No, nor any one else. When I missed the watch, I went to my husband and told him of it. I told him the house they were at. I saw them standing at the Rose and Crown door when I went to my husband. My master came home faster than me. That is all I know.</p>

             I went up stairs with her, and Taylor went up with me, and after a little time Taylor went down stairs. Mrs. Watson came and called me down; she told me Archibald Taylor wanted to go. I came down with the young woman then. Taylor then stood at the door. I went out with Taylor, and the young woman went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know anything of the watches that hung in Watson's room - A. As I stood in the passage I saw the two watches as I was going up stairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were not you present the whole of the time I was in the public-house - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see me have a watch, or pass it into any one's hands - A. You went out of the Rose and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140022"></xptr>Crown; something passed between you and Mr. Green what it was I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What is the value of the watch - A. It cost me upwards of forty shillings; I would not take three guineas and a half for it; the key is gold; I value it at ten shillings.</p>

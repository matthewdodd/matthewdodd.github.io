I live at 37, Sekforde Street, Clerkenwell, and advance money—on 27th November the prisoner came and said he wanted now 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him who would guarantee the repayment—he said Thomas James Cross, 26, Colebrook Bow, Islington, a householder and carpet-pattern designer—he filled up this application in my presence. (<hi rend="italic">This was for a loan of 51. for 40 weeks, giving Thomas James Cross, of 26, Colebrook Row, as guarantee.</hi>) I went to 26, Colebrook Bow, and had a nation with a woman there—on 1st December the prisoner and a man reprenting himself to be Cross came to my office, and I asked Cross if the prisoner had given him as surety by his authority—he said "Yes"—I handed him the form, and he said that the statement in it was true—I advanced the prisoner 51, less 10 per cent, upon their signing a joint promissory note, believing they were respectable people at the addresses stated—3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. only has been repaid—I saw the prisoner at 26, Cole-brook Row—I heard the catch of the ground-floor front-room move directly the street door was open, and I think the servant asked me Mr. Cross I wanted—he said "It is all right, come in here"—I went in and asked the meaning of my being asked which Mr. Cross I 1—he said "There are two Mr. Crosses living here, one is the other's brother"—I asked him why he had not paid the money; he made some about business being very bad—I have never been able to find her Mr. Cross.</p>

Wood, of 31, Great James Street, Bedford Row—he met me there, and the declaration and the inventory were signed in Mr. Wood's presence—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then gave the prisoner 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and he wrote this: "I appoint Mr. Frederick Wood my solicitor for the purpose of explaining the bill of sale.

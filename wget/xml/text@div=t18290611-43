               <p>THOMAS WESTLEY. On the 29th of April I was in a field in <placeName id="t18290611-43-crimeloc227">St. Pancras</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What were you doing? A. I was walking in the field - I believe there was a fight, and I happened to be passing; I did stop - I might be looking about ten minutes; I seized the prisoner immediately; I was outside the mob - there was no one outside me but the prisoner; he ran off - I pursued, and took him in about a minute and a half; I did not beat him, he was not bleeding; I am a baker - I do not know who the persons were who were fighting.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was running and getting over a fence, and I took him - he said he had not robbed the gentleman, he had picked the handkerchief up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find the handkerchief on the prisoner? A. No; the prosecutor gave it me - I should think there were above a hundred persons round this fight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was crossing the field, and saw a mob round the fight; I had not been there many minutes before I took up this handkerchief - the prosecutor came and asked for it; I gave it, and he shouted out that I had picked his pocket - several of his companions told him to duck me in the pond; he made use of some very bad expressions, and struck me.</p>

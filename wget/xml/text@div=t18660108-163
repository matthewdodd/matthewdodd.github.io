                  </hi>. I am a seaman—on Saturday night, 23d December, about 11.30, I was standing in ship-alley alone—the two prisoners and other men came up and said, "Have you got a pipe of tobacco?"—I said, "No," and one of the prisoners snatched my watch from my waistcoat pocket—they all ran away—I ran after them—I lost sight of them, but they were brought back by a policeman a few minutes afterwards, who showed me my watch—the guard was broken and left hanging on my neck.</p>

I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running down Neptune-street followed by the prosecutors—I tried to stop them, but missed my hold—one of them was stopped by a sugar leaker—I told him to hold on till another constable came—Sullivan ran up Ship-alley and was stopped—I took hold of him and heard something fall—Wilson picked up this watch about a yard from Sullivan and handed it to me—Sullivan said, "You have made a mistake, it was not me"—I took him to the station—I had previously seen Mann stopped.</p>

            . I had these blankets of the prisoner (producing them;) they were brought to me of a Friday night, about three weeks or a month ago; she asked my wife if she could find any body to pawn them or sell them; I was not at home then; I asked her afterwards why she wanted to part with her blankets, she said, she had two children, and her husband had left her, and she was with child. I went to one Mr. Thompson and told him; he desired me not to buy them without she brought somebody to prove they were her own; I went back to her,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177206030016"></xptr> and told her I did not like to buy them without she brought somebody to prove them to be her property; she said, her children were crying for bread, and it was too late to go about to get any body then; so I said I would let them have a shilling to buy bread; she left them; I saw no more of her. On Sunday Hill came and brought an officer to search my house; I produced the blankets, and Hill immediately gave charge of me; the next morning we were examined, and I was bound over to prosecute.</p>

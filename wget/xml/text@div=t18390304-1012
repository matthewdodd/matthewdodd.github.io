                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Priddy, a hatter, in Fleet-street. On the 16th of February the prisoner came, about half-past eight o'clock, and asked if I could oblige him with a half-crown for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he threw on the counter—I examined them, saw they were good, and gave him a good half-crown out of my pocket—I am positive it was a good one—it was very bright, and had not been in many persons' hands—he turned his back to me, as if he had been going to the door, and then he asked me, was that a good one—I told him I would give him another one for it, which I did—he put a bad half-crown in my hand, politely wished me a good night, and walked out—I found the half-crown he gave me was very smooth—I looked at it—it was very black, and the one I had given him was very bright—I ran after him—he had got two or three yards from our shop towards Temple-bar—I caught him round with my arms, and brought him back into the shop—the bright half-crown was what I should call a new one—I marked this one that he gave me back, it is a bad one.</p>

I had given him the other—nothing was found on him, I believe, but a ring that was taken off his finger, because, when I took him back to the shop he gave me back the se<lb></lb>cond half-crown which I gave him, and said, "There is your money, what do you want?"—no bright half-crown was found upon him, but he had got two or three yards from the door, and there were a good many people about.</p>

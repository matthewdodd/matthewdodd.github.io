                  </hi>. I am a publisher, and live in St. John-street. I have one partner—I have employed Elizabeth Larkin to stitch books for the last two or three years—her daughter Eliza was employed by her mother—she has worked for about the last six months at our present premises—I had not missed these prints—they are such as we publish, attached to our own works—this paper forms part of works we are publishing—the prisoners had the opportunity of possessing themselves of those prints and paper on our premises, but had no right to dispose of them—our stock is so large we could not miss it—I dismissed the prisoners on the 14th of March—I afterwards accompanied the officer to Bartholomew-close, where the prisoners were living—I saw these prints found there, and the officer took possession of them—this book was found at the lodging where the prints were—I removed it myself, from the prints to the paper—the officer was not aware of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What partner have you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My brother Frederick—we have an extensive business—we have a warehouseman who gives out the work—I cannot swear what is given out—these books and prints were given to the prisoners to stitch up on our premises, not to take home—they have not had such things to work at their own premises for the last six months—they did take them home to work at their own premises, which were premises we rented and let to them—I perfectly know the mode of the warehouseman giving the work out—he gives them from one room to another—we never had but one or two that we gave work out to beside the prisoners—each person when they bring work back bring a book in which is entered" received," so much as they bring back—the work is entered when they take it out and when they bring it back—I have the book belonging to the prisoners, in my possession—they have not sent to me to know what I had against them—they were told they were deficient 1136 sheets in all when they were dis<lb></lb>Charged—these</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184605110068"></xptr>
               <p>I did miss, and told them of it, but I was satisfied we had a bad lot, and I told the prisoners they had better go about their business—they used to have a great quantity of this paper—the pile of paper they would have in six months would be as high as the room—they often came and stated that the prints they had given them were too few, and got an additional quantity from the warehouseman, because we had not the means of detecting then that they had the plates, but there is no doubt about it now, because here they are—they returned a few plates on the Saturday right when I dis<lb></lb>missed them, and therefore these that are here must have been taken before that—they have not asked for their book half a dozen times—they would bring the book to our clerk.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did they use the book as long as they were employed for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, as long as they were employed in the house, but not to carry work home—they had no authority to sell paper or prints, nor to carry them home—when I discharged Elizabeth Larkin she said I falsely accused her—that she was always very honest, and she and her husband called me all to pieces—I distinguish amongst this paper and prints some that the bad to work upon.</p>

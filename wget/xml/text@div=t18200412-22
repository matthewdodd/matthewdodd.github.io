As soon as I got out the door was locked, and I was knocked down at the corner of the house. I had left some company in the house. It was the prisoner and another that knocked me down. They both fell on me with their knees, held my mouth and hands, and robbed me of this property. I made every effort to cry out, but they throttled me. Before I could get up they run out of the court. One said to the other, have you got it? They then gave me a dreadful blow, and I was obliged to let my watch go. I lost them and returned to the house, knocked hard, but nobody came to the door, and I went home. Next morning I took an officer to the house and shewed the landlord where the prisoner sat, as he had been there all the evening. I knew him to be the man who robbed me, for it was a moon-light night and saw him plainly. I was sober. I had had a pot or two of beer before I went there. He was apprehended on Tuesday, and I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. How long have you been in town - A. I came up that night. I came from Manchester with Mr. Holden, he had been at the public-house with me, but was fetched home. We had called at several places in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any dispute at the house - A. There was a quarrel about a fire which was at the docks. I saw no fight. The prisoner and two or three others went out before me.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday after did you see the prisoner - A. He came running after me in the court, and asked if I wanted him. I said I wanted nothing of him. He had changed his dress. He was then dressed in a drab coat like a quaker. I did not know him in that dress.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to enquire after the prisoner, and he wrote me this note (read). (Mr. Barton's compliments to Mr. Godfrey, having been informed he has a charge against him of a most distressing nature, Mr. Barton will wait on Mr. Godfrey to-morrow morning, at twelve o'clock). He called, but I was not at home. I took him the following morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found him at Bow-street where he surrendered - A. No. I met him in Bow-street. I found Bank-stock receipts on him for 300 l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at Hobb's about eight o'clock, the prosecutor and two friends were there. He was very much intoxicated - he was asleep. Next evening I was informed he had been after me, charging me with the offence. I went to the magistrate to surrender, he was not sitting, and on my return I met the prosecutor. He said he did not know me. My friends persuaded me not to trouble myself about it. I was not satisfied and wrote to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120012"></xptr>the officer, and went to surrender, but he was not at home.</p>

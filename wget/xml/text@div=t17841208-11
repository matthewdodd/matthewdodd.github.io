               <p>Court. After you left the George, did you observe them following you before they struck you? - No.</p>

               <p>What effect had the blow upon you? - It knocked me down.</p>
               <p>How do you know who struck you? - I got up and run after him, I saw his face when he knocked me down, he put his knee upon my breast, the other said, you secure that other bugger, and he went to make a blow at the lad, and the lad fell down, he did not knock him down, he demanded my money or my life, and I bid him take it; he took a guinea in gold, and half a crown and four and sixpence, and eight halfpence, and four farthings; I knew what money I had about me, because I changed it just before, they had all the money I had; after he robbed me he run away, and I got up and run after him till I fell down, I could run no further; and then two rope-makers overtook him, I saw them stop him, he was out of my sight about a minute or two; I was led home by two persons, I was so much hurt by the fall, and the blow he gave me; Rutter got clear off, Harrington run after him, but could not catch him, he was taken the next day in his mother's bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Council. You are sure as to the time this happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Quite sure of that? - Yes, it was on Monday the 22d of August.</p>
               <p>You mean to stick to that? - I do stick to it.</p>
               <p>How happened that these lads were not committed till the 26th of October? - I do not know for that.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Harrington? - He went the voyage<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080051"></xptr> with me, the prisoners pretended to be acquainted with him.</p>
               <p>How long have you used the Barley-mow? - I never used it before, it was as likely to fall into my hands as any other.</p>
               <p>You have been pretty well acquainted with the Barley-mow? - I never was yet; I do not know what I may be.</p>
               <p>How far was it from the Barley-mow to the George? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Guess a little; you were leaky vessels, you wanted wetting very often? - We had a pint of ale at the George, a pot of beer at the Barley-mow, it is between a quarter of a mile and half a mile.</p>
               <p>A pint of ale, and a pot of beer? - That is nothing of a working day; it is the day I went up to be bound; I had been at work for my master.</p>
               <p>Whose house have you lived in since this happened? - My master's sister's.</p>
               <p>What is her name? - Stoddert.</p>
               <p>Which of the thief-takers is it, that you are so well acquainted with? - I am not acquainted with them, I never lived with one of them in my life, nor lay in their house a night, I have seen one of them every day I have been here, his name is Forrester.</p>
               <p>How often in the course of a week? - I cannot rightly tell, some weeks I have not seen him at all; I can swear I have not seen him every week upon my oath, some weeks two or three times a week only.</p>
               <p>How much of the reward is Mr. Forrester to have? - I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Is there any reward? - I know I am to get my own money, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Have not you heard there is eighty pounds to be got by the death of these two lads? - I have not, I have never heard that.</p>
               <p>You may swear it is if you chuse? - Then I chuse to swear it, I do not know it, I never heard so from any body.</p>
               <p>When did you see Harrington last? - I saw him on Sunday last.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - In Farmer-street, he was taken ill on Monday last, this day week, he keeps his bed, I do not know his complaint; I went to him and asked him if he was coming, and he said, he was not well, and was not able to come; I never asked him what was the matter with him.</p>
               <p>Was Patch drunk or sober? - Sober.</p>
               <p>What was the expression they used? - He told me to demand my money or my life.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with Mr. Forrester about that? - No, I suppose I had walked a hundred yards, these boys followed me, and I did not know it, Harrington immediately said, there were the boys that were drinking with us.</p>
               <p>What were you doing in the fields? - We were walking in the fields for our own pleasure.</p>
               <p>Court. Why my boy, do you know what Month it was in? - October.</p>
               <p>What made you say August? - It is only what happened to slip out, I know it was October, because I was bound that day.</p>
               <p>What words did Patch make use of? - He knocked me down, and demanded my money or my life.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you? - He demanded my money or my life.</p>
               <p>He said some words to you? - He demanded my money or my life.</p>
               <p>But I want to know, in what words he demanded it, what were the very words he said? - These were the very words he said, he expressed it in that manner, he came up and gave me a blow and knocked me down, and says he, your money or your life.</p>

               <p>Court. What does that mean? - About our way, they call it a thief.</p>
               <p>What, he said so himself? - Yes, says he, I believe you are going to take me to Green's, we said, yes, we went to the Lebeck's-head, and he pulled out some silver and halfpence, and laid it on the table, and said, that was all he had; Mr. Rosewell, the Justice's clerk, was drinking in that house or the next; they took him into the back room and searched him, and the guinea fell from under his shirt.</p>
               <p>Did you see that? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How long had they been playing the rogue together before this happened? - I do not know, I saw them altogether, when I saw them first; it was only while I was making the thread fast; I saw neither of them knocked down, I saw none of them down.</p>
               <p>How often have you seen Harrington since? - Only once, about a fortnight ago, he is bad they tell me.</p>

               <p>And Burton and you took different ways? - We took different ways, I ran up the field that I work in, and the other up a gentleman's ground; I pursued Patch, and a man held up his stick, and I ran and caught him by the collar directly; the two boys remained in the ground that we worked in, we were three hundred yards off the boys when we stopped Patch.</p>
               <p>Then the two boys did not pursue at all after you and Burton? - No, not after we were gone.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When you were bringing them back, how long was you before you got in sight of the boys again? - About five minutes and better.</p>
               <p>You walked quietly back again, I suppose? - They were at the upper end of the grounds, they had not a quarter of a mile to go, it might be between six or seven minutes.</p>
               <p>What were the two boys doing? - I cannot tell, Patch and the other lad ran abreast of each other, one ran before, the other behind, but they were near together; one parted from Patch, and made off another way.</p>
               <p>How many days have you been attending here? - Three days.</p>
               <p>How much have you paid out of your own pocket now? - About two or three shillings.</p>
               <p>Did you pay for yourself and Burton too, or only for yourself? - For myself, sometimes between us both.</p>
               <p>Did Burton pay for his bread and cheese and beer? - Sometimes, we did not eat a great deal, but what we did we paid for.</p>
               <p>Which of you was it that paid for Rollings, the boy? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>I apprehended Rutter in bed, I told him it was for a robbery in the fields, he said it was not him, it was Patch; Fletcher was present, he said Patch had the money: Mr. Cliff, of Shadwell-dock, gave me half a guinea to pay for this prosecution, and I paid for the indictment. One of the ropemakers brought some victuals in his pocket; he paid part of their expences: I told them they would be paid their expences; there never was a word said about the reward in my presence.</p>

               <p>I have known Patch from his infancy, he is a sailor, and has been a short time from sea, he has a very good character, and is very honest: he has an imposthume in his head, which issues out of both ears, and when he takes liquor, I do not think he is right in his senses.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that it affects him more than it does men of sound understanding when they get drunk? - I think it does: there has been gentlemen of character to speak for him, but their business called them away, and they could not attend any longer.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner Rutter called three witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

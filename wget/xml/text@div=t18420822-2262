                  </hi>. I am clerk of the works of the General Penitentiary, Millbank. The prisoner was employed at some repairs going on there, as a bricklayer's-labourer. On the 6th of July some lead was found put apart in the visiting-cell—it was covered with a slight book-board—we had missed lead of that sort from some other part—I left it there, and set a man to watch—about five o'clock in the afternoon the prisoner left the building—he passed me at the entrance gate—after he had got out I called him back, and asked him what he had got in his basket—he said, "No<lb></lb>thing but a cloth and a bit of bread—I took hold of him, and found there was something hard about him, and found this piece of lead between his waistcoat and small-clothes—he made no observation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a japanner, and live at Glass-buildings, Bloomsbury. On boxing-night I was at the Nag's Head, in Compton-street—the prisoner and seven others were there—a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> commenced about Christmas-boxes, in which the prisoner took up a quart-pot, full of boiling water, and threw it over us, as we were sitting—the publican came to turn us out—Dennis M'Carthy was before me, going out, and the prisoner behind me—I felt the sharp edge of an instrument going into my hand—it came from the prisoner, or from behind him—when we had got two or three yards outside the door, I saw Lane stab M'Carthy in front of the head with a knife—I ran to the police station.</p>

               <p>—M'Carthy was one—the rest followed—Lane went after M'Carthy—about five minutes afterwards I saw Lane in the tap-room, quarrelling with some of M'Carthy's friends—he had a knife in his hand—I asked him what he meant by that—he closed it, and put it into hit pocket—I put him out the back way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon, at Middlesex Hospital. On 26th Dec. a man named Dennis M'Carthy was brought there, with a semicircular wound over the right temple, about two inches long, extending to the covering of the bone; and another, about an inch long, at the back of the head, dividing the scalp only; and another, about four inches long, on the left shoulder—this knife would be likely to pro<lb></lb>duce such wounds—there was nothing to cause immediate danger—we took him into the house for a month or five weeks.</p>

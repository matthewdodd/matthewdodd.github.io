She came home at two o'clock to dinner on the third of March; and as she had no fire she dined with me, and went out afterwards to her work. She said, she had locked her door, and had the key in her pocket. After that, I was going into my parlour, I missed my key out of my kitchen door. I looked up stairs. I saw the stair-case lighter than usual. I went up and saw Mrs. Meakins's door wide open, and the lid of a box half off, and one box gone. I went out, and asked my neighbours, if they had seen any body carry out any thing? A man said, he saw the prisoner come down stairs. The prisoner had been with me the forenoon that day. I was in my cellar, and heard the street door open very softly. I came up as fast as I could, and met the prisoner coming out of my kitchen. I said, what do you want? He said, is Mrs. Daniel at home? I said, go up and see. He went up; this was about 11 in the forenoon. I staid in the entry till he came down again. I did not like his looks. I was told by my lodgers above, that he did not ask for Mrs. Daniel, but for Mrs. Thompson, when he was above. The things, all but the gowns, were found in his apartment [ produced in court, and deposed to].</p>

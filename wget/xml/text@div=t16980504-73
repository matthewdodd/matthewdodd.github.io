            </rs>. One Evidence deposed, that the Prisoner told her in Aug. 95. that he was going to France, and had Money of her to accouter himself; and did go, and return again about 5 weeks before the Christmass following, and told her he saw the late K James, had the Pr. of Wales in his Arms, and brought over with him 37 Commissions from K. James for his Friends here, which he let the Evidence see: That he told her he carried over a List of Names from Ireland to the late King: That he had borrowed above 130 l. of her for those that were to bring in K. James, and kill K. William; that when he was taken up about 2 Years ago, he wrote her word that now he would not have such a Trial as before, and that he was a dying man; which Letter was produced in Court, and the Prisoner denied it not to be his hand. She further deposed, that having got a loan of the Key of Hide-park-gate, she took the Impression of it on Clay, by which one was made, and given to the Prisoner with a design to lie in wait and kill the King; that when the Prisoner was in the Marshalsea, he told her if he were at Liberty he'd kill the King, by which he said many Poor men would be the better, and threatned her for advising him to the contrary, but rather to make an ingenuous Discovery. Another Evidence deposed to the same Effect. A 3d deposed that the Prisoner owned he had been at Valenciens about the time swore to before, and described the Governor to him. It was likewise deposed that the Prisoner said if it were known he had been in France, he should come to the same end one Mr. Pike did, who was hang'd. The Evidence being positive, and the Prisoner having little to say, he was found <rs id="t16980504-73-verdict355" type="verdictDescription">

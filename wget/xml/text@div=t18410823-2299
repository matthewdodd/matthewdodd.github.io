                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Kensington-square. On the 16th of August I was fishing in company with the de-ceased and some other friends—I had known the deceased about two years—his name was Edward Lewis—he was twenty years old—I began fishing with him about half-past ten o'clock—he had been fishing about two hours</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184108230214"></xptr>
               <p>previously—it was in the river, near Richmond, opposite to the Duke of Buccleugh's, which is on the Surrey side, above Richmond-bridge—I, the deceased, and two others, were in a punt, about midway, moored by stakes at each end across the punt—we were sitting on chairs—there were two other gentlemen, friends, in a skiff close by—the skiff was on the Surrey side of the punt—while we were there in the morning I remember two steamers passing up towards Richmond, on the Surrey side of the punt—that is the side on which the current is—where we were is comparatively shallow—when the steamers passed up to Twickenham in the morning there was a little swell—it did not interrupt our fishing—about half-past five o'clock I was sitting with my face towards Richmond-bridge—we were all in that position, and fishing in the same place—I looked round, and saw a steamboat coming from Twickenham—it was not more than thirty yards from the punt when I first saw it—I cannot say at what rate it was coming, but it appeared to be coming rapidly—the tide had turned about an hour, and was running down—I am unable to say if it was a strong tide—I observed somebody in some part of the boat, but I cannot say where, waving his hand as if to the man at the wheel—he was in an ele<lb></lb>vated position, or I should not have seen him—I have seen steamboats navigating, and a person on the paddle-box making a motion—it appeared to be done in that way—I was standing up—I could not see the person at the helm—the steamer continued to approach towards the Surrey side of the river—I cannot say whether it altered its course after the waving with the hand, for I sat down, thinking I should be thrown down, as I thought it would either strike the punt, or we should be upset by the swell—I had scarcely sat down a moment when we were struck by the steamboat—I had not even time to call out—I was about the middle of the punt—I know I was not on the Surrey side of it—the deceased was near the extreme end, on the Surrey side—there was a little boy sitting beyond, or nearest the Surrey side—I did not observe whether Mr. Lewis was standing or sitting at that moment—the end of the punt towards the Surrey side was struck by the steamboat—I cannot say what part of the steamer struck us—we were all knocked down into the punt, and the punt, particularly the end which was struck, went under water—that caused the punt to ship a deal of water—it did not right itself—that end remained slightly under water—directly I got up I looked round, and saw Mr. Lewis struggling in the water—the punt was driven from both its moorings, and carried down with the tide—I threw out two chairs to Mr. Lewis, and other efforts were made to save him but he sunk—I did not then observe the steamer—I afterwards saw her below the bridge—I think I saw her about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after then, between us and the Surrey shore—I afterwards saw her below bridge, stopping—I rowed about for some time to endeavour to find the deceased, but did not succeed—I afterwards went with a policeman on board the steamboat—it is called the <hi rend="italic">Richmond</hi>—the prisoner Undey was pointed out as the captain—I cannot say whether he was the person I had seen in an elevated position making signals—the policeman who was with me told him he was come to take him to the station, or something to that effect, I did not hear him say what for—Undey said he had not charge of the vessel at the time, and objected to go with the policeman—he pointed to Dakers, and said that he had charge of the vessel at the time—I did not hear Dakers say any thing—he made no objection to go—ultimately they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184108230215"></xptr>
               <p>both went with the policeman to the station, where I preferred the charge—Undey appeared to me to have been drinking—he was not actually drunk, but I am confident he was in liquor—I afterwards saw the body of my friend—he had just been taken out—he had been in the water between half an hour and three-quarters of an hour, and was quite dead, bat he had been taken out once before that—we did all we could for him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were yon sitting in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> An ordinary-sized punt, as long as from me to his Lordship, and about three or four feet wide—it was a flat-bottomed one, and I should think drew no water, but I do not understand it—I have fished there many times before in the same situation—the punt was moored stem and stern above the bridge, right <hi rend="italic">athwart</hi> the stream—one of the poles to which the punt was moored had given way, and she turned and lay with the stream; but the fisherman came up again, and set her exactly in the same place as she was before, as one of the poles had not moved—it was done by pushing the pole in the river, and making a piece of rope fast to her—there were three chain in the punt, there were no sculls or oars in her—she was not moved by sculls, hut pushed along, in shallow water, by means of a boat-hook—she was square stem and stern—I know the place where the <hi rend="italic">Vivid</hi> moors, when she comes up to receire her passengers—I have seen boats lying there—it is about 150 yards from where we were moored—I cannot say whether there are shallows about there—we had only been fishing about an hour when the accident happened—we had been fishing before, but in consequence of the tide not suiting, we were obliged to discontinue fishing, and then resumed it again at about four o'clock—I do not know whether it was about flood—we resumed it when the fisherman told us we might do so—the fisherman put us on board—I cannot say whether the punt was injured at all—I have not seen it since—if I had had the curiosity to look, I could not have done it, for I was taken out of the punt a very few minutes after the accident happened—she was filling with water—she did not go down—I cannot say whether she would not go down—I did not then observe any mark on the punt—the steamer's striking her dragged her from her moorings—there may have been some injury done to her, but I do not know whether there was or not—I have not looked—the chairs we were sitting on were only a few inches above the level of the water—I should not think the ripple of a sailing-barge would place us in very great jeopardy, sitting in that position—several steamers had passed us in the day—there was a little swell with them,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184108230216"></xptr>
               <p>but I did not consider there was any danger—the chairs were standing in the bottom of the punt—the part on which we sat was above the water—I should think the side of the punt was not more than four or fire inches from the water—I have been fishing there at all times of the tide in the same way—several other persons were fishing in the river—there had been a boat about thirty yards from us—I do not know whether it was there at the time—I saw one afterwards about 150 yards off, and my impres<lb></lb>sion is, there was one between that and us, but I cannot say—they were all in the same line in the river, down the stream, exactly in the same way—I cannot tell the width of the river there at high water—I cannot say whether Mr. Lewis was standing or sitting at the time we were struck by the steamer—the last time I saw him before he was in the water, he was standing—I am sure he did not fall in the water before the steamer struck the punt—I did not see him till he was in the water—I did not see how he went into the water—none of us were in the water beside—a little boy, I believe, was thrown into the water—he took hold of the punt—I do not know how he saved himself—he was wet through—I cannot say whether the stream is deeper on the Surrey side than the Middlesex, but I presume, from all the boats passing us on the Surrey side, that it is deeper there—I cannot say whether or not the steamer had any motion of the wheel when she touched the punt—I have always seen captains of steam-boats waving their hand to the man at the wheel—but I do not understand which way it means to direct him—I never went to Richmond by a steamer.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean you only drank one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—I only drank one as far as I remember—I had drank no more than was rational to drink on such occasions—I had been taking a glass of wine and some ale—no more than my proper quantity—it was in the skiff I rowed about to see if I could find the body.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an artist, and live in Berners-street. I was one of the fishing party in the pun—I have not been in the habit of fishing there—I had been ashore in the course of the day, and went on board again about four o'clock—we had been to the house of Mr. Lewis's father, at Richmond, and taken some refreshment—none of us were in the least affected by what we drank—about half-past five, while sitting in the punt, I heard a noise of a steamer approaching—I looked round, and saw a steamer coming from behind—she was about thirty yards from us when I first saw her—she did not appear to be bearing on the punt at first—the bow of the vessel was going in a direction towards Richmond-green, about parallel with the Surrey shore—I think if she had kept that course, she</p>

               <p>would have cleared the punt, but the Ride of the paddle-box struck the punt—she appeared to come more towards us before she struck the punt—that appeared to be from altering her course—I did not perceive any thing be<lb></lb>tween her and the Surrey shore which made it necessary for her to alter her course—I had observed two or three steamers going up in the morning— their passage between us and the shore made the punt rock a little, from the swell—I did not notice any thing done on board the steamer before the blow was struck—the punt was very much shaken—I was thrown down—the punt tilted, and shipped some water, and was separated from her moor<lb></lb>ings—when I got up I observed Mr. Lewis in the water—efforts were used to save him, but he was quite dead when he was got out of the river afterwards—the steamer was going at about the ordinary rate when she came up to us—she bad the tide with her—my impression is, that her I wheels were in motion, but I cannot be certain—she was stopped as soon after the collision took place as she reasonably could be—I did not notice whether the action of her wheels was reversed—she stopped, and remained there some ten minutes, then went back towards Richmond bridge—I af<lb></lb>terwards saw another steamer lying at the landing called "the Pigeons," above Richmond bridge—that is about one hundred yards from where our punt was moored—I did not notice whether she was in motion or lying there, nor whether she was close to the shore.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Kew Bridge. I was one of the fishing party in the wherry—it was not a skiff—I noticed the <hi rend="italic">Rich<lb></lb>mond</hi> before she struck the punt—to the best of my recollection I first saw her about forty yards from the punt—she was standing down, I thought, in<lb></lb>side of us, I mean the punt and wherry, for we were all fastened down—I judged that her course would clear the punt—I noticed a man on the larboard paddle-box, which was nearest to us, and thought he was making signal—</p>

               <p>be waved his band, apparently guiding the man who was steering—I have been on board steamers, and seen how they are navigated—at the time she struck the punt, I think the wheels were not in motion—they were so when first saw her—I saw her paddle-box strike the punt—it tilted the punt, and threw the deceased into the river—when I first saw the steamer, she was coming down the stream, and, as I thought, taking a course which would clear the punt—I did not observe any alteration in her course—my idea was that the man on the paddle-box was making signals to put into the Richmond shore, as if to avoid us, but I did not observe any alteration in the course—I cannot tell whether the course was altered or not—the bow of the vessel cleared us entirely, and the greater portion of the pad<lb></lb>die-box—a steamer had gone down before, pretty nearly in the same course as this was coming, but I do not know what became of it—I cannot ex<lb></lb>actly recollect how long before that was, but one had passed—I did not notice where she or any other steamer was at the time the collision took place, but I afterwards saw there were two steamers; the one which caused the accident, and another—I understand the distance between the punt and wherry and the other steamer has since been measured, and it was about one hundred yards—when I saw that steamer she was in motion, and I I thiok she was coming up—I thought she was coming to give us assist<lb></lb>ance at the time, but I did not see enough to judge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, and have been so about eleven year. The deceased engaged a punt of me on the morning of the 16th of August, which I moored off the Duke of Buccleugh's premises, about forty yards from them—it was athwart the stream—the Surrey end of the punt was not quite forty yards from the Duke's wall—I was present when the distance was measured—I am sure the spot where the measurement took place, was where I moored the punt—I have been frequently in the habit of mooring punts for the last eleven years—I can tell the place where I moor them from signs on the bank—the current is on the Surrey side—where we fished that day is three feet two deep at low water—the channel of the river is between that spot and the Duke of Buccleugh's—the large boats, the west country barges, and steamers, pass between the Duke of Buccleugh's and the punt—I have observed that in my experience as a waterman—there was a wherry with the punt—it was not fastened to the punt, it was fastened to a chain attached to the stake the punt was moored to—I have moored punts at the same place for the last eleven years—I left the gentlemen at half-past nine o'clock in the morning—I was not there when the accident happened—I went on board just before four, and left the punt moored secure in the usual way, athwart the stream—about five was returning to the punt, and met it coming down the stream with her stern down, and the head cocked up, and water in the stern—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Richmond</hi> steamer—steamers always take the course between the punt and the Duke of Buccleugh's, coming to the channel—I saw the steamer below the punt when the accident was over—the wheels were not in mo<lb></lb>tion —she was swinging down—Dakers, the mate, was at the wheel—I</p>

               <p>He was also indicted a second time for the feloniously slaying of the said Person.</p>
               <p>Captain Littler depos'd, That he was sitting in the Room, where were several Gentlemen, and the Prisoner and Mr. Baron were playing a Game at Billiards, and Capt. Colt and the Prisoner had laid a Bett of 4 or 5 s. upon the Game, and a piece that had been glued into the Billiard-stick dropped out, and the Deceased was sent out to get it mended, that there happening to be a Dispute about the Bett while the <rs id="t17310714-27-viclabel132" type="occupation">Boy</rs>

             depos'd, That he saw the Blow given, and the Prisoner said to him, you little Rogue, if you had not staid so long, this Dispute had not happened; that he did not apprehend the Blow to be such, that could have done the Boy any Injury, nor the Prisoner to be in any Passion, or angry with him when the Blow was given, nor that he gave it with any Intent to hurt him, nor did he repeat the Blow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baker depos'd, That he did not perceive that the Blow was given with any Violence, and when the Prisoner found the Boy was hurt, though he nor any of them could in the least apprehend it could be mortal, he was very much concern'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron depos'd as the other Evidences had done, and that he had given much greater Blows to his own Son , to his thinking, without doing him any Injury, that the Blow did not seem to him to be given with any Violence; that tho'a Surgeon was sent for, it about 3 Quarters of an Hour before he was came, that when he came, he said, he believ'd he could have saved the Boy's Life if he had been sent for sooner, but now it was too late.</p>

            , the Surgeon, depos'd, That he opened the Deceased's Head, that the Wound was upon the middle of the Coronal Suture, an Inch and a Quarter long, but had not divided the Pericrarium, nor was there any Fracture, but he apprehends that the Concussion had wounded an Artery of the Brain, and he could hardly have thought it could have been done by the Blow of such an Instrument had he not seen it; and that he found in the Head about three Ounces of extravasated Blood, that the Depth of the Wound was but a third part of an Inch, and was of Opinion, that if he had been trepanned immediately, it might have saved his Life, by preventing the Blood from pressing upon the Vessels.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tast , a Surgeon, depos'd, That when he came he found the Boy in strong Convulsions, and was surpriz'd his Wound being so very slight to see such Symptoms; that at the first, he did not think that Wound could have been the Cause of his Death; but seeing the Symptoms, he sent for Instruments to trepan him, but before they came he was dead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barnet, the Apothecary, depos'd, That when he came the Boy was in strong Convulsions, and he let him Blood, and he bled freely, that he prob'd his Wound, but could not find that it was fractur'd, and the Surgeon said, it was not, and that at first he thought the Boy had been only frighted, and he did not think such a Blow could have put him into Convulsion-Fits.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner call'd several Persons to his Character.</p>

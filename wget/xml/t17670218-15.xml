            . I sent my servant with two horse, one of them a gray gelding, and a cart, to the Swan brewhouse in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your servant's name?</p>
               <p>Chitch. I do not know, he was but a new servant; this was the first time of his going. I helped to put the horses to myself; he said, he knew the brewhouse very well; after that, I met him coming home with the other horse and cart, without the gray one; I asked him the reason of his coming without the gray horse; he told me he had lost him; I found him again by an advertisement at Mr. Terry's at Westminster; I had the gelding 13 years.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say against the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Chitch. I know nothing against him.</p>

            . I never knew the prisoner till the 29th of last month; then I saw him on this; gray gelding in Pall-mall; I am a hackney coachman; I was waiting there for a lady; he had lived in that neighbourhood I found afterwards; he called me by my name, and said, do you know any body that wants to buy a good horse; I said, where does<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176702180009"></xptr> he stand; he said, this is he, and said, he stood at the Swan in Tyburn-road; he had a cap on like a light horseman's cap with the word Glory upon it; he said, the horse was the property of a serjeant belonging to Elliot's fight horse; he said he had been to sell him to a man that was not at home; I said, let me see him go; I saw he was lame; he asked three guineas for him: he said he had rode him a good way without a shoe. I agreed to give him two guineas for the golding, and gave him a shilling earned, and desired him to take the horse home; he did when I came there, I desired him to go to Tyburn-road. where he had told me the serjeant lived. that I might pay the serjeant, and have a proper receipt; he would not go along with me; then I said I should stop the horse; I had him cried in Smithfield market, and advertised him; by which means the prosecutor found me, and he owned the horse, and took him away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was at work at Shooter's hill, I am a brick-maker; coming home, I met this horse by London-bridge, between Tooley street and the gully-hole; there was no harness upon him; I carried him to the Horse and Groom in Gravel-lane, on that side the water, and left him there, and said, if any body comes, to let them have him; I went the next morning; the man charged me 16 d. and desired me to take the horse away; then I took him up to Tyburn-road.</p>

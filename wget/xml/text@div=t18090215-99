            . I am a slop seller in Rosemary lane. On the 11th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came very much intoxicated to our shop with a gallon pot in his hand, I was serving some customers with cotton shirts, he did not offer to sell it; I took the pot off the counter, I asked him where he got this pot; after some hesitation he said he picked it up in the street; I saw it belonged to the Cooper's Arms, Lower East Smithfield; I sent the boy down to Mr. Steward.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you think he knew what he was about - A. I do not think he did.</p>

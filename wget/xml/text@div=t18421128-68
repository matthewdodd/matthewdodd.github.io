                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live at No. 52, Broad-street, Golden-square. This is my copper—it was in the back kitchen, not much fixed, any one could draw it out by pulling it—it was put in in the usual way—I know nothing of the prisoner—the lodgers leave the street door open from morning till night—I did not miss it till between one and two o'clock the following day.</p>

I met Dickins; he asked me what I had got there; I told him it was a bundle from Betty, meaning the prisoner; I carried it to the house where I lodge, and looked at it.</p>
               <p>Is that the lace that is produced? - Yes; when I saw Dickins again he asked what it was. I told him. He said I was a fool if I did not cut some of it off, for he dare say she did not come honestly by it; that she had robbed her master of it. Dickins kept company with me at that time. I did not know but that he was a single man. I carried it to her aunt's as she ordered me.</p>

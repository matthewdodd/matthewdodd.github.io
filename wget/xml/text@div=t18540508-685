                  </hi>. I keep the post office at Kingston. On 27th February, the prisoner, who I have known five or six years, brought me this cheque (<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> London, 9th Feb., 1854, pay Mr. Jones or bearer 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., James Brout; <hi rend="italic">endorsed</hi> James Donovan and John Richards)—he represented that it was sent to him by his father at Cork, in Ireland—I told him that having known him five or six years I should have no objection to cash it after inquiries, and I advanced him a few shillings, and let him have goods to the amount of 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I passed the cheque through the London and West<lb></lb>minster Bank, and it came back to me—the prisoner was in the habit of calling from day to day, to know if it was correct; I told him that it was not—he said his brother in law was in very good circumstances in Ireland, and would send him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if required.—I advised him to go to his mother in law, who this cheque was first sent to—he came back next day, or the day after, and brought me this note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and said it was from his mother in law in London, and that he had been to the Bank of England, and if he had had the cheek with him there would have been no difficulty—(<hi rend="italic">note read:</hi> "March, Michael M'Carthy residing in the parish of Ardfield, in the Barony of Carberry Court, <hi rend="italic">send</hi> a cheque, payable to James Donovan residing at Kingston, payable to him at the Bank of England for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.") I retained the check, made some inquiries, and afterwards told the prisoner it was wrong, and tore the cheque in three pieces and threw it at the back of my counter—he said—"And faith, now, Mr. Beading, if you will let me have those pieces again to show to my sister in law to let her know what trouble she might get into." I let him have them—that was on 30th March.</p>

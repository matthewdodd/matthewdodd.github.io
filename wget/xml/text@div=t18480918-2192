On Sunday, 20th Aug., I was in the rear of the barracks at Woolwich—the men were having their supper—I saw Paul there, and Crossley standing up in front of him, and challenged him to fight—he was in the act of pulling his jacket off as I came up, and said I would put them both in the guard-room—Crossley said he had accused him of a thing he was not guilty of, and if he was any man he would stand up to fight—the prisoner was sitting down eating his</p>

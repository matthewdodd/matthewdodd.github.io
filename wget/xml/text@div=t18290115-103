               <p>SAMUEL DAVIS. I am an officer. About twenty minutes to eleven o'clock at night I was walking along the Poultry, and saw the prisoner with something under his left arm, and looking about him very suspiciously; I went by him, and saw he had this brawn wrapped up in a flannel apron - I saw a knife in his right-hand, as if he were cutting it open, and when he came under the light I saw him cut a piece off, and put it into his mouth; I then asked what he had got there - he made no answer, but turned round; I took it from him, and asked where he came from - he said he was going to take it to a customer, at Kentish-town, and had got it from his master's, in Leadenhall-market - he named a person who I never heard of; I said it was odd he should be cutting it - he made no answer; I took him to the watch-house, and found only 1d. on him - he then told me he had left home in the morning with 10s., and went to Billingsgate and bought this brawn there for 7s.; I locked him up, and next morning inquired of Mr. Myers, who claimed it.</p>

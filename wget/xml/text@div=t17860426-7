               <p>Where did this plank lay? - I found it on the platform; that platform has a communication with the river; there were holes in the plank, which appeared to be made with a gimblet, and afterwards they took a knife and cut it, so as to get a stick in.</p>

               <p>I deal in cordage; I live in Narrow-street, Limehouse; I was alarmed by my servant that my house was robbed, on the 13th of January; I fastened my doors; there was no man in the house but myself; I saw the doors fast, and went to bed with my family; I did not get up till my man alarmed me; he said, master, master, your house is robbed! My wife and me came down stairs; and when I came, I missed this rope and six bundles of paper stuff, and some junk; I observed the board laid there, and the board that belonged to the outside of the warehouse was put up by the carpenter, and never removed till it was broke off: this stick was found in the place, and they took and knocked another board through the necessary, and here is where it has been cut with a knife; they came through the necessary, and unbolted the door; the outside plank and the inside plank of the necessary were forced out.</p>
               <p>Where does that outside of the necessary look to? - The necessary is below in the warehouse; the dwelling-house, warehouse, and necessary communicate together.</p>
               <p>Where does the back of the necessary look to? - It looks to the water.</p>
               <p>How could they get at it from the place where you found the planks forced out? - There are stairs directly under it; upon those stairs is built a little bit of platform, about three feet wide, and they stood on that. I sent for

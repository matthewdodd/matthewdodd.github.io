On the 19th of January, about eight o'clock in the evening, my wife went up stairs to see if all the doors were fast, I heard her cry out murder. I suspected there was more than should be, I went forward and locked the foredoor, in order to see who there were in the house, and on my going up stairs I met the prisoner coming down. I knew his person perfectly well, I do not know what occupation Driver is, he used to frequent my house. When he came down stairs I followed and shoved him into the parlour, and sat down upon a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to him by his name - A. Yes, and I went out to get a constable to take charge of him; the constable refused coming. I was detained sometime, and when I came back he was gone; he had made his escape through the parlour window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go up stairs - A. Yes; the sleeping-room door on the first floor was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he got into the house - A. The doors were open as usual, he had come in at the street door, and had walked up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the sleeping-room door was broken open, what was there taken out - A. A guinea, and a seven shilling-piece that was taken out of my desk that was broken open, and a little trunk was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen that guinea and seven shilling piece - A. I had not seen it perhaps for a week; the man got away, and was away a month or longer before he was taken up. I am confident that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner throw any thing away when you were taking him into the parlour - A. Yes, he put his hand into his pocket and threw away this bunch of keys. I did not know what it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030027"></xptr>then. I saw him put his hand into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q What are these keys - A. They are skeleton keys.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask Mr. Reeves if he has never received any remuneration for the loss of his money, and the locks that were broken that night - A. One of his associates brought me a two pound note and begged me to take it; I said I could not take it onconsideration of stopping the prosecution. If he had brought me more I should have took it.</p>
               <p>Q What other view had you of taking it except stopping the prosecution - A. I took it, and I believe if he had brought more I should have took it.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember the night of the 19th of February going up stairs - A. I do. I found my chamber door open, I saw a glimmering light in the room on the bed, that light proceeded from a dark lanthorn; I saw my little red trunk that we put our tea spoons and tablespoons in. I saw that on the bed, towards the foot, two salts and two pepper castors, they all laid together, they were on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q What else did you lose - A. A guinea, a seven shilling piece, and a shilling, a pap-spoon and silver strainer. The pap spoon was part of the eight spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they worth altogether - A. I should think, between three and four pounds, without the guinea and seven shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. These things had been all removed, had they from their proper place - A. Yes, they had.</p>
               <p>Q. The guinea you did not see, nor the seven shilling piece - A. No, they were in a purse; the bag was left. The eight spoons were all on the bed, and the silver things, they were taken out of a little red trunk, and that was broken open, it was taken from under the head of the bed. I saw the prisoner looking over some papers, and all the books, to see if he could find any value, I suppose: I saw the prisoner and another man looking at them, the other man was not touching any thing, he was looking at them. I shut the door, and halloaed out murder, as loud as I could holloa out, with the door in my hand; these men came to the door to get out, they could not, I held it so tight; they burst the frame of the door, and shoved the door through; the prisoner came out first, I catched him by the collar; the other brushed by and got down stairs, and I saw no more of him; my husband was coming up stairs, and I saw the prisoner at the bottom of the stairs, I catched hold of him again, he said d - n your eyes, what do you want to stop me, have not I been endeavouring to assist you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention in what way he had been endeavouring to assist you - A. No other way than that; my husband took charge of him, and another man that was in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the guinea, and the seven shilling piece - A. I believe about three days before to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing here that you found upon the bed - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were eight spoons, was there a pair of salts, and a pair of pepper castors - A. Yes, and three table-spoons, and five tea-spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. The table-spoons are large spoons I suppose, what may they be worth - A. Between two and three pounds altogether. The three spoons I should not like to take two pounds for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then altogether they may be worth about two pounds - A. Yes. I cannot say particularly, they being old silver.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask her whether she is certain that she was assisting Mr. Reeves in securing me - A. Yes, I held him while my husband and another man took and drove him into the parlour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you sure that when you went into this room that you recollect the features of this man by the light upon the bed - A. I am, he has been at our house frequently at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known him two or three years - A. No, not so long as that, about six or seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no sort of doubt about his person, have you - A. No, none at all. I have always said it was the same person.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is far from my intention of delaying the court, but it is a duty incumbent on me to impress on your lordships mind, and the jury, my innocence and that it is in my power to invalidate the evidence of Mrs. and Mr. Reeve; I had not been there five minutes when I heard an alarm, I thought it was fire. After the other man was apprehended I own one of the men said I was one of them; I said, am I not assisting you? I was never searched, nor never made a prisoner. I went voluntary into the parlour. Mr. Reeve has said I threw the picklock keys away, I never had them. I was not secured on the stairs, I was never beyond the bar-door, and with respect to the woman, by the glimmering light alone she could not observe my countenance. I can prove that she had no other light than the glimmering light till after the prisoners, whoever they were, were gone, and after that it is impossible, from the agitation of her mind to know the prisoners at all. Mr. Reeve said he had no other motive of putting him into the parlour, as he says, which he never did, as I was there, than to see whether I would suffer the prisoner to escape. Call

               <p>Q. Who is that stout gentleman - A I do not know. He asked me about a taylor that lived in my room, I told him he lived in Carey-street. I instantly went down and told to Mr. Reeve, and told her that I had seen a suspicious person in the passage, Mrs. Reeve went up stairs, and I went into the tap-room, and within ten minutes I heard an outcry of my wife, crying murder, and Postan, calling me by name; I instantly ran to her assistance, I found a man coming down stairs within three or four steps of the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same man you had seen before - A. No, it was not. Whom I instantly collared, he tried as much strength as he had to get from me, but I held him so as I secured him, my wife was behind at the bottom of the stairs; my wife saw him drop a watch stolen out of Mrs. Reeve's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it yourself - A. No. I dragged this man into the tap room, and a man in the tap room said, do not choak him. I instantly loosed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that man was that you seized by the collar - A. I should know him if I were to see his face. He went into the parlour, I made an attempt to follow him, but by Mrs. Reeve telling me that I was not to go into the parlour, that there were gentlemen there to take care of him, I did not follow him. I instantly turned to Mr. Reeve, and said, I conceived there was a party concern. I saw in the parlour five or six gentlemen drinking brandy and water and rum and water to my knowledge; the room was not so large but I could see the man escape through the window, by the moving of the curtain, as I thought he did not come out the way that he went in, he was not present. I instantly ran to Mr. Reeve, who was at the outer door in the passage, and repeated these words. He was keeping the outer door that nobody could come in or out. I said, Mr. Reeve open the door instantly, the man that was confined in the room is escaped through the window.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw five or six people in the parlour - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had escaped while these five or six people were in the room - A. I positively do declare it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not make so much action, behave decent I hope you are perfectly sober - A. Perfectly sober. Mr. Reeve open the door instantly, for I can catch the man again; he made answer, do not make a noise, I know what I am about, and afterwards he opened the door and came into the tap-room, I asked him the reason why he would not open that door to me; he told me that he kept the prisoner in the parlour to see if Driver would let him escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Driver in the parlour - A. No, not when I missed the man to my knowledge. Mr. Reeve told me he left him along with Driver to see whether he would let him escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Driver in the parlour - A. No, I saw him in the tap-room. I spoke to Mrs. Reeve concerning her not letting me go into the parlour. When I saw the prisoner I saw him between me and the door adjoining the bar window. When I had hold of the man somebody accused the prisoner of being one of them, whom I know not, he he said, I am just come out of the parlour, father, am I not been assisting you in the best manner I can, meaning Mr. Reeve. He has been in the habit of calling him father, I have been informed by Mr. and Mrs. Reeve a twelvemonth before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Why they have not known him above six or seven months - A. They informed me that I heard a voice say in the tap-room, by whom I do not know, that Driver did come out of the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you at the time that the alarm was given - A. In the tap-room, and Mr. Reeve was in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr Reeve leave the bar at the same time that you did - A. I went out, and Mr. Reeve followed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Reeve assist in taking the man that you had hold of - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Mr. Reeve at that time - A. With his back against the outer door, to prevent any one going out or coming in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did Mr. Reeve go up stairs - A. He did not, nobody but myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were you between the stairs and me at the time that you secured the man - A. The stairs were between me and you, you were against the door by the bar window.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first instance that you remarked me - A. When somebody accused you of being one of them, you said, I am coming out of the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Reeve secure me - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consider me a prisoner at the time you put the man in the parlour - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. It does not matter what he considered you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever observe me obstruct you in your duty of taking the other man - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. You do not know any thing about the keys - A. I saw nothing of the keys until they were picked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lodged any time at that house - A. Only a fortnight, a week after this happened I left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with this man - A. I never saw the man in my life, only during the time I lodged there; I do not lodge there now.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this business did you quit<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030029"></xptr>this house - A. That day week following. I was afraid of losing my life and property by people that resorted there.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this business was it that you saw the prisoner again - A. I saw him yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the first time that you have seen him since this transaction up to the present time - A. On Wednesday I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the first time since the 19th of January - A. Yes. I went to see a boy that was confined there that had burned clothes, a shopmate's son of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a witness upon that prosecution - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know there was a search about this man - A. I thought it was all done away by the money being paid.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not the person that offered the money, are you - A. No, God forbid.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he alone in the parlour - A. I believe there were more people in the parlour, I did not go in, nor into the tap-room; I did not see any body in the parlour; Mr. Reeve was with his back against the taproom door; my husband wanted to go out to go into the yard, because he said the man would escape through the parlour window; Mr. Reeves would not let him go, told him to be quiet, and as soon as Mr. Reeve had gone from the tap room door I picked up a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs Reeve. Had you lost a watch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Postan. I picked up a watch and an iron crow, and the handle of the tap-room door.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you take them up into your room for - A. Because I had left the babe crying in the cradle. Mrs. Reeve said to the servant, I have lost a guinea, a seven shilling piece, and your master's watch; I went to her, I said, you shall have the watch, I have got it; she came into my room, and I delivered her the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever hear Mrs. Reeve make any remarks respecting of her agitation of mind - A. She said she was so very much in a fright she did not know who the man was; she said so that night.</p>

On the evening of the 14th of April, I was near the Great Western Railway, serving a boy with some oranges—I dropped two sixpences, the prisoner was standing there, but I did not see him pick them up—he went a away, and the boy told me something—I went and asked the prisoner for my sixpences, he said he has not got them—he went down the railway-steps, and the officer took him—he searched him, and then knocked the two sixpences out of his month.</p>

Coutts' Bank and got it cashed, do you know the right name of Andrews?" and he said "Yes"—I did not say anything then about how the cheque was signed—I think I afterwards drew his attention to it—afterwards I told him I was an inspector of police—he said "Yes; I know. a lad of the name of Andrews"—I produced the cheque and said "This is a forgery to the cheque," and he said "Yes, that is my writing; I wrote</p>

Ought not the parents to receive the money?"—he said, "No, it is more than they dare do to keep a seaman's money after he has left ship"—he said he had been to some bank; that it was not endorsed; he had taken it back to the owners, and that he was going to have it changed—I advised him to be very careful, as there were always people ready to pick sailors up, and the best thing he could do was to go home to his mother, and I asked him what he was going to do—he said he was going to stay one day in London and see a little pleasure, and then return to his mother in Brighton—I said, "If you like to entrust it in my care I will mind it for you till the. following morning"—he then had a little conversation with my kitchen-servant and the young man I keep in the shop, and he asked the servant if he might go and brush his clothes—on returning to the kitchen he said he had seen a young man who was lodging with me, and was he to be trusted—I said, "What young man? Oh, you mean Gerry," meaning Warner—I said, "You could not have a better friend; place yourself in his care, and go home to your mother directly"—he thanked me, and said he would—Warner then said to me, "This boy wants me to go with him to the bank to pt a cheque changed"—I said, "Oh, go with him, it is a pity he should be lost"—he said, "I will, but I must report myself at the railway"—they then left my house—as they were leaving the. butcher's man came in—I said, "Do you think your master can change this cheque?"—he said, "I have no doubt," he knowing Warner—they went to Mr. Meanwell's; he refused to</p>

               <p>change it—I saw them with the money an hour or two afterwards; Andrews said Warner had got his money—I took the money and counted it, and found there were 12 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—to the best of my recollection the boy gave them to me—I said to him, "Are you going to stay in London another day?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "Let me mind them for you, or you will be robbed of them—he said, "Give me one of them and keep the others, and I will lodge here to-night"—I said, "No, you have a balance, and that balance is quite sufficient for a boy to spend in one day"—I said, "You had better go home to your mother"—he said, "No, I should like to see a little pleasure"—I said, "Give them to my care; let the boy see me count them," and I gave them to my niece with my keys, and she locked them in my drawer—I can scarcely say whether Andrews and Warner went across the road about a watch that the boy said he had left at a jeweller's across the road; I think they went across—they came back, and Andrews asked for dinner—I said to the boy that I thought Warner had lost a deal of time; "You ought to give Warner ('<hi rend="italic">Gerry</hi>' I called him) some recompense for his trouble"—he said, "I have already given him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; will that be enough?"—I said, "I should think so"—they took some refreshment—my niece was in the room a portion or the whole time—they sat there some time—I was busy in the shop, and cautioned the boy being a good boy—he then said he thought he should go home, as he did not seem inclined to take any pleasure—I said, "It is the best thing you could do, but let me know when you are going home"—he said he would take a bed, and he paid me the money for a bed—I said, "Let me know, and you shall have your money; I shall not give it to you unless I am certain you are going home"—I served some customers, and then he said he thought he should go home; he should not like to lose it—he said his parents kept a public-house at Brighton—I said to Warner, "You are going to the railway-station; cannot you see him in the Brighton, train, and make him telegraph to his mother, so that he should not be robbed by anybody following him on the road?"—I still had his money—I looked at the time-table; the time for starting was 4 o'clock—I had the notes brought down, and counted in his presence, and folded them, and told him he should have a print bag to put them in—he said "No, I will wrap them up in another paper"—he wrapped them up, and as he left the door he showed them to me rolled in a piece of paper—he replaced them in his pocket, and went away—I did not see him again that day—I saw Warner in the day, or in the evening after 9 o'clock—he came back alone—I said "What did you do with the little sailor-boy?"——he said "Oh! he wanted to buy everything he saw, first a gun, and that gun I thought I should not be able to keep him from buying;" and that he had seen him off—I next saw Andrews five or six days after<lb></lb>wards—I did not speak to him at night when he took a bed, but in the morning I thought he had a haggard appearance—he went to his ship, and came back—he said "Somebody has stolen my purse, with 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I felt hardened against him—he said he had some sailor friends, who went to a coffee-house, and they asked 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a bed, and one of them was robbed, in a place called the Verity, of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that very night.</p>

I first knew his name was Andrews when the inspector came—I cannot say whose name the cheque was in—I read the amount—I did not notice the back—I never inquired the boy's name—Andrews had met Warner in our kitchen when he went there to brush his clothes—he said he had had a conversation with Warner, and was he to be trusted to go with</p>

He then told me to take the key of the letter box, which I did, and he entered while I kept watch, and two letters were taken. Then he took me to his lodgings, and told me to say I had just come from Plymouth, and the cheque was my wages. He said "Ask Mrs. Burton if anybody will go with you, and she is sure to say Me." We took the cheque to the butcher, and he refused to change it. We then went over West<lb></lb>minster Bridge, and then to Coutts'.

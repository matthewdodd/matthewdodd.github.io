               <p>Ann Tootel. The prisoner lay in the same room with me but in another bed. I lost a gown about three weeks ago, and I found it at Mr. Warner's house by the directions of the prisoner at the bar. She owned she had taken it, and pawn'd it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her the gown to pawn ?</p>
               <p>A. Tootel. No, I was fast asleep when she took it.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, the prisoner brought this gown (producing one, and deposed in by the prosecutrix ) and pawn'd it for four shillings. In two hours after she came with the prosecutrix and demanded it, and the prosecutrix own'd it. This was on the 11th of May.</p>

            . Some time in April I went into the Blue Anchor in Chick-Lane, where I drank with the prisoner. Afterwards she said, come, we'll go home to bed together. When I awaked in the morning I saw two beds, there was another woman geting up. I sent her for a quartern of gin. She said she was out of place, and I said I knew of a publichouse that wanted a servant, and if she could get people to her character, I'd help her to it. Then she strip'd herself, and came into bed to me, she would not lie behind the other woman's back, but she would lie by the side of me. She said to the prisoner, because your husband has been so good, I'll send for something to drink, I'll pawn my gown. I said, then how will you go to service. She said don't trouble yourself about women's business. Afterwards, when the prisoner was gone, she awaked me, and bussed me several times, and when she found I would not be concern'd with her, she got up and said, my wife had pawn'd her gown.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Acton-place. On the 12th of Aug., about five o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoners at a public-house—they asked me for something to drink, and we went and had a quar<lb></lb>tern of gin—I took one glass, and then went to sleep—Thew was on my left side, and Midgley on my right—I slept about a quarter of an hour, and when I awoke, Thew was sitting on my left hand, and Midgley on my back—I missed my purse, containing four half-crowns and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, from my left-hand pocket—I sent for a policeman, and charged the prisoners with it—they denied it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was potboy at the Yorkshire Grey. I saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor and the prisoners and another woman—the prisoners were very busy about the prosecutor, and pushed him into the parlour—he called for a quartern of gin, and they shared it—he then sat down, and the prisoners sat one on each side of him—he went to sleep—I saw Thew was busy about his waistcoat—he had a cape on, which covered his shoulders—I saw Thew put her hand into his left trowsers pocket, she took a parcel out, but I could not see what it was—she dropped it—I was then sent out, and when I returned I saw the prisoners standing outside the door, talking together and watching the prosecutor—Thew gave Midgley something, but I could not see what—Midgley then crossed the road, and went down George-street—she came back in two or three minutes.</p>

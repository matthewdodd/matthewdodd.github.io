I am the wife of William Thorne, of 1, Bond-street, Vauxhall, Lambeth, corn-dealer, and chandler—on Wednesday, 27th November, between 1 and 2, Sarah Crawford came to my shop and asked me for an egg, which came to five farthing—she gave me a fourpenny piece, and I gave her 2 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change I saw it was bad directly she went out of the shop I went outside, but could not see her—I had not put it into any till, or rais it with any other money I put it away by itsel—the next evening, about 8 o'clock, Mary Ann Tiazard came in and asked for a half-penny worth of oatmeal, and gave me a fourpenny piece exactly like the one I had taken the day before—it was bad—I told my husband and he gave her in charge I gave the foorpenny pieces to policeconstable Lansdale.</p>

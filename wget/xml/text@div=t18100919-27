               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was the person that knocked you down the second time - A. I cannot say; there were other persons standing with him.</p>

When I was down and upon my back, I felt a hand in my pocket, I called out immediately, they are robbing me, what is your hand doing in my pocket. The watchman came to my assistance; I shewed him the prisoner, he was about twenty yards off; he was taken into custody immediately, and was taken to the watch-house and searched; nothing was found upon him. I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the prosecutor came to the watch-house he was very much intoxicated, as well as me.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On this morning I was on duty in Beech-street, I heard some person call out, what is your hand doing in my pocket. I ran to the place, I saw the prisoner go away from the person that was down; I assisted Mr. Green up: the prisoner had his coat off, and an old red waistcoat on his arm, that is how I knew him; the prisoner did not go out of my sight, he did not go above twenty or thirty yards off, he got behind a spout in Whitecross-street, as there were two or three watchmen coming down Whitecross-street, that he was runing up. Mr. Green came up and said, this is the man that robbed me of eighteen shillings, I never lost sight of him. I took him into custody and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see more than one person running away from Mr. Green - A. Yes; I saw another, but he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Green say that he had been robbed by girls of the town - A. No.</p>

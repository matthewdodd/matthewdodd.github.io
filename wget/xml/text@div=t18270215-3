I came to town on the 22d of January, and went into my library that evening; I saw my mahogany desk in its usual place there, and, I think, I saw the travelling desk in the window, where it usually stands - in the travelling desk was a small red silk purse, with a steel clasp; it had been made by my daughter's governess, and given to me; it had been in my desk ever since my return from the circuit - I never carried it in my pocket, but it was regularly kept in my circuit desk, and I was quite familiar with it; the mahogany writing-desk cost me three or four guineas. ans was in a perfect good state - it was worth 30s. or 40s.; there was a gold mourning-ring in it, worth, I suppose, as the value of the gold, half a guinea; a silver-gilt vinageret, worth 10s.; two unset topaz stones, which I brought from Lisbon, and, I should think, were worth 2l. - these were in a small secret drawer in the desk; there were also four portraits of friends at the Bar, worth 10s. they cost 30s. - there were several trifling articles, my private papers, and family accounts, and a banker's cheque-book in the same desk. The travelling desk was locked, and the key of it was in the mahogany desk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Whether these things were in the desk on the 22d, when you came home, you cannot say? A. Not from having seen them, but as the desks had been locked ever since I saw them there, I infer that they were there - it might have been a month since I opened the travelling desk, as I only use it on the circuit.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you had not seen the silk purse since October? A. I saw it when I came from the circuit in October; I then left it in the desk, and had not seen it afterwards. I had seen the other things within a fortnight.</p>

            . I am cook in Mr. Curwood's family. On the morning of the 23d of January, about half-past 7 o'clock, the dustmen came for the dust; while the street door was open for them I saw the prisoner in the passage - I am certain of him; he said, "Good morning;" I asked what he wanted; he said he wanted the clerk; I replied he was not up, but I would call him; he said, "No, don't call him, I will call again in half an hour - my name is Rogers;" he then went out of the door, and down the steps; the door continued open. I went into the library, and staid there less than five minutes; I then went down into the kitchen, leaving the street door still open - I came up again in about a quarter of an hour. I saw nothing more of the prisoner - he did not call again. I am in the habit of answering the door - nobody called half an hour afterwards - Mr. Curwood was unwell at this time, and did not use his library; I had seen the mahogany desk in the library<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150004"></xptr>when I met the prisoner in the hall that morning - my candlestick stood on it; I saw the travelling desk there the morning before. I attended at Bow-street on the 1st of February, when the prisoner was in custody, and had not the least doubt of him - I am confident of him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where is the dust-hole? A. The men had to go down through the kitchen to it; there were three dustmen - I kept my eye on them all the time, and am confident they did not take the desk; I could see them sufficiently to be certain that they did not go into the library - they had to pass near the library door, which is about three yards from the stairs, and was ajar - the stair-case is dark; I might be down stairs a quarter of an hour. We had ten chaldrons of coals in that morning - I cannot say how many men came with them; they had to go through the library with the coals. The prisoner had nothing when I saw him go out, for I was in the hall; I did not see him return - I was up and down stairs occasionally while the dustmen were there; they were there half an hour after the prisoner went, and the street door was open. The coals came nearly two hours after the dustmen - it took a long time to deliver them; it was light enough in the passage for me to see the prisoner's features; he was not with me longer than this conversation passed - I never saw him before, but am positive of him.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You talked to him? A. Yes. I could not see from the kitchen into the library; I was a quarter of an hour in the kitchen, but still watehed the dustmen sufficiently to see they did not take the desk.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Curwood. On the 23d of January, at ten o'clock in the morning, the coals came; I went into the library to turn the carpet up, and push the table aside, to make room for the men to go through, and then I missed the desks; the men had not been into the library before I missed them. I know nothing whatever of the prisoner - he did not call to see me that morning.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Monday, the 29th of January, I apprehended the prisoner inside the passage of Mr. Selby's house, No. 15, Howard-street; there was a dust-cart at the door at the time, and I took him in consequence of information which the dustmen gave me. I searched him, and found in his breeches pocket this purse, containing 6s.; he was dressed in a blue coat, not as a dustman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was not near Chancery-lane? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. As far as a man can speak to a thing of this sort, I believe this purse to be mine - I have no doubt of it in my own mind; it is dirtier than when it was in my desk - it was then clean; it was not so tight on one side as the other, but it appears to me that since the constable has had it, it has been stitched up a little; it is the same sort of clasp, the same coloured silk, and opens familiarly with my hand - if it is not the same, it is like it in every particular.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There may be other purses made of the same coloured silk and texture? A. I suppose so.</p>

             re-examined. I have been in the silk trade. I have examined the other purse, and this is precisely the same silk; there is something peculiar in the make of it - it is silk-twist and sewing-silk knitted together, and this silk-twist is woven, which is peculiar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long is it since you were in the trade? A. Six years; the peculiarity is its being made of twist and sewing-silk together - I believe it to be the same I have seen Mr. Curwood use; I feel certain of it.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister. I made him a present of a purse about four months ago, as near as I can recollect - it was more of a maroon colour than red, and had a steel snap; it was made of sewing-silk, I believe - I think I should know it again.</p>

               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Had it a yellow tassel? A. It had no tassel at all; the clasp was arched over a little; I saw it at Bow-street. [The purse was here shown to the witness] - this is the purse I gave my brother; it has a tassel at the bottom of it, but I could not tell whether it had one or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that this is sewing-silk? A. I do not know; it is silk - I did not make it; it was made a present to me by a young man.</p>

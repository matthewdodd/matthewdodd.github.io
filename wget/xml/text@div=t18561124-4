                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Ballance and Co., silk manu<lb></lb>facturers, of No. 37, Steward-street, Spitalfields. They have warehouses com<lb></lb>municating with the dwelling house in which I live with my family—on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185611240010"></xptr>
               <p>29th Sept., I shut up the warehouse and left it all safe, about half past 10 o'clock, when I went to bed—my son was out—about 4 o'clock I was aroused by my son ringing the bell; and at the same time I heard a rumbling, rattling noise, as though it was a rattling of tiles, at the back—it sounded as if it was in the yard adjoining—I went down and let my son in; I then unbarred the middle door, and looked into the yard, and there I saw three bags containing a quantity of silk and goods, the property of my employers, worth upwards of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the bags were in the yard close by the window—those goods had been all safe the previous evening—I found that a panel of the shutters had been cut, and an entrance made through from the yard into the warehouse—there was no other door or window open—they had apparently gone in and out the same way—the place where the bags were lying, was about a yard or two from where I heard the tiles rattling; it is a very narrow yard altogether—a passage runs along there, leading up to the wall where the parties had come over; there was a rope ladder there—I have not seen the place where the prisoners were found, I know where it is—the rope ladder was placed against the warehouse staircase window, fixed round one of the iron bars—they could get from the yard on to the tiles by means of the rope ladder—there was no other way for them to get, but into the yard, where they were taken—the yard where they were taken is about ten yards from, our wall, where I found the bags—I told my son to call the police immediately.</p>

RIBTON</hi> (<hi rend="italic">for Hawthorn</hi>). <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the warehouse in the rear of the private house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; one warehouse faces into Steward-street, the other is a back warehouse—they are both on the ground floor, they lead into each other; the house next to the front warehouse is now empty—it was a Utrecht Company, for printing, or something; they have left about a fortnight—there is no communication between that house and the warehouse—the house on the other side is a bottle warehouse—my apartments are over the warehouse—the front entrance is by a street door, and there is a regular window which has shutters, which were barred inside—there is a room called a weavers' room; no one works there, it is a room where weavers wait to be served; the entrance to that room is in Duke-street; it is on one side of the yard, it is separated from the yard by a wooden partition, about ten feet high, covered in with glass at the top—on the other side of the yard is a narrow passage leading into the street, and right through both warehouses from back to front—that passage is divided by doors—the yard is about four yards long, and about a yard and a half wide the passage is separated from the yard by doors and windows; and then you could not get out into Duke-street without unbarring a heavy door—at the end of the yard is a kitchen; that does not lead in to the back ware-house—it was quite plain how the entrance had been effected, by the rope ladder; it could not have been effected by Duke-street, the doors were all secure; I examined them when I went to bed that night, and also when I came down at 4 o'clock, after the prisoners were taken, and I found all the doors safe—the bottle warehouse is at the comer of Artillery-street—the back premises of the Tower public house do not quite adjoin our back premises, they are contiguous—the noise of the tiles that I heard was on a shed at the back—they are all sheds and closets about there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, A</hi> 411). About a quarter to 4 o'clock, I heard a call of "Police!" went to the prosecutor's premises, and found that an entrance had been effected through the back by cutting the shutter—I found a bag in the yard—I went round into Artillery-street, listened, and heard a noise at the back of No. 17—I sprang my rattle: City police<lb></lb>man 622, came up, knocked at the door, got admission, and got into the back yard, and on to a water closet—I assisted him to get up, another party assisted me up, and I saw the prisoners standing together in No. 18 yard—Lusette exclaimed, "Here we are, we will not resist"—No. 17 is at the back of the prosecutor's premises, and No. 18 is the adjoining yard—a rope ladder was extended from the first floor window, which I saw, and there would be no difficulty in a person getting by it to the yard in two minutes—Lusette said, "There are three more in the <hi rend="italic">mess</hi>"—in the bag were two <hi rend="italic">jemmies</hi>, a jack bit, a screwdriver, and a gimblet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—No. 17 and No. 18 were both locked outside, front and back—there was a person inside who lived at No. 17, and a person partly dressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you knock at No. 17? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a very short time before I was let in—a number of females live there—I saw a lodger outside No. 17—I cannot say whether he opened the door—I do not know who he was; I should know him again—the landlord was inside, partly dressed—No. 2, Duke-street is open all night—I do not think it is a brothel, or a lodging house; I do not know much of that neighbourhood—there is a sort of wash house, or yard—you can get into Messrs. Ballance's premises from there by getting through a skylight, and back the same way—No. 18 is a shop where they make sealing wax—I do not know whether the persons reside there—I do not think there was anybody there that night, because there was a padlock on the front door—the yard where I found the prisoners adjoins the Tower public house, separated from it by a wall twelve feet high—when I first went into Messrs. Ballance a back yard, the rope ladder was extended from the staircase window down into the yard—I do not think any persons who were in the yard could get into the wash house without using the rope ladder; they could stand on the top of the wash house, and tie the ladder to the staircase window, and with it's assistance could get in at the staircase window without going down into the yard—they made their entry on the ground floor—whoever made an entry made it from the yard—they had only to step off the rope ladder into the wash house—the water closet is the roof adjoining; you could get from one to the other—we found marks of violence from the skylight on to the tiles, which made us imagine that the entrance was effected by means of the empty house in Duke-street.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the skylight open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from within, by pushing up—as far as I can judge, a person might have come through the empty house in Duke-street, and so on through the skylight—where they</p>

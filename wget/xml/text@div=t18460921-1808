                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, and live in Wood-street, The prisoner had been in my service between five and six years, first as a clerk and subsequently as a cashier—he was to receive various sums due from my customers, to enter them in the cash—book, and hand over the cash to myself—I have examined the cash-book carefully—there is no entry of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid by Mr. Burford on the 15th of Nov., and the prisoner never paid me that sum of money—here is no entry of 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received on the 1st of Jan. from Mr. Stevens—the prisoner never paid me that, or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it—on this day fortnight I told him, from the manner in which he was going on, he could not be acting honestly—I pressed it closely on him, and he said, "I am guilty."</p>

               <p>—the prisoner had been in my service about three months. On the 29th of February I went to Leadenhall-market to purchase pork—I left my man behind me, and the prisoner was to assist him in loading the cart—I asked the prisoner, when I returned to the cart, how many turns he had brought down, or how many loads, I cannot say which—I counted the pork which was in the cart, and missed four sides, which was part of what he should have put into the cart—he said he had put it into the cart—I sent for an officer, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to the prosecutor. On the 29th of February I was present when my master purchased three pigs and twenty-four sides of pork—the prisoner took four sides and I took four to the cart—he then went back with me for four more each—there ought to have been twenty-four put into the cart—I carried twelve myself—the pri<lb></lb>soner cannot put them into the cart, he is not tall enough—I did it for him—I took eight of him, and he ought to have brought twelve—when he brought his second load, I took them, and placed them in the cart on each side, leaving the middle hollow for the other four—I then went to the salesman, and saw the prisoner had got three sides on his shoulder, and I placed the fourth side on his shoulder—he then started off to the cart with them—I stopped for some pieces of pork, and then went after him, because I knew he could not put the sides up himself—I got to the cart, and was surprised that he was not there, and had not put his sides in the cart—I then thought he might have had an accident—I went up the market, and saw him in the passage talking to a young man—I said, "What have you done with those four sides?"—he said, "I have put them into the cart"—I said, "Who took them of you, did Barker?"—he said, "No, I went round to the step of the cart, and put them in," but I could see they had not been put in.</p>

Q.</hi> How long were you loading? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not more than half-an-hour—I should think we finished by eight o'clock—we had to wait till master came down—I did not at first recollect how many turns the prisoner took, but I recollected when we got home, and when the pieces were counted I was certain of it—I never knew him put loads on the cart without my assistance—the tail board was up—we put the meat in at the side—I am sure he had three turns—it was three or four minutes before I went to the cart, and then I perceived the deficiency—I was a little agitated, but I did not like to say any thing till I was sure—I waited a few minutes, then went and found the prisoner in the passage, which is a thoroughfare—we had come along there to load the cart—I knew the man by sight to whom he was talking—his name is Cox, and he lives at a poulterer's shop there.</p>

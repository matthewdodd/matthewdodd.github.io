                  </hi>. I am a farrier of 14, Smith's Square, Westminster—on 22nd December, a little after 10 a, m., I went to Kensington Place to see Mr. Batchelor, and when I came out of the yard I saw the prisoner there—I said "Good morning"—he said "Good morning"—I knew him before—he said that I had been saying something about his, work, and doing him some harm—I said I had not—he said he was going to knock my brains out, and then he tried to pull my nose, and at last he struck me on the head with his tools, which were in a handkerchief together—I did not know where I was for a few minutes—I bled very much, and went with a friend to the hospital—I had to go there four times—it gave me much pain, and I could not work for week.—I had a hat on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was standing at his own door, next to Cooper's Yard, where he works—MRS. Cooper was present—all his tools were wrapped up in his apron, and I cannot say which of them struck me, but they all came out at my feet—I did not say before the Magistrate "He <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his hammer and struck me on the head"—"I said he up with his <hi rend="italic">hand</hi>" but his hammer was with the other tools—MRS. Cooper heard all that was said—I did not say "I will fetch somebody to take it out of you"—I did not hold up my fists, for I had two turnips in my hands.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-physician at Westminster Hospital—on 22nd December, about 12.30, I examined Harris, and found him suffering from a tri-radiate wound on the forehead—it was tolerably severe—it went to the bone—it was done by a blunt instrument—I do not think it could be done with a leather apron—it would require considerable force to make it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It might be caused by a farrier's hammer inside a leather apron.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman B R</hi> 42). Harris came to me in the Horse-ferry Road, with blood running down his cheeks from a wound in his head—he took his hat off to show it to me—I went after the prisoner, and just as I was going up stairs a man shut the door in my face, and immediately afterwards the prisoner lifted up the window with a poker in his hand and said, "You b----, if you attempt to come here I will knock your b----y brains out with this""—I said, "It is not your poker that frightens me"—I tried to get in, but could not—he said, "I shan't come down"—I said, "I don't suppose you will"—I saw Davis standing at the top of the street, and sent for him—I advised the prosecutor to go to the hospital, and went back to where the prisoner was—there was blood near the gateway—he lives over the gateway.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Cooper, a farrier, who is now in Germany on business—I carry on the business in his absence—the prisoner is my foreman, and has been so for a considerable time—he lives next door—I saw Harris come there—the prisoner had a leather apron in his hand, with a small farrier's hammer rolled up in it—Harris wished him good morning, and Gaskin thanked him for the tale he had been telling about his not being a very good workman—Harris said, "I don't know what you mean; you are b----y clever, and I will fetch some one to take it out of you"—Gaskin said, "I am a better man than you, but you know what your son can do and likewise yourself"—Harris held up his hand, and on that, Gaskin took his leather apron from under his arm and swung it and knocked his hat off—I picked the apron up, and saw the hammer inside—I am certain he did not strike him with the hammer, but simply in the way described—it was a thick brown leather apron—he had it under his arm before Harris came up—when Harris went away he said he would make the prisoner pay for it, and that he would give him a bit of paper.</p>

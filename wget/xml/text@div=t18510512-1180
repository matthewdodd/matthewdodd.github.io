On the night of 7th April, I made the house and premises secure, about half-past eleven o'clock—I have a back-kitchen window, which is protected by iron bars outside—that window was shut that night, and the bars were in their proper places—I had a great many articles of clothing, and other things in my shop; they were all safe when I went to bed, and there was a pair of boots belonging to my foreman—next morning, I was disturbed about half-past five, by a servant—I went down, and found my shop in very great disorder, and goods lying about the floor in all directions—I went for a policeman—I examined the back window, and found it open, and the bars were wrenched out of the stones, that would enable any person to get in at that window, and having got in, they could get in the shop—the desk was open, and the papers that had been in it were all strewed about—several coats, waistcoats, and trowsers were missing; some waistcoat-pieces, buttons, and coat attachers, and the boots belonging to my foreman were gone—I have seen several of the articles since, in the hands of the officers—the value of the whole was about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

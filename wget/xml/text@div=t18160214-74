            . I was going my rounds with a brother watchman, and we saw three men that we suspected had got a swagg. It was about half past seven. My brother watchman remarked to me, that there were three men going along with a swagg. I followed them, and took the foremost man into custody with the bundle. The other two ran away. The one ran up Cornwall-street, and the other ran down Cornwall-street. The prisoner is the man I stopped. I took him as far as Mr. Smith's the pawnbroker's door, with the bundle. He put it on a carpenter's bench, which stood at the green-grocer's door, and said he would not carry it any farther for me. I wanted to get him into Mr. Smith's, and he kept backing in the mud, and I saw his left hand come out of his left hand pocket, and he threw something behind him. I drew my cutlass, and threatened him very hard if he did not keep his hands out of his pocket. I had him in charge, until James came back with a coat and hat which one of the other's had thrown away. I told James not to be in a hurry, but to get a light to see what the prisoner had thrown behind him. At first he said it was spoons, and we found it to be a bag of picklock keys. James took the bundle, and I took the prisoner.</p>

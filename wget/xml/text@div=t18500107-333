On Wednesday, 19th Dec, I and another constable placed ourselves within sight of Mr. Meares's shop, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning—I saw a younger boy, Robert Biddle, about ten years of age—he had this bag with him empty—he was waiting about and watching the house for a quarter of an hour—Lemm then came, and rang the bell of his master's shop to get in—he got in—and after he got in, he let Robert Biddle in—he was in about three or four minutes—Lemm then came and looked out and watched about a little, and Robert Biddle came out with this bag, containing 19lbs. of rice in it, on his shoulder—he walked straight to his father's place, and I followed him—I knew before then where his father lived—he does not keep any shop, but he has served persons whom I have known with corn, and that caused me to watch him—as soon as Robert Biddle got into his father's house, I went in after him—I saw George Biddle there—I asked Robert what he had got—he said "Rice"—I asked where he got it from—he made no answer, but George Biddle said, "From Kinslow's, to be sure"—I asked him then who sent him for it—he said, his father—George and Robert and I then went into the father's bed-room—George carried the bag in—the father, James Biddle, was sitting on the bed—I then asked Robert again whether his father sent him for it—he said, "Yes, my father sent me for it"—the father did not say anything to</p>

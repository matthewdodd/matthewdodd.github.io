                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 25, Castle Alley, White chapel—the deceased, Ann Sullivan, was my step sister—she was single and about thirty years of age; she was a tailoress—the prisoner is a sack-maker, and lives in Castle Alley—on Wednesday, 14th August, Sullivan and I had been out, and between 3 and 4 o'clock we saw the prisoner—she and I had some words, and we beat each other; we were separated then, but my sister happened to push the prisoner, who hit her across the eye, and said that she would either do for me or my sister before the night was out—she has a <hi rend="italic">palm</hi> in her hand, which is a piece of canvas with iron on it—at 12.15 that night we saw the prisoner again in Castle Alley; she had a sacking needle and a pen-knife in her hand—she caught my sister by the hair and threw her down—I could not see which instrument she used, but my sister called out "I am stabbed, "and she was picked up bleeding from the back of her head—when my sister was on the ground the prisoner was on top of her—my sister was taken to the hospital and the prisoner went away—she did not go home that night—we had said nothing to provoke her, nor had we done anything only what happened in the day time—my sister came from the hospital with a bandage on her head—she afterwards became an in-patient, and on the Wednesday she died—we had two pots of beer between us in the afternoon; I do not think we had any more after<lb></lb>wards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first row occurred in Castle Alley, by the prisoner's house—no one was with her then, and there was only my sister with me—the prisoner and I flew at each other like two cats; we both began first—that was before we had any drink—live at 25, Castle Alley, and the pri<lb></lb>soner lives right opposite—after the fight I and my sister and Mrs. Crawley went and had two pots of beer between the three of us—the pots were only filled once—we then went home, but we did not have any more drink—we then went for a walk in Whitechapel but we did not go into any house, we had no money for drink—we walked about till nearly 12 o'clock because my sister was frightened to go up the court, as our lives were <hi rend="italic">cautioned</hi> in the daytime—the prisoner was sitting on her door-step at 12 o'clock and the moment she saw us she got up—neither of us said a word—I heard Ellen Kelly examined before the Magistrate, but I still mean to say that we did not begin <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi>—the prisoner must have got the best of the first fight because she gave me a scratched face and a black eye—I did not make her nose bleed—she said in the daytime that she would do for me or my sister before the day was out, and she made her words true—I am a charwoman in regular work—go out washing and cleaning every day, if I can do it, but on the Monday, me and my sister went to the Rye House, and on the Tuesday we did not feel inclined to go to work, nor on Wednesday, the day this hap<lb></lb>pened, either—I did not see my sister on the Thursday, as I was out from 7 o'clock a.m. till 12 at night, and when I came home she was in bed—she used to drink a drop of beer sometimes.</p>

I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—the deceased was brought there on the night of the 14th, suffering from a cut on the back of her head, an ordinary lacerated scalp—I did not pay particular attention to it at that time beyond ordering a bandage—it was three inches long and did not extend down to the bone—a wound caused by the skull coming in contact with the stone would not necessarily be contused—I gave her a letter which admitted her as an out-patient—I do not know whether she attended on the 16th and 17th, but on the 18th she became an in-patient—erysipelas had then set in—I attended her in the hospital, and she died on the 21st—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> exam<lb></lb>ination; the viscera were perfectly healthy—the wound in the scalp was in a straight line obliquely from the centre of the upper part of the head downwards towards the right—there was a very small wound over the eye<lb></lb>brow which was so slight that it had almost healed at the time I made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was erysipelas supervening on the wound; it was certainly caused by the wound—that is <hi rend="italic">the</hi> danger of a wound on the head—I should say certainly that the wound was caused by</p>

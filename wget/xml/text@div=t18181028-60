In consequence of a discovery which was made, I told the prisoner that property was missing-he was taken to the watch-house. I saw him next day there, and he begged for mercy; I said I could say nothing to it, as I was afraid the robbery had been carried on to a great length. He said he should never have done it if he had not been persuaded by another person, whose name he said was Horn. We got a warrant, searched Horn's house, and found the property stated in the indictment, there.</p>

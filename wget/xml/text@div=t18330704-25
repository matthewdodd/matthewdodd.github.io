            . I am in the service of Mr. Gideon, a pawnbroker at Lisson-grove. I have a plough, twenty-four bits, two saws, and some other tools, which were pawned, I think, by the prisoner; these duplicates found on the prisoner were given for them.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SCOTT. These are my property, they are worth more than stated at in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I can prove that part of the property belonged to a brother of mine, and was lent to me to work for the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>MR. SCOTT. It is all mine, except one saw; I had seen it secure at seven o'clock, when I went out; I went to my chest, and my clothes and tools were all safe - I have known the prisoner from a child, and have entrusted him to get in monies; I believe he always acted honestly.</p>

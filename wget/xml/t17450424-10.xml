The prisoner was there (I was not so much gone, but I knew very well what I did) I not being used to be out so late, and not used to drinking, fell asleep; and my hat dropped off: I waked between four and five in the morning, and missing my ring, I charged

               <p>Bowen. I said I was robbed of my ring; she said, there is no body here that will hurt you; she told me my hat sell off my head, and she had taken it up, and put it into the closet; I said, I believe you have my ring; she said, she knew nothing of it. There was a drummer there, (not in soldiers clothes, but in a drummer's habit) and he said, he believed no body there would take away my ring. Finding I was in a bad house, I was not willing to make a noise, but went away; I went into the Butcher Row by Temple Bar, and staid till between eight and nine, then I went to the cellar again , there was one

I cannot but say the prisoner was very impertinent in her way; I will say nothing but what is true, did not I offer you what was very fair, did not I offer to give you a crown? I said, if the ring was pawned, I would give her a crown, besides what the ring is pawned for, and she d - n'd her poor eyes, and said she knew nothing of the ring.</p>

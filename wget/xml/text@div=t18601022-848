                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know of his making a claim upon the Com<lb></lb>pany? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard him state that he has done so—I have heard him speak of a claim having been made as late as 6th August, and that the Company, on that occasion, denied their liability—I have heard him say so several times—it is my firm conviction that that was the only reason of his sending them as hardware.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think it was characteristic of an upright and honourable man to write "hardware" when it was not hardware? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think he was under a mistake; that he did not know he would render himself liable—he told me that he had some goods damaged by the railway, and, finding he could not obtain any recompense for it, he took the advice of some legal gentleman, who told him that the Act of Parliament entitled him to send goods under any denomination he liked, provided he took the risk on his own shoulders, and that is the reason, I believe, why Mr. Revell did so—I believe that he acted under a mistake of law—I should know very well that they were not hardware—I believe Mr. Revell knew they would be charged lower as hardware.</p>

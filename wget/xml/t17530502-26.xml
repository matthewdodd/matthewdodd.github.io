She went to enquire after her, and brought word she had heard the prisoner was all new cloath'd, and had a great deal of money about her, and was at Lambeth. I went there to her aunt's, and could not see her; but coming away I saw the prisoner near her aunt's house with 40 or 50 after her. I took hold on her, she said, dear master don't send me to gaol, I know 'tis in your power. I asked what she had done with the money; she said, take me from this mob, and I'll tell you. I took her into an alehouse, where she gave me my purse with twenty guineas in it, and said, she had laid out the rest in cloaths, and own'd she took it. I took her before justice Clark, who committed her for farther examination. I went the next morning and brought her before justice Fielding, where she would not speak, so the justice said silence gives consent, so he committed her.</p>

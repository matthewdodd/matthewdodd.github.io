                  </hi>. I live in Maiden-court, Broad-wall, Lambeth. About half-past eight o'clock, on the 18th of March, I was in Barbican—I saw the shadow of some one close behind me—I turned, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—I told him he had my handkerchief—he said I was a liar, and dropped it—I took it up—he ran off—the policeman fetched him back—I had seen the handkerchief not a quarter of an hour before—the prisoner said he was going along, and three men who were walking by the side of him, drew it out, and dropped it—there was only a young man just before me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Albion Chambers, Moorgate—the prisoner entered my service as clerk in-January this year, and was em<lb></lb>ployed in the conveyance department—he believed—with very great propriety—we acted for the vendors in a sale of property at Hackney last August—I entrusted him with the management of it—the vendors were a corporation—we have a general authority to receive their purchase monies—the settlement was on 28th September—that is the date of the deed—the prisoner told me that the purchase had been completed—Mr.'Oldshaw is solicitor for the purchasers—I cannot say whether his clerk attended—I produce a copy of the. assignment, it contains in the fold particulars of the amount received—it is in the prisoner's writing—it is our usual practice to enter all the particulars of sums received in the fold of the draft—that is the apportionment of the income and outgoings up to the day of completion according to the. conditions—it should be paid to my cashier—on 12th October I received in Ireland a telegram in consequence of which I returned home on the Friday night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The 2nd October would no doubt as appears from the memorandum be the day of actual completion—the deed no doubt would have been executed in anticipation, of an earlier completion—when he told me of the complesion of the purchase I understood by</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187611200060"></xptr>
               <p>that that the money had been received—I left town before 12th October—the prisoner was—engaged also about this time in other matters—Mr. Bridgman will be better able to give particulars—no charge is made with regard to the deeds—they have not been tampered with—we are vendors, therefore they would be handed over—there is no charge with respect to the deeds found at his house—I remember bis telling me that the client who had to receive the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. purchase money in the matter of Godson's sale of Wiltshaw and his mortgagee, had given us some authorities to pay creditors out of the purchase-money, and that he had given certain undertakings to do so—I expressed my disappointment of our giving any such undertakings—as a general rule all monies received by any one in our offices are paid over to the cashier, but it often happens that we receive odd sums, not for ourselves, as on the completion of a purchase or mortgage deed, when large sums for a moment pass through our hands and go into the hands of the mortgagor or vendor—in such case it would not pass through the books at all—in that case, as in the case of this company, the costs would be deducted in the first instance—the prisoner was then I believe a total abstainer—he promised me when he entered my service that he would be, and I believe he was for a long time—he may have had to devote extra time to business during the absence of another clerk on his holidays—I have seen him there myself—I left early—before I went for my holidays something led me to suspect he was not keeping his pledge—when in Ireland I learned that he was not at the office and I returned at once—I telegraphed to his father that his son had disappeared—he telegraphed in reply that his son was in Liverpool, and that he (the father) would come up immediately and see me—he came that night—that was after the warrant Teas out—when I saw the prisoner he said evidently I did not know all the facts and wished me at once to send to his house and I should find my property there—he might have—meant the money, but I did not understand it—I wrote this letter to Mr. Howard,—the solicitor in this matter. <hi rend="italic">This expressed a hope that the prisoner had not added to intemperance the greater crime of dishonesty, and stated that he wished to put the best construction on his conduct</hi>. This was Mr. Howard's reply. <hi rend="italic">This was dated 28th October and stated that he had had an interview with Mr. Bowman, who gave a more favourable explanation of the matter; thai after, completing the Holder<lb></lb>ness purchase the prisoner had another to settle at Bolton, and having missed the train and Mr. Learoyd being away in Ireland, he went to Newmarket and was robbed of some money and his watch and chain and was detained in trying to recover them</hi>. I am still desirous of putting before the Court the best view that I can on his conduct—I think it was greatly attributable to his intemperance and to his <hi rend="italic">going to</hi> Newmarket—the money found is in possession of the police.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). On 16th October I went to Liverpool and found the prisoner in custody at the Bridewell—I told him I was an officer from London and held a warrant for his arrest, and charged him with embezzling nearly 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said he would have to return with me to London—he said "Yes, I went to Newmarket, I got drunk and was robbed of five fifties, one twenty, one ten, and one five pound Bank of England notes, and one ten pound National Bank note," and that he had given information the police there of the robbery, and after doing so had returned to his hotel, went to sleep and was robbed of his watch and chain—I said "There is a deed found at your house, is that Mr. Learoyd's?"—he said "Yes"—I brought him to London.</p>

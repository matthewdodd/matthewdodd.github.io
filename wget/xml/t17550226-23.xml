            ; on Sunday the 23d day of this month I went to open my drawers, and, to my great surprise, missed all the goods mentioned in the indictment; I suspected my servant at the bar, I had given her leave to go out that day; when she came home I asked her what she had done with my goods, mentioning some of them; she fell on her knees, and said she knew nothing of any of them, but my gown and quilted coat; she begged forgiveness, and said she would get up in the morning and pawn all the things she had, and would get a friend to lend her some money to get my things again, so I let her lie there that night; she came into my room about seven o'clock in the morning, and said she'd go out, and be back again as soon as possible; I finding that she did not come at 10 o'clock, went to her husband in Barbican, by which means I found her. I took her before the justice, she confessed she had taken them away, and sent them to be pawned by

            . Last Monday about nine or ten o'clock the prosecutrix came to my shop in Hounsditch, and said she had been robbed by her servant; we went into Barbican to the prisoner's husband, and told him his wife had robbed the prosecutrix; he said he would go along with us to a pawnbroker's where she used; he went to Mr. Armsted's in Redcross-street, there we found five napkins, a neckcloth and a pillowbear. We met with a person who told us she was set out for Shrewsbury; I went to the book-keeper, and was informed by him that one of the name was in the waggon, I got a house and followed her, and before I came to Upper-holloway overtook the waggon, and took her out, and told her she had robbed Mrs. Coleman; I sent for a constable, and brought her back to London. She confessed to me she had robbed Mrs. Coleman of two petticoats, a silk gown and a shirt.</p>

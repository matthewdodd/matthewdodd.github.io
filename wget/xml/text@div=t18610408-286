I am a solicitor, carrying on business at 19, Coleman-street, City—I know the defendant—he called at my office about the middle of January last in reference to an action that had been brought against him by my firm—on that occasion he told me he had established in London a horse register which promised to be very successful, and from that he hoped to have money to pay the debt for which we had sued him—he said he would send me some of the registers to look at—he then left—he sent me three copies of his registers—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he called on me again a few days after that—these registers were lying on my table by my side—I told him that I had received them, and it happened that a friend of mine had just come to town who was in immediate want of a pair of carriage horses—he asked me to give him the particulars of the kind of horses that he wanted, which I did—he made a note of it in a memorandum book, and said he thought he might be able to assist me—I don't think he said anything further at that time—I received a letter from him a day or two afterwards, dated 22d January—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I forwarded that letter to Mr. Hackblock.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 34, York-place, Portman-square, at present; I reside near Reigate—I received this letter, dated 22d January, from Mr. Cox—I did not receive it till the Thursday night—the appointment was made for Wednesday—that was too late for me to see the horses—I read the letter, and sent to make another appointment—I afterwards got an order to see the horses—the letter came by post—I went with that letter on the 28th, to Knightsbridge, to the Swan-yard—I had the piece of paper with me, which I showed at the stables, and I was shown a pair of carriage horses—I thought at the time that the man who showed me the horses was Smith, the proprietor, but it turned out afterwards to be the witness Smart—I thought they were horses that would suit me—when I left Knightsbridge I went to 22, Parliament-street, the address on the letter, to see the prisoner—he was not there—his clerk gave me, on the back of an envelope, his address at Warrington stables, Edge ware-road—I went there and saw the prisoner—that was the first time I had seen him—I inquired for him—he told me his name was Hunt—I said I had been to see a pair of horses at Knightsbridge—he immediately said, "Oh! Mr. Hackblock, I suppose?"—he asked me what I thought of the horses—I said I thought them likely to suit me, but I asked him if he could not get them for something less than 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he said not a shilling; he had done his utmost, and he could not get them for anything less, and he then said, "By heavens! if they were my horses, I would not take 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them"—I rather hesitated, and he praised them very much, and spoke about his mode of doing business—he said he was entirely in the commission way, that he never bought or sold horses on his own account, and he said that he had bought and sold horses to the value of 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within the last month—I then said if he could not get them under 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I would give it, provided they would pass Mr. Field's examination satisfactorily—he then pressed me very much to forego the examination, and to take Smith's warranty—he called him the proprietor—I said I did not know what Smith's warranty might be worth; he was a stranger to me, and I should prefer Field's examination—he said, "Oh, he is a man of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if you take his warranty you will be able to return them if any thing turns out wrong, but if you take Field's examination it must be final"—I then said I would consider it, and let him know in the morning—that evening I took the advice of Mr. Cox, my friend, and he advised me to have Mr. Field's examination, and I wrote a note, which I sent the next morning—my coachman had the order to see the horses—I can't say whether I saw it or not—this is the note I sent to the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is dated 29th January—I sent it on the morning of the 29th by post, I believe, and in consequence of that note the horses were sent to Mr. Field—I did not put it in the post—I saw it produced before the magistrate by the prisoner's counsel—I had no copy of it—I got a certificate from Mr. Field—on the afternoon of the 29th the prisoner called at my house in York-place to know the result—I had at that time received the certificate—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner read it partly through, and said, "Oh, that is sufficient for me l"—(<hi rend="italic">This was a certificate signed William Field, stating that he had examined two bay geldings, and was not aware of any unsoundness about them</hi>)—when the prisoner read the first part of it which said there was no unsoundness, he said, "That is sufficient; of course you will take them"—I said, "Well, I think I will," and I gave him the money—something was said about a mare—I asked him whether Smith would feel disposed to take a mare I had, what he would give me for it, whether he would take the mare for the 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a</p>

               <p>100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he could not tell—he went with me and saw the mare, and he then went off to Smith's, at Knightsbridge—he came back and said Smith would take the mare at 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I would give 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the mare for the horses—I refused—I said I considered the mare worth a great deal more money, and I would sooner give him the 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and keep the mare—I then paid him the money—I gave him 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes—this is the receipt that he gave me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he wrote it in my presence—I gave him a pen to write it with—I gave him 142<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">receipt read</hi>)"Received from John Hackblock Esq., 34, York-place, the sum of 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. commission on a pair of carriage horses, passed by Mr. Field, V.S.—V.

Hunt"—I gave an additional 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the groom—I paid him a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, two 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and two sovereigns—they were Bank of England notes; I have the numbers—I got the notes from the City Bank, from a clerk named Allen—when the prisoner gave me this receipt, he said, "Don't send your coachman for the horses for half-an-hour, for I must first go and pay for them"—he went away and I sent in about half or three-quarters of an hour—I sent the written order he had given me for the horses—he left me a written order for them—I sent for them and got them—after I had had these horses some time, on 8th February, an accident happened, and in consequence of that, I wrote a letter on 9th February—I have no doubt this is the letter—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "Mr. Hackblock begs to inform Captain Hunt, that he is under the necessity of returning the carriage horses, in consequence of one of them not being quiet in harness.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">If a person induces another by a fraudulent statement to entrust him with property to carry to a third person, he is not the less a bailee, because he may be punishable for that fraud; he cannot take advantage of his own fraud, as in the case of a fraudulent contract, the contract is good as against the party himself. The defendant receives the</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">expressly to carry to Mr. Smith for the horses, and instead of doing that he pays his rent with it; surely that is a bailment within the meaning of</hi> 7 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 8 <hi rend="italic">George IV.</hi>

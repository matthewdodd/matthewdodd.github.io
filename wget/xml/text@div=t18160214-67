            , esq. I reside at Knightsbridge, opposite to the officers quarters. When I was getting up in the morning, of the 12th of January, I saw something lying in my garden, apparently as if it had been thrown over the wall. It was this portmanteau; it was locked, but the end was cut, and wrenched open, so as to admit a persons hand into it. I told my people to try to get something out of it, if there were anything; and a taylor's bill and receipt to a Lieutenant Judd were got out of it. I delivered it to an officer immediately after breakfast.</p>

I returned to town again on Sunday morning. I went to Bow-street on the Monday, but could get no tidings of my things; but on my going on the Wednesday, I saw some of my things, and this portmanteau.</p>

I remember giving that portmanteau to the coachman, and he strapped it to the back part of the roof of the coach, with other luggage, and a large leather was over them all, to keep the weather from them. I gave the coachman his weigh bill at half past five precisely.</p>

            . I am the driver of the hackney coach 189. On the morning of the 12th, I was at a stand by Berkeley-square, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, and I was hailed by another coachman. The prisoner at the bar was in his coach. He had two great bundles with him. He ordered me to drive to No. 40, Chancery-lane. When we got to the top of the Hay-market, he asked me if I would have any thing to drink. He sat in the coach, and a quartern of rum was brought. He sat in the coach and gave me a token like an eighteen-penny token, but it was not one. I offered it to the landlord and he would not take it. The prisoner then looked over his silver, and said he had no others. He then gave me the two halves of a ten pound note. The note was left with the landlord, and he let the prisoner have a poundsworth of siver upon it. Then I drove to the end of Chancery-lane, where he told me stop. He took out the bundles and went up the lane, and told me to stop until he returned to take him back; but the officer Wainright afterwards came to me, and told me to go about my business.</p>

He went out immediately, and I looked at him as he went out. I thought he was not a sailor, and examined the bundles. I sent a young man for a officer, and gave an account of what I observed. I saw the prisoner again, brought in by Wainwright, the officer, in half an hour.</p>

            . I am a patrole of Bow-street. I went to the Hole in the Wall, and in consequence of something I saw there. I apprechended the prisoner; he was a few yards from the door; I found four Jersey tokens in the prisoner's pocket; one small Irish ten-penny piece, half a guinea, and a seven shilling piece; I took two ten-pound notes and the ring from one of the bundles; the general contents of the bundles were, the coat Captain Judd has now on, handkerchiefs, stockings, boots, and windsor soap. As I was taking the prisoner to the watchhouse, he told me he had changed a ten-pound note some where in Piccadilly; but he did not remember the house; in consequence of that, I got the ten-pound note from Bathe.</p>

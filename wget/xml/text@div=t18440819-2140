                  </hi>. I live in White Horse-street, Stepney. On the after<lb></lb>noon of the 9th of Aug., I saw the prisoner leading the prosecutor, who was rather intoxicated, down White Horse-street—the prisoner beckoned to a female as he came up to our door—I followed them till I met a policeman—the prisoner asked the gentleman to go up Bear-street—he said it was not the way home—the prisoner said he would take him round the other way—they went a little further, and the prisoner leaned upon his breast, against the wall in Butcher-row, and he took a pin from his breast—I had noticed the pin before—they both fell down—the prisoner was rather intoxicated—they went up Bear-street—I followed them, and they went down a kind of court or alley—I went and asked the gentleman to come out of the place—the prisoner said he would fetch a policeman, and give the gentleman in charge for half-a-crown, for bringing him from Blackwall-stairs—I begged of him to fetch one—he went and fetched one—we came down the Com<lb></lb>mercial road, down to Arbour-square—the gentleman, the prisoner, and I went to the station of our own accord, without a policeman—in going to the station the prisoner tapped me on the shoulder, and said to mind that he was halves—I saw the policeman, and gave the prisoner in charge—I saw some gloves and some silver taken from the prisoner.</p>

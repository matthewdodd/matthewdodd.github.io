                  </hi>. I live in New-court, Goswell-street. The pri<lb></lb>soner gave me three silver spoons to pawn on the 9th of Aug.—I went to pawn them, and was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at Garraway's Coffee-houte, in the service of Mr. John Funge and another. These spoons are their property—they were kept in the coffee-room—I have known the prisoner twenty years to be a respectable woman—she was in the habit of coming back-wards and forwards to our coffee-house—these spoons were missed, and I went to her—she said she found them in the cellar at Mr. Warner's, very dirty, and took them away to clean them, and that Richardson took them to pawn.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 240.) I took Richardson and then the prisoner—I got these spoons from the pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was working at Mr. Warner's, and picked up these spoons in the cellar; they must have been there a long while as they were quite black; I put them into my pocket to clean them; I certainly was wrong not to take them back as soon as I found whose they were, but forgot; Richardson worked with my husband, and on the 9th of July, she took the spoons unknown to me or my husband when I was gone to work; I did not know that they were silver, but she said they were; she told the policeman that I met her in the street, and gave them to her, which was not true.</p>

That there was a few Words of Anger pass'd between the Prisoner and the Deceased, and the Name of Blockhead was call'd. That while he was gone down Stairs, to draw some Drink, he heard a Pistol go off, which when he came up, he found had been discharged against the Back of the Chimney. That upon the doing of this, the Deceased did tax the Prisoner with being a Highwayman, or Robber; but that the Prisoner did desire the Deceased to be easy as to the offence, said that he carried it, being in Danger of being robb'd; and then discharg'd it that it might do no Mischief; gave him a Pot of Drink, and some Cyder, and that they drank together some Time after, and he thought they had been good Friends; and that the Prisoner did tell the Deceased if he would send for a Constable, he would give a good Account of himself. That they went out about five a-Clock in the Morning, and immediately went to parrying with their Canes; and the Prisoner was thrown down, and his Hat was thrown into his House, and his Cane was fallen out of his Hand.

               <p>Q. Was that shop robbed at any time - A. Yes on Sunday, the 23rd of January; I left the house between seven and eight o'clock, leaving the door upon the spring lock; it was dark at that time of the year; I shut the door after me, and pushed the door to see it was fast. After I shut it, I left no one in the house. I returned to my house about half past ten; when I came back, I found my door nearly closed, but not locked, so that I could push it open; I went in; I found eleven pair of boots missing, and seven odd ones; they were all new boots, and were in the shop when I left it that morning, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any violence done to your house - A. No, except the door was open: there was no other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300013"></xptr>violence then that. My partner was out. I was the last that went out; there was nobody there but myself when I left. There is nobody lives in the house but me and my partner; there is no family. On the Monday morning we gave information at the police office, Marlborough-street, and Foy afterwards discovered some of the boots.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see any part of your property that you missed - A. It might be three weeks afterwards. They were brought to the police office. That is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner Bird - A. No, he was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOY. I am an officer. In consequence of the information that Mr. Arnold gave at our office, on the 14th of February last, I took in custody a person of the name of Clarke, who had offered some boots to sell, which afterwards turned out to be Mr. Arnold's; he was committed for re-examination; in consequence of his being apprehended, I took Joseph into custody.</p>

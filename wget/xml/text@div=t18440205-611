                  </hi>. I am in the employ of John Gregory, a carcass butcher, who has a stall in Leadenhall-market. I had a sheep safe there about half-past five o'clock on Tuesday the 24th Jan.—I missed it when Childs came to me—I found it at the station—it was my master's—I had killed and dressed it—the head was off.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to swear that you did not hand it over to Spencer yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was in the cellar kill<lb></lb>ing when Childs fetched me out—I missed one sheep from a hook on the rail where I had hung it about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon—they hung there for sale—there was no one there to sell them—if any one comes I am called out of the cellar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Spencer. Q.</hi> You killed nine sheep, are you sure your master did not sell that one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were three sold out of the nine—I will swear that I killed that sheep—it had a particular mark on it, by a score on the side, which is different by two or three cuts from those my master sold—I know he did not sell this—I marked it in a particular way and gave it two more cuts at the side—I had no motive for doing so.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) About half-past five o'clock, on the morning of the 24th, I was coming through Leadenhall market and met the two prisoners—they went into the market—they had no sheep then—I went down Church-row into Crutched-friars, and there I saw Spencer walking quickly with a sheep on his back, in a direction from the market—when they got forty or fifty yards Spencer gave it to Anderson and he gave Spencer his hat to carry—they went through Tower-hill to Thames-street, and there I took them—Anderson had the sheep on his back—I asked where he got it—he said he brought it from Leadenhall market—I said, "Where from?"—he said, "I don't know, that is my master,"pointing to Spencer, who was near enough to hear what was said, but he said nothing—I went and asked Spencer what he was doing with the sheep—he said he had brought it from Whitechapel—I took them both, and in going to the station Anderson told me he brought it from Mr. Gregory's—at the station I said, "Will you take me to where you brought it from?"—he said, "Yes"—he took me to the market and showed me the hook, and said he took it off the hook and gave it to Spencer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How was it you did not say a word about that before the Alderman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—it was not read over to me—Anderson did not tell me that Spencer desired him to take it off the hook—he said he was very sorry, he hoped I should be as lenient as I could with him, but he took it off the hook and gave it to Spencer—I do not expect anything if these persons are convicted—this is my handwriting to this deposition—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, did not state the conversation deposed to.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">Q</hi>. Did you desire what you have stated should be added? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not think it was necessary—I have been a witness some hundreds of times—upon my oath, I mentioned this before the Magistrate—the clerk never took down that part.</p>

                  </hi>. I searched the prisoner's premises last Monday fortnight, and found a window-blind, some account-books, a gallipot, harp-strings, table-cover, a wooden board, some wrappers, pieces of veneer, and solid wood—I can speak to some from their general resemblance, and I can positively swear to the account-books—I had lost one blind from Judd-street, and one out of my cellar in Cloak-lane—I believe the blind produced is mine, and the wood at the bottom of it is the wood that was on the blind in my cellar, but the canvas belongs to the one stolen from Judd-street—to have done that he must have taken both—I missed a box, containing 120 or 140 harp-strings—the prisoner had access to it—I asked him if he had seen it—he said no—some time after I inquired about it, and he said he should not wonder if we lost all the things in the house, if we kept that girl Elizabeth in the house—I spoke to the girl; her boxes were searched, but nothing found—a week or two after we lost two or three napkins from up stairs, and discharged her—this table-cover was in my care, and was lost from a sale at Tottenham-court-road—I had an allowance to make for it—the prisoner told me he was sorry to say he had taken it from there—here are a quantity of pieces of mahogany and veneer—this is a parcel of mazephyr, or unrated wood—it was not in the tariff, and escaped the duty at the docks—I am not aware of any parcel of this wood imported into this country, except what I had—I never sold any of it, only as manufactured—I missed veneers from time to time—I have upwards of a hundred pieces of this wood, some of it very small—I have every reason to believe all these articles are mine—the account-books were warehoused with me by Parrington and Co.—they were in a large cupboard, which he had ac<lb></lb>cess</p>

               <p>to at times—I found some of the veneers and mahogany in a box under the prisoner's counter—he has a small shop in Dog-row, Bethnal-green—I know some of this wood as well as I should know the features of a person—here is a box made out of them, a zephyr wood—it has only been polished with wax—this is the wood I first missed, and discharged a man for—it is valuble, and is called snake wood—I lost eleven veneers of it, and it was said my foreman had stolen it.</p>

Q.</hi> What articles do you positively swear to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> These three account-books—I have another, which I can swear to the writing on, but have no memorandum of the number of it, being in my possession at the time—I have sold about two cwt. of books, by private contract, to one Joel, but neither of these four, I am certain—the last sale to him was about two years ago—these ledgers are never parted with—I had a man named Bruce in my employ—I swear the veneers on this box are mine, but not the inside nor the banding—I swear to the sides, and believe the two ends are mine—here are a number of pieces of wood I can swear to—I missed veneers of snake, and think I may venture to swear to these—the bark is the same width as a piece I have brought—the top of the box is mazephy, but it is in three pieces fitted in—it is uncommon wood—the prisoner did not say the table cover was the refuse of a sale—he might—I allowed 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—the sun<lb></lb>blind is worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I missed part of the blind the day the prisoner left—I discharged him for that, but did not tell him why, I only said he had been doing what was very wrong—I found it in the passage of his house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter. The prisoner was apprenticed to me, and worked for me afterwards—he left me thirteen months last April—while with me he had two pieces of wood similar to the two long sides of this box—it was pieces of wood my son bought in London—he brought a great lot home—he is now in America, and I gave the prisoner what was left, as I should not use it—if I must say, I believe this to be the same; it is much like it—he made it into a little work-box like this—it is more than two years ago, and I should think this box has been made that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been employed by the prosecutor—I was there at the same time as the prisoner, off and on, and attended sales which Mr. Nor<lb></lb>man had—after every lot is cleared we sweep up the premises, and if there is a bit of wood or old phial we reckon it our perquisite, and master never said a word against it—I saw a sun-blind at the sale in Judd-street—the prisoner had that—he had worked at the sale as head porter—he asked if I would take the blind home for him—he made no secret of it—I remember a quan<lb></lb>tity of books being sold to Joel eight or nine months ago—I heard the prisoner</p>

               <p>tell Joel he should like to have a book or two, and Joel handed over to him four or five books of this description as near as possible—this is one of them; I know by the writing inside, belonging to Mr. Parrington, it is the very book that Joel gave the prisoner—I do not think there was a dozen with this sort of cover—I have not the least doubt in the world of it—as to the others, there was a green covered book, and one or two white-covered—they were similar to these—I firmly believe they are the same—I have heard Mr. Norman say, in reference to sales, if there was any pieces of wood, old iron, rags, bones, &amp;c., the men might sell it, and get a pot or two of beer; if it would raise a drop of beer we might have it—it is what is called the clearance—we had a sale at a large linen-draper's in Tottenham-court-road—Mr. Norman gave a man named Lillycrop, who is now dead, leave to take about two cwt. of rags—I firmly believe it was done with Mr. Norman's leave—I did not hear him give leave.</p>

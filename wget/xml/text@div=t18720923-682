About 5.30 on the morning of 27th August I was on duty in Coleman Street—I saw Moseley in White Horse Yard, carrying two bundles of wood—I followed him into Fore Street—I stopped him and asked him where he had brought the wood from—he said "Out of that yard you saw me come out of"—I said "How did you get it from there, then?"—he said "The watchman gave it to me"—I said "Where are you going to take it to?"—he said "Into Whitecross Street"—I asked him where he lived, he said he lived up somewhere near Euston Road—I said "This won't satisfy me, you will have to go back with me and see the watchman"—I went back there, and as I was going to ring the bell for the watchman he appeared at the door—I said "This man," pointing to Moseley, "says that you gave him these two bundles of wood, is that so?"—Storey said "Yes, "and picked up one of the bundles—I said "Are you sure you gave him this wood?" and he said "Yes"—I said "There is a paper parcel in between these staves, what does that contain?"—he said "It is paper, but it is waste"—I said "Did you give him that?"—he said "Yes"—I undid the bundle of wood and took out this parcel—I undid the parcel and found it was clean white paper—I said "This is not waste"—he said "Oh, I burn plenty of this in the furnace"—I said to Moseley "I shall have to make some inquiries in reference to this paper, you will have to go to the station with me"—Storey said "Take no notice of it; I have been a policeman, "which he has—ho made his way to the door up the steps—I heard someone else coming down the yard, which I believed to be a constable—I followed Storey up the steps—he got inside of the door first, pushed the door on me, and tried to keep me out of the warehouse—I forced the door, and he ran to another door leading into the warehouse—I caught hold of him, and brought him forcibly back to the outer door—I told him that I should take him to the station likewise—at that time my inspector appeared and told him to go quietly—there were 137 of these sheets—Moseley told me in Fore Street that he had slept in the premises all night—I told Storey that, and he said "Yes, I let him sleep here because it rained"—I came out myself at 10.30, and there was no rain the whole of the time I was out—I was out till the morning—the door where Storey appeared was the door of Messrs. Burbidge's premises—Storey gave me his address, 8, Little Coram Street—I was not able to find him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Inspector</hi>). On Monday morning 26th, I went to Coleman Street—I passed this yard and saw Moseley in the custody of a constable—I went up the yard and saw a bundle of wood lying by the side of Moseley, and I went further on and saw this bundle of paper on the steps leading to the warehouse door—I went to the warehouse and saw the officer with Storey—he seemed to be very much excited indeed, and said "What is all this about?" and Storey said "I can assure you Mr. Harding I knew prisoner very well that I gave the paper and the wood to Moseley. I allowed him to stop on the floor all night because it was a wet night, and it is only waste-paper that we burn in the furnace, and I can assure you we burn lots of it; it is no use to us at all"—I advised him to go quietly to the station, which he did—I said to Moseley "How came you in possession of the wood?"—he said "Oh, I brought the watchman his supper, and it being a wet night he asked me to sleep on the floor of the warehouse"—I said "It had not been a wet night"—I happened to be on duty all that night; there was a little rain in the evening—I did not say that to him, but I knew it was not a wet night; it had rained a little between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening.</p>

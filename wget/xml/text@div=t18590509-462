                  </hi>. I am a Post-office carrier, and live at Cowley, in Middlesex—in 1855 I became acquainted with the prisoner, who was living independent—he told me that his income was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—I lent him money occasionally, and continued friendly with him up to the present year—in, and previous to, September, 1856, I had an uncle living with me—he died at my house, and a bill was incurred of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Morton, an undertaker—I gave the prisoner 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in gold, to pay Mr. Morton's bill, and two or three days afterwards he returned me the bill receipted, saying that he had made use of the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change, and asking me to let it go to the other account—I had the bill in my possession about a month, brought it up to town, and left it with my aunt—long after that, in November last, I had a conversation with the prisoner about his past conduct, he said that if he got involved in difficulties again, he would never submit to what he had before—that he some time ago signed a document for his father-in-law, for which, if it had been found out, he should have been transported years ago; also, an act which he had done, which was unto the best friend that he ever had—in consequence of sus<lb></lb>picions from that conversation, I went to Mr. Morton, the undertaker.</p>

               <p>that, that I had him on the brink of a precipice, and if he did not mind I would throw him over; I never uttered such words—I did not say that I had a charge against him, and would be even with him, for I had no such intention in my head—I decidedly deny having said anything as to doing Brown an injury, or that I would get up a case against him—I went to the Magistrate on 22d March, the next day after calling on Mr. Morton—the case was heard before the Magistrate three times—I showed this bill to Mr. Morton—I received the bill back from my aunt on 19th March, and I went on the 21st—the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid to me in 1857, with other money which I had lent him—I had been in the habit of lending him money from week to week—I owed Mr. Morton a bill in 1848, which I did not pay till 1853—that was not my bill, though it was made out to me; not the whole of it—a por<lb></lb>tion of it was mine, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was my brother-in-law's, which I objected to pay—the conversation I had with the defendant, which created my sus<lb></lb>picions, was in his own house—no one was present; it was at night, and we were sitting up together—I have mentioned before that he said he had signed a document for his father-in-law, for which he might have been transported, had it been found out—I understood him his father-in-law—I do not think I mentioned it before the Magistrate—I have not said that he had done an act for his best friend which would render him liable to punish<lb></lb>ment—what he said was, that if he could get through the difficulty, he would never do the like again.</p>

On the next day (the 24th) I missed a piece of gold; I had left a parcel of gold (contrary to my usual course) on the mantle-piece in my dining-room; the parcel contained 10 oz. in different pieces, but this piece was the largest in the parcel; with great difficulty I found out the prisoner; I charged her with this fact; she confessed she had stole the piece of gold from off the mantle-piece, and that it was at a pawnbroker's in Clare-market, who had stopped it; she refused to go to the pawnbroker's, but fell upon her knees, and begged I would forgive her. I afterwards found the gold at the pawnbroker's according to her directions.</p>

               <p>Glover. Yes, for he had got a great stick under his right arm: he told me, if I stirred a step after him he would turn again and blow my brains out; then he ran away towards Stepney, and I went towards my own home. I never saw him after till yesterday morning in the cage at White-chapel, I am certain he is the man; then I went to Justice Pell, he sent for the prisoner, and I swore to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again?</p>

            . I met the prosecutor that Sunday morning a little after 9 o'clock, he was coming to Westham, I came from there, he seemed in a sort of a fright; I asked him how he did, he said he had just been robbed coming over the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had been robbed by one or two people?</p>
               <p>Oliver. He said by two men.</p>

               <p>Oliver. He said of his watch and 13 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain he said 13 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Oliver. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Were there two men that robbed you or one?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner robbed me first; there was another that followed him, but I should not know him if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to vary from 7 s. to 13 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The other man took the other money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at Mr. Mills's a public-house, the time this man says he was robbed.</p>
               <p>He called Mr. Mills, who deposed the prisoner used to come to his house almost every Sunday; he could not recollect that day from the rest, but he believed he was at his house that forenoon. And

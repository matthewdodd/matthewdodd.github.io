                  </hi>. I am a widow, living at Lower Tooting—on 8th August, last, I was in Adelaide-street, Strand, about 4 o'clock—two boys were by the side of me, and presently I felt some one at my pocket—I looked down, and said to the boy, "You have been and robbed my pocket of half a crown"—the half-crown lay on the ground; I went to pick it up, and the prisoner, who was one of them, struck me in the face, picked up the money, and ran away—he struck me very severely; I had a very black eye since last Friday week, and feel the bad effects of it now—I came to myself a little, and then went to the corner—Mrs. Harding, my sister-in-law, was with me.</p>

I am a widow, and live at Bury St. Edmund's—I was with the last witness, and the three lads were just in front of us—I saw the smallest of the three pick her pocket, and throw the half-crown down close to me; the prisoner picked it up, and struck her in the face—I heard her say, "Why, you have picked my pocket"—that was said to the lad who had done it; not to the prisoner—when it fell, she said, "That is my money"—the prisoner then struck her, and they all three ran away—the prosecutrix would have fallen down, had it not been for a man in his shirt sleeves.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, and live at 9, Jermyn-street—on 8th August, about 4 o'clock, I was in Chandos-street—I heard an outcry—I turned round, and saw that something had happened, and the prisoner ran past with two others—they were talking to each other as they passed; I pursued them—there were others following and crying out, "Stop thief"—the principal one amongst those who were following was a man in his shirt stores—the three turned up Bedfordbury, and I turned up with them—the prisoner turned up a court that leads into Bedford-street—I followed him, and he crossed the road, and got among the baskets and the people in Covent-garden; and the next time I saw him was when he was in the custody of the beadle of the market.</p>

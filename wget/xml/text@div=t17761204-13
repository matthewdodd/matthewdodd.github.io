Latham I had often observed at my shop-window, looking under it in an evening; I have taken notice of it to the women who were working in the shop, and when I have gone out of the shop-door, Latham always walked away; I often saw Kelly with Latham; I saw Latham that particular night, but did not see Kelly. Upon the 6th of November they were apprehended; as soon as I challenged some of the things as belonging to me, Latham came up to me, and desired me to be very careful what I swore to, as it might affect his life; I recollected his face instantly, and swore to his being the person I had so often seen about my shop; and said, at the same time, I believed Kelly was the other: upon searching the lodgings the next day, I am not precise as to whose lodgings they were, I understood they lived together, other trinkets and things were found, and particularly, a lock of a little boy's hair I had the misfortune to lose a few days before.</p>

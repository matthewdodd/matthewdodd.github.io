            . I am a constable of Eaton. On the 14th of June, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Eaton market, offering a bay gelding for sale, with a person named White and another; they communicated with him by signs - he did not appear to make a bargain with them; I apprehended him - when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050033"></xptr>first saw him - he was leading the horse; I afterwards showed the horse to Drake, it had no saddle on.</p>

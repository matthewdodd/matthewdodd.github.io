On the morning of 12th June I saw the prisoner and another man engaged in a scuffle near the Music Hall—I saw Mays come up—he tried to persuade the prisoner to go away, and I told the other man to go away—the man with the barrels went away, and the prisoner would not go—he used bad language and Mays took him in custody, they went down, and then he said he would walk quietly—I took hold of his left hand and Mays his right, and he walked about twenty or thirty yards—he made a bit of a scuffle, and I saw him lift his right arm and make a deliberate chop at Mays with the knife—I let go his left arm, and seized his right, and tried to take the knife away from him—I threw him on the ground, and we were struggling for the possession of the knife, and I got cut and kicked on my knee and forehead—another witness came up and took the knife out of his hand—I assisted to take him to the station—a gentleman brought a strap, we strapped his legs, and carried him to the station on a stretcher.</p>

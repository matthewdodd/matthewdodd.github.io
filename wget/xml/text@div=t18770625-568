               <p>Blackheath—in June, 1876, the prisoner asked me to discount a bill for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I did, and have never received any proceeds—I gave him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the bill, which became due in August, 1876, and on August 23rd I received this letter, stating the prisoner was unabled to meet the bill and asking for its renewal, and an appointment—I afterwards saw him, when he said he would give me a better bill for 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on a man in Sheffield, and I took it to take the place of the first, intending to pay him the differ<lb></lb>ence—it came due on 29th November, and was not paid—I had received another letter on September 13th. (<hi rend="italic">This letter promised a settlement in about a week.</hi>) I afterwards had an interview with the prisoner, who handed me this bill for 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I also found to be worthless, and I instructed my solicitor to issue a writ on the bill for 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

On Friday night, the 2d of March, a little after 8 o'clock, I was sitting in my shop, which is part of the dwelling-house - the shutters were not closed; there were several shoes in the window, against the glass - I heard the glass fall; I went out at the door, and looked round, not suspecting it to be my own window; I looked round, and found a pane of my own window was broken quite out - I believe it was slightly cracked before, but not broken. I saw several young boys standing close to the window, laughing, but the prisoner was not one of them. I saw an old shoe laying on the flap of the cellar, close to the window; it did not belong to me; it was taken away by somebody; I missed two pairs of new shoes from my window, I am certain, if not three - they were worth 4s. a pair; I have never found them. I am certain I missed two pairs; some pieces of glass laid outside the window, and some inside.</p>

            . I am nearly fifteen years old, and live at No. 4, Orange-court. I was in Church-street, near Mr. Robinson's house, on this Friday night, about five minutes to eight o'clock; the bell had not sounded for eight. I was going on an errand, and passed the shop; there was nobody about the shop then; I returned the same way, and heard the window break before I got up to the house, and seeing the glass fall on the pavement I stopped to look; I saw a boy at the window - I think it was the prisoner, but I did not see his face; I saw a pair of shoes pulled out of the window, and I think he is the person who pulled them out; there was a boy there a little bigger than him; directly it was done I saw the one whom I believe to be the prisoner, run away as hard as he could; I had seen him several times before, as I live in the court facing him; there was a light in Robinson's shop, and the gas-lamps in the street were lighted.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I know Donovan. At six o'clock on this night, as I was going to school, I met him - he stopped me, and, holding up his right foot, said, "How much would your father make me a pair of shoes for?" I told him I did not know - I knew him before - he lived in the neighbourhood. As I returned from school, a little after eight o'clock, I met him - he rushed by me very fast one door from my father's house; I did not observe any thing in his hand, but I am quite sure he had only one shoe on; I found my father's window broken, and an old shoe on the cellar flap; it was like the shoe he had shown me; it was the same shoe. I told my father I thought it was Jerry Donovan's - after that it was taken away - I do not know who by.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to John Hawkins, grocer, High-street, Whitechapel. The prisoner was his carman and porter four or five months—about eight o'clock on the morning of the 13th of Feb. Mr. Hawkins was attending the jury here, and I was in his warehouse in Half-moon-passage, Whitechapel—the prisoner was there—I desired him to take a chest down, weigh it, and take it to the shop—it was about half or three parts full of tea—I fancied he was longer than usual about it—I went into the lower floor where I desired him to take it, and found him leaning over the chest with the lid open—it had been fastened down with a peg when it was up stairs—he had no business to open it—there was a hasp to it, and it shut with a kind of spring—it would not open very easily unless the hasp was lifted with the hand—I told him he was a long time about it, and he took it round to the shop—I looked about where I found him leaning over the chest, and found the soda scoop, which had no business in the room—I examined it and found some particles of tea adhering to it—the scoop was generally kept in the soda cask, in the stable—I had been in that floor a few minutes before, and the scoop was not there—I found this bag of tea between two small tubs, close by where the chest stood, when he was leaning over it—he afterwards returned from the shop with the empty chest, and took it into the stable, passing by the place where I had found the tea—I had the tea in my hand at the time in the counting-house—he afterwards walked out of the warehouse, and I saw nothing more of him that day—he did not come back to his business, nor say</p>

               <p>a word to me before he went—he came again next morning—I have examined the tea in the bag, and in my opinion it is the same that had been in the chest—I cannot find any appearance of dirt, as if it had been on the ground and required cleaning and sifting—the warehouse floor has been swept—it was damp with molasses and runnings of sugar, and dirty saw-dust carried with the feet—there were one or two particles of the tea adhering to the floor, as if they had fallen from the scoop—there was no appearance of a chest having been upset—the tea that was in the bag was worth 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not go to the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—that is not in the same range of building as the warehouse—it is about three minutes' walk from the warehouse to the shop—there are three persons in the warehouse with the prisoner and myself, and there are persons in the shop besides—the tea was not all over the floor—there may be dirt in the tea, but it came in the chest originally—I can swear that dirt did not come from the floor—if a man should spill some he would take off what was at the top and carefully put it in a bag, and then take up the other and throw it away, but the floor must be cleaned after being swept up—it must have been swept to have gathered it up.</p>

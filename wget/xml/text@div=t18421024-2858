I was paid off—I received 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and had five sovereigns and three shillings left—the prisoner took me to lodge a boarding-house—I was a cripple at the time, and was forced to go an stairs—he carried the light up, and staid there while I undressed—my money was in the inside pocket of my jacket, which I laid on the foot of the bed—I heard him go out of the room—when I awoke in the next room, my jacket was not in the room where I slept—I went into the next room, and found my jacket hanging on the bedstead where another of the boardes slept—I took it down, and the purse and money were gone—I went to the public-house to look for the prisoner—I asked him about it—he swere by his Maker he did not take it—he told the landlady it was a pretty case if he was to bring a boarder to her place, and he was to be robbed—I gave him in charge—this is my purse—there were three sovereigns and four| half-crowns in it when it was taken from the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Little Hermitage street. The prosecuter lodged with me—the prisoner introduced him there—I was the first person that went into the room after the prisoner left—I found the jacket in the next room, and hung it on the bed-post—it had only a penny-piece in—the prisoner went out after he took the prosecutor to bed—he never came in again—he ought to have slept that night at our house—he came in in the morning, and had two purses, but no money—I said would he give me on—he said, "Yes, take your choice"—he put this purse into my hand—the prosecutor came down, and asked how he came to take his jacket—I said, "Is this yours?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I took it, and there was nothing in it but a penny-piece; if you have lost your money, the person that put you to bed must have it"—the prisoner came in and said, "Is this your purse?"—the prosecutor said, "It is very much like mine"—the prisoner said, "Will you swear to it?"—he said, "To the best of my knowledge, it is mine"—the prisoner then turned to me and said, "I don't like to bring a lodger to your house, and he be robbed"—I said, "If anybody did it, it must be you"—they went out together.</p>

Between eleven and twelve o'clock that evening the prisoner came to our house—when he was going he asked permission to leave a sum of money—he first put down four sovereigns on the counter, and dropped one on the floor—he left the five sovereigns there that night.</p>

On the 29th of September last we missed several pieces of linen and other things, amounting in value to 100 l. We took stock more minutely on the 5th of October, and found the goods still missing. On the 12th of October, I had some officers at the wharf, and determined to examine all the servants - the prisoner was the first that was called. Brand asked if he knew of any linen which had been taken - he said he did not, that he lodged at the corner of Knight Rider-court, on the first floor. We went to his lodging; he remained at the wharf - his wife was not at home, and we returned without searching. When we got back to the wharf, his wife came down almost directly, and we accompanied her back to the lodging, and on opening one of the drawers, Brand found forty or fifty duplicates, one of which led us to Mr. Chaffers's, of Queen-street; there were several remnants there of Mr. Maberly's sheeting, and one of diaper, which was a table cloth made up. There was only one article I could compare with what he had by us, that was a diaper table cloth. We had four pieces of that diaper in the warehouse, one of which had been cut on the 16th of May, 1820, six yards and a half, and sold to

            . A piece measures forty yards. On taking stock we missed eight yards from one piece, and thirteen and a half from another; it was a very particular pattern and width. Mr. Maberly had manufactured it at Aberdeen, and only four pieces of it had been made. I found a remnant of dark sheeting in his drawers, of which we have the counterpart in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you went to the lodgings did you leave word who you were, and from where you came - A. I believe not. Brand spoke, we returned, and his wife came within five minutes to speak to him, saying she I understood some gentleman had been to the house. I think she opened the drawer where the duplicates were. I do not know whether it was locked. We have five people in our warehouse. I believe his wife said the duplicates belonged to a friend, who was out of town. It is thirty-four inches wide, which is a particular width. He has lived above thirteen years with us.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Mr. Maberly. Brand brought a piece of linen sheeting to the warehouse. I compared it with a piece there, and it corresponded. We occasionally cut a piece for a friend. The piece was matched with what Brand had - it had never been cut by us. I did not know that it was cut before this; it had been in the warehouse more than a year. It was not cut strait, and the piece matched exactly. The whole piece should be eight yards and a half; Brand produced about four. The quality<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230024"></xptr>is the same - the edge corresponds. He brought it after the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see it for a week after he was apprehended - A. Less than that; I think it might be five days. I have brought the piece it was cut from. This piece was one hundred and twenty-six yards when it came from the manufactory. It makes eight and a half. I had not seen the remnant within a year before.</p>

            . I am a marshalsman. I went to the prisoner's lodging, and found his wife there. The second time I went I found the piece of sheeting in one of the drawers. I took it to the warehouse some days after, and produced it in the same state as when I found it. I found a duplicate, which led me to Mr. Chaffers's; I got a piece of diaper from there. I saw the sheeting compared with a piece in the warehouse - it formed part of the same in my judgment. I have both here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner was left in the counting-house while you went to his lodging - A. Yes. I only asked if anybody was at home. I was dressed in my common clothes. I found the duplicate and sheeting in the same drawer. It was not locked.</p>

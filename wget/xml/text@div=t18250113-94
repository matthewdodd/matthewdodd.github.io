On the 18th of November I changed a 50 l. cheque at Messrs. Curtis and Co.'s banking-house, and received four 10 l. notes, and ten sovereigns. I put the notes into a spectacle case, which I put at the bottom of my chest, under my clothes, in my bed-room, on the first floor. On the 27th of November I went to my chest, and on opening the spectacle-case I missed two of the notes - I have the other two here. The prisoner continued at work till the 4th of December, when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. On the day you lost your notes, did you not bring a small table to the alms-house gate; and were you not so intoxicated you could not carry it? A. I took a table there one day, but cannot say when - I was never in liquor in working hours.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Ockley, at the Cross Keys wine-vaults, Blackfriars-road. On the 27th of November, about six or seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and asked for change for a 10 l. note. I took it to Mr. Ockley, who came to him with it in his hand, and asked some questions, which I did not hear, and afterwards gave him in change. I am sure he is the man.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner, at the counting-house of his master, Mr. Ward, in Water-street, City; he denied all knowledge of the notes; I then asked if he had changed a 10 l. note on the Saturday previous, at the Cross-Keys; he said he had been there, but had not changed a note; I found a sovereign, and eight shillings on him, and asked, if he had any more money about him; he said he had not, but I found a 5 l. Banknote in his fob; he began saying something about a ring, but suddenly stopped, and said he would say no more; he gave me his address in John-street, Waterloo-bridge; I found that he did live there.</p>

             re-examined. I slept at the alms-houses, to take care of them, while they were building, but did not have my victuals there; I was foreman of the works, under the direction of Mr. Smith, the architect - I was not put there by the company - the building is now finished, and the chaplain lives in that house, and I lodge at a tavern; my living there made no difference in my wages - I had no family there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I certainly have acted very indiscreet; but solemnly deny the charge of robbery; the prosecutor is addicted to drink, which was the case when I assisted him with the table, about an hour before I found these notes - I seriously deplore having appropriated them to my necessities.</p>
               <p>The Court ruled, that this could not be legally called the dwelling-house of the prosecutor, he having been placed there for a special purpose only.</p>

               <p>St. Luke's—it is my dwelling-house—I know the prisoner. On Wednesday evening, 18th April, he came to my place about half-past seven or eight, and remained till nine—I went with him to a public-house, as he asked me for some drink—I parted with him about half-past nine, and went home—I went out again soon after, leaving my wife and daughters at home, and returned about eleven—I did not miss anything that night, but next morning I missed a piece of gold and a brooch from my work-board in the shop—I gave information to the police—about eleven that night the prisoner's father came to me with the brooch; I refused to take it—I afterwards went with Turpin to the father's house, and he got the brooch.</p>

                  </hi> I am twelve years old, and am the prosecutor's daughter.

The prisoner came to me and laid he understood that I wanted him—I told him I did—he asked me what for—I said concerning a brooch from St. Luke's—he said he had taken the brooch, but he did not know anything about the gold, or anything else—he said he had taken it in mistake for a stone, or something he had left there.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received an excellent character).

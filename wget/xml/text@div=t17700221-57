               <p>John Brown. I live in Fisher-court, Eagle-street; my boy, name Storer, had been out; he came home, and said he saw two lads about that he thought were going upon the budge. He and I went out to watch them: we saw the lads pass on towards this house that was broke; they not passing a window at a little distance, I knew they must be gone into some house. My lad and I went and stood opposite the door; we saw the prisoner come out first, then the other. I went to catch the prisoner, but could not. My boy called, Stop thief! In about forty yards, they dropped the things mentioned. A gentleman knocked the other down. I followed the prisoner, but they both got away. My boy, who had been a bad boy, knowing them, the prisoner was had before Sir

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Brown. I am going into seventeen years of age. I was out, and saw the prisoner and another lad looking about: I stopped; the prisoner came up to me and asked me, if I stood to hear music at the puppet show. I have known him three or four years. I went home and told my master, there were a couple of young men looking about that were bad men, and asked him to go and watch them: we saw them go into Mrs. Lawrence's house, and come out again: the prisoner came out first; then I called stop thief! they ran, and, finding they were pursued, they dropped the things; one sell, and my master ran after the other, but neither of them were taken. I and my master found the prisoner on the Tuesday after at Sir John Fielding's office, and we took him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the meaning of that word you made use of to your master, going on the budge?</p>
               <p>Storer. Going on the sneak, is to go into houses that are open to take things: going on the budge, is to burst the doors open. I was acquainted with the prisoner when I used to be in bad company. (The things produced and deposed to).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, living in Chapman Street, St. George's-in-the-East—somewhere about 12 o'clock on the night of the 10th May, I was in the neighbourhood of William Street and went into a urinal—my coat was buttoned up as I proceeded along Cannon Street Road—I had no sooner unbuttoned it than in came the prisoner and made a snatch—three other men came in—one hit me a fearful blow—the watch was handed by the prisoner to a taller man—I had not a guard chain on—they immediately left and went up William Street into Langdale Street—I followed them and arrived at the corner of James Street and Langdon Street—I called out for police—the policeman came up and I gave the prisoner into custody—a party said "This is one of them"—I have not the slightest doubt the prisoner is the man.</p>

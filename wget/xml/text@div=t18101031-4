             in search of her, we intended to go to the George inn in the Borough, and being strangers we went up to Shoreditch, I met the prisoner in Shoreditch, in the street, he was riding a black horse, and leading my mare; we followed him some distance, and then we saw him turn into Holywell-lane, I rode up to the side of him, and asked him whether that mare was for sale, he said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the same person - A. Yes. Then I accused him of stealing the mare; I said that mare is my property, he said he was very sorry for it, then he jumped off the horse he was riding and let my mare go, and ran away directly, leaving the horse and mare both loose in the street. I pursued him and cried stop thief, in running he fell down, and a person of the name of Wheeler laid hold of him; Mr. Wheeler asked me what was the matter, I said he had been stealing horses; the prisoner said he was no thief; I said if they brought him back to where the horse was I thought it was in my power to prove him a thief; Mr. Wheeler brought him back to where the horses were in the Curtain-road.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean that they were loose in the Curtain-road - A. Yes; then Mr. Wheeler told me if I had any thing to say to the man I must take him myself; I directly collared the prisoner, I took the prisoner to a public-house next to the office, there he was delivered over to Wilson.</p>

               <p>Q. What made you send for him at his own house at Chatham - A. My husband, a wood-cutter eloped from home and was at this good man's house at Chatham about two years ago, my husband eloped at this time, and I heard that he was down to Chatham, and I sent down.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is about this Thursday - A. I am telling you I heard my husband was down at Chatham, I had no friend at Chatham but this gentleman that I thought knew my husband, I desired if he would enquire about Chatham-line whether my husband was at work there and then, I sent him word that I could help him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310008"></xptr>this bargain of fish.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you sent partly to enquire after your husband, and partly to sell your fish - A. I sent a letter to him on the Tuesday, he came up on the Thursday, I let him have the fish, he carried it away on the Friday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring you any tidings of your husband - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him go away on the Friday morning. A. Yes, he went away on Friday morning with his horse and a little cart with him, he took the fish with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body see him go away that morning besides you - A. I cannot say, I did not notice that, I dare say there might be plenty of people; we do not think of such trouble as this.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to stay all night with you - A. It was too late to go all that many miles in the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever stopped with you before at your notice - A. He has been at my house many times, not a twelve-month ago he slept at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you had not seen him for a year and a half - A. Well, a year and a half or a twelve month, it will be two years ago next January. I have not known him above two years and a half, I cannot say to a quarter of a year, but I have not known him longer, he then was the same as he is now, dealing in any thing that he could get a livelyhood by.</p>

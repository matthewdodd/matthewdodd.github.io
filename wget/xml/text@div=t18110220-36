            . On the 30th of January, about a quarter before three, I was standing at the back of St. Andrew's church, looking over the rails into Shoe Lane, I saw the prisoner and another man standing together, the prisoner stood with his face towards me, and the man with him with his back to the wall, I saw Mr. Johnson pass between them, they followed the prosecutor, and the prisoner took the handkerchief out of his pocket, I went round the church and told Mr. Johnson of it, I am certain he is the man. We followed the two men from the corner of Shoe Lane to Eagle and Child Alley, there they parted, the prisoner went down the alley, we followed in Fleet Market, we asked him if he had not got the handkerchief, he said he had not, he would walk with us to any house and settle it, I went with the prisoner and Mr. Johnson to a public-house, a constable searched him and found nothing, I am certain the prisoner is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman to Mr. Lemon, at the King's Arms, Kennington-lane. On 24th March the prisoner came about 10 o'clock in the evening; he called for half a pint of porter, I served him, and he gave me a penny—he afterwards asked me to give him a shilling for a sixpence and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of halfpence, and I gave him one—he afterwards called for half a pint of porter, for that he offered me a shilling—I directly told him it was a bad one—my master was in the parlour, he called out and asked what was the matter; I told him a man had given me a bad shilling—I gave the shilling to my master, and fetched a constable; I saw my master give the shilling to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. These shillings are both counterfeit, and are struck from the same die—they are different from the others, these are German silver—the die in which they have been struck has been cut very badly—these are made in the same way that coins are made in the Mint—they are about five grains lighter than a new shilling, and about three grains lighter than a shilling that has been in circulation about fifteen years—they are very near indeed to the weight of good coins, and they will not bend in a detector.</p>

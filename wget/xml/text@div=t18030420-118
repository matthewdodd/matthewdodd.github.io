               <p>Court. Q. Had any body been near this hole as to take it out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it found ever afterwards? - A. I have seen this piece since at an old-iron shop, in Chick-lane.</p>
               <p> - LONGDEN sworn. - I am an officer; Mr. Short came to the Office, and said, he had been robbed of a quantity of iron and steel; the prisoner told me where he had sold this property; I went to an old-iron shop, in Chick-lane; he could not tell me the name; I found the son, who is not the owner of it; I asked him whether he had no old iron (produces it); he made no hesitation whatever, but pulled it out from under the counter; he said, he had bought it, but did not know from whom; he is lately come.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Ebden) Do you know any of that iron? - A. That is the piece I had in my hand; it is my master's property.</p>

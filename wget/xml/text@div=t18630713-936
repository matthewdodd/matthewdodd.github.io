I live in Shaftesbury-terrace, New North-road—I let lodgings—on 22d June, about half-past 12, the prisoner came and engaged a room—he came a second time, and asked me if I would allow him to write—I got him a pen and ink, and left him alone in the room for a short time—when he went, I missed a great coat and a hat—the coat had been hanging up behind the door, with another one, and the hat was in a box in a cupboard, in the room where he was—I saw him go out, and saw that he had something on his arm, covered over with his blouse, but I could not catch him—he had the hat on, and left his old one behind.</p>

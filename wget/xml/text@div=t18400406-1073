                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Robert Bradbear, and live in vine-place, Tabernacle-square, Old-street-road. On the night of the 10th of March I was intoxicated, and recollect myself last at the station-house—before that I was going up the New North-road—I was only in one gin-shop—I do not know the name of the house—I was alone—this shawl and handkerchief are mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I had them on that night.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184004060053"></xptr>
               <p>—it was a very fine night, and I took a walk—I had not seen my husband all day—I saw him the next day—I slept at home with him the night before—I was not looking for him that night—I went by myself to the gin-shop—very little made me drunk—I did not get into the company of one or two men—I was not in company with any man at all—I saw a man in the New North-road—he did not do any thing with me—he spoke to me—I am sure I cannot say what he said—I do not know where I went after that—that is the last thing I recollect—it was after I left the public-house—I left the public-house sober—I do not know what the man said to me—he might touch me—I fainted when the policeman saw me—I could walk when I left the public-house—I did not see the prisoner to know him—I saw him at the station-house—the man I saw in the New North-road was not the prisoner—that man did not stay long in my company—he only talked to me—he was with me about ten minutes—I walked with him—I do not know where to—I have no recollection afterwards—he was no friend of my husband's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I saw the prosecutrix about twelve o'clock on the night of the 16th of March, with a shawl on, standing at the end of Windsor-street, which leads out of Britannia-fields—in about two minutes I saw the prisoner and another man accompanying her about one hundred and fifty yards across the field—they were walking by her side—one had hold of one side of her, and she appeared hanging on their arms for about one hundred and fifty yards in the field—the prisoner then left her suddenly and ran away—the prosecutrix called out that he had robbed her of her shawl—I pursued and took him in Windsor-street, with the shawl and handkerchief, which I have produced; closely buttoned under his coat—I took him to the station-house—the prosecutrix was intoxicated—I took her also to the station-house—I was in plain clothes—when I took the prisoner he said, "I suppose I have got your wife's shawl, but don't handle me"—he appeared perfectly sober.</p>

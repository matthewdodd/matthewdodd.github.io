                  </hi>. I am a senior clerk in the Post-office—in consequence of some information I made up a letter on 29th October—I put into it a half-sovereign, a two-and-a-half-dollar piece, and twelve penny postage stamps—I put them into the slits of a piece of card, closed the card and money in a plain envelop, which I folded up—I then placed a sheet of paper round the first envelope, and put the whole into a second envelope, which I fastened with adhesive gum—I directed it to "Miss Lever, Mrs. Brown, Lorrimer Academy, Highgate-hill"—I gave the letter to Willis Clare, one of the Inspectors of letter-carriers, with directions to post it at Mr. Burfield's, one of the Strand post-offices—the letter, if posted according to my directions, would have gone by the 11 o'clock collection to the district in Holborn, and have reached there about fifteen minutes past 11 in the ordinary way—I proceeded to the Western Central District Office in Holborn to await the arrival of the 11 o'clock delivery—upon looking over the bag brought from the Strand district I found that letter—upon examining it I found that it was not in the same state in which I had given it to Mr. Clare—the seal had been opened—the adhesive gum seal had been raised and refastened—it is easy to open those by putting the gum over hot water, or by wetting them—I then cut the outer envelope open along the bottom, and took out all the contents—the inner envelope had not been fastened with gum; I merely folded the card in the inner envelope—I found that the half-sovereign had been taken out—upon that I went to Mr. Burfield's shop in the Strand, and there saw the prisoner—he was attending to the post-office duties there—I asked him if he made the 11 o'clock collection; he said he did—I asked him if he had any person to assist him; he said he had not—I then said that a money letter, addressed to Miss Lever, Highgate-hill, had been posted there between 10 and 11 o'clock; that, letter had been opened, and a half-sove<lb></lb>reign taken from it—I said, "Do you know anything of the half-sovereign?"—he said ho did not remember seeing the letter; he cleared all the letters out of the box, and despatched them himself—I said, "Did you have any person to assist you in the post-office business this morning at all?" he said he had not—I then directed the officer Smee to search him, and he took from the prisoner's pocket 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I then requested the prisoner to show me where he kept the gold, or his money, and he did so—he went to the drawer, and from it he took a small tin box—I examined the contents of it, and found in it 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and a half-sovereign—I examined the</p>

               <p>half-sovereign, and found it to be the one I had inclosed in the letter addressed to Miss Lever—the half-sovereign bore my private mark—I found that mark upon it—the box was taken from a drawer close to the letter-box—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the half sovereign; it has my private mark upon it—I said to the prisoner, taking it into my hand, "This half-sovereign was inclosed in the letter directed to Miss Lever, how do you account for its possession?" he said, "I took a half-sovereign over the counter this morning between 10 and 11 o'clock, for postage stamps"—I said, "Where is that half-sovereign?" he said, "That is it," pointing to the one produced—I said, "No, this half-sovereign was inclosed in the letter addressed to Miss Lever;" he said, "That is the only one I have had; I took it for postage stamps"—it is the money of the Postmaster General—it was about ten minutes past 10 o'clock that I gave the letter to Clare—he is an inspector of letter-carriers—he always assists me in this sort of business—I had acquainted him with the object for which this letter was made up.</p>

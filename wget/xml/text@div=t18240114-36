            . On the 30th of December, about one o'clock, I was in Jockey-fields, and heard an alarm, and saw the prisoner running very fast, with a bundle in his hand - a carter who was between him and me, stopped him; he said he had just taken an apple from a girl's basket in a lark, and told him to let him go; but I collared him, and took him to the prosecutor's house. A coat was produced, which his daughter claimed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Could you see all along the field - A. It is a mews behind Bedford-row. When I took him back, he fell upon my arm, and said he was faint - I pulled him up; he put his hand behind the parlour door, and I heard something like glass break, and some spoons fall down.</p>

            . On the 30th of December, Parkinson brought the prisoner to my father's house; he was pulling him from the front parlour door, and I picked up a watch by the door, with the glass broken, and a silver salt spoon - they are my father's. The door had been left ajar. I heard footsteps in the passage a few minutes before, and heard the parlour door open, but supposed it to be my mother coming in. A great coat was taken off a peg between the two parlours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been in the parlour - A. About half an hour before; the watch and spoon were then on the back parlour mantle-piece, and the coat was safe.</p>

            . I live in Red Lion-street. I was working at Mr. Phillips's, in Holborn, at the back of the house, and could see into the prosecutor's yard, and saw the prisoner go up his steps - he pushed the door open, went in, pulled the door too, and came out - he looked about him, went in again, and brought the coat out in his apron. I went down stairs directly, and caught him in Brownlow-street, and asked what he did with the coat; he threw it down and ran away; I called Stop thief! Lowe stopped him. I gave the coat to Lee.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far off were you - A. About fifty yards from the spot. I lost sight of him in coming down stairs. I swear to him positively.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Old Red Cow, Cleveland Street, and serve in the bar—on 19th March, about 6.30 a.m., I served the prisoner with twopennyworth of rum and milk—he tendered a shilling; I took it to the till and bent it, it bent easily—he then asked for twopennyworth of tobacco, and while doing so Constable O'Neil came in—I told the prisoner the shilling was bad, and handed it to O'Neil—the prisoner put down a florin and I gave him the change and told him to leave his name and address, which he did, and said that he worked at Mr. White's, the builder's—the policeman kept the shilling and I told him to follow him—I went outside the door and saw him standing at the corner of the grove putting his head round the corner—two policemen came up and took him; he was brought back and searched, but no bad money was found.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 219). On 19th March, about 6.80, I saw the prisoner near Cleveland Grove, 20 or 30 yards from the Old Red Cow—he kicked a black rag and covered it up with mud—I afterwards met O'Neil and went back with him to the public-house, when the prisoner was taken back and searched—I afterwards went back and picked up the black rag, it contained six bad shillings with paper between each—I showed them to the prisoner, and he asked where I got them—I told him where I spoke to him at the corner of Cleveland Bow—he said that he knew nothing about them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. You were in Cleveland Grove when I spoke to you, and you kicked the black rag away—I saw no man there—I went to the station and told Harris to take you, as you had been taken to the Bethnal Green station before for a similar offence but not charged—I did not pick up the rag when you kicked it because I did not know then that you had been passing bad money—I never saw you drunk on my beat and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> you away—I know that a coffee-shop keeper charged you with passing bad money—I was at the station at the time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 424). I was in the Old Red Cow at 6.30 a.m., and heard the prisoner call for some rum and milk and tobacco—he tendered a shilling, which the barman said was bad—I asked his name and address—he said "George Smith, 9, Arthur Street, Wells Street, Hackney"—he left, and I followed-him to the comer of Cleveland Street, and met another policeman, who told me that he had been taken to Bethnal Green on a similar charge—I went after him, took him, and found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—I took him to the station, when McGowan gave me six bad shillings, and said that he found them at the corner of the street where the prisoner was standing—they were in this black rag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with paper between them—the prisoner gave a different ad<lb></lb>dress at the station—I saw no one else at the comer of Cleveland Row.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I am an honest, hard-working man. It is not feasible that I should go and pass bad money with a constable at my elbow.

                  </hi>. I reside in Thames-street, and am a merchant. On the 17th Nov. I was returning home, about 2 o'clock in the morning; I came from Charing-cross to Thames-street—I had a watch in my left hand waistcoat pocket, and an Albert chain—the prisoner accosted me about Temple Bar; she asked me the way to St. Paul's—I directed her—she walked with me till we got about to the Old Bailey; she took hold of my arm once or twice, which I repulsed—she entreated me to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> home with her, which I did not wish to do—when I got near the Old Bailey I missed my watch—I am certain I had it an hour previously—that is the last time I could swear I had it—when I missed my watch I entreated the prisoner to go with me in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to a brothel, but she would not go then—I was afraid to charge her, she being a powerful woman—I told her I would go home with her—we got near to Doctors' Commons, and I got a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; she got in—I told the cowman privately to drive to Bow-street, and when we got there I gave her in charge—this is my watch and chain—the chain has been cut from the watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I asked you to go into a house, and you said no, you would go in A <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; you unbuttoned yourself in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and stripped me, and tore me to pieces. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, No, I deny it—I did not see you take my watch.</p>

I was in Bow-street station, when the prosecutor arrived in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with the prisoner—he called me, and told me she had robbed him of a gold watch and chain—he gave her in custody—I asked her to get out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and come in, and as she rose up I found this gold watch and chain on the seat in the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi>

On the 4th of February, about half past nine o'clock, I was sitting in the housekeepers room with my mother, who was with me. I was reading aloud to my mother, my room is near the passage door; I heard the lock of the house door turn, and immediately came a man's foot into the passage; I said to my mother that I thought Mrs. Tenant's watchman had gone home to his supper. The instant I opened the door, a man ran upon me with a large stick in his hand, and a pistol; he said your money or your life. I told him I had very little money; I gave him a one pound note in the note book; he then said more money or I will murder you. I said I had no more money, I have a watch, I endeavoured to cut it from my side; I took a knife from the table and cut the watch off and gave it him also; there was a noise afterwards, a rattle sprang. To the best of my knowledge the prisoner is the man; his face was black to the best of my belief; I could entirely distinguish he was a dark complexion man with a prominent nose, his face was black, but I could see his nose.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever acquainted with the man before. - Never, Sir, he said your money or your life, and then more money, or I'll murder you; I had no light, I had only fire light, I could not swear to the man.</p>

            . I live in Grays-lane, Bromley; I am a carpenter. I know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he - A. I cannot tell what occupation he is; I have known him for two or three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the house of Mrs. Tennant - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear a rattle sprung - A. I was returning home with a bundle in my hand from marketing about twenty minutes before ten, in the lane before mentioned, when I drew within fifty yards of my own home, I heard a rattle spring; I stopped to listen. There is a dry ditch in the field, and a wet ditch. The prisoner came opposite me, he stooped down in the dry ditch, as though he would hide himself; immediately I hallowed out halloo there; he sprang out of the dry ditch, and stood upon the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150036"></xptr>bank, and as he stepped over the dry bank, he fell into the wet ditch, he said, oh, dear, he got out of the ditch, and proceeded on. I returned, about one hundred and fifty feet from that spot he would pass the house of Mrs. Biggs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in his way home - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. From the observation that you made of the person running, are you certain it was the prisoner at the bar - A. I did not observe his face, nor the colour of his clothes; I have no doubt from the body, the figure of the man. I returned home, and left my bundle. He continued his course, and passed the house of Mrs. Biggs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. This passage where Mrs. Biggs lives is a public road - A. It is.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him on the evening of the 4th of February - A. I really think it was him that I saw pass me, he was quite close to me almost; he was very wet indeed, the wet ran from him, he had his coat tucked up; he was running in a great hurry, extremely wet; he lives very near me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near does he live to you - A. I could walk it in two minutes. I certainly think he is the person that passed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear positively that he was the man - A. It was star light; I cannot say that I saw his face; I have no doubt at all that he is the person.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EDWARDS. Q. You are a police officer - A. Yes; I in company with Smith, apprehended the prisoner; I went to see Mrs. Tennant's premises. After apprehending the prisoner, Smith and I conducted him to London. I went to examine the premises; I found the marks of shoes with large nails in them; I traced them from the stable to the orchard; I plainly distinguished one shoe; I thinking the prisoner might have shoes on with that description of nails in them; this was going from the garden into the orchard; the way that the man run was not a thoroughfare. At the office I examined the shoes the prisoner had on on the 10th in the afternoon, and seeing the nails in his shoes corresponded in the garden and the orchard, and seeing one nail was out in one of the shoes at the toe, we compared it to that part with the marks of the shoe, it corresponded exactly; to be more exact we made a fresh impression with the shoe, they were both alike.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. The 4th of February, was on Saturday; you took the shoe on the 10th - A. Yes, the man and the shoes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

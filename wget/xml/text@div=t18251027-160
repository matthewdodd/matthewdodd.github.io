On the 19th of September, about six o'clock in the evening, I was at the <placeName id="t18251027-160-crimeloc903">Gloucester public-house, in Gloucester-court, Upper Whitecross-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18251027-160-crimeloc903" type="placeName" value="Gloucester public-house, in Gloucester-court, Upper Whitecross-street"></interp>

I was not at all intoxicated. I cannot say when the prisoner came in, but he called me over to the company, and sat down opposite to me. Between ten and eleven o'clock he reached across the table, put his hand in here, and took my watch. I reached after it, but was prevented from getting it by some other man there - there were two men at the end of the table, and some women. I said to the prisoner "Give me that" - he said, "I have got nothing," and held up his hands. I called to the landlord, who is not here, to bar the door - which he did; he then came to the tap-room - but I saw three persons go out at the back door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did not you resist? A. I did resist as well as I could, but I had not a friend in the house. I got away, and when I went back again, the house was clear.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the landlord take you to the watch-house for breaking the glasses and not paying for them? A. Yes.</p>

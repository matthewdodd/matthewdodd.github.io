On the 11th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I heard the shop window break; it was whole before, and not cracked- I ran out, and saw the prisoner running down the street; I followed him, calling Stop thief! up Circus-street, into Nelson's-place, and never lost sight of him, except while he turned the corner, and saw him again directly I turned- he stopped running, began to walk, and turned back the same way as he had run; I went up to him, and collared him - I told him I wanted him; he said, "Me! I ayn't the man that robbed you" - I said he must go back with me to Mr. Wissett's; he went back, and I left him in the shop with Mr. Wissett - Knowles, an officer, was sent for: I went out to see what was stolen, and found a gold watch was gone; a handkerchief was in the window, which he had broken the window with; it did not belong to us - I had seen the watch safe a few minutes before, in the window, close to the broken pane - the window was whole on this day; the watch was my master's: the prisoner was running when I went out.</p>

A.When I brought him back they were - he had stopped running, and turned back, and then the people following him turned back also; he passed me about a yard and a half before I could stop myself from running.</p>
               <p>ROBERT KNOWLES. I was a Police-man at the time in question, but have now left for a better situation. On the 11th of November, at half-past five o'clock, I was on duty in Seymour-place, and saw a parcel of people round Mr. Wissett's window, and walked up; Mr. Wissett was there- the prisoner was brought up by Metcalf in custody; Mr. Wissett gave him in charge - I followed him into the shop, and searched him; I felt in his trousers pocket, and found a gold watch - I then took him to the station-house in Harcourt-street, Marylebone; I asked how he came by the watch - he said a man going down the street said to him, "Here, d-n it, take it;" I had not said it would be better or worse for him to confess - I produce the watch.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH METCALF. This is Mr. Wissett's watch - here is the private-mark on it of what it cost; it is worth 14l. - we should sell it for 20l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home from work, up Stingo-lane, and saw a man running at full speed; he flung something down on a dung-hill - I went to see what it was, and instantly picked it up, not thinking it any harm; I was coming along the street; a mob came with me - the young man asked if I was not the man who broke the window; I said I was not - I went with him, and did not deny having the watch; I did not say a man told me to take it.</p>

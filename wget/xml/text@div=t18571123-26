               <p>half past 10 o'clock—I had seen that the house was quite safe, and as I went up stairs to bed the parlour windows were both shut down and fastened—there was some sherry in a decanter on the table, the property of Mr. Charles Burton Musgrave—I had seen it before I went to bed—there was also a desk in the room, and other property there—about 2 o'clock in the morning I heard a noise on the second floor; I got out of bed, and came down stairs immediately, and opened the parlour window, and called out, "Police!"—I afterwards opened the street door to bring in Redmill, the constable—I looked round the parlour, and found that the sherry was gone out of the bottle—the desk had been removed and broken—it was whole when I went to bed—I saw Redmill bring the prisoner down stairs.</p>

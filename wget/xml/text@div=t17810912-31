On the 1st of September, about twelve at noon, the prisoner came into the shop. I was behind the counter. Two persons had been looking at some thread edging, which was in a box then upon the counter. The prisoner came behind the two people who were looking at it, and stood there a considerable time. I suspected her. I was at a distance, and could not perceive what she was about. She bought a yard of edging, of another person in the shop. She seemed confused, and went out of the shop. I suspected her, and followed her out. When she got about ten yards from the door, I laid hold of her, and felt the lace under her cloak. I brought her back to the shop, and charged her with taking a piece of lace. She then dropped it from under her arm. She was taken to the Office in Bow-street, and committed by Justice Addington. The edging cost 26 s.</p>

               <p>I went into the shop, and bought a yard of lace. The gentleman followed me; and he said, I believe you have something more than your own. I was rather shocked. He brought me into the shop, took me up stairs, and sent for a constable, and gave charge of me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, and live in Shakspeare-walk, Shadwell. On the 28th of April I went to the St. Katharine's Docks with, four sacks of potatoes—I put them on board the <hi rend="italic">Zante</hi> packet—I took five sacks altogether—I delivered four—I waited a quarter of an hour, and took the donkey and cart round to the main entrance, and came in again for the empty sacks and the money—I waited half an hour or twenty minutes—I then, went out again, and the donkey and cart were there—I came in, and waited half an hour before I could get the sacks or the money—when I came out the third time the donkey and cart were gone—I went up the Minories, and, spoke to the toll-man—I had left one sack of potatoes in my cart and two empty sacks—about an hour afterwards I found the prisoner and another man in Devonport-street, about three quarters of a mile off, with my cart, sacks, and potatoes—the prisoner was holding a handkerchief, and the other man filling the potatoes into it—directly I laid hold of the prisoner he shook the potatoes out of his handkerchief—a woman called to me, and told me to let the man go, he knew nothing of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brook-street. I was passing up Devonport-street—I saw the prisoner and another one standing in the road—the prisoner had hold of a handkerchief—the other was putting potatoes into it—I passed on, and heard the cry of "Police"—I turned—the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner, and accused him of stealing the donkey, cart, and a sack of potatoes—the other man ran away—the prisoner did not run—he said he was merely passing, and the other one asked him to hold the handkerchief—he gave the prosecutor his own direction.</p>

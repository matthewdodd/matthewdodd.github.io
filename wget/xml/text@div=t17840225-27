               <p>What became of you after they left you? - I went down to Kensington to my master and told him, then I came home, I heard afterwards that the men were taken on the next night, I went on Tuesday morning, and gave an information of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this is the man? - I am very positive.</p>
               <p>Were any of your things ever found? - No, the prisoner stood fronting me, I saw his face.</p>

               <p>What did you take him up for? - We took him on suspicion; after the information, we went to see if we could find him, and we did so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He first said I was the person, and shewed me to the prosecutor, and then he said he did not.</p>

               <p>All that I have to say in my own defence is, that I do not know my prosecutor; and this runner has threatened my prosecutor with the pillory if he will not swear against me, he told that young woman so.</p>
               <p>Court to Johnson. Did the prosecutor tell you so? - No, indeed, he did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Bowyer. Where did you first find these trowsers? - In the prisoner's lodgings, where this woman was, these trowsers were hanging on the head of the bed, and when the prosecutor came to the Office the second time, and related the circumstance of his having red striped trowsers on, and it then struck me that I saw something, which I took at that time to be a striped jacket, but when I went again, I saw they were trowsers; these are the trowsers.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one Witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>CHARLES HEBARD. I was on duty on the 18th of November, between Red Lion-street and Gray's Inn-lane, at ten minutes past five o'clock in the morning, and met the prisoner and another person in company - I passed them, and on turning round I saw something bulky about the prisoner; I followed him to Red Lion-street, and asked what he had got - he said a feed of oats, and was going to the Greyhound-yard, to a horse which Mr. Wyatt had been in the habit of borrowing; I said it was more than one feed - he said it was for the whole day; I found in his coat about half a bushel of oats and beans - I then went and found Mr. Moore.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he no tell you to go with him? A. Yes - he said he was going to a person named Cockerell.</p>

            . The prisoner was our head horse-keeper, and had to take care of the corn in the stable; he never had authority to take oats and corn out of the stable - I believe this to be ours; here is rather more than half a bushel of oats and beans mixed together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Will you swear to it? A. I believe it is ours - the prisoner has been twelve months in our employ; I always thought I could depend upon him- I never borrowed a horse of Mr. Cockerell; a man in our employ went by the nickname of York - he has absconded.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The under horse-keeper came to me, and said he had borrowed, or was about to borrow, a horse for the prosecutors, and he wanted to feed him previous to doing so; I said, "Where is this horse?" he said near the Greybound-yard; I said, "I will go with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030037"></xptr>you and see the horse" - he said," How shall we carry the feed?" - I said, "In my pocket," and I took them.</p>

            . I am a carrier, and live in French Horn-yard, Holborn, near the Greyhound. I lent a horse, as I understood, for the use of the prosecutors; I bargained with the man who had it, that he should give it a feed of corn - York answered, "That I will do;" they had it for three hours, and then brought it back again - I had agreed to lend it on the day in question; I do not consider this quantity too much to give a horse for a day - he will eat a peck at a feed, if he can get it. <rs id="t18291203-84-verdict452" type="verdictDescription">

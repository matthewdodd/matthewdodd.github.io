               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not see him take it? A. No; I stood looking into a shop window; several people were passing - it is a new handkerchief, and might hang partly out of my pocket - I felt a pull at it; his mother asked what he had been doing, and said he had parted with her in anger a very little time ago; I find he is respectably connected.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what part of the street did he throw it down? A. In the carriage way.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you made inquiry about him? A. Yes, and understand he is highly respectable; his mother came up in two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been with my mother to the General Post-office, and as we returned we were talking of a female I kept company with; she said if I said any more she would give me in charge. I immediately left her, and seeing this handkerchief on the curb-stone picked it up - I heard an alarm, threw it down, and kept running, fearing my mother would give me in charge.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother, and live in Conduit-street. He had not parted from me five minutes when I was fetched, and found him in custody - we had rode to the Post-office, and were walking home; I had heard he was asked in marriage to a girl - we quarrelled about it; I told him if he was saucy, and would not be ruled by me I would never look upon him, but would give him in charge - he then ran away: he never had a charge against him before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where were you fetched from? A. I believe I had passed the Bolt-in-Tun - he had left me a few doors before I got there.</p>

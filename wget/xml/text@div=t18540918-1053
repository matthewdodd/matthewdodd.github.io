                  </hi>. I am a linendraper, of Woolwich. The prisoner was in my service—on Thursday evening, 17th Aug., I sent for a policeman, and went with him into the prisoner's bedroom, and found her boxes—we examined them in her presence, and found these two pairs of boots, a para<lb></lb>sol, and two pairs of stays, a plain habit shirt, and one with a collar, some tape, buttons, collars, needles, and postage stamps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the value of those I can identify is about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these boots and stays are mine—here is my private mark on them—they have not been sold—her boxes were not locked—I believe she opened them with a key.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this mark on the boots a private mark put on by yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they do not come to me marked—I mark everything in my shop in this way, either in ink or pencil—I do not take off the mark when they are sold—I sell a great many, and they all come from the same manufacturer—I have reason to believe that the prisoner has a sweetheart, a soldier—if he came to the shop, bought the boots, and gave them to her, there is nothing by which I can tell that—when I say that they have not been sold, I mean not to the prisoner—my private mark remains after they are sold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CAARTEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember the soldier being a customer at your shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is a very rare case for soldiers to buy ladies' boots and parasols—this "11" on these stays is my mark—I cannot say, within a month or two, when they were in my stock—the prisoner was in my employment nearly eighteen months, and had access to the shop on Sunday mornings, while I was at a place of worship—these collars have not been washed or worn—here is my private mark in pencil on them—these habitshirts have not been washed—at the time the prisoner's boxes were opened she was asked whether she had any new boots at all—she replied, "No"—she was then asked if she had any in her boxes—she replied, "No," and in the second box that was opened we found them—she said, in my presence, that she had bought several of these things—she was asked where she bought the stay a—she said, "In Eyre-street, Woolwich;" and twenty minutes after<lb></lb>wards she was asked again, and said she bought them at Stratford—she said she bought something else, and my impression is that it was the parasol.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you say anything about this conversation; did you ever tell it in a Court of Justice before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I think not; she was not asked whether she had any new boots, but whether she had any new boots belonging to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 340). On 17th Aug. I was sent for to the prosecutor's house, and saw the prisoner—MR. Robson said that he suspected her of robbing him, and that he should have her boxes searched—I told her she was charged with stealing some boots and stays from her master—she said she had no boots at all in her boxes—I went with her and Mr. Robson into her room, and found three boxes locked—I desired her to open them, and she opened them with some keys which she took from her pocket—in one large box I found two pairs of stays and a parasol—she said nothing till the whole of her boxes were searched; and the things were found; and then she said, in the presence of her master, that she had taken the whole of the things which I had found from the shop—she said she had some friends living at Stratford, and that her mother had been to see her once or twice since she had been at Mr. Robson's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> She admitted at once stealing the whole of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Mr. Robson heard that; I am quite sure of that—I do not know that I have said a word about her saying that she took them from the shop with the exception of what I said before the Magistrate—I know that my depositions were taken down, and handed to the prisoner's advisers—there can be no doubt about what the prisoner said, because she said she was very sorry—before I went up stairs, when I told her she was charged with stealing boots, I believe I said, "belonging to your master"—she said she had not got any new boots belonging to her master.</p>

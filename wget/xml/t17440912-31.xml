The 1st of July, on a Sunday morning, the maid went out of an errand, and left the door open - the rest of the family were in bed: she had not been long gone, before I heard an outcry of Stop thief. I saw the Prisoner run along, and a man offer to lay hold of him. I run after him and took him. As soon as I had caught him,

As we were going to a Justice of the Peace, I went up to a man that the people told me the Prisoner nodded at, and went to lay hold of him, and that man presented a pistol to me, and told me he would blow my brains out, if I came any nearer: I came up pretty near at him, and he presented his pistol again, and made his escape. He presented his pistol at every one he met as he went along. - There was nothing found upon the Prisoner. The Justice asked him to discover his accomplices, and he said he had none.</p>

            . I was looking out of my window, and saw the Prisoner at the bar go into Mr. Lockall's house - it was just after the people were gone to church. I suspected he was a thief, for there was another person came and stood about 10 or a dozen yards short of him, on the other side of the way. I drew my head in again, that they might not observe me, and I saw the prisoner come out again, with something in his apron, and he walked very soberly towards the other man. I said, There is a boy come out of Mr. Lockall's house with something in his apron, and I believe he has robbed him; and cried out stop thief; and then the Prisoner ran along, and cried stop thief. One of them run on one side of the street, and the other on the other side; but when they came to the corner of the street, one turned one corner, and the other the other corner. - I believe the prisoner was about 5 or 6 minutes in the house.</p>

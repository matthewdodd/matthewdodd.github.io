                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of 49, King-street, St. James's; the prisoners were in my employ. On the Sunday before 21st June, in consequence of information, I called Carr into my room, then sent for Emmett, told him what Carr had said, and asked him if it was true—Carr was not present—I will not undertake to say whether I told him or not that it would be better to tell the truth—I believe I did not—I had told Carr so, and promised him forgiveness—I told him Carr said that he (Emmett) had told him to take a loin of mutton to Mr. Dee's public-house in Warwick-street—he said it was not true—I gave them into custody—after they were charged at the station I went with the policeman and Thomas Stephens to</p>

               <p>Mr. Dee's, and inquired for a loin of mutton—one was produced—it was mine—it was peculiar, being from a country piece of mutton—I believe last saw it on the Friday—it weighed 7lbs.—while at the station, before I went to Mr. Dee's, Emmett intimated that he wanted to speak to me—I did not hold out any hope to him whatever—he said, "We did take a loin of mutton," or "part of a loin," I am not certain which, "for a poor man out of place, and intended to put it on to the weight of some customer's meat."</p>

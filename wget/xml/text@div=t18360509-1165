                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Robert Spence and co. We lost two pieces of merino, on Saturday, the 9th of April, in moving from King-street to Love-lane—I know nothing of the prisoner—the pro<lb></lb>perty had not been found—I know it was moved from the old warehouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Barker. The prisoner had our cart on the stand; and was employed in moving the prosecutor's goods—I saw him running away from King-street, with a parcel under his arm—I could not tell what it was—it was similar to the parcels of merino produced in the last case, as to bulk, from what I could perceive at a dis<lb></lb>tance—I occasionally saw the goods unloaded—I was on the stand—I lost sight of him at the corner of 3, Nun-court, Aldermanbury; his cart at that time was on the stand in Aldermanbury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was his cart full or empty at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Empty—it ought to have been empty—I had not seen it loaded—I tried to overtake him, but he turned up the court—I had my suspicions, but did not call—I cannot swear the bundle he had was not wrapped up in a pocket handkerchief—I accused him of it in the evening; and he denied ever having had a parcel.</p>

                  </hi>. On the day in question, I saw the prisoner in the Axe tap, Aldermanbury, with a parcel under his arm—a few minutes after he went out, the witness came in to make inquiry—I had a very short glimpse of the parcel—it might be merely paper—I think it was about the size of this one.</p>

                  </hi>. I was assisting in unloading the carts as they came up to the door—the prisoner was the carman—about eleven o'clock it rained very fast, and the lad who was him left him for a few minutes—I assisted in unloading the cart, and thought every thing was taken out.</p>

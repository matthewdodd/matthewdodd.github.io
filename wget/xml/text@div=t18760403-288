                  </hi>. I was shop foreman to Messrs. Hill Son, of 60, Bishopsgate Street, confectioners—the prisoner was in their service and another man named Thompson—the prisoner and I occupied the same room, and Thompson slept upstairs—ours was a back room on the second floor—I kept money in that room in a tin box in a drawer which was locked—the prisoner knew that, because he was there one morning when I took some money out to lend to Thompson—the prisoner was discharged, and he and Thompson both left on Tuesday—on the next Saturday, the 26th, I went out about 8.45, leaving my bedroom safe and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the box in the drawer, there were four sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, and some silver—I was away half an hour—I had seen the box safe a quarter of an hour before I went out, at 8.30, and when I returned I found that the drawer had been forced open and the money taken out—I went to the prisoner's lodgings the same night, but could not find him; I saw him next morning at 11.30—he was taken in custody and searched—Clara Hartley was in the house when I went out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housemaid to Messrs. Hill—on Saturday evening, 26th February, the prisoner came there and came upstairs for his clothes brush—he was alone—he went down to Mr. Phillips' room, where he had slept, for his clothes brush; he was only there about two minutes—he came out with books under his arm, but 1 saw no clothes brush—the kitchen door was open and he had to pass it to go to Mr. Phillips' bedroom—Mr. Phillips had gone there just before—no one but the prisoner passed the kitchen door I am sure—after the prisoner left Mr. Phillips returned and complained of the loss of his money—the entrance is through the shop.</p>

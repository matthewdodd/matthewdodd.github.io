            . I am shopman to a pawnbroker in Goswell-road. I have a saw and a square, pawned at our house on the 28th of February, by the prisoner, in the name of Clarke.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. That is in his own name? A. Yes; I have known him five or six years - I did not observe that he was in liquor; I would not say he was not - this was within three doors of the public-house.</p>

               <p>MR. BALDWIN. This is my property - I know it by having it in my possession for twelve years; the prisoner was drinking there all the morning; I saw him there with his companions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How many people had been in that skittle-ground? A. I did not observe any but him- I believe his father died deranged, and when he gets a little liquor he is nearly in the same way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the public-house about ten o'clock that morning, and remained drinking all day; a man called me out, and asked me to take the property to pawn, as I lived in the neighbourhood; when the prosecutor came in, and inquired about his tools I was so overcome with liquor, that I did not tell him.</p>

I am the wife of Reuben Taylor, of Henry Place, Corn<lb></lb>wall Road—I was at the corner of Cornwall Road, I saw the prisoner turn the corner very quick, driving a horse and cart—a woman and child were crossing at the time—somebody came up and pulled the woman out of the road, the cart shaved her shawl—the child tried to get out of the way, but it was too late, the cart knocked it down and ran over it—the prisoner took up the reins and hit the horse with them, and went faster than ever—they were in the middle of the road when struck—if the woman had not been pulled away, she would have been pulled under as well.</p>

             sworn. I live at the corner of Orchard street, Oxford street. On the 29th of May my shopman had been to Portman square, he returned into the shop before five o'clock in the afternoon, he returned in the shop with the prisoner and the bundle of paper in question; my man said that he had met him in the street, asked me if I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020015"></xptr>sold it, said he suspected that he had stole it; I asked the prisoner how he came by it, he said that he took it from the side of the door towards Orchard street.</p>

             sworn. I am in the employment of Mr. Jackson; on the 29th of May, returning home I met the prisoner in Orchard-street with a bundle of small hand paper in his hand, from the manner of his appearance I suspected that he had stole it, but not being positive, I followed him, he saw that I watched him; at the top of Quebec-street I asked him where he got the paper, he immediately threw it down and said he took it from the corner of the street, I asked him what street, he said he did not know, I brought him back to Mr. Jackson's; he acknowledged taking it from that side of the place which is next Orchard-street.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Thompson, of Berwick-street. I have known the prisoner five years; he called on me one morning, about five weeks ago, and asked me to pawn him a dozen knives, which he had bought of his master at trade price - I pawned them for him for 10s.; he called at one o'clock, and I gave him the money and duplicate - in three weeks he called again, said he had taken them out of pawn, and asked me to pawn them again, which I did, at Mr. Harrison's - I gave him the money and duplicate at dinner time: he came again last Monday fortnight, said he had taken the knives out of pawn, and asked me to pawn them again; I went with them to Mr. Harrison's, who said, "I have several of these knives - I must know where they come from, and detain you;" I was frightened, and ran out of the shop: I was taken three days afterwards - he gave me these salt-cellars five months ago, for my good behaviour to him, and giving him something when he was out of place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you lived in your place? A. Five or six years; I pawned these on my way to my master's shop - I do not know the prosecutor, but I know his shop. I kept these salts in my own room, but I did not know they were stolen; I thought he had bought them of his master - I did not suspect the knives were stolen; I had not sold any.</p>

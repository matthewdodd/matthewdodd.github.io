               <p>Q. What is the value of your cloak? - A. It cost me three guineas and sixpence. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How do you know that that is your cloak? - A. I know it by the number and the mark, it was the very first cloak I had shewn her; she objected to it on account of the lace being of a bad colour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You knew Mrs. Hutchinson? - A. I knew there was such a person who lives in Oxford-road, they have lived there a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to doubt that that person who was with her was the Mrs. Hutchinson who lived in Oxford-road? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar gave you her address? - A. Yes, Running-horse-yard, King-street, Portman-square; I went the same evening to enquire, and found that she lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you any reason why she would not pay for it then? - A. Because she had not made up her mind which of the two she would have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about her husband at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find out who her husband was? - A. Yes, a horse-dealer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he provide horses for the King's troops on the Continent? - A. I do not know; the people I enquired of said he had been on the Continent.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a great many cloaks lying upon the counter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It might have slipped down? - A. It might, but it could not have slipped under her arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you apprehend her? - A. She had not got past the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not she looking at some articles in the window? - A. Yes, she was just going to move off.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you make any enquiry respecting Mrs. Hutchinson? - A. Yes; she answered the description of that Mrs. Hutchinson of Oxford-road, she wore spectacles, and is a person of very good character.</p>

I live at No. 18 A, Bayham Place, in the neighbourhood of Camden Town, with my relations, and am in the employment of Mr. Burton, a plumber of Frederick Street—I have been so for two years—I have lived with my parents at this house for three or four years—I know Pearce, who has just been examined—on the evening of the 30th of August I was in his company—I met him about half-past seven o'clock in Regent's Park—I was not out of his company from that time until we were taken into custody the following morning between one and two o'clock—Phoebe Glue was with us part of the time—I have known her about six months—she lives with her mother in Fitzroy Place—I was in her company part of the time—she left us about eight o'clock or half-past to go to her brother's, somewhere in Camden Town, near Camden station—she rejoined us about twelve o'clock at the "York and Albany," and remained in our company till we were taken into custody—the first time I saw anything of Barry and the other constable was at the corner of Warren Street, in Camden Town—I had no watch, nor had Pearce—it was about one o'clock—there was a bit of a row or something at the corner of Warren Street—we met some people there—I had seen them before, but not to speak to them—we had been at different public-houses drinking—me and Pearce wanted to fight—we did not fight—we went away then, and saw this man and the other</p>

               <p>constable go down Camden Town—one had a light coat on, and the other had a dark one—one of them had an umbrella in his hand, I believe Hayes, he was the one with the light coat—I think it was Barry had the umbrella, now I come to think of it—the man who had the dark coat on had the umbrella—when we got a little further on in Camden Town we saw a man in a fit, and stopped to see it—Hayes and Barry came behind, us and pushed us, and said we had better move on—they said, "<hi rend="italic">Sling</hi> your <hi rend="italic">dannel</hi>"—I understood that to mean to go on—we crossed the road, and these men followed us, and me and Blackburn ran round King Street, and ran down Bayham Street, and came out at the bottom of High Street again, and met the others, Glue, Pearce, and Gregory—we left the policemen, ran away from them—I saw them again when we were bidding one another good night at the corner of High Street, and they got into a hansom cab—this was about half-past one or a quarter to two o'clock, as near as I can guess—the cab turned back and drove towards Tottenham Court Road—we walked up Eversholt Street, and when we got as far Crawley Mews I was going round there to make water, and Hayes, the one in the light coat, <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fist and hit me in the ear and knocked me down in the road—I did not see anything more of the cab—they picked me up again, they were both waiting round the corner, just round by the public-house, then Hayes said to the other, "Collar him; I have got one, we may as well have a couple"—Pearce was then just across the road, they were just coming across to see what was the matter, when they saw me knocked down—there was Pearce and Gregory and Glue—Barry then went and took Pearce—I saw that, and he told Gregory he had better be off home, else he would have him too—Gregory then went home—Glue stopped and walked behind us—we were taken to the station—she followed us to the station, in Little Albany Street—during the whole of the time up to the moment when we were taken into custody in Eversholt Street neither myself or Pearce were at No. 63, Gloucester Crescent, or in the garden, or near it, not nearer than the "York and Albany"—when we got to the station I asked Hayes what we were charged with, he said, "Hold your noise"—then I asked him again, and he said, "You will know in the morning"—the prisoner did not, nor did anybody in my hearing at the station-house tell us that we were taken on a charge of attempting to commit a burglary—this is my knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have had it six or twelve months—I had it with me on the evening in question—I had it when I was taken into custody—I had it when I was taken to the police-station—it was in my pocket when I was taken into the police-station—Hayes took it away from me, and held it up like this, open, and said, "Here's a fine thing," or something of that sort—I said, "That is my knife"—Pearce said, "Yes, I sharpened it for you yesterday"—that was true.</p>

I am a grainer, residing at Kentish Town—on the night of 30th August I was at the "Stationers' Arms," at the corner of Warren Street—I stopped there till the house was closed, about a quarter or five minutes before one—when I came out I stood outside for a short time with Grocer and Wright—while standing there I saw a number of youths coming down High Street—Pearce and Dye were among them—I saw Hayes and Barry there too—Pearce and Dye came up and pushed against me, and very nearly pushed me into the road—then they walked just past me, turned back, and went up Warren Street—the constables were standing just round the corner of Warren Street—I saw the boys go and speak to them—I then saw the boys pass me again, and go down the Hampstead Road towards Mornington Crescent—that is towards Eversholt Street way—I did not see any one following them at that time—I missed Hayes and Barry all at once—I went away, and went home.</p>

I said, "No, thank you," and I walked away—they passed us and went down High Street—I did not take particular notice whether anybody followed them—I saw two or three boys, and I think there was a girl—they were going in the direction of Eversholt Street—it would be a straight road.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 53, College Place, Camden Town, and am a pianoforte manufacturer—on the day after the trial of the case against Dye and Pearce, at the Middlesex Sessions, I went to Mr. Dolman's house, 63, Gloucester Crescent—he showed me the front kitchen window, and I examined it in his presence—I saw some three or four slight cuts on the window, extending upwards about one-eighth and one-sixteenth of an inch—they had been cut evidently by a knife—I saw the cuts when I was inside the kitchen, they were on the right side of the fastening, the side towards which it opens—at that time I was under the impression that the cuts could not be made unless the window was open—on a subsequent examination of the window I found that the lower bar of the top sash came when fastened lower than the top bar of the lower sash, so that the cuts might have been made from the outside, and when the window was fastened—at that time I had the knife which was produced at the trial in my possession—I borrowed another knife from Mr. Dolman, a common table-knife, you would call it a cheese-knife, much thicker than the one said to have been used—when the window was fastened I attempted to put that thicker knife up between the two sashes from the outside, and I could just see the point of it—I used a great amount of force to wriggle it up, and I could just see the point of it, but I could not get it to act on the fast<lb></lb>ening,</p>

               <p>which I tried—when I returned into the room I fastened the catch, and I found that it required a very great effort on my part to push it back again when once it was properly closed—the force required to open that catch with a knife would, in my opinion, produce a mark on the edge of the knife—this knife has never been out of my possession—there are no marks at all on the edge of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 63, Gloucester Crescent—on the night of the 30th August I retired to rest at half-past eleven, as near as I can remember—on that night I slept in the back room on the first floor—I have a garden at the back and in the front of my house, the front gar<lb></lb>den is where the prisoners are said to have been taken—I heard nothing at all that night—nobody slept on the ground floor or in the front of the house on that night—I first heard anything about this matter, as nearly as I can remember, at a little before five in the morning, from my servant—the servant woke me, and I came downstairs almost immediately afterwards—I went into the room where the window was and saw the two police con<lb></lb>stables, Hayes and Barry, and a policeman in uniform—they pointed out to me the marks on the sash, and showed me that the window was open—the window was open then—there were some slight cuts on the bottom of the middle rail of the sash—I know a carpenter of the name of Hearne—I was in the kitchen when somebody came in and brought this model (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) with him, but I am not aware that he made it in my kitchen—my window has not been altered at all since—I remember Mr. Ivory coming to my house the day after the trial at the Middlesex Sessions—to the best of my belief I had not seen Barry and Hayes that day—Mr. Ivory went down into the kitchen, and, fastening the bolt of the window, tried with a table knife whether he could open it from the outside—he was not able to open the fastening from the outside—the hasp of the window goes stiffly—the entire height of the wall that the boys are alleged to have gone over is more than six feet to the top of the coping—it is six feet from the pavement from the outside—I think it is such a wall that a man, placing his hand on it, could leap over, because there is a little set-off in the brickwork out-side, a man stepping on that could get over—there is an entrance gate—I believe on the night in question that gate was bolted on the inside—a person might get out of the garden that way by pulling back the bolt.</p>

On the night of the 30th August I was at the door of the station when Hayes and Barry came in with the two men—I was just outside the station, near the outer door next to Albany Street—I did not see anything in Hayes' hand at the moment he entered the station, but when he placed the prisoner he had in the dock he showed</p>

               <p>me a knife—it was in his right hand open—he said, "How should you like a bit of this?"—he said no more to me—Dye said, "That is my knife," and Pearce said, "Yes, I sharpened it for you"—he did not say when, at least I do not think so—Hayes said he found it in Gloucester Crescent in the garden—I did not see any woman with them when they came to the door—I have seen the girl Glue since—I did not see her there—she did not come to the door—before they were searched I saw this knife in Haye's hand.</p>

I remember the 30th August—I did not go that night at all at the "Stationers' Arms"—I was never in there that night—I am a married man; and live at 58, Arlington Square—that is adjacent to Mornington Crescent—I left my house that night somewhere about ten minutes to twelve—I have to report myself at the station at twelve o'clock—on coming out I came down Arlington Street into Mornington Crescent, through Crescent Place, into Stanhope Street, to the corner of Mornington Road—I saw two men standing at the corner of Mornington Road by the railway arch—Stanhope Street and Mornington Road join—I passed the two men, and waited till the constable on the beat came up to me—that was Small—it was a very few minutes before he came up—something passed between us—he gave me a description of these two men—from what I said to him, he went to the station for my companion Barry—Barry came to me—I might have moved a little from the spot—he met me about half-way between the two bridges—on meeting we followed these two men—I pointed them out to Barry—they were not in sight then—we followed them up Mornington Road into Park Street—that is about 200 yards from Smith's, the "Camden Stores;" 200 or 300 yards, more than 100 yards—they crossed over to Gloucester Crescent, where we lost sight of them—Barry and I then stood at the corner of Gloucester Crescent, to see if we could see anything of them—this was somewhere about one, I could not speak exactly—I said something to Barry—I looked on one side of Gloucester Crescent, and Barry the other—in coming by 63 I heard a sort of scramble in the garden—I looked over the wall, and I saw two men there—I sang out to Barry, "Here they are"—I put my foot on the ridge of the wall, and leaped over the wall in that manner—I caught hold of Dye in the garden—at the same time the other man ran to the other end of the garden, and got over the wall—I took hold of Dye, and saw some<lb></lb>thing lying on the ground beside him—I picked it up—it was a knife open—at that time the other prisoner was brought back by Barry—we then</p>

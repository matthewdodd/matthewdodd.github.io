                  </hi> I live at 58, Lesada Street, Old Ford, Bow—I was a passenger on board the <hi rend="italic">Orion</hi>. a British ship sailing under British colours, bound from Antwerp to London—the prisoners were passengers on board the same ship—on the afternoon of 21st July I was awoke by Robert Smith, when on board the ship; she was at that time out at sea—he asked me to pay my passage; when I got up for the purpose of paying it I missed my purse out of my pocket—there was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it when I last saw it, at three o'clock, when I lay down in the cabin; it was then in my right-hand trousers pocket—when Smith awoke me I had my trousers on—the money was all in gold, fourteen sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver; I could speak to one half-sovereign—I never saw my purse afterwards.</p>

                  </hi> I am a fireman on board the <hi rend="italic">Orion</hi> steamer—on the voyage from Antwerp to London, about four miles from Flushing, I had occasion to go to the watercloset, and while there the two prisoners came there; they tried the compartment I was in—I told them to go to the next one, and as they were there I looked through a hole to see what they were doing; one was outside and one in, and I saw them exchange some money—I saw Bennett with a purse—I did not see where he took it from or what he did with it—this was between three and four in the afternoon—I could not say what sort of money it was; it was gold.</p>

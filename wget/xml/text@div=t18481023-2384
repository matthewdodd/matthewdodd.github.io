                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, of Redgate-court, Minories. I met the prisoner about eighteen months ago in a public-house, and kept company with her—she spoke to me on the subject of marriage, and I married her at Stepney on 26th June last—about three weeks afterwards I was walking with her, a female came up, and called her a good-for-nothing thing, and said, "You know you are a married woman"—she denied it—I asked the prisoner if it was true—she denied it, and I did not think it was true until 13th Oct., when I went to Bethnal-green church, got this certificate, and gave her in charge.</p>

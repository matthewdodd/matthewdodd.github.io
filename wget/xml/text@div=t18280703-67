On the morning of the 2d of June, I marked thirteen pieces of gold, weighing 20z. 6 dwts., and gave them to the prisoner to melt; I afterwards went to his crucible, and found only eleven pieces there; the officer was sent for, and one gold found; I charged him with taking it, and he said he had, and it was the first time he had done such a thing.</p>

            . When the prisoner was accused, he brought out one of the pieces, but it was not taken from him - he kept it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he might have put these into the crucible afterwards? A. He was called away from it - I gave him the gold to melt.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it usual to put the whole of the gold in at once? A. It depends on the size of the crucible - it would have held all this.</p>

               <p>These things hung up to dry on the 21st of February, I hung these shirts in the yard to dry, the prisoner at the bar took the shirts, a boy coming up with beer for supper, told me there was a foot in the passage, I ran down, this was about half past eight o'clock, I found the street and yard door open, I ran out and took the prisoner, at about fifty yards distance, I took him with the shirts upon him.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>They were the same I hung up in the yard, they partly belonged to myself, and part to a captain I was washing for, I take in linen to wash, I took the shirts that I found upon the prisoner, I am sensible they are the same shirts, because I washed them, they were almost dry, not ironed, I could swear to them all, when I stopped him my husband was with me, the prisoner said, he did it for poverty, he was just starving, he did not deny taking them, he said he did it for want.</p>

               <p>I was not seen in the yard at all, she found no shirts on me; I have no witnesses.</p>

               <p>Q. What have you to say against this man? - A. We caught him with four faggots.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You did not catch him - did you lose any faggots? - A. Yes, four out of the rick-yard, on the 9th of July, in the morning about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>- HAYCOCK sworn. - I am a carpenter: On Monday night, the 8th of July, I was out for the purpose of looking after depredators; on Tuesday morning, near two o'clock, we met this man with these four faggots on his back tied up with a cord of his own.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from Mr. Lucas's farm? - A. Not quite half a mile; I stopped him till seven or eight more came up of our party, and then we took them away from him, and hid them till the morning; we knew the man perfectly well, so we set him at liberty; we asked him where he had them from; he said he had them from Muswell-hill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. This man has a wife, and how many children? - A. A great number; he lives about a hundred yards from the spot where I took him. (The faggots produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

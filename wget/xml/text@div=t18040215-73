             sworn - I am a constable; the father of this young lad informed me, that he thought it was the three women that lodged in the same house; I knew some of the lodgers there by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they loose women? - A. I see them go about, two or three of them together; I have seen them go into the gin-shop; I took all the three women to the pawnbroker's; the pawnbroker pointed out that woman from the three.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the three women live in the same house? - A. I believe two of them do; I know they did at that time; I took her before a Magistrate; she was committed till the Monday following, and a duplicate was brought on the Monday.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker, in Warner-street; on the 29th of December last, at seven o'clock in the evening, a blue cloth coat was brought to me to pledge, upon which I lent 15 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought it? - A. The prisoner at the bar, to the best of my knowledge; I produce the coat.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Is that your coat? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never came to your shop but once, and then I pledged a coat for 1 s. 6 d. it was a black one; I lodge in the next room to where he lives; it is an open house, where there are half a dozen people in and out in the night, and an open door continually; I never had any thing lost in the house; I have lived four months in the house; I had very bad health, and very seldom out from one month to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any witness here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JAMES M'GILL sworn. - I heard of the loss of a coat; some time after, in my room, I found a duplicate, rolled up, as if it had been put through the key-hole of the door; I said to my wife, you are very careless of your duplicates; I had a coat in pawn; I thought it was this coat; I threw it by and thought no more of it; my wife, a day or two afterwards, said, that duplicate is not your's; I live in the room facing the prosecutor's; I cannot see how it came there; I picked it off the floor, and this person had access to my room, the same as her own.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Pawnbroker.) Q. Are you certain that is the woman that brought the coat to you; you might mistake? - A. A mistake is what we are all subject to; it was night when she brought it, but I have no doubt in my own mind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an articled clerk, and live at 17, Camden-square—about 12 or half-past, on the night of 20th November, I was in St. Martin's-lane, and saw the prisoner attempting to take a watch from the prosecutor—there were some persons standing at the corner, but they did</p>

               <p>not seem to take any notice of it—I stepped up and caught him by the collar, and when I had my hand on his collar the watch was in his hand—he was quite sober, but he acted very cleverly, pretending to be drunk—it seemed to come on as soon as the policeman came up.</p>

I am a musician, and live at 6, Church-terrace, Battersea—about half-past 12, on the night of 20th November, I was in St. Martin's-lane, and saw two men sparring together as if disputing, three or four yards from where I was passing—as I was crossing St. Martin's-lane, both the men came on me, and pushed me—I lifted up my cane to defend myself, and the one who was nearest to me seized my arms, at the same time the prisoner pulled at my watch-chain four times very violently—he pulled the watch out of my pocket, and had it in his hand—he could not break the chain; it was too strong, and it saved my watch—I was obliged to let my stick go and an umbrella that I had in the other hand—the other man ran away with it.</p>

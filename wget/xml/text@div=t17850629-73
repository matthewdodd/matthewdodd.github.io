               <p>Court. Could these halfpence have laid there any time without being seen? - I think not; these other things were found in a lower apartment at this house, where the prisoners Lambert and Edwards were; I turned round a bed-stead, and there were some goods belonging to the prosecutor in a cupboard, I found a caddee of the prosecutor's with some tea in it, tied round with a string, I saw five shillings of half-pence lay in a window, I cannot say whose lodging it was; this dark lanthorn was found in the prosecutor's house by Lee, the watchman, I found this key myself; these are the halfpence I found in the watch-house, and these are them that were found in the room.</p>

            . How long do you remember Harris resorting to that house in George-alley? - Three or four months, M'Glew kept the house before, I had not seen him that morning, the woman prisoner said, she lodged there that night, it was a private house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Would not these ladies of the town have carried me to that house? - Certainly they would.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. My Lord, I submit whether on this evidence, Harris should be put on his defence, that which is against him expressly, is, that he was found in a situation where these halfpence were found; the indictment specifies that these halfpence naming the number of them, are of a precise value, the same as the farthings, now this man's evidence says, that they were some of them counterfeits.</p>
               <p>The indictment handed up to the Court.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not necessary to prove the value that is lost, if the whole was counterfeit halfpence, they should be so settled to be sure, but I do not conceive that the Court will say, if a part are counterfeit that should vindicate the rest; I do not now speak of the effect of the evidence, but supposing it to be clearly proved under this indictment, that the prisoner had stolen ten good halfpence of the value of five pence, do not you conceive that would be sufficient to maintain the indictment; but, supposing the prisoner had stolen nothing but bad halfpence, I think it would not have been sufficient to maintain the indictment.</p>

               <p>I leave it to my counsel.</p>

               <p>I had been out a drinking that night, and I was in the house when these people came in, and there were more people there.</p>
               <p>PRISONER EDWARDS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I lodged in the house, and I do not know what I am taken up for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lambert. I am an intire stranger, I have no witnesses.</p>

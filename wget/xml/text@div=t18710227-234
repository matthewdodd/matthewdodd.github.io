                  </hi>. I live at 29, George Street, St. Luke's, and am in the service of Gilbert &amp; Rivington, printers, St. John's Square—my duty is pulling off the first impression of types—Gilbert and Rivington print the examination papers for the Apothecaries' Company, and it was my duty to pull the proofs of those papers—in September, 1868, a boy brought me a message, in consequence of which I went to the "Coach and Horses," and saw Newport, whom I had never seen before—he asked me if my name was Heatley; I said "Yes"—he said that he had got something to speak to me about, very private and confidential—I asked him what it was about—he put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out the paper of a previous examination, saying "You print this at your place?" I said "Yes"—he asked me if I could supply him with one for the next examination that was coming on—it rather took me aback, and I said "I could do such a thing, but it requires some thinking, and if you like you can see me again"—he said that if I could get it, I should be paid liberally; 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that he wanted it for an old gentleman in Lincoln's Inn Fields, a doctor, a friend of his, who wanted it to supply another doctor with the means of passing the examina<lb></lb>tion—I said that it required consideration, and I would meet him the next night—I communicated with my employers the next morning, the moment I came, and in consequence of directions, I again met Newport that evening—I said that I should like to see the gentleman in Lincoln's Inn Fields—Newport said that I could go with him and see him, and it was arranged that I should go—I ultimately went to 50<hi rend="italic">A</hi>, Lincoln's Inn Fields, where Newport introduced me to Jerrard, as Mr. Heatley, the party who could supply him with an examination-paper—Jerrard said that he was glad to see me, and hoped I should be able to get him the papers, and there would be no fear of getting into any trouble or bother, it was quite private and quite safe—I told him I had never done anything of the sort; I had a wife and family, and had my character to study, and I hoped they would not trouble me again—Jerrard seemed very much taken aback by it, and sur<lb></lb>prised—he said that he hoped I should keep it a secret, and not let anyone know anything about it—Newport said nothing to me while we were in the room—we three went out together to a public-house, and had a pot of ale—we talked the matter over, and they said they hoped I should not say anything about it, and Newport went away with me—I informed Mr.</p>

               <p>"There is the money"—I took it, and gave him the papers—he opened them, looked at them, and said "The Greek <hi rend="italic">aint</hi> here"—I said "Yes, I think you will find it there"—he said "It is all right"—I said that I must be going, for I had other business to do—he said, if at any other time he wanted anything of that sort, he supposed I could supply him—I said "Yes, I daresay I could," and when I got to the door I said "I suppose, at any future time, you will let Mr. Newport know"—the inspector and sergeant then came up; I handed the money to them, and they took the prisoners in custody—all I did was under instructions.</p>

I had six interviews with Newport, between October, 1868, and the time I supplied the papers—I have got them down here—I went twice to Jerrard's—I would not let him see the papers till I had the money—I never intimated to Jerrard that Mr. Rivington would not allow me to part with the papers—what Jerrard said was that there was no fear of my getting into any trouble, for the money was safe—he said that he would give me ten sovereigns, and not a note, so that there should be no trouble about it—I do not think he said "So that there should be no difficulty about it"—he said that if I would let him see the papers, they could be burnt—I do not suppose he wanted the paper.</p>

Newport sanctioned my doing so—all Newport did was to introduce me, and to say that I should be able to get the papers—I saw Newport again, At the "Eagle," and also in Fleet Street, and he said that I was a very foolish fellow, I might be making a pound or two, and nobody know any<lb></lb>thing about it—Mr. Rivington told me to go to Mr. Mullens, and all that subsequently took place was under the superintendence of Mr. Mullens and Inspector Mulvaney.</p>

Rivington, about 7 p.m., and saw Heatley—I searched him, and he had only a shilling on him—I marked two examination papers, and saw Heatley go with them to "St. John's Gate Tavern," where Newport joined him, and they went together to 50A, Lincoln's Inn Fields—Butcher and I stayed outside—Heatley was there about five minutes; I then heard the door open, and saw Heatley standing at the door, and Jerrard behind him, with some papers crumpled up—I said "Mr. Jerrard, I presume?"—he made no reply—I said "I am a police-officer, give up what you have got;" we had a short struggle, and I got the papers—I said "I am informed you have been inciting this man to steal these papers from his employer"—he made no reply—I said to Heatley "Have you received any money for this?"—he gave me eight sovereigns and four half-sovereigns—when we got to the second floor he desired some young gentlemen to go to his wife and say that he was locked up—I said "Who are those young gentlemen?"—he said "They are students"—I said "Then, you teach?"—he said "Yes."</p>

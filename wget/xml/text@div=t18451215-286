                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I had charge of the captain's coats—I was bringing them for him—I took them out of my chest on the Sunday night, and they were taken with the other things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Carroll's Defence.</hi> I never was placed in such circumstances before, and I feel it more severely as I have brought three innocent persons into it; while I was a waiter in the Home I became acquainted with another waiter named Henry Williams; he and I were <hi rend="italic">chums</hi>, and used to help each other; after I left I got</p>

               <p>work in the docks, and furnished a room out of what money I had saved at the Home; I worked in the docks about six months; I then furnished a house, and took in sailors as borders; while there I had frequent opportunities of seeing Williams; he asked me if I could dispose of some things he had bought in the Home from sailors who had run out of their money, but he did not like to dispose of them in the Home, as he knew the officials were against any trafficking between the boarders and the waiters; I sold several things for him—about a fortnight ago he asked me to dispose of a coat for him, which he gave me on the Monday, with these pieces of table-cloth, (which he said had been condemned,) for myself; it appears that he has been turned away from the Home on suspicion of this, and has not been heard of since, and I have been brought into this trouble through him; if I had had any criminal knowledge it is not likely I should have sent these parties to pawn the things within a stone's throw of the Home, and of my own place, where I was known.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Franks's Defence.</hi> Speed gave the table-cloth to me, and I brought ber back the ticket and money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Speed's Defence.</hi> Carroll gave me the two pieces of cloth; I asked where they came from; he said that was no business of mine; I asked Stevens and Riley to pawn them, for I had two Mack eyes, and was ashamed to go out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Vallack's Defence.</hi> The knife was given to me by a young man the day before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Carroll.</hi> I can account for Vallack possession of the knife; I gave it to George, a sailor using the house, and he gave it to Vallack; it was in the pocket of the coat that Williams gave me to sell for him.</p>

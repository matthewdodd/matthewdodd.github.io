On the 9th of August I slept at Bedfont, at my mother-in-law's—the prisoner slept with me—I had four sovereigns and tea shillings in my breeches pocket when I went to bed—one sovereign bad a mark on the hind part of the head—we got up much about the same time, and each went to our work—between ten and eleven o'clock that day my wife came to me—I took my purse out of my pocket to give her two shillings, and missed two sovereigns and a shilling—I suspected the prisoner, and went to the field where he had been at work, but he was gone—I found him at Han well, at the <hi rend="italic">Tom and Jerry</hi>, kept by Seal—I got a policeman—the prisoner was charged with having taken my money—he said he had not taken it at first, and afterwards he said he had—I applied to Mrs. Seal for the money the prisoner had given to her—she gave me a sovereign—"it was the one which was marked as mine was.</p>

                  </hi>. I act for Mr. Pearce, the landlord of the Duke of York public-house, Chelsea, while he is out of town. About ten o'clock in the evening of the 10th of February, I saw the prisoner in the house with a female child in her arms, about sixteen or seventeen months old—she threw it violently on the ground—it was picked up and put in her arms again—she threw it down a second time, saying, "You little b—would not mind two years for you; I wish you were dead before the morning"—a woman picked it up, and as she was giving it to her, the prisoner made a grasp at its throat—I prevented her by laying hold of her, but she caught its arm and gave it a pull, and I rather think she dislocated it at the time—we got it away as well as we could, and got her on the ground, where I held her till the policeman came and took her into custody.</p>

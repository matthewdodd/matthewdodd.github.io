                  </hi>. I am a corporal in the Royal Artillery—on 7th November I made up a letter into which I put a photographic drawing and case—I addressed it "Mrs. J. Roberts, W. Williams', Esq., Langions Castle, Monmouthshire"—I put six penny stamps on it and posted it myself at a quarter to 10 in the morning, at the Royal Artillery post-office in the barracks at Woolwich—I made some inquiries with regard to that letter, and on 17th or 18th December this photographic case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was shown me by sergeant-major Osborn—it is the one I enclosed in the letter—my likeness was in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sergeant-major to the garrison, Royal Artillery—there is a post-office in the garrison which is under the charge of George Groves, a sergeant—on 17th December I received information that the prisoner was in custody, and went to his house at 2, St. James's-place, Woolwich, between 6 and 7 in the evening—I did not know what rooms he occupied—I went into two rooms on the ground floor—his wife came in while I was there—I searched the house, and in a clothes-box in the front room found these three likeness cases and several other articles which I did not bring away—Rees selected one of them as his—I also found in a piece of blue paper twenty-four postage stamps which all appeared to have been put on and taken off again—one of them has a piece of paper adhering to it now, and ten I found in a black envelope, one of which appears to have been taken off and re-gummed—I found some sealing-wax and a button with a crown on it in the clock-case—there is a piece knocked out of it, which corresponds with the seal on the bag—the bag is sealed when it is sent down from the office, but not with a similar seal to the button—I find the impression on both is three guns, but one is raised and the other is sunk, and this button has been knocked about—this is the Royal Artillery seal—the prisoner was taken in custody before I heard anything about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the Royal Artillery—the post-office of the garrison is under my charge—it is not under the charge of the Post Master General—letters are sent from the garrison to the post-office in the town four times a-day: half-past 8. a quarter to 12, half-past 3, and a quarter-past 9—the prisoner was employed in November last as a messenger to carry the bag from the garrison to the town, but he did not go all the four journeys; only the quarter to 12 and half-past 3—he always went those two—if a letter was posted at half-past 10 at the garrison post-office, it would go to the town by the quarter to 12 bag—when letters are sent from the garrison they are tied in a bundle, put into a bag, and sealed—we have six or seven bags, and as one comes up the other goes down—they are similar to this one—I recollect that the prisoner took the bag for the quarter to 12 delivery down to the town—it was delivered to him to seal and was sealed in my office with the ordinance seal—it was his duty to deliver it to the post-master at Woolwich—on 17th December I went with sergeant Osborn to the prisoner's house and saw the button found and the stamps—the button was found in a small box on the mantlepiece—the impression on it is three guns.</p>

On Sunday, the 15th of May, I and my sister went out for the day, leaving nobody at home; I made the door fast, tried it, and took the key with me; this property was then perfectly safe. We returned about ten o'clock at night, and found the gate of the fore court open; I had locked it - the lock was not injured: I found the house apparently as I had left it; the street door was locked, but I found a difficulty in unlocking it. On entering the house I missed four silver spoons from the front parlour, and on examination we missed the other articles, and next morning, about twelve o'clock, I found them at Worship-street, in possession of Grafton, the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. Are you certain you locked the door? A. I locked it outside, and did not leave it on the spring.</p>
               <p>SARAH TRUMAN. I went out with the prosecutor (who is my brother) about eleven o'clock on Sunday morning, the 15th of May. The articles stated in the indictment were then safe. I saw him lock the street door, and try it, and the gate also. We returned at ten, and found the fore-court gate open; I missed all these things, which were safe when I went out; (examining the property) here is a silk dress of mine - it was made for me; I had worn it twice; I put this string to it. Here is another dress of mine - each of them are worth 1 l. Here are four new table-cloths and a looking-glass, of my brother's.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker, and live in Brunswick-place, Stoke Newington. On Sunday, the 15th of May, I was returning from a place of Worship, and saw the prisoner standing opposite to Mr. Truman's gate (as I now know it to be) - he was apparently reading a paper; he stood there till I came up to him, and just as I got up to the gate I saw another person come out of Truman's door, with a bundle, and shut it - he spoke to the prisoner as he passed, and left him behind; the prisoner went on the other side of the way; I suspected something, it being Sunday; I did not know that I had a right to interfere, but I took particular notice of their dress and manner, and let them go away. I saw the prisoner in custody on the Wednesday following, and am fully persuaded that he is the person - I have not the least doubt of it: he was not dressed exactly the same as before: he had a black coat on at Worship-street, but I knew him immediately. I took particular notice of him, being apparently reading, and yet looking about him. He followed the other man when he had got about thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did there appear any acquaintance between them? A. There was no particular friendship. but a short sentence passed between them - I cannot tell what the paper was about.</p>

            . I am a headborough of Islington. On Sunday, the 15th of May, I was in Lower-road, Islington, about a mile and a half from the prosecutors', and saw the prisoner and another man on the road - the prisoner was carrying a bundle containing the property produced, and the other man a hat tied up in a handkerchief. I went up and asked the prisoner where he got the bundle; he threw it down, and ran off; I picked it up, pursued, and secured him nearly a quarter of a mile off; his companion escaped. I was informed the other man had gone into the Gun, public-house, where I found this hat, tied in a handkerchief; I have kept the articles ever since: the spoons have not been found. I have a blue bag, two handkerchiefs, a screw-driver, and several skeleton keys, which were all found on the prisoner's person - two of the keys open Truman's gate and street door.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he was returning from Newington between twelve and one o'clock, and met a young man carrying three bundles, who asked where he was going - he replied to Islington, and the man then asked him to carry two of them to the Gun, public-house, and on his being stopped this man ran away, which rose his suspicions, and he threw the bundle down, and ran off - that the man had told him he was going to the Gun, where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

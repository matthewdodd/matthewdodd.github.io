            . I owed O'Neil 10 s. 2 1/2 d. for milk. I paid it to the prisoner on the 25th of March, with a half-crown, a sixpence, and the rest in shillings and halfpence. I produce his receipt for it.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY O'NEIL. He never paid me this money. He was drunk for a fortnight before he left me. I asked him about this money; he said the cook would have paid him if she had had change. This was before the 25th of March - he said nothing about it afterwards. I asked him to come and make up his accounts, but he did not - there was nearly 2 l. due to him if he had settled with me, but he has kept more than this back.</p>

I went out about a quarter to six o'clock in the evening, leaving my wife at home: I returned about eight, and missed about fifty yards of silk which was in the loom when I went out - it was cut out; I had been working at it that day; I directly went to Worship-street and gave information; Armstrong promised to meet me in half an hour, but never came, and I got three watchmen to examine my place; there was a knife left in the room - the silk has not been found; it was up in the second - floor room where I lodge - there were three lodgers - Mr. Patrick lodges under my room, the prisoner Vine lived on the middle-floor, and a woman at the bottom; I sleep in the room the loom is in - we only have that one; we were down stairs in the lower room after missing the property - and about a quarter-past eleven o'clock we went up, and in a quarter of an hour Vine's wife came up, knocked at the door, and began saying what a sad loss it was; and while she was talking we found a knife, but whether it had been left there in the afternoon when their child was playing there I cannot say; it belonged to Vine - I have seen him at work with it several times; I found it by the fire-place close by the loom - I have lived there about a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Vine has some children? A. One; it runs about, and used to play in our room - we occasionally lent each other things.</p>

            . My husband left me at home; I went out at a quarter to seven o'clock and returned at a quarter to eight; I had locked the door and took the key; I left the silk in the loom - I returned before my husband and found the door wide open, and directly missed the silk and the shute also; I made an alarm, and the first person who came up was Mrs. Patrick, who lives in the bottom room; I found the knife on the ground between eleven and twelve o'clock - it was open; I had seen it in Vine's hands often; I never had it in my hand before, but am positive it is his knife; how it came there I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not several persons come to the room after the alarm? A. Yes; Vine's child had been in the room the night before; he is a gold and silver wire-drawer.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was with McWilliams, and found the buckle - the silk appeared to have been cut out with a knife, as the place they had begun to cut was near the window, which would be very awkward to begin at with shears; I accompanied Neuson to the Feathers public-house, in Austin-street, about half-past eleven o'clock that night, and took Vine in the tap-room; I returned to the room, and the prosecutrix gave me this knife - I went next morning to Blundy's house, and asked if he had been with Vine the night before; he said he had been at the Queen's Head public-house with him; I told him to attend at Worship-street - his father said he should, and he came there; a buckle was missing from his braces - the one found corresponds with the one remaining; there is a piece of old black silk attached to them instead of the buckle - they are common buckles; the braces are old, and might have lost a buckle.</p>

            . On the 27th of October Blundy came to my house to be measured for a pair of shoes, and as be stooped to tie his shoe I heard something crack - he turned up his waistcoat and fastened a bit of silk to the button; he had no buckle on his brace then: these are the braces he wore.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you know that nine or ten days before the robbery his braces wanted a buckle? A. Yes - I know the date, because I took my work home that day, and received 2l. 13s. 5d. for weaving ninety yards of silk; I have master's memorandum of it.</p>

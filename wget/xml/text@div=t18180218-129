I was coming up Holborn on the 23d of January, about ten o'clock at night, and met the prisoner in Holborn; she asked me for something to drink, and called me by my name. I told her I did not know her - I gave her something to drink. I took her and another woman into the Punch-bowl, public-house. I pulled my notes out to pay for it-the other woman then left me. The prisoner persuaded me to go down Newton-street. When we got to Charles-street, the prisoner wanted me to go up a passage, I refused. I took her into another public-house; and gave her more liquor. I pulled my notes out again, and let them fall, the prisoner picked them up, and I put them into my pocket. I came out, and asked the patrol to see me out of the street - the prisoner still went with me. She took me down a passage - We talked together for ten minutes. I felt her put her hand to my pocket, and missed my notes. She ran away, I called out, Stop thief!-the watchman stopped her, he found nothing on her.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was in Newton-street, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor go down Charles-street, a man stood under the wall - I thought he spoke to the prisoner; they went into the Coach and Horses, public-house-the man looked through the window. They came out, and went into Drury-lane, and had half a pint of gin together. In about ten minutes, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house.</p>

            . Last February I lived with him at 26, John-street St. Pancras, in the second floor of the house; we had lived there about three years; my son Robert was about thirteen years old - I remember last Shrove-Tuesday, the 19th of March, I went out that evening about six o'clock, leaving my little boy Robert, at home alive and well; he had hashed mutton and pan-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110049"></xptr>cakes for dinner that day - my husband comes home to supper every night, and Robert was to have boiled the potatoes for my husband's supper; I gave him directions to boil them before I went out at six o'clock - I left them with him to boil; when I left home, at six o'clock, there was no occasion for him to go out for any thing - he had his boots on when I left home; I sent him for the potatoes before I went out; and then he had had tea and bread and butter; I told him, as he had no occasion to go out, to take his boots off, as he should not dirt about the room - I did not tell him to clean them; I parted with him on good terms at six o'clock - he had no apple-pudding that day; he was very regular in his conduct - he was always a good lad, and always had very good advice given him; he had been in a little place, in service in the neighbourhood, and had left it about a month - he was not in the habit of going about the streets at all, with other boys, that I know of; he had a little rabbit in the back yard, which he used to amuse himself with - I went out that night to see a sick friend; I returned, I believe, between eight and nine o'clock - I believe it was after eight, because my daughter was home before me; when I returned the boy was gone - he had not been accustomed to be out so late; he was never allowed to be out at night except when he was at his place - he had a pair of slippers, which were missing; his boots were in the room - I had not seen him take them off; he had robbed the dirt off them in my absence, but not properly cleaned them - he has ran to the door before in his slippers, but has not gone out in them; my daughter arrived at home before me and my husband too; from what I heard when I came back, some search had been made for him in the house, and I went about to make inquiry for him, and my husband and my daughter went; we went in search every where - we walked the streets, and watched the people out of the play-house; we could not tell what to think - we had bills posted up, offering a reward, a few days after; we exerted ourselves every where to find him, but without success. I know a young man named Sparrow; I did not know his name then - on Tuesday, the 26th of February, the week after I lost my son, Sparrow came to me, and brought Marchell with him as his friend; I had seen Sparrow before, at Taylor's, which is next door to me- Marchell was a stranger to me; I did not know Taylor before - I knew he lived at next door, but did not know him; I had seen Sparrow at that house, but did not know his name - I went to that house to make inquiry, but did not see Taylor; when Marchell came to me, he said he had seen the bill at the colour shop, which was Mr. Reeves' - that is the first that I recollect his saying; I understood him to mean Reeves' shop in Chapel-street, where I had placed a bill - he said he had seen the bill, and then he described the child's dress, in every respect, to me, all but the slippers; he said he had seen the child on the Thursday before, at St. Katharine's-docks - I think he described his dress before he said that; he described every thing the child had on when I left home at six o'clock, all but the slippers - he said he had on a very old pair of boots; Mrs. Richardson was with me at the time this took place - Mrs. Richardson said the child was like me; she said, "This is the mother, and the child is like her" - Marchell said "Yes, it was exactly like her, eyes and all;" my eyes are dark, and the boy's eyes were dark - they were described in the bill as dark eyes; he said he saw him at St. Katharine's-docks, loitering about with marine boys, eating a crust of bread; Marchell said that he himself was going off by a ship the next day, and the sooner we began to search after the boy the better - this conversation was between twelve and one o'clock in the day; I went with Mr. Roe to the docks immediately - I do not know that the prisoner went to the docks that day; Roe and I took a cab and went down to the docks, and at the opposite corner as we went, stood Sparrow, Marchell, and Evans - we were going across the road to Tottenham-court-road to get the cab, and saw them standing by a potato warehouse at the corner of John-street, which leads into Chapel-street, leading into Tottenham-court-road; when we got to the docks we made all the inquiry we possibly could, but to no effect, we could learn nothing about him - as we returned from the docks, just before we got to my door, I saw Sparrow going into Taylor's, next door; I put a question to him respecting Marchell, and desired him to do something respecting Marchell; in consequence of that, in about a quarter of an hour, Marchell came to my room (Mr. Roe was still with me) and Roe, in my presence, said to Marchell, "We have met with no success at the docks," that we had been searching there (I cannot exactly recollect his words) - I had made inquiry at the docks about ships going out; Roe told him also that there were no ships going out there, and that there were no marine boys there,(as Marchell had described to me) as going out from there - he put his hand out and said, "The child is there now, he is exactly like your eyes and all;" he pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket, and said he would give us the name of the ship going out - he said the name of the ship was the Hereford; he wrote something on the paper, and tried to write something more, but could not - he said to Mr. Roe, "You write it;" Roe said, "No, you write it, we can read it" - I got up to get a pen, and before I could get the pen

             came in; Marchell, before that, said he had written the name of Hereford on the paper, but I never saw it - and when Ellen came in he put the paper into his pocket and said he would go with Ellen; he and Ellen went out together - they said they were going to the docks; the centre prisoner (looking at him) is Evans - I was looking out of my window the next day, or a few days after the conversation with Marchell, (I do not know which, but it was the same week, I was looking out,) and saw Evans nearly opposite the window of Mrs. Smith, who lives opposite to me - I said nothing to him; I did not know his name at that time - I had seen him, I believe, the day they went to the docks - he was walking about the streets; he was standing opposite there, and Marchell with him, and I believe Sparrow and some other persons - Evans shook his fist at me, and said something which I did not hear, as the window was shut; he was looking up at me - the window was shut, and I was looking through it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. The boy was missed on the 19th? A. Yes; I made great search for him that night and the following day - I described his dress and person; I went to all the Police-stations, and spoke publicly of his loss, describing his dress and person, to know if any body had seen him; I had never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110050"></xptr>seen Marchell before he called; I offered, in a second bill, to reward any one for bringing him home - the sum was not stated; both the bills had been published before the 26th, when Marchell came; my son's slippers were black - they could not be easily mistaken for old boots.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Richardson remarked that your son was like you, Marchell replied, "Yes, eyes and all"? A. Yes, those were his words; I told him I should go down to the docks - I saw him at the corner of the street, where we crossed; I gave him nothing to drink the first time he came - when he called the second time, he was asked to take a glass of wine - he refused; I did not discover the information he gave me about the docks to be correct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q.Where did you see Evans standing? A. In the street opposite our window; several other persons were about - it was about eleven or twelve o'clock, I think, but am not certain, and on the 27th, I think.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. He was standing nearer to Mr. Smith's window than to yours? A. Yes; theirs is an open shop.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN PAVIOUR. I am sister of the deceased. I went home to my father's lodging on the evening of the 19th of February, at ten minutes after eight o'clock - nobody was at home in the lodging at the time; I found the fire burnt hollow in the middle, the candle burnt into the socket, and the wick long, as if the room had been left some time. I saw the body of my brother before the Coroner - it was my brother's body; I know search was made for him, and bills published - I was at home when Marchell came back from the docks.</p>
               <p>GRACE RICHARDSON. I am the wife of Thomas Richardson - we live at No. 26, John-street, on the first floor. I knew the deceased Robert Paviour - I remember the evening on which he was missing; in consequence of what was said to me by his sister

            , I went into their room about ten minutes after eight o'clock - Mrs. Paviour had not returned home at that time; I examined the two rooms in which they lodged, but could not find the deceased; I noticed the fire - it was burnt quite hollow, and a saucepan was on it with potatoes in it; a candle in the room was burnt down into the socket of the candlestick - I should think the fire and candle had been neglected for about an hour - the snuff of the candle, I should think, was nearly two inches long; on the following Tuesday I was in Paviour's room, when Marchell was there - I do not recollect what passed in the room - there was a conversation; I opened the door to Marchell when he came in - I heard what he said at the door; he came in the morning - he said there was a boy of the description lurking about St. Katharine's-docks; I called Mrs. Paviour down to speak to him, and I said the boy was very much like Mrs. Paviour - he said, "Yes, what I could see of the person, he was very much like her;" I told him she was the mother of the boy - and he said, from what he observed of Mrs. Paviour, he was very like her - he said he had a child of his own, and did not know what he should do with her, for he seemed to regret very much the loss - he said he had a little child a year and a half old at home - he seemed to think it was a shocking thing; I was not before the Coroner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. Had you said any thing about the description before he said there was a boy about the docks answering the description? A. No; handbills had been printed, and I considered he alluded to them - he said he had seen a bill in Reeves' window, in Chapel-street - that the boy had not slippers on, but old boots, and was gnawing a hard crust.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Q. Do you know me? A. Yes, by sight; you appeared a hard-working, industrious man - I have observed goods which had been japanned drying at your door.</p>

Taylor was present - Marchell said, "I think I have - I think from what I saw in the bill, the child answers the description, and when I saw the mother of the child, the two countenances struck me forcibly that he was the child;" I said, I hoped it would turn out so, but I had my doubts - he said, "Why do you have your doubts;" I said, I think, when the boy left his home with only slippers, coat and jacket on, I thought he was no more, I thought he had been burked - Marchell said, "You may rest yourself assured, that child is as well and as hearty as you are;" I said, "How do you know that?" he said, "I do" -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110051"></xptr>I said, "Then I hope we shall see the child to-morrow" - he made no answer to that; that was all the conversation I had with him then, but after he had left, I went over again in about half an hour, and said to Taylor, "Do you know any thing of this good man, that has brought this good account" - he said, "Yes, I know him very well, he has come of creditable and respectable parents;" I said, "I hope it will turn out to be all correct, that we shall see the child by to-morrow" - he made me no answer - my house is opposite Taylor's; after the child was missing I observed something unusual about Taylor's premises, but made no observation of that kind before, not till after Marchell brought the intelligence about the child; Marchell, Evans, Taylor, and a man named Sparrow wer repeatedly going to and fro, in and out at Taylor's house, sometimes very much in liquor; they were repeatedly watching my house and me, to see, as I supposed, if I was watching them - this occurred continually till they were in custody. On the Thursday previous to the Inquest, Evans was very much in liquor, and he got sky-larking with a young woman; I saw him dancing about - Mrs. Paviour was at that time at her window - he was holding his fist up, doubled, towards the window - he was leaning against my window, and holding up his fist up to her window, and the other parties were with him, altogether; I could not hear what he said, but I judged from the motion of his lips, that he was saying something - my wife saw and heard what passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. After this poor boy was missing there was great excitement in the neighbourhood? A. Very great; almsot every body was running about making inquiry; I did not see Marchell before the 26th.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw these four men walking up and down watching your house; were there not a great many people walking about, and talking of the occurrence? A. The neighbourhood, at that time, had noticed their proceedings - people were perpetually going to Paviour's, to make inquiries; I saw no drink given away - what was had, I believe, they got at the corner public-house - when Marchell said the child was as safe and as well as we were, he appeared to be sincere, as if he actually meant what he said, as if he actually knew it.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q.At what time of the day did you see Evans holding up his fist? A. About two o'clock; he was intoxicated, and had been dancing on the rails, and sky-larking with my servant just before.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Q.How long have you known me? A.Two or three years; I never knew you any thing but a hard-working industrious man - when I came to your apartment I did not perceive that Marchell was in liquor; I have no recollection of saying he was drunk or foolish, as he went on in an erroneous way; Sparrow is in Taylor's employ, and frequently goes in and out on business.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Were the appearances about Taylor's premises different to what you had seen them before? A. Yes, they would pop out one or two together; I never knew of any business Marchell or Evans had there - I never heard any thing to induce me to believe they had business there; Taylor is a japanner - I understood Evans is a French polisher; I never saw Evans take any work in there, or bring any out.</p>

               <p>SARAH SMITH. I am the wife of Joseph Smith; we live at No. 86, John-street. The Thursday fortnight before the Inquest, (the 7th of March) I observed some men drinking in John-street and Pitt-street - there were five or six men; they were up and down the street all day - two of the prisoners were among them, but not Taylor; I saw Evans dancing upon his heels - he held up his fist at Mrs. Paviour, and said "You are a b - y old bitch, you shall be plagued a little longer" - I did not see Mrs. Paviour at her window, but I saw her open her window a few minutes after, when they were going up the street; Marchell was with Evans when he used these expressions - they returned back again, and went into Taylor's house; I did not observe any particular appearance about Taylor's house at any time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.After the occurrence, was there not people running up and down the street, making inquiry? A. A great many; I did not hear Marchell say any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q.Whether Mrs. Paviour was at her window at this time you do not know? A. No, but she opened it soon after; Evans was very drunk, and had been riotous about the street all day - it was about one o'clock.</p>

On Thursday evening, the 7th of March, I had been out on an errand, and was coming home at ten minutes after six o'clock - as I returned home I saw Taylor and Evans at the step of my door, conversing together; as I entered the door I heard Evans' voice, but could not distinguish what he said - he was addressing himself to Taylor; I heard Taylor answer him "Hold your tongue, the boy is all right, he is safe enough now."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q.Did you hear whether Evans made any answer? A. No, I did not listen; I heard this as I passed.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Q. Did we name any boy? A. No; you had been in and been down to Phillips, and as you came out you made a stop at the door - Phillips lives in the kitchen; I live in the parlour of No. 5.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was Evans drunk A. No, they appeared quite sober; I had let Taylor in twice to go into the kitchen - an old man lived in the kitchen.</p>

             and the prisoner Marchell to St. Katharine's-docks, on Wednesday, the 27th of February; I had some conversation with Marchell on the road - I was asked by Marchell if I thought the money was safe; (the reward of 5l. which was offered;) I told him I thought it was, and if he would cause the boy to be brought back, or bring him back, I would pay the money without any further questions - this was on our road to the docks; he said nothing about the boy at that time - when we proceeded a little further, Sparrow, (who had accompained Marchell,) observed the father, Mr. Paviour, walking behind; he (Sparrow) touched Marchell on the shoulder, and Marchell turned round away from me, and he said something to him which I could not hear - Marchell replied directly, "It is no go;" Marchell came alongside of me again, and we got into conversation about the boy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110052"></xptr>and he said he thought the boy was not taken away for any other purpose but to become heir to some property, or for the use of some of those swells - he told me there was a man in the City who was in the habit of giving money for boys; and he told me about a captain that hung himself at Horsemonger-lane, and said he was one of those sort; he called them hoofe - I have heard of a captain who hung himself, but I do not know whether I had heard it at time; I did not understand what hoofs meant at the time - I now understand it means a person addicted to unnatural propensities; Marchell talked about a place which he had lost through getting intoxicated - and before that, on Tuesday the 26th, I went down to ask him concerning the boy (at Taylor's house,) by Mrs. Pavlour's desire; I went into Taylor's, and asked for Marchell - he was not there; they told me to call again in half an hour, which I did, and he was not there - I went again, saw him, and asked him about the boy, if he had seen him - he said Yes, he had seen him at the docks; (I did not say I had come by Paviour's desire) and he mentioned what part he had seen him; he mentioned some letter, I think it was C, but I will not be positive - I asked him if he could get the boy; he paused a bit, and said, "Yes - no doubt but I can, but I want some one to go with me to the ducks of a spirit;" he said, "I do not want any woman to go crying and sobbing with me;" for there were many creeks and corners he had to go into, that he did like to take a woman with him - he said the mother had given a wrong description of the boy; that she had represented him as having dark eyes, and he had grey eyes and dark eye-browns - I asked him again if he had seen the boy; he said Yes, he had seen him in the docks, and he was there then - I appointed to go with him the next morning, which I did, and have stated, what conversation happened on the road; when we got to the docks, Marchell did not appear to know any thing about the docks - he took me to the place where he said he had seen the boy, inside the docks, on the right-hand; I think the letter was C - he did not appear to know his way into the docks; from his conversation with me, I caused him to be given in custody the same evening, on his return.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.On your way to the docks, did not you converse as to the cause of the boy being taken - gnessing the cause? A. Yes; part of the way; Marchell said nothing about his being carried to the Indies as heir to some property, in my hearing - before we went on the Tuesday evening he said, "I am steward of a ship;" and that he was going out as steward to the Indies, and that the boy was going out with him - I had said nothing about 5l. rewards before this conversation; it was after Marchell made the remak about the reward that I saw Sparrow speak to him, and after that Marchell said it was no go - he appeared to me to know nothing whatever about the docks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Marchell said he was going out as steward to the Indies and the boy with him, did he name the ship? A. Yes, it was the Hereford; and he said we had better pursue the inquiry, for he was going out very shortly.</p>

            . I live at No. 64, Molyneux-street; I lodge there with my father. I heard of the boy being missed about a week after he was missing - I had not seen Merchell until I came into Mrs. Paviour's room, to go down to the docks with him; I am acquainted with Mrs. Paviour - I went to her house on the Tuesday afternoon, in consequence of her message; I have been to sea, and have not been home long - when I got to Paviour's Marchell was there; he was writing something down on a piece of paper - I did not observe what he wrote; when I came in Mrs. Paviour said, "This is the young man who is going to the docks with you;" (meaning me) - Marchell agreed to go with me; Wiggens came in a little afterwards - we left the room together, and got down stairs to the door before Marchell said any thing; he turned into Mr. Taylor's, at the next door - he came out, called me inot Taylor's, and said he could not go to the docks without 2s. 6d. in his pocket, 15d. each, to spend; Taylor was present - I told him I had got no money at all; he had said nothing about money before, in my presence - Taylor kept at his work, and said very little; Marchell was lighting his pipe over Taylor's fire - (he had sat down as if he would not go at all) and while lighting his pipe at the fire, he made a reply, and said he would make 2l. of the boy yet; he said so to Taylor - Taylor said Hush! as much as to say there was somebody in the room to hear him - I had not, heard Taylor say any thing till Marchell spoke about the 2l., and then he said, "You are talking too fast;" Marchell asked Taylor what he thought, whether it would be best to take the 5l., or to take the boy to Plymouth, and write a letter home to his mother to let her know the boy was safe - I then asked Marchell whether he thought it was of any use my going to the docks; Taylor made a reply, and said, "Perhaps the boy is gone to hell or Halifax by this time;" I then went back, and went into Mrs. Paviour's again - neither I nor Marchell went to the docks that day; I agreed with Marchell, before I left, to go with him to the docks at nine o'clock next morning; next morning Wiggens and Sparrow accompanied us to the docks, and the father followed on behind at a distance; Marchell began a conversation of his own accord, by saying there was a gentleman who gave a great deal of money for boys - that the gentleman lived somewhere in Horsemonger-lane; he said he was a captain - he said, there was a gentleman in the City, too, that was one of, these poofs, as he called them - neither I nor Wiggens had said any thing to him to lead to these observations; I never heard the word poofs before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.When you went into Taylor's house did you enter into conversation about the boy directly? A.I only asked if he was going to the docks with me; I said if he had seen such a boy, to go to the docks with me to find him.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.When you went to the docks did you inquire for the Hereford? A. Yes; there was no such a ship in the docks, nor was there water for her to come up the river; there was a ship of that name laying at Black wall - she had been home from China about a fortnight; a vessel usually lays in port two or three months.</p>

               <p>MR. WALESBY. Q.When you agreed to accompany Marchell to the docks, had you said any thing about a reward? A. No; he asked Taylor if it was best to have the 5l. &amp;c. - I had said nothing about a reward for the boy, nor heard any thing said, more than the cause of the boy being taken away: one suggested one cause and ano<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110053"></xptr>ther another - I do not recollect whether he mentioned about the captain as killing himself in Horsemonger-lane or living there; I never heard the expression hell or Halifax before.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Q.Did not Marchell treat you with a share of a pot or two of beer at my premises? A. Yes, and a pipe; I was not there an hour altogether.</p>
               <p>Q.When he talked about the boy, did I not say,"Don't talk too fast, but say nothing but the truth, because you are hurting the parents' feelings?" A. I heard you say something of that sort - when I think of it, you did say so; Marchell said he would go with me to the docks in the morning.</p>

            . I am the father of the deceased. Marchell and others went to the docks - I followed after them; I heard nothing of the conversation as they went along - when I got to the docks I inquired for the Hereford; there was no such ship there; she was laying at Blackwall - Marchell was quite a strangee to the docks; he knew nothing about them.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BUNDAY. I live at No. 17, Shouldham-street, Bryanstone-square - I formerly lived at Hampstead; I was in the service of Mr. Keys, of Oxford-street, at that time. On Saturday, the 23rd of February, I was accompanied by my wife, going towards Hampstead, between seven and eight o'clock; I know the bridge over the canal, near the York and Albany public-house - it was in our way to cross that bridge; it is at the end of Albany-street, Hampstead-road - when we came near the bridge, I observed one man between the public-house and the bridge; the public-house is about twenty yards from the bridge - as I passed over the bridge, I observed two men on the right-hand side of the bridge, about fifteen yards from where I had seen the one man (I cannot recollect whether the man who was between the bridge and public-house, was moving or standing still); there is a parapat to the bridge; they were leaning forwards, looking towards the water - they had a largeish parcel between them; I did not particularly notice the size - they both appeared to have it between them, and it was resting, I think, on the parapet; they were standing before it, and I thought were endeavouring to conceal it from us as we passed; any thing large might have been in the parcel - I cannot tell whether it, would contain a child of thirteen years old; it was not a basket, it appeared like canvas - as I crossed the bridge, one of the men said, "Here is some one coming;" I did not take notice of the man, who I had passed before I came to the bridge - the observation made me look at the two men, but I took but little notice of them; my wife made some observations to me which I answered, and proceeded, over the bridge towards Oxford-street, and when, we had got twelve or fifteen paces from the bridge I heard a splash in the water - it must have been caused by something large being thrown in; the noise was considerable - I consider Marchell and Taylor about the size of the men I saw on the bridge - I cannot say whether the man, who was about fifteen paces from the bridge, was taller or shorter than the two on the bridge.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On Saturday, the 28rd of February, I was going over the bridge with him, near the York and Albany, between seven and eight o'clock; I saw two men on the bridge - I had seen one man before we came to the bridge, and two on the bridge; the two outside prisoners are like the men on the bridge; they are the figure and size of the men on the bridge; I did not observe the man in the road - the men on the bridge were leaning forwards, with their faces towards the water, and they had a largeish bundle resting on the wall of the bridge - it was something dark, but what I cannot say - it appeared more like canvas than any thing else; I heard one of them say, "Here is somebody coming," and the reply was, "It is only a boy" - it was a dark night; I and my husband, passed on - I made an observation to my husband, and he made an answer; I thought they were throwing something in which was not right; I heard the splash of water, which must have been caused by something of considerable size being thrown in, for we were at some distance when we heard the splash; I should think the parcel was large enough to contain a thing of considerable size - I cannot say it was large enough for a child - a child might be put into it; I think it was big enough for a child ten or twelve years old.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.You were not near enough to see either of the men's faces? A. No; they were about the prisoners' size and figure, and were dressed like them, when I saw them - they both had dark clothes - the tallest had a frock-coat on, I am certain.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.When you say their dress was like the men when you saw them, where do you means? A. I saw them before the Justice - they then had clothes on like those worn by the men on the bridge.</p>

             when he was alive; I saw him the night before he was missed, but not that night - I was with him the night before Shrove - Tuesday, in John-street, and I think Taylor is the same gentleman that came up to Paviour - the man came out of Mr. Taylor's house - I had never seen Taylor but once before in my life; he lived at No. 27, next door to Mr. Paviour; I was on the other side of the way, coming home with my mother's bread, and saw the man come out of Taylor's house, and speaking to Paviour's boy - the person did not seen very pleased; I did not hear what he said; I saw Paviour's boy, as I was coming through Pitt - street, peeping through the key-hole of Taylor's door - the person came out about five minutes after that; I think the prisoner in the brown coat is the man that came out, but cannot say for certainty; the man held his hands, as much as to say "I will do something to you" warning him (holding his finger up) - I heard no words pass between them at all.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Q.Was it an older man than me? because a schoolmaster lives up stairs? A.He was about your height, and in the same kind of dress; he did not touch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110054"></xptr>the boy - I saw the boy peeping through the street door, which was shut.</p>
               <p>DANIEL WILLIAMS re-examined. On Monday morning, the 11th of March, I found in the canal the body of a boy, about twelve or thirteen years old; he had on a pair of speckled trousers, (pepper and salt or worsted,) a blue jacket buttoned close round, and no shoes nor slippers - he had stockings on, but no hat; I sent for the Police, and found both his arms were broken - I delivered the body to a Policeman, who is not here; I did not see the body before the Coroner - I should know the clothes again; by water the distance from the York and Albany public-house to where I found it is little short of half a mile, coming round by the water; there are no locks between the York and Albany and that spot - there may be some little shallows, but very little; the water is generally five feet deep about there - the barges draw about four feet of water there; the body coming in contance with a barge might drive it some distance - barges frequently pass up and down the canal; there is no raised water there - there is more draft of water where I found the body than at the York and Albany; the water runs both ways - the water would drift the body from the bridge towards where it was found.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FOREMAN. I keep a coal-wharf. I found a cap in Regent's-canal, the latter end of February - I do not know the date - I carried it home, dried it, and gave it to my mother - Keys, the constable, has it - I gave it to him; I found it between the top lock, and the first bridge going to Chalk-farm, facing the York and Albany, nearly.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS KEYS. I am a constable of St. Pancras, From information I received, on Monday, the 11th of March, I took possession of these clothes, which I got from the body of the deceased boy Paviour, which was produced before the Counter.</p>
               <p>DANIEL WILLIAMS. These are the clothes the boy had on - I know them very well by their appearance - the trousers were buttoned on; I only saw the jacket,  waistcoat and trousers.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS KEYS. I received a cap from Foreman, which I now produce; there is marks of blood on the back of the collar of this shirt, and on the hind part of the shirt tail, there is marks of blood just at the seat; the cap-lining had a mark of blood, and outside the cap there was the appearance of a blow - the cap is made of green cloth, and the nap appears to have received a sharp hit - and from the shape of the cap. and the lining, I should think the blow had been given on the forehead - and the blood in the lining comes just about the place where the appearance of the blow outside is; I saw the person of the boy before the clothes were taken off, about two hours or an hour and a half after it was taken out of the water; they were wringing wet, and had evidently come from the water - I saw it at the York and Albany public-house, in the morning, at half-past nine o'clock.</p>

I did not see the body afterwards at the York and Albany; I took no other body out of the water that day - I gave it to the Policeman and two men - they are not here, the Policeman has left the service; I took it out of the water about nine o'clock in the morning, and sent a person for the Policeman, who got two persons to take it to the tavern.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Union-terrace, Camden-town. On Monday, the 11th of March, I was fetched to the York and Albany, public-house, about two o'clock, and saw the dead body of the boy - the clothes were then on his person; after they were removed I examined the body, and took notes of the examination; I conclude the fracture of the right arm had been effected before the blood had ceased to flow - that is not many minutes after death - the other might have been about the same period; a violent blow had been given on the right side of the head, and I should say it could not be given long after death, at any rate - it must have been inflicted while the blood was flowing, as there was extravasation - it was on the side of the head; I did not perceive much mark of a bruise; judging from the external and internal appearance, I should say decidedly, that the blow on the side of the head, if given during life, would have caused death; there were some indications of drowning, but I would not say they could not be caused by a blow, or apoplexy - there was no decided appearance of suffocation.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you conclude, that either from the blow on the head, or that, and the drowning, the child had died? A.Certainly - I think the fracture of the arm could not be inflicted by a barge passing over the body in the water, as the bottom of the canal is very soft, and if it was done after the body was in the water, it must have been only a few minutes after; I should say the body had been in the water about a week, or it might be a fortnight - it certainly was not very recent; the eyelids were closed, which is not usual in cases of drowing, but that is not conclusive.</p>
               <p>The witness read his notes, containing a detailed account of the post mortem examination, strongly stating particulars indicative of an abominable offence having been committed on the person of the child; which the witness stated must have been done not later than a day or two before death.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BURROWS, ESQ. M. D. I am a physician, and live at No. 42, Mortimer-street, Cavendish-square. On the Friday after the Inquest I examined the body - I think it was on the 15th of March; Mr. Curtis had seen it before me, and he was with me at that time - I have heard Mr. Curtis' evidence; I concur with him in the external appearance, but he examined the internal appearances before me, and of course they were displaced before I commenced my examination - I do not know so much about them; I examined the hinder part of the boy very minutely, and suggested that they should be removed from the body for more minute examination - it is my opinion, from the appearance I saw about the fundament externally, and the gut internally, that some violence had been done to that part of the body previous to death - I observed the fractures of the arms, about the right arm there was the mark of a bruise, nearly the size of half-a-crown, and a considerable discolouring; and it was of that nature which I believe could not have been made after death; or if so it must have been while the blood was in circulation in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110055"></xptr>smaller vessels; it could not have been made after the heart ceased to bleed - we divided the skin off the head, and, as far as I could judge, the appearance corresponded with what Mr. Curtis stated - I think the boy must have received a blow on the head, which stunned him, or probably killed him, and subsequently to that the arms were broken, but whether he was immediately afterwards thrown into the water there is nothing to enable me to say - the blow was quite sufficient to have stunned him and produce death, but I cannot say he might not have recovered from it - nothing that I saw or have heard detailed, except these two causes, can account for his death.</p>
               <p>ROBERT PAVIOUR. I saw the body before the Coroner - it was my son Robert's body: I first saw the body about four o'clock in the afternoon of the 11th - the clothes were on then, it was my son's body.</p>

             KENT. I am Marchell's landlady, and live at No. 5. Warren-street, Fitzroy-square; my husband is a shoe-maker. Marchell came to me last October, and he was lodging with me on the 19th of February; he was at my house on the 19th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening - he could not go out after that without my knowledge; he came in between six and seven o'clock - he did not go out before eleven, which was the time I retired; I recollect this by a funeral which he told me of on the Sunday before - his wife and him came to lodge with me together, in October; he has one child.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Was he acquainted with Taylor? A. I believe not before the funeral - it was Taylor's wife's funeral; I believe he became acquainted with him by going to his wife's funeral to assist; he told me he was to have 2s. 6d. for carrying the corpse, and when he got there he was too short - I never saw Taylor at my house; I believe Marchell is supported by his wife - she had money when she left her situation, as housekeeper, to a gentleman in Hanover-square; he was never out later than ten or eleven o'clock - I heard of the Inquest, but was not told to attend: I was first asked to be a witness the week before last - Keys called at my house after Marchell was in custody, and asked if I could tell where he was on the night of the 19th of February; I said, I could not tell - he came abruptly to me - but when I recollected the funeral I remembered it was on the Tuesday following - Keys called six, seven, or eight times.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not tell him, on every occaion, that you could not tell about his being at home? A.He only asked me about that the first time, when he took Marchell - I told him, when he called afterwards, that I recollected he was at home; he often went into Marchell's apartment without speaking to me; my husband was not at the home on the 19th, he was out of town - I am not obliged to say where, it is not a fair question; he was in the Marshalsea prison - I had three lodgers besides Marchell; I cannot say whether any of them were at home that night, but Marchell's apartments joined mine; and he never had a key - I went to bed about eleven o'clock; I have not told an untruth by saying my husband was out of town - for the Marshalsea is not in town.</p>
               <p>Q.Has not Keys repeatedly asked you where Marchell was on the night of the 19th, and have you not as frequently told him you could not tell? A. I do not know that he ever asked me more than once or twice; I was flurried when he came to apprehend Marchell.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I went to that gentleman's house in the morning to look for an acquaintance, the woman was there drinking, and asked me if I would drink part of a pint of purl, she said with all my heart, the gentleman would not give her a glass of brandy.</p>
               <p>To Jones. Is that true? - It is true I would not serve her, but that was in the morning; she had rather more liquor than she should have, they were squabbling about an apron.</p>

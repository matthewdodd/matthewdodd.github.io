As my Lord Mayor was coming by the corner there was a stoppage that I could not get along. (I was going to Fleet-street.) The prisoner was facing me. I observed he was looking at what he could get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070032"></xptr> instead of looking at the people as they came by. He snatched hold of my watch chain and got my watch out; I got hold of his arm, and said, D - n you, you rascal, you have got my watch; I clapped my hand behind him, intending to get hold of my watch: some of his confederates behind him, I imagine, took it. It was gone: then he opened his bosom, and said, Search me. I took him by the collar and drawed him down towards the Old Bailey, and called constable, but could get none. I took him to Bridewell. There was a woman that appeared before my Lord Mayor when we were there, that swore she saw the prisoner draw my watch out of my pocket. I went to her last Friday, there were two Jews, who, I imagine, have inviegled her not to appear. (The prisoner is a Jew.) I had looked at my watch coming along Cheapside, but a few minutes before.</p>

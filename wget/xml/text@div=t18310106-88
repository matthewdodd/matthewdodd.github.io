            . I live at Twickenham. I was sent to Mrs. Steers in September last; she lodged at Mrs. Feaney's - one day there was high words between me and mistress about a pennyworth of wood; it is three months ago or more - I do not know the month; it was about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon - a brick was chucked in at the window three times; I did not see by whom the first was thrown - the prisoner threw the second, and he was on the tiles; the brick was chucked on the landing-place, and I believe little bits of the mortar came into the room where I and mistress were - after that Mrs. Feaney closed the landing window; mistress was sitting.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060043"></xptr>by the fire-side - she had the rheumatism in her knee, and was eighty-one years old; only a little mortar came into the room - I did not perceive that she was alarmed; I was very much frightened when the first was thrown in, but mistress did not seem frightened - I afterwards sat down to work by the window; in about a quarter of an hour somebody came up with a sheet over his head; he came to the room door with a kind of stick in his hand, but I did not see it; he had something under the sheet pointing towards mistress and me - he did not stay there many minutes; he never entered the room, only stood outside the door, which was open - he went away without saying or doing any thing; it went away - some time after that the prisoner brought a chopper across his shoulder, and said he had found it behind the water-butt - he supposed it was to break the door open to cut her head off; he did not say he was going to do it - he did not go near her with it; he went out in a few minutes without saying any thing more - he came up again in a quarter of an hour, and said somebody had taken his hat away; he had not got the chopper then - mistress then said, "Gillett, you should not lose that if I had money to buy you another;" mistress sent me out for a quartern of gin among five of us - I cannot say whether I left him in the room, for I was so frightened at the person in the sheet; the old lady joked afterwards about it, and did not seem frightened - the prisoner asked her what was the matter; she told him somebody had come to frighten her - when somebody came on the landing-place in the sheet, she said to me,"Martha, what is that?"</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation between her and the prisoner about a person coming up with a pistol? A. Not in my hearing; I was so frightened I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you frightened on the 11th of December, when before the Coroner? A. Yes; she had died that morning, which was three months after this happened; somebody held something up like a sword-stick under the sheet, and it made a snapping noise; mistress said it was a pistol - I said it was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe after this was over about the sheet, the prisoner sat down and took some gin with your mistress? A. Yes; we were all on good terms; she never brought up about the sheet afterwards - she was joking, and in as good humour as ever she was; she had been confined to her room twelve months; no medical man attended her before she died - her spirits were as usual, after this happened; she moved from the fire-place to the window with a stick -I attended her till she died, and did not observe her in more pain after this, than before.</p>

            . The deceased was my mother. This transaction happened on a Thursday, and on the Sunday following, I sent her a hot dinner as usual, and she sent for me - I went, and found her very poorly; she said she had a violent pain in her back and stomach - she was hearty and in health before, and had not complained, except of the rheumatsm in her knee - on the Sunday following-she got so much worse I bound her up very tight, her back was in much pain - she died on the 9th of December; she said she should like to have the Clergyman, she was sure she should never get over it - I offered to sead for a doctor, but she would not have one.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I have known the deceased six or seven years - I saw her about five months before her death, that was before this transaction - I did not see her again till about eight days after her death, when I was desired to see her body - I examined it externally, but could form no judgment of the cause of her death.</p>

After some discourse, they both went out, and about ten minutes after the prisoner came and knocked at the door, which my little brother opened; she said, she came to stay till my mother came in, and asked how long she would be; I said, not long; she went towards the drawers, and took off her bonnet, and said she would put her cap on; she came towards the fire-place, and scraped her feet on the stove; I was reading, and heard her jingling the glass that stood on the mantle-piece, with one spoon in it; she asked what my mother drank; said, nothing particular; she told me to get a bottle, and she would fetch something against she came in; I gave her a bottle, with which she went out, and never returned; the other two spoons were on the drawers; I was frightened, and did not observe they were gone.</p>

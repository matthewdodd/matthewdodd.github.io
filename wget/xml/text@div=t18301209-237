On the 9th of December this hearth-rug was taken from the further end of the shop- I saw it safe half a minute before, but did not see it taken; I sent my boy one way, and I went the other - it was about five o'clock in the afternoon, and about eight I found it at a pawnbroker's in Old-street-road; while I was in the shop, claiming it, the prisoner came in to pawn a carpet - the pawnbroker said he was the lad who had pawned my rug.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Burgess, a pawnbroker, in Old-street-road. The prisoner pawned the rug at near eight o'clock last Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please your worship, it was six o'clock when I took the rug.</p>
               <p>Witness. I think it was about eight - I lent him 5s. on it; he said he brought it from his sister, and gave me the direction, No. 4, Bath-street, in the name of

             he came again while the prosecutor was there, to pawn a carpet, which has not been claimed; I think he brought the rug later than six o'clock - it was near eight that he came the second time.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along Kingsland-road, at a quarter before six o'clock, and met a man, who gave me the rug to pawn at Miller's for 6s. - I thought he said 3s., which I asked; but when I went to him and gave him the 3s., he said I was to have had 6s. - he went with me to get it out again, and sent me to Burgess'; they would only lend 5s. - I came out and gave the man the ticket and money; he then sent me to pawn the carpet - the prosecutor said the rug bad a string tied to it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BIRD. There was a string tied round it when the prisoner brought it - the carpet is now at our shop.</p>

               <p>gave him shute at different times, amounting to four pounds four ounces—he returned a portion of the work, but leaving a deficiency of two pounds thirteen ounces and a half of shute, and a portion of the warp—he absconded, and had taken away the machine—I traced him to two or three places, and he was gone—at last the policeman found the machine—I saw it in Wilkes-street, in an empty house—there was no person there—it was worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the silk about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., besides the money that was overdrawn—I have no evidence that the prisoner carried away the machine, or the materials.</p>

He came about Jan., 1845—my father gave him warning to leave, because he paid no rent—they gave up the key to the rent-gatherer—when we went to the room we saw the machine—we kept the machine there a little while—the prisoner's wife came to my father, and he would not give it up, because it did not belong to them—we got sergeant Teakle, and he found who it belonged to—it was not removed till sergeant Teakle took it away.</p>

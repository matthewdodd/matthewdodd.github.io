                  </hi>. I live with my parents at 1, Little Skinner Street, East Lane, Walworth—on the 4th December, as I was going along, the prisoner said to me, "Boy, do you want to earn a penny?"—I said "Yes"—he gave me a five-shilling piece and told me to go into the German baker's and get him two half-quarterns of bread, one stale and one new, and he would give me a penny—I went into the shop—the boy gave me the crown back, and I went out along with the baker and pointed out the prisoner to him.</p>

I manage the baker's shop—the last witness came in about seven in the evening on the 4th December, and gave me a crown—I tried it and broke it, and gave it to the boy, and went out with him—I saw the prisoner just opposite, and the boy said, "That is the man that gave me the money"—I asked the prisoner if he gave the boy the money—he said no, he did not—the boy had it in his hands, and the prisoner tried to get it away from him—I took possession—he tried to get it away—a constable passed, and I followed and gave him in custody—I gave the crown to the constable.</p>

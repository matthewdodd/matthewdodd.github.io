                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and live at No. 47, Oxford-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone. On the evening of the 26th of Nov., about six o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked me the price of a good watch—(my shop was lighted up)—I took one out of the win<lb></lb>dow, marked 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—he was outside the counter, and I was inside—he said he should like to see one at about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I turned to the window again, and took one out, marked seven guineas—that was about the price of it—I said I supposed that was too expensive—I laid it on the counter before him—he took it up—I then turned to take another out, and he immedi<lb></lb>ately ran out of the shop, with the seven guinea watch in his hand—I immediately cried out, "Shop," as there was no one in the shop at the time, and followed him—he ran across Oxford-street, into Chapel-street, from thence into Litchfield-street, and into Dean-street, where he was taken by Beadnell—he threw the watch down in the street—it was picked up, and put into my hands—I am sure the prisoner is the man that was in the shop, and that ran away with the watch—I was close to him—I could touch him and the watch too.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. In consequence of what Mrs. Green told me, on the 1st of October, I went to the Green Man, and saw the prisoner in the tap-room, smoking his pipe, between eleven and twelve o'clock; I told him I took him on suspicion of stealing a basket of elder-berries, which he denied, and said he was willing to go with me - I took him to the watch-house, and he there said he had no lodging, but slept in the bay-lost at the Green Man; I went there, and under the hay found this basket, with a few berries in it.(Basket produced and sworn to.)</p>

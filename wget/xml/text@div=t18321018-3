On Monday, the 17th of September, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I went out, leaving the house fast; I shout the door as usual, and locked it; I have a back door, but there is no ground belonging to me behind the house - the back door was bolted inside; all the windows were shut down; the front window shutters were shut - it has been a shop - the up stair back window was nailed down; half of the sash of the ground floor back window is without glass - I had fixed some wood against it; part of the wood was nailed, and part laid against it - nobody could get in without pushing it aside by violence; the house was being repaired, and I nailed a lime sieve against the window, and the wood against it was two new door frames, without the pannels: the upper half of the sash was glazed all but one pane, which was broken, and the lower sash had no glass - any person could put a hand through to unfasten it, with a deal of trouble - the sieve was nailed inside against the window frames; when I went out in the afternoon I looked in at the prisoner's door - she asked how I did; I said I was very ill, that I was going out, and should return about nine o'clock- she said I should have a light when I returned, as usual, and if she was out I should have it from her children; I returned about nine, and her eldest daughter gave me a light - I unlocked my door without any difficulty; I went into the prisoner's house, and saw her - she told me she had found my door open about eight o'clock; that she walked into the house, and called me at the foot of the stairs, but no answer was made, and she went out, and shut the door - I said, "Why did you call me? you knew I was out;" I do not recollect her answer; I went into my house, and shut the door; it has a spring lock - I did not miss any thing just then; but I undressed between eleven and twelve o'clock, and went to bed - I had left my bonnet on the back of a chair, which I do not usually do; I got out of bed, to put my bonnet on a petticoat; I missed the petticoat - I had left it there when I went out - I missed a black silk dress, which was inside the petticoat, and it also contained a parasol - there was a clasp fixed to the waist of the dress, and a shawl was folded with the dress; the shawl and dress were folded up, and placed within the petticoat - I searched over the house, and found they were gone; I dressed myself, and went to Mrs. Hall's window; I tapped at her window repeatedly, and then she answered me - I told her to dress, and come in, as I wished to speak to her particularly - she came in, and I told her of my loss, took her up stairs, and showed her where the things were taken from, and when I came down with her, I said, "Look at that window, they have forced away the wood;" one of the door frames was drawn on one side, the sieve taken away, and thrown to the left of the window - she said, they had better take my life at once than murder me by inches - I asked her to go with me to the station-house; she said it was very late - I said I was determined the Police should have information of it; she went with me -I told my story there, and returned with her - I did not suspect her - I went to bed, and next morning asked her if any of the Police had left a message for me at her house - she said they had left none; I said I would not be put upon, I had been robbed before, and was determined to persevere, and recover these articles, and if she could find them by questioning any of the children in the neighbourhood if they had seen any body open the door, I should be obliged to her; on the Sunday morning after the robbery (the 23rd) about ten o'clock, she brought me the petticoat, containing the parasol and shawl - she said some boys had brought them to her, and that the black silk dress would be returned on the Monday morning - I understood her to say the boy said so - she said she had given the boy 1s. 1d. for what he had brought; I have the shawl, parasol, and petticoat here - I am sure they are mine; I have seen the clusp in possesion of a witness, and the dress in possession of a pawnbroker - they are worth 20s.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 25th of September, I went to the prisoner's house, about nine o'clock - she was not at home; I believe she has only apartments there - I remained about the spot till about three o'clock in the morning; she then came home; I told her there was a charge of felony against her, and I must take her into custody - she said, "Good God! where is Mrs. Neal?" I had not told her on whose charge I took her - I never knew the prosecutrix by the name of Neal; I did not know the prosecutrix: I told her she was in bed, and she must accompany me to the station-house; and as we went along I thought I heard a piece of paper being crumpled up in her hand; this was about thirty yards from the station-house, and when we got there I asked if she had any thing in her hand; she said she had not - I told her she had thrown some paper away then on the road; she denied it - she had a white handkerchief in her hand, and had let it fall, all but one corner, as she went along; I took a lamp, went to the spot where I thought I heard the paper crumple, and there found two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180006"></xptr>pieces of a duplicate, which I produce - they were at the corner of two streets; this was about three o'clock in the morning - I saw, in the possession of Soper, the serjeant, two other pieces of a duplicate, corresponding with what I found - I searched the prisoner's room about half-past four o'clock that morning, and found in a small box a clasp, wrapped in paper: the box was under a show-board, under the window, inside the house; there was an unfinished house near the corner of the street where I found the pieces of the duplicate.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have known Mrs. Cunningham ever since August - having been robbed several times, she always told me when she went out to look at her door; a friend called that evening, and sat in my parlour about two hours - before Cunningham came home my little girl ran in, and said, "Mother, is Mrs. Cunningham come home?" I said to my friend" I don't know;" she said her door was wide open; I said, "What a shame - they are always playing her some tricks;" I directly went into the passage, and called Mrs. Cunningham! no answer was made; I shut the door, and came home - when she came home I asked if she had shut her door; she said Yes - I said I had found it open; she asked why I did not make a report of it, but I had not the presence of mind to do so - she knocked at my window at twelve o'clock; I went with her to the station, and next day she said she would reward any body to find it out for her - I asked if she liked to put a bill in the window; she said No, but if I made inquiry, and told the party she would not bring them to trial, she might recover the property, and said, "If you can find it out, recompense them; I don't care what you give;" a boy came one morning, and asked if there was not something lost and a reward offered; I said "Stop a bit" - he said he could not stop, that somebody wanted to speak to me at the corner of Catherine-street; I went there, and a young lad said, "Have not you lost something?" I said No, but I knew who had; he asked what were the articles - I told him, and said, "If you can tell where they are, let me know;" he asked if there was not 5s. reward - I said I did not know what it was; I gave the little boy a penny to go with me - the boy said he would send the things to me, which was done, and I gave the boy 1s.; I took them to Mrs. Cunningham, and said the boy would bring the other articles on Monday - I did not know what the articles were till the parcel was opened; the gown was not brought on Monday, and in the evening Mrs. Cunningham came and asked me to go and make inquiry for it - I went out, and saw the little boy who first came, and asked him about them in Bell-street - I was going to spend the evening with my landlord, and did not come home till late; I took the duplicate, and kept it till I came home, but was not so late as the Policeman says - he said there was a charge of felony against me; I asked what for - he said Mrs. Neal's: I said,"Where is she? can I see her?" he said No, I could not; I found my eldest girl at the station-house, and having the ticket in my hand, my fright was so great I did not know what to do, and tore the ticket; I did every thing to serve Mrs. Neal.</p>

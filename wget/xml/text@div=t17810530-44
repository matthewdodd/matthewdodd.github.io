On the 4th of May, about eight in the morning, I had occasion to go down into the kitchen; when I had been there about three minutes, I thought I heard some person in the shop. I immediately ran up stairs, and missed this piece of cloth from off the counter; it lay on the counter when I went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Did you leave any person in the shop? - No. I found the door wide open; it was shut when I went down: I went to the door, and saw the prisoner, with the cloth on his shoulder; he turned round, and saw me at the door; then he threw the cloth down, and ran away: I called out, Stop thief! and ran after him, and overtook him a little way up Bedford-street: I never lost sight of him. I seized him, and brought him back. My master came down, and we took the prisoner to Bow-street Office; and he was committed.</p>
               <p>What did the cloth contain? - Twenty-eight yards: it is of the value of 10 l.</p>
               <p>(The Cloth was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Ormond-yard, Lamb's Conduit-street—I know the prisoner—her mother lodged in the same house with me—on 20th Feb., about four o'clock in the afternoon, I received information that the prisoner had gone down stairs with a cup and paper, containing what was considered to be poison—I went down into the kitchen, and found her sitting at the bottom of the stairs—she did not appear particularly stupified—she had a portion of something in her mouth—we wiped out as much of it as we could—I found a paper on the stones, and a broken teacup, which she had thrown out of her hand as my wife came down—I examined the paper, and found "sugar of lead," written on it—there was a white substance in it, similar to salts—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I left her in the care of my wife—I found a sediment at the bottom of the cup—the prisoner said she had done it—I went to Mr. White, the parish doctor—he refused to attend, but gave me an emetic for her—he is not here—I received orders from the Grand Jury to tell him to attend—I went to him twice, and my wife went once—he said he had no busi<lb></lb>ness in the case, and would not attend—he is till the parish doctor, and lives in Lamb's-conduit-street, about 150 yards from where the prisoner was—he knew what she had taken—he desired me to give her the emetic, and to send her to the hospital, as he should not attend—the prisoner took the emetic—it took effect—there was a portion thrown from the stomach like what was con<lb></lb>tained in the paper—she was taken to the hospital—I have known her three years—she is single, and is an industrious hard-working woman—she has been out of work some time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 74.)

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Yard, a chemist, in Lamb's Conduit-street. On the 20th of Feb., between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop and asked for a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of sugar of lead, as she wanted to make goullard-water, which is used as a lotion—it weighed half an ounce—that is quite sufficient to destroy life—it is never sold as medicine—it is occasionally administered in prescriptions in very small quantities, but not for parties to take by themselves—in the pharmacopoeia we are ordered not to give more than two grains, but the prisoner said she wanted it for a scald for her leg—I wrote sugar of lead on the paper—this is the paper, here are five or six grains in it now—the effects of it are a violent burning of the throat, and probably inflammation—it operates as a poison by producing in<lb></lb>flammation in the stomach and intestines, attended with acute pain, unless very soon discharged—the prisoner was apparently quite sober—she gave satisfactory answers to all the questions put to her—Mr. Yard and two assistants were in the shop—we told her it was poison—she paid 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it.</p>
               <p>

I went to Deptford, tied the Prisoner's arms, paid the reckoning, and came away, and paid ten shillings for a landau to bring him to London.</p>

            . On the fourth of June in the afternoon I took out my horse for a ride, and about the middle of Deptford town I saw two fellows at an alehouse door with some fowls, and hearing Mr. Johnson had lost some the day before, I asked them what they had got there; they said fowls, but their master was not there, and they could not sell them; they were to carry them to the Boot and Crown at Deptford, and he was to come there to them. I went there and enquired for a constable, but there was none to be had there, so we got one at Greenwich. I told the men I believed their master had stole the fowls: at last the Prisoner came, and I took care they should not give him any item to get away. The Prisoner came into the house very boldly, and I asked him if he had any thing to sell; he said, yes, he had got some fowls. I asked him if they were his fowls; he said, yes. I had not patience to stand talking with him much, and I said if he did not give a good account how he came by them, I would charge a constable with him, which I did. There were six dozen and two of the fowls left, and I desired the constable to take care of the Prisoner and them till I rode to London. I went to Mr. Johnson's, and acquainted him with it; and when he came to Deptford I shewed him the prisoner, and he said that was the man; and Mr. Johnson hired a landau, and brought him to London. <rs id="t17450710-14-verdict80" type="verdictDescription">

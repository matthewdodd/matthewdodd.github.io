                  </hi> I live at 15, Stanley Buildings, St. Pancras, and am a steam-engine erector—the prisoner works in the same shop—on 9th August I went to tea with him at his house at the cattle market—his child began to cry, which annoyed him, and Mrs. Lowe said, "What can I do with it? I have no peace in doors, and if I put them outside the superin<lb></lb>tendent canes them in again"—I asked him if he allowed any one to cane his children, and said, "I should suffer no man to cane any child of mine"—he said that he supposed I had come there to take his wife's part, and said, "I suppose she has been a wh— to you"—I said, "George, if you think so, I will go"—he said, "So you may"—Mrs. Lowe said, "Do not go, Mr. Hood, my life is in danger;" he made a rush at his wife, took her by the shoulder, put her out of doors, locked the door, and got this carving knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>. and made an attack on me with it—my right hand was cut, and I then took the knife from him, and he attacked me with this carving fork and stabbed me in the ear and on the face with it—he then attacked me with this other knife, but did not hurt me with that—I demanded to get out several times, and at last forced the door with the tongs, when I got out he made a rush at me and struck me on the left breast—I thought it was with his fist, and knocked him down, and as he fell I saw that he was holding this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>.; it bent in this form, and I took it from him—he threw a plate of butter and a cup and saucer at me before I got out—my hand bled very much, and so did my ear and my face, but they were all slight wounds, the blow on my breast did not ever penetrate my coat.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 22, George Road, Kentish Town, and am a costermonger in the cattle market—on 9th August I was called to the prisoner's house, and saw Hood bleeding from the ear and hand—the police came up at the time I knocked at the door—the prisoner said, "Who is there? "—I said, "Police"—he said that the first man that came in he would kill, I told him to cool himself—he was a long time opening the door, and when it was opened he was cutting something with a knife; there was a</p>

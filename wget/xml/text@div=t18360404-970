                  </hi>. I am a silk-weaver, and live at No. 28, New Nicholl-street, St. Matthew, Bethnal-green. The prisoner was my apprentice—his time was up about twelve moths ago—he remained with me after that, till within the last month—about the 4th of February—he came back on the 18th of February, I believe—that is the day I missed my watch and silver—he was not in my employ at that time—he had got a fresh place a week previous to that—he remained at my house about half an hour in the kitchen—I have a workshop on the third floor—it is under the same roof as the rest of the house—he went away about eleven o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I occupy the whole house—I work in the workshop myself—I came down between nine or ten o'clock at night, from the workshop—I left my purse, with about 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, in one of the drawers of a chest in the workshop, and my watch in one of the drawers—I am quite sure the work<lb></lb>shop door was latched—I was the last person in it—I did not go out of</p>

               <p>the house at all after that—I cannot tell whether the outer door was on the latch or not; but when I came down stairs, about half-past nine o'clock, it was on the latch, but very likely my wife or the boys may have gone out afterwards—I went to bed about ten o'clock—I and my wife sleep in the kitchen, and my two apprentices sleep in the workshop to protect it—they went to bed before me, and my wife also—I am certain the street door was shut when I went to bed—is was on the latch, and bolted inside, and the windows were fast—about half-past nine o'clock in the evening we were sitting by the fire—I had scarcely sat down before I heard the street door go-that was the moment I came down in the evening—and, it appears to me, that at that time the robbery was done—the boys and come down to have their supper—we were all down in the kitchen, and I heard the street-door alarm too—said, "The street-door is gone too, and I have heard nobody go up or down"—the boy opened the door, with a candle, and said, "Mas<lb></lb>ter, here is nobody"—I said, "Very well, shut the door"—the street-door was latched at the time I came down form the workshop, but not bolted, and very probably my wife might have gone out on an errand, or the boys had gone out for beer, and left it unbolted—I cannot tell whether it was on the latch or not just before I heard it alarm too—the workshop-door was latched when I left it—I was the last per<lb></lb>son who came out of it—I did not go up to it again that night—I went up next morning, and perceived my silver was gone—I opened the drawer, and the watch was gone—I came down, and told my wife—I then went to the prisoner's lodging, and said to him, "George, I was robbed last night of about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver and my watch, do you know any thing of it?"—he said, No, master, I do not"—he said, "It is very strange; you must know something about it, for no other person could have access to my shop, only you that were used to it"—he said, "I was going to come to your house this morning, about some work"—and he came in about an hour to my house—I said again, "You must know something of it, for nobody but you knew how to come to my house"—he then left—this was on Friday—on the Saturday it got reported in the neighbourhood, and a neighbour gave me information—I went to him again on the Monday morning, and charged him with it again—he denied it, and I took him to the station-house—when I got against the station-house, I said, "Don't left me go in here; it will be the worst day's work you ever had; give me the watch, and you may keep the silver, if you like"—he said he knew nothing about it—I said, "Well, if you have not got it in your possession, send it by dinner-time"—I did not like to take him inside the house—on the 10th, one of my workmen brought me a duplicate—he is not here—the watch was worth 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I lost about 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in money.</p>

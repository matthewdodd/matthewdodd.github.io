             sworn. - Q. What are you? - A. I am a cabinet-maker, and servant to Mess. Foley and Ward, in Wardour-street, Soho: On the 31st of December last, I went to Martin and Co.'s banking-house, in <placeName id="t18040215-9-crimeloc42">Lombard-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the man? - A. To the best of my belief it is the same man; I only lost sight of him when he turned round the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. You say they were well-dressed men - was he one of them? - A. Yes, I am sure he was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay hold of his hand when you found a hand in your pocket? - A. No, I did not; I found another hand in my pocket; he was close to me; there was one on each side of me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understood you said, to the best of your belief, he was the man? - A. He was the man that knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. He knocked you down by reason of his charging you with a robbery? - A. No, I charged him with robbing me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was angry with what you said? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a great many people passing in Lombard-street at that time no doubt? - A. I did not take particular notice then.</p>
               <p>Q. You never found your property since? - A. No; I then went and stopped payment.</p>

             sworn. - A few minutes before five o'clock on Saturday the 31st of December, the prisoner was coming down Sweeting's-alley, (I was at the bottom of the alley) crying out, stop thief! I saw him sixty or seventy yards before he came to me; I was determined to stop him; he came up to me at the bottom of the alley; I caught hold of him by the collar; he pleaded his innocence, and said, the person had gone on, and that he was the person that cried out, stop thief! I secured him; the gentleman who had lost his pocketbook came up; I took the prisoner to the Compter, and searched him, and found one 2 l. note and a 4 l. note.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not find the prosecutor's pocket-book with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He was rather quicker than the other? - A. Yes, he was the first that was running.</p>
               <p>Q.They all cried out, stop thief? - A. No, not all.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Forsells.) What were these notes? - A. They were a banker's check for 20 l. and 10 l. draft on Marun and Co. they belonged to Mr.

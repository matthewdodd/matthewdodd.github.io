               <p>Did they lay there when you served her? - No; I had seen them when I went up to dinner; and there was no person came into the shop but her; there was no coat in the shop to please her; she bespoke one, and went away, leaving her directions; I missed a card of lace as soon as she was gone out; missing it I suspected her, and went after her a few doors, and I saw about half a yard hanging from her petticoat, dragging on the pavement; I went and laid hold of the lace, and desired her to step back; she came back and dropped the lace upon the shop floor, she dropped it from under her coats; she had a long cloak on; she begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>What did she say besides? - She said she had a child of six weeks old, and begged for mercy for the infant's sake; it was the first offence; the child was not with her.</p>
               <p>Did you see her take the lace? - No; I am certain I did not see her take it.</p>
               <p>Where is the boy? - He is not present; he did not see her take it he says, he is sixteen.</p>
               <p>You did not see this card of lace on the desk after you came down? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it dropped from her? - Yes; it has been in my custody ever since; I know it to be my master's, it has his shop-mark.</p>
               <p>Might not a card of lace of that bulk stick to the lace of her cloak? - It was not near the desk; I saw her at the end of the counter; she had no occasion to pass by the desk to go to the back room.</p>

               <p>I had some witnesses, but they are gone, they did not think my trial would come on; I am not guilty of the crime; I did not take it; I am eighteen next October.</p>
               <p>Court By a particular act of parliament this offence, as laid in the indictment, against the prisoner is of a capital nature, and if you find her generally guilty, your verdict will affect her life for stealing privately in a shop to the value of five shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090026"></xptr> or upwards is a capital offence by act of parliament.</p>

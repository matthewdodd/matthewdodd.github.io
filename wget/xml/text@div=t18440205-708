                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police-constable, No.</hi> 30.) Between twelve and one in the night of the 23rd of January, I was rowing down the river with two officers, and was near the junks at Crown-wharf—I saw the prisoner in a loaded coal-barge—he walked to a light punt, lying between two loaded coal-barges—we rowed to him, and found him lying on the flat of his face, between two piles of coals—I asked what he was doing, he said he had brought the punt to take some coke when there was water enough—we went down and returned aside the barge, and saw him come up from the cabin, take several pieces of coal off one barge and the other, and put them into the punt—we took him in the punt—I have compared these coals with those in the barge—they correspond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know whose barge it was, except from what you were told? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till I went and found Mr. Wickers—I did not observe the name on the barge—I took Wickers to the same barge—she was lying in the same place—the prisoner said he brought the punt down and was going to take her under the gas-works to load coke—we then went about fifty or sixty yards up the river, and when we came down again my brother officer asked him who he had got in his cabin—he said, "No one"—we did not say, "You had no coals forward when I spoke to you before"—he said the coali in the punt belonged to him, they were the remains of seven tons that he had had previously—I observed when I hailed him at one o'clock, that he bad coals in his barge—at the station he said to the best of his judgment he had eight tons of coals in his punt—I found there was one ton and three hundred weight—he did not say, "I must have lost three hundred weight myself"—we are frequently rewarded by the Commissioners of Police—I took him just after three—I did not from one till three take any person—it was a beautiful star-light night—there were not many vessels about—a person could get from one craft to another.</p>

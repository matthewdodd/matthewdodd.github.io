                  </hi>/. I am a widow, and live in Leonard-street, Shoreditch. On Sunday evening, the 26th of August, I was coming from chapel across Smithfield—I went by Charter-house-square and Long-lane—my cousin Pate and Mary Hartly were with me—at the corner of Charter-house-square, about nine o'clock, I stopped to bid Hartly good night—while I was doing that I saw Stubbs walking about—we noticed him, and thought it was for no good purpose—we did not see any person with him then—I proceeded to walk on—Pate was still with me—when I got to the corner of Beech-lane, I found the prisoner Mullins' hand in my pocket—I am sure of hit person—I turned round—Mullins was nearest to me, and I saw the two other prisoners, and two others with them—I turned and asked what they meant—I did not make any alarm, because I wanted to be sure whether I had lost my purse or not—I found it was gone—it contained one sovereign and eight half-sovereigns—I did not see either of them do any thing—I only saw Mullins <hi rend="italic">muzzling</hi> my purse up in his hand, as he drew I to hand from my pocket—they did not walk away very fast, but gradually—Mullins and Bostock went down Beech-lane, and Stubbs and the others walked along the street down to Finsbury-square—they crossed the way—the policeman came up, and my cousin gave him information—I have not the least doubt of these persons being the men—there were some persons fol<lb></lb>lowed us on the Sunday evening before, but as I did not lose any thing then, I did not particularly notice them—they had just the same appearance as these young men—they were like them—I did not speak to any one of them particularly—I did not look particularly to know them—I did not see any more of the prisoners after I was robbed till the next day, Monday, when I was fetched to the station-house, and I said that all three of them were the same persons as I had seen in Chiswell-street on the Sunday—I am positive they are the same persons—I noticed my purse in my pocket about seven o'clock in the evening, when I put my hand into my pocket—I did not take it out.</p>

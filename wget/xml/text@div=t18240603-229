            . I am a chemist, and live in Gravel-lane; there are some premises next to me belonging to Messrs. Fyler - I had the key for letting the house. On the 24th of March the articles stated in the indictment were all safe; Thompson took possession of the house adjoining; this house is No. 145, and Thompson's is 145 1/2; I was occasionally there, but did not miss any thing till the 24th of April, when I missed the articles stated in the indictment. On Tuesday the 27th I went to Wellington's shop, and saw the copper boiler which had been in the parlour. I saw Wellington there. I found an aperture, four feet high, cut from Thompson's kitchen to the unoccupied house. I went with the warrant to Wellington's shop, and took the copper - it was the same which had been in the parlour; in the room passing through the shop we saw the cupboard, and we found all the articles except the stove - there was no appearance of the doors or windows having been forced. Thompson lives a quarter of a mile from Wellington, who is Thompson's father-in-law.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to Thompson's house on the 27th of May, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have a warrant to search your house; the next house has been robbed, and the things are suspected to have been carried through your house; he said</p>
               <p>"They may be, but I know nothing about it." I went in, and found the aperture very badly nailed up. I was going up stairs, but he said,</p>
               <p>"You need not go up, there is no bed; I sleep with my father in Ratcliff-highway." As we were going to Wellington's I said,</p>
               <p>"Shall we find the square copper boiler there;" he said,</p>
               <p>"I don't think you will." I then said,</p>
               <p>"Is it not exposed for sale on your father's counter;" he said,</p>
               <p>"My father has a square copper boiler for sale." I went to the house; the copper boiler was on the counter; I asked the price of it; he said 15 s.; I said,</p>
               <p>"Of whom did you buy it;" he said he did not know the man. I asked what he gave for it; he said he had bought it some time, and could not say when; Wellington then said, he was not master of his house, but that it had been brought in by somebody</p>

            . I am the wife of Mr. Chatwood. I saw Thompson going out of the house one night with something like a door or a shutter - he lived at his shop, but went away of an evening.</p>
               <p>THOMPSON'S Defence. My father-in-law took this shop for me, where I go in the day-time, but sleep at home. The houses at the back of the premises are in a very dilapidated state, so that any person might get to the back of the house, and commit the robbery.</p>

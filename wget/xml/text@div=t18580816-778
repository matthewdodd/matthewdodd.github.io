                  </hi>. I reside at 1, Cavendish-square, and am principal manager of Sir Claude Scott's bank; the firm consists of Samuel Scott and another—the prisoner was in their employment as city collecting clerk, and had been for about two years—his duty was to collect the sundries east, the city articles, the bills and drafts lying in the east part of London, in the city—by the word "article," I mean a cheque, bill, or draft, or anything of that kind.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understood you to say just now that it was entered as all received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was to be received; but it is not brought out—there is no other entry with respect to that sum in this book; it should have been brought out if paid, and it is not brought out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> According to the practice of the bank, how would be account for those amounts which had not been paid him at the banks where he had been collecting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He enters them in his walk-book as "returns," and then hands the draft itself, or an article or a ticket representing that draft, to the keeper of the sundries east, or undues—the draft is supposed to be left for acceptance at the bank; it may be an article that is only a day's date—if he retains the draft, he hands it to the keeper of the sundries; if he leaves it behind him, he hands in a ticket representing it—these tickets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in the prisoner's writing—this is "C. A., Jones, for acceptance, Hall, West, &amp; Co." means a bill of Hall, West, &amp; Co. of Brighton, on Jones, Loyd; this represents it: the date is 9th June, 1858; that means the date upon which the article is left for acceptance; but it is wrong in this instance—the "C. A." means "Cash Article"—the other ticket is "C. A., Hankey; Harvey &amp; Co. 295<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 9th July, 1858"—that was for acceptance also. On Saturday morning, 10th July, in conse<lb></lb>quence of matters which had occurred, the prisoner was called into Mr. Scott's private room—Mr. Scott, Mr. Tyson, the prisoner, and myself were present—these two tickets were lying on the table before Mr. Scott; Mr. Scott handed them to the prisoner and said, "Can you account for these articles, Mr. Jervis?"—the prisoner replied, "They are drafts left for acceptance"—Mr. Tyson said, "No, they are not; I have ascertained this morning that that is not so"—the prisoner then hung down his head, and said, "I can't say"—Mr. Scott said, "Well, but that is very singular, Mr. Jervis; you must give us some explanation"—he replied, "All I can say is, that all the moneys I have received I have brought home"—Mr. Scott said, "But how about this particular sum (referring to Hankey's tioket); we have ascertained that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160050"></xptr>
               <p>they paid you that amount, being the amount of their charge: do you mean to say that that has not been paid you?"—the prisoner held down his head and said nothing—after waiting a few minutes, he was again asked if he could afford any explanation respecting the tickets, and he then repeated what he bad said before, "I can say nothing, but that all the moneys I have collected I have brought home"—Mr. Scott was then called out of the room for a moment—I then told the prisoner that we had found out all about it, and could not he explain it at once, and save us further trouble—he shrug<lb></lb>ged his shoulders and said nothing—I then asked him if he could give us the money for those tickets—he said no, he could not, the money was gone—he was given into custody immediately afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you took up the conversa<lb></lb>tion, had Mr. Scott left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Mr. Tyson was present when I said to the prisoner, "Can you give us the money for these tickets?" I believe he said, "No, I cannot; the money is gone"—I wrote down what he said afterwards—he had said 2 or 3 minutes before to Mr. Scott that all the money he had received he had paid in—I don't remember his saying, "My books will explain all that I have done; "he might have said so, but I do not remember that he did—the pocket walk-book was not produced, but the walk-book east was—Glyn's charge on 5th July was not received by the prisoner; it is not in this book at all—the whole of Glyn's charge on 5th July is in Gliddon's handwriting, for Gliddon collected it—there are a great number of entries, amounting to 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—Gliddon is one of our assisting-clerks—all the work with Glyn's that day was transacted by Gliddon, and this book shows it—the prisoner had to collect money on drafts, and to go to the Bank of England—he had occasionally to go to the India-house—he never received dividends there—these items probably represent East India stock paid into the Bank of England—he very seldom had business there—he had to go to our brokers in Lothbury, and to do business there—he had messages given to him from myself, Mr. Scott, and others, almost every day; it was his duty to attend to those—he occasionally delivered letters when wanted, and had to bring back the results of his messages and inquiries, that was what he was sent for—he had rents to collect at times, and payments to make; he paid for our stock purchases; he had to make those payments, in smaller or larger sums, at a great many different places, and to give an account when he returned of all that he had done—he had to present bills for acceptance at the houses within his beat—anything out of the way was given to a notary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has he complained repeatedly of having too much work on his beat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard him make such a complaint, but I thought it unjust—on the day in question we sent in Gliddon to assist him; that was not particularly on account of his complaint—he did not complain to Mr. Scott, nor was Gliddon sent in consequence—he had complained several months before—Mr. Scott is not here—when I thought it necessary, we were in the habit of sending Gliddon to assist the prisoner, not when I thought it unusually heavy; Gliddon had other business to transact, and when he went into the city he assisted the city clerk—I do not remember such a thing occurring as assistance being sent in consequence of his complaints—I have been the manager for 6 or 8 months; Mr. Tyson was my pre<lb></lb>decessor—the prisoner was given into custody and taken before the magistrate the same day, upon these very charges that are now being inquired into—inquiry was made before the magistrate whether the notes received on these articles were paid in, and evidence was taken from the different bankers' clerks; we said that they were not paid in; we charged him with embezz✗</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160051"></xptr>
               <p>ment—I believe the clerk took the depositions—after it was said that the notes were not paid in, the book containing the entries of the notes was called for, the book in which the numbers and dates of the notes were entered; that is, the cash article waste-book—it is impossible for me to answer whether on that book being produced it turned out that the very notes received from the bankers on these articles were paid in—I can't say that I produced from my pocket one of the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes that was paid on these very articles; a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that he had received was produced in court, I can't say who produced it; I think I produced it; it was one of the notes that the prisoner brought home the day preceding; I think it was the note he had received from Hankey's charge which he said was not paid him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the magistrate upon that refuse to proceed upon that charge, and did you then take other cases? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was unassisted by a solicitor, and Mr. Long said the evidence was not complete—we had a remand on that day—when Mr. Mullens came he reserved that charge for future attention—I can't say that he formally abandoned that charge before the magistrate, I have no knowledge of it—I cannot say whether the depositions were gone on with that day; I should think it very unlikely—I believe Mr. Mullens said he should not offer any evidence as to that charge, but he should proceed to others; he did proceed to others—The walk-book is not made up over-nights to a great extent—I should think the drafts of the 9th are not entered on the 8th, the practice that obtains in our house is upon any very heavy day, say the 4th of the month, to detain the clerks to enter over-night the articles that they have got to collect in the morning, but that is an unusual occurrence; I should say on the day in question it was not done; they are entered in the morning before he goes out—it is not our practice to enter them by anticipation; it might have been so on that occasion—he goes out at 10 o'clock—he comes to the bank at 10 minutes to 9, he is generally early—before he goes out he has to make these entries; he has also to stamp the drafts and sort them; there are very few drafts come in in the morning, it applies chiefly to the amounts coming in the day preceding—the line drawn in the middle of the page does net indicate morning drafts, they may be taken from the undues of the day preceding; these are the bills—bills and cash articles are kept separate; we call them sundries and morning drafts; the sundries are taken from the undue sundries of the day preced<lb></lb>ing, and the morning drafts are added to them—there may be four or six, I should say six was the outside—I am speaking of morning drafts or un<lb></lb>dues, for which a ticket or something has been given—I do not know that those on the other side of the line that is drawn, are made up on the over<lb></lb>night—the bills are entered in the morning generally, very seldom at night, they are occasionally—his duty is to make every entry before he goes out; they are all entered in anticipation of collection—the pocket walk-book is his private memorandum, he makes that up as he goes on, whilst on his walk—as soon as each of those books is concluded or posted up it becomes to a certain extent waste-paper; it is not kept—it is the property of the bank; it is found by the bank; they are put away with our other books—he renders them to us, but we are not strict on the point—I do not mean to say that we have all these books of two years ago, we are not bound to keep them; the clerk should return them after they are completed; it is not the practice to destroy them for a year or two; they ought to be kept for three or four years and then be destroyed—we have all the prisoner's walk-books, and I should say we have a great many others; we keep them in regular methodical order—there is no clerk to whom they are given, they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160052"></xptr>
               <p>are put in a certain place, sometimes under the desk in a place reserved for them, and sometimes in a desk; but it is an extraordinary thing that the prisoner is almost the only clerk that has regularly kept them; we are not particular about their being kept; they are not made up totally with the walk-book, but merely with the private book—they were all in his desk—we broke open the desk; I believe he gave up the key without knowing that we had done so; I think he gave it to me the next morning when we charged him with it—I can't say whether or not we told him that we had broken open his desk—I don't remember whether I asked him for the key or whether he gave it up to me; he might have seen that it was broken open when he came to business in the morning, and no doubt he did—when articles are stated not to be due they should be asked for—the clerks do not check every item each evening—there is no clerk to whom he would make his return, hand over the sundries, and go over the account—he makes up his walk-book on his return, with the assistance of the articles that he brings home—everything he collects he brings home, and the rest he must account for in bank-notes or payments—when he comes home the walk-book is handed to him and he makes the entries against each item, whether they are paid or not—supposing he said an article was not due, we should expect him to bring it home; he ought to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What does "not due" mean? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For instance, to-day is the 19th, we will suppose that he has an article due on the 25th, and he presents that inadvertently; he ought not to take it out with him, and the banker does not pay it, saying, "It is not due till the 25th"—the inadvertence is in the walk-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The item of cash articles 12,138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 9th July, would include such as those of Hankey's, Jones', and so on. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, if they are not specified by name underneath in the morning drafts—any one of the drafts or bills that he has returned as not due, may be entered in the walk-book, either under the head of cash articles in a lump, or in detail as a morning draft—this is a mass of bills, drafts, and cheques, taken from the sundries east-walk-book—those are what he has to collect that day, and the labour would be too great if he had to enter them all seriatim—these bills are to be received besides—the lump is the total of the drafts sent in to us for collection the day preceding and some of the drafts entered underneath that had only come in for collection that morning—the specified articles are the morning drafts and undues; undues is a short term which we use signifying sundries undue—drafts that remain in our house for several days being undue, are entered each day as undue, until they come to maturity, and they are then given him to collect with the morning drafts—the bills do not go into the balance.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the reason why you keep the bills distinct from the cash articles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The cash articles form our balance of cash every day, the bills do not, and it is to meet that balance every day that the prisoner has been obliged to make these particular entries, otherwise it would have been discovered directly—it is to meet the balance, which is struck every day in every banking-house, that he has been obliged to do this—we strike a balance every day of all the amounts received and paid—these drafts are treated as cash, and called cash articles—the bills are entered distinctly; they do not come into the cash balance, they are entered seriatim in this book, which is kept by another clerk, and this pocket walk-book ought to contain a list of them—the pocket walk-book of 9th July contains the total amount; that is taken from the sundries east, which contains each article</p>

               <p>seriatim; you will find the figures tally—the prisoner could always see that book—he takes the amount from it, and he takes the instruments themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The other book you speak of is kept by another clerk, who furnishes the account to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner himself takes it from the book—it is generally done by himself, he trusts to his own work—I do not think we treat our cash articles differently from other banks—if a customer pays in a country cheque, we sometimes treat it as cash and sometimes not; sometimes it is entered as a bill, and sometimes as a cash article, as the case may be—a country cheque takes four or five days to clear—If it is a large amount we enter it as a bill, because it gives a fictitious cash balance; if it is a small amount, it may, or may not, be entered as a cash article—drafts not yet due we sometimes enter as cash articles, and sometimes not; if it has only a day or two to run, it is put in as cash, to the credit of the customer when received—that is not at all an unusual practice with banks; every bank in London does so—it is not the constant practice for what has been put in as a cash article to be returned as not due; it is so occasionally—here is one on 9th July of 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and one on the 7th—If he does not bring back the article, he is required to give a ticket—he ought to bring in the article itself next day—this mark is not meant for ditto, it may mean <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> for acceptance or anything—in the case of the 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which was returned as not due, the article itself was given in—it was not given in to me, I merely speak from the book—there is no reference made to it here—in the case of the 499<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of Glyn's, the article was not asked for, because there was no occasion to ask for it—I am not the party to whom he gave in the walk, therefore I cannot say, I only tell you what is written here, "not due"—generally speaking, if an article is returned as not due the article itself ought to be insisted upon and not a ticket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understood you to say just now that if there is simply an entry "not due," and the bill is not left for acceptance, the instrument itself ought to be brought back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, if it is left for acceptance we have one of these tickets instead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But in neither of these instances on 5th July was that done, because a ticket was taken, although the words "not due" are written. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, you misapprehend, we have no ticket for those—Gliddon and Smith keep the undue sundries; they have the copying of the book the day preceding—they are not the parties who would hand the prisoner the articles next morning—they would make out the account of what was to be collected by the prisoner, and next morning the articles represented in that account would be handed to him by the party who ascertained the undue sundries—I can't say who that would be on the 5th, it is sometimes done by one, sometimes by another—there are two or three clerks whose duty it would be to sort drafts; I can't say who it was that did it on the 9th; it did not occur to me to inquire, it is perfectly unimportant—the 499<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of Glyn's, and 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Jones, Loyd, received on the 5th, are charged as again given out to the prisoner on the 9th, and accounted for on the 9th, in the walk-book east—they are charged out against him for collection, not as coming in on that day—he charges himself with the receipt of them on that day; he is charged with them for collection, and he makes them paid on that day—they are brought into the cash balance as paid on that day—supposing the tickets to have been given for them on the 5th, they would have been returned to him when they were brought into the account on the 9th—he did bring tickets for the 499<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know that of my own knowledge, I have not seen them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the result of the transaction of the 5th July would be that the two articles 499<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with Glyu's, and 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with Jones, Loyd. would be represented as left with them because they were not due, and tickets brought to represent them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then those tickets would be taken up by him when the money was paid in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were charged out on the 9th, and two fresh tickets paid in—if the money was paid on the 9th, the tickets given in on the 5th would be given up to the prisoner, and he would destroy them; they would be given to him instead of the others, just as any other voucher.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you got the tickets? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—on 5tn July, there is entered in his walk-book a total charge of cash articles amounting to 13,801<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., then there are some items which are morning drafts—the cash articles include all that we had on the preceding day, and the morning drafts are those that have come in before he starts; those being added to the 13,801<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the total he had that day to receive was 14,601<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. besides the bills; with the bills it would be 15,382<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is the sum which, on 5th July, it would be his duty to collect and account for—the items composing that 15,382<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. are all entered in this book, not specifically, the details of them are to be found in another book, to which the prisoner had access—before he leaves the bank in the morning, he takes charge of the securities that are represented as included in the moneys he has to collect—he has a banker's walk-case for the purpose of carrying them in—it is his duty to compare the articles that he puts into that case with the entries in the books, to see that he has got what he is charged with—he takes them down in the pocket walk-book—he does not check them over with this book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That would not enable him to check them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not till he comes back—he is told that there is a gross sum, which is the amount of the yesterday's cash articles, and the instruments are given to him to collect upon; that is all he knows at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then what is the object of the pocket walk-book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That he should take them all down seriatim, and, when he comes back, the total casting of this book ought to agree with the total casting of the other; it is a sort of private memorandum-book, to enable him to account for his day's transactions—in the account he has given of that day, the 499<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. are deducted from the total; the private walk-book shows that—it mentions the amount with reference to the London and County Bank, and, at the end of the day, Glyn also—I did not say that the deduction of 499<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. appeared without any explanation, it has "Glyn" to it; there is no explanation beyond that—there is also a deduction of the 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Jones, Loyd—those two items are deducted from what he renders an account of on 5th July—according to the practice of the bank he would have to collect that 499<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as a demand still due upon Glyn's upon subsequent days, until the time arrived when it would be payable—on the 9th, Glyn and Jones are entered as a part of the charge that he had to collect on that day; he here accounts for the receipt five days before, of that 499<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then he reports them as not being paid on the 9th—he makes deductions represented by those two tickets, he makes the former two paid, and he deducts these two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are they put as not due, or for acceptance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For acceptance—these tickets being marked "for acceptance," we should not ask for the documents themselves, we never do when they are for acceptance—those two amounts are deducted from the total receipts of the 9th—the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that has</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160055"></xptr>
               <p>been spoken of I produced as a not received, as I understood, by the prisoner from Hankey's, on the 9th; it was paid in by him on the 9th—I can speak of that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note because I inquired of Hankers myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the banking-house of Scott and Co.—I keep the sundries undue book—in that book is entered anything that is brought back by the collecting clerk as not having been paid—the entries in the sundries undue book on 5th July are in the prisoner's writing; he sometimes assisted in making entries—I find here an entry of "Glyn, 499<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and "Jones, Loyd, 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,"—on 5th July, I assisted the prisoner in the collection in the city—we are busy on the 4th of the month—the 4th July was on a Sunday, and on the Monday I assisted him on the walk—I received the charge on Glyn's that day; I received 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Glyn's that day—I handed it over to the prisoner on his return from the city, before he made up the walk—there was no draft on them that day for 499<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; there was no draft at all returned from Glyn's that day—I made the entries of the undues on the 9th—I have an entry of 378<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Hall and West, and 295<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Hankey's—I made those entries from these two tickets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner closed the sundries east-book on the 5th, I closed it on the 9th—on the 5th, there is no article entered of 449<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to be collected from Glyn's, or 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Jones, Loyd—that draft was entered on the 4th, and charged against him, and ought to have been presented by him on the 5th—on the 9th, there is an entry of 378<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Jones, Loyd—there is no article on Hankey's of 295<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but there is a charge on Hankey's, amounting altogether to 295<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., composed of several items.</p>

               <p>to the house, and obtain a signature to a ticket—by a ticket I mean such as have been produced, with the amount—he would say, "City walk, short so much," and obtain the signature of the manager to that piece of paper—these two tickets are unsigned, they came through my hand—I reported that they were not right; I reported these very tickets as contrary to the principles of the house; they are unsigned by the manager—these are in receipt for the articles he took out on the 9th; they represent that the bills had been left for acceptance—the account is deficient those amounts—finding these tickets unsigned I brought them under the manager's notice—they ought to be signed by our manager—I reported them as wrong be<lb></lb>fore this charge was made—I reported them on the evening of the 9th, the evening they were given to me by the prisoner—the tickets were passed through my hands, and were under my inspection, and I asked the manager if they were allowed—I had only recently been placed in a position for these tickets to pass through my hands—I had not taken the same sort of tickets on the 5th; they did not pass through my hands then—the prisoner assisted me on that day—they were not given to me, they would be given to Mr. Parrott—they were placed in the undues by the prisoner after having entered them—I have charge of the undues—they were placed there by the prisoner without my seeing them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not repeatedly said to the prisoner, when there has been some difficulty in ascertaining where a particular error arose, "We cannot stop here all night, just give a ticket and set it right in the morning"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect having done so; I will not swear I have not, because sometimes we are 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. wrong, and a ticket for that amount is not objectionable, but for a large amount of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>for examination we should have to go and get it—I do not recollect having told him to give tickets when the amount has been small, I may have done so when it has been a few pence—signed tickets are given at present—I say it is not customary to give unsigned tickets—I believe they were given previous to this prosecution, but I can only speak from 1st July—I did not give them at all when I took the walk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you told the prisoner that the walk was too heavy for him, that there was too much business for one man to do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At times; at times we are very busy and it required two, and I have stated so—I always sympathised with him when he had too much to do, and did my best to get him assistance—we were very busy in July, it is a busy month.</p>

On Monday evening, 26th March, I was on duty on London-bridge, in company with Brett—I saw the prisoner and another man, coming from the Surrey side towards the City—near the centre of the bridge they met a lady, and turned back after her—the prisoner walked close to her, and looked at the right-hand side of her</p>

On the evening of 26th March, I went over London-bridge—I had come out of an omnibus five or seven minutes before, paid my fare, and put my purse into my pocket again—it had steel beads—I stated the amount wrong, in my confusion—I afterwards calculated what I had paid, and found there were only two sovereigns and fifteen shillings in the purse—Haydon spoke to me—I immediately examined my pocket, and the purse was gone—I had this dress on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you carry your handkerchief there as well as your purse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but my handkerchief was then in my muff—it had not been in my pocket at all—I had no hole in my pocket—I got out of the omnibus in King William-street, and walked on to the bridge—I had not stopped at any shop—I had no occasion to put my hand into my pocket, until Haydon spoke to me—the pocket is in my dress—I do not put my hand through my dress to get at it—I never had anything slip down between my dress and other clothes—when I once have my hand in it I cannot drop any<lb></lb>thing—it is a very different pocket from those that used to be worn.</p>

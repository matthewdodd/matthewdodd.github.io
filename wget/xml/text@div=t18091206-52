               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Gentlemen, the case of the person under examination is probably the most singular that ever attracted your notice. In the first place my affection for my husband induced me to take a crime on myself, for which I suffered the sentence of the law. My time being nearly out, I embraced an opportunity which offered, to return to England. I have two children in England, and my affection for them led me to accept the happy opportunity of embracing my dear offspring. I have suffered much on my passage. I submit my case to my dearly beloved Sovereign, for an act of royal mercy, and for which there cannot be a doubt but the Lord will command an extra blessing on his royal brow. Gentlemen, consider a mother's feeling for her children: give me them, and no punishment that the law can inflict will be thought too severe by the most unhappy of the human race. Oh! my dear Gentlemen, consider the unhappy state of the unfortunate</p>

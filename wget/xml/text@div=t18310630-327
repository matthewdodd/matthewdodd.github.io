On the 26th of May, having dined with a friend, I was on my road home - about one o'clock in the morning, as I proceeded up Rathbone-place, I saw the prisoner before me and a man walking along with her; I overtook and passed them - they stopped at the corner of Rathboneplace, by the Percy hotel; as I passed the prisoner she looked very hard at me - I crossed the road, and she followed me; I requested her not to go with me, for she could get no advantage at all by my company, and requested her to return to her friend - she said he was no friend of hers, that she had never seen him before, and did not like him for he was putting a great many curious questions to her, and she did not wish to have any thing to say to him - she continued this sort of conversation till I got to the other side of the street; that was in crossing Charlotte-street - she wished me to go to a house with her, which I declined; she then asked me for money to carry her home in a coach - I asked where she lived; she said in Burton-crescent - I said the distance was very short, it was a fine clear night, and she had no occasion for a coach - she then became rather abusive in her language, and said I had deprived her of a friend; I reminded her that I had wished her to keep by that friend - I could not get rid of her; I cannot repeat all the conversation - she was very importunate, and to get rid of her I turned away from her, and at the moment of turning away, another female, who is here, happened to be passing; I joined her on purpose to ged rid of the prisoner, and walked a few paces with her - when the prisoner saw me join that female she ran after me, laid hold of the skirts of my coat, apparently to stop me; I put my hand round to take care of my pockets or my coat, and at that moment (I was walking alongside the other female) the prisoner put her hand over my shoulder, towards my breast - I moved my right hand to keep her away, but she repeated these efforts so frequently that I did all I could to push her away from me - I had not used sufficient force to keep her away, and therefore I laid hold of both her hands, folded them on her bosom, and gently pushed her into the street; I did it so gently as I could; I left her standing in the street, and came back to the pavement on the left side, upon which she instantly rushed towards me, and made a grasp at my breast - I had a diamond pin in my shirt, which was conspicuous; the moment she made the grasp, she withdrew a step or two -I put my hand to my breast, and found the pin was gone; I immediately charged her with robbery, and called Police! Police! a Policeman came up; I laid hold of her left hand myself immediately, and told him to lay hold of the right, which he did, and she was taken to the station-house - I did not feel satisfied with the Policeman's conduct; at the station I made a general complaint that I was robbed; Pattisson went out; the prisoner was on the point of being searched when Pattisson came in with the pin - my shirt was torn with her taking it - I had taken no description of liberty with her whatever.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have stated very fairly that you took her by the wrist, I am sure you would not use unnecessary violence, but with as much force as you thought necessary, you removed her? A. Precisely so; she certainly appeared angry at my not acceding to her wishes - I was going home, and did not want to be troubled with any body; the last grasp she made was after I had pushed her away - I have never said I might be mistaken as to her intention; I said to Mr. Harmer that I did not wish to press hard upon her, for there was no anger in my feelings - she denied that she intended to steal the pin.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you use more violence than to keep her from your person? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What did you say to the other girl? A. I believe I asked where she lived, and where she was going; that was not in the prisoner's hearing - she was ten or twelve paces off: it was a still night - my object was only to get rid of the prisoner.</p>

            . I am unfortunate, but do not get my living by walking the streets. I was returning home, and heard the prosecutor and prisoner talking rather loud; I heard something about a coach, but cannot exactly recollect what - I saw the prisoner snatch at Mr. Maccallum's cravat; he pushed her away - she made a second snatch, and then he called the Policeman, who came up and took her; the Policeman told me I must go too - I heard something drop, but did not think any thing about the pin, and never saw it - they took me to the station; Pattisson afterwards called me out - I described the spot to him; he went away, and returned in about ten minutes with the pin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long before the prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300143"></xptr>pushed away by Mr. Maccallum did you come up? A. I was passing; Mr. Maccallum said, "Are you going home?" I had not time to answer before the prisoner ran up to him- she had passed me with the prosecutor; I cannot say whether she could hear what he said to me, as she was behind me - he had left her and come up to me; she came up and gave the snatch - he took her by the hand and pushed her off the pavement; then she came and made a snatch at his cravat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not appear irritated and angry at the push off the pavement? A. She appeared angry, and was making use of very angry words.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not, in strong terms, deny indignantly that she had any intention of robbing him? A. She certainly said she was no thief - she appeared angry; a piece of his shirt was torn off.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Was that the part where his pin was? A.Exactly.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was not called up on this occasion - there was no call till I got to Mr. Maccallum - he then directly gave the prisoner into my charge for stealing a diamond pin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you the Policeman the prosecutor was dissatisfied with? A. I am - I do not know that I gave him any reason to be dissatisfied; I think he acted with rather unnecessary violence - as I was going up Rathbone-place I saw the prosecutor and prisoner, and hearing an altercation between them, I stopped, and saw the prosecutor push her into the road - he directly came on the pavement; I passed them, and he gave her into my custody - it was a clear still morning; I came up directly after the push, and he exclaimed, "She has stolen a diamond pin;" and gave her in charge - I saw him push her, and was near enough for her to see me, if she had looked; I was in my dress, and on duty.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was at the station - the prisoner, prosecutor, and Duffield came in; I called Duffield, and she described the spot to me - I immediately went there, found the pin, and brought it back to Mr. Maccallum - I have the shirt where it was torn from the breast.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Maccallum followed me some distance, and asked my address, which I refused; he repeated the question - I asked why he put the question to me; he said he was very anxious to know, that he might call next day - I told him I was so situated I could not tell him; he then behaved very ill to me, indeed, turned away to another woman, and spoke to her - I turned round, took him by the coat or sleeve, and said, "You behave very unlike a gentleman," and believe I said, "You are a blackguard;" he then pushed me to the other side of the road - I thought he would have killed me, he threw me with such force into the road, and at the impulse of the moment I attempted to slap his face, or scratch it - if I could have got at it I would have done it; I declare I never saw his pin till I saw it at the station-house - he took hold of me, pulled me to the station-house, I did not know what for, but thought it was for the assault; when I got there I wept bitterly; he said, "I charge this woman with stealing a pin;" I was astonished - I was not at all anxious for his property, or any body else's; I want nothing but what is right.</p>

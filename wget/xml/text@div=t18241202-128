               <p>JOHN WELLER. I live in Bedfordbury, and am a woollen draper. On Sunday, the 31st of October, I watched about Mr. Offley's house, and saw Jane Taylor come out of the house, about twenty minutes past nine o'clock in the morning - she was holding her apron up in her hands - there appeared to be crockery or glass in it. She went into No. 6, Vine-street, which is Mrs. Tirmody's - it is a little dirty house - they sell rags - I saw Mrs. Tirmody speak to her - I passed by and came back again.</p>

I saw Mrs. Tirmody at her shop, and asked her for some rummers - she said she had none at present, but had had some on Monday, and should have more in a few days.

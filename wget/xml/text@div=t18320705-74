On the 29th of May, about seven o'clock in the morning, the three prisoners came in together - Earle called for a quartern of gin; I had seen him before, but not the others - they all partook of the gin: Earle tendered me half a crown to pay for it - I had no silver in the till, and I told the maid to mind the bar while I went to get my purse, which contained a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and 6s. 6d. in silver - I gave change of the half-crown to Earle, put the half-crown in the purse, and put the purse on the table in the bar, but any one could take it by reaching over; I then turned to draw some porter, and when I turned round all the prisoners and the purse were gone - I did not like to call my uncle, but in about two hours he got up, and then I told him, and described Earle's person; the prisoners were all taken in about two hours and a half - a strap of the purse has been found, but not the purse.</p>

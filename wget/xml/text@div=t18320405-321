            . On the 28th of February I was unfortunately in the station-house; I had a shawl on; the prisoner, who was a stranger to me, was there - I was in there for some hours, and while there I lost my shawl; I told the officer of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you walk to the station? A. I dare say I was taken there for protection, because I would not give my address; the prisoner was tipsy - I do not know which of us was the worst; I was sitting sleeping when I was robbed.</p>

             (Police-contable G 7.) I took the prisoner down to Worship-street; I then heard of this robbery, and saw the corner of a shawl hanging below the prisoner's gown - I took her back to the prosecutrix, who was at the station; I asked her to describe the shawl, which she did, and when I showed it her, she claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not the prosecutrix and the prisoner both drunk? A. The prosecutrix was very drunk; the prisoner was not very drunk - she might have been drinking.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I certainly had the shawl somehow; but I was not in the least conscious of it till I was told of it.</p>

               <p>Court. You had given this draft to your waiter and he gave it to the porter, and he was gone, and returned about the time you expected? - Yes, but I was in the coffee room; and the prisoner seemed uneasy about the porter staying; and I said, I dare say he would bring the money, it was a man that I could trust; and he said, bring me my bill, and I will call again for the change; and he was in the act of preparing to when the porter came in; he had paid his bill to the waiter,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200094"></xptr>and just going out of doors, when the officer came.</p>
               <p>Q. To Parrott. You took them all to the Mansion House? - Yes. I wanted them all to get into a coach; I took the prisoner in a coach; the master and waiter desired to walk, and they did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const to Halifax. You said that Mr. Gepp kept cash at your house many years? you know his hand writing? - Yes. There has been some mistakes in Mr. Gepp's account before, and that was the reason of its being found out.</p>
               <p>Q. To Guy. Look at that note, is that the same that you received of the prisoner? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Halifax. Was the balance, at the time this note was presented, in Mr. Gepp's favour or otherwise? - Taking the forged drafts out of the account it was in his favour.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you then, or have you since given him credit for these notes, which he says were improperly obtained? - I don't know that we have at all yet.</p>
               <p>Q.Then at that time, as the account stood in your book, the balance was against Mr. Gepp? - I know very little of the accounts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his accounts? - I have not seen it yet.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, I now stand before you in a most awful and distressing situation, and have involved in my misery a dearly beloved wife, with five young children, by giving credit to a person, which I supposed an honest man On Monday, the 13th of April last, a person, who said his name was Birch, and lived at, or near Uxbridge, he bought goods at my shop, and asked me to change a banker's bill, I told him I had not cash enough to change it, but possibly might be able in the course of the day. This was in the morning; he then said he would leave it with me, and call for the change in the afternoon, but desired to have the goods, as he wanted to send them down into the country; and he consented to leave the draft, I had every reason to believe it was good, and therefore consented for him to take the goods. Having some business in Holborn, I went to the Bell and Crown there, and asked the landlord if he had any body to send into the city, to get cash for it. The man, after waiting a length of time returned, I found the man when he returned had been stopped, and consequently I was apprehended. I have always borne a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200095"></xptr>good character, which can be testified by many respectable gentlemen of fortune; and others, which I believe, and expect are in court, and to whom I have the honour of being known for many years. I therefore, throw myself on the merciful goodness of the court, as my life has been hitherto unimpeached, humbly confiding that they will restore, a wretched and miserable individual, to his heart breaking wife and family.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

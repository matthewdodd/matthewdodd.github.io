                  </hi>. I live in Vineyard-walk Clerkenwell, and am a horse<lb></lb>hair manufacturer. The prisoner was in my service—on the 22nd of Dec. a person called, and gave me information—on the 23rd the prisoner came to work, and was detected in taking horse-hair.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Bailey. I saw the prisoner, on the 23rd of Dec, go to a pile of hair in the shop where she works, take some hair off that pile, lift up her clothes, and put it into a large pocket which she had tied round her—I informed my employer, a policeman was sent for, she was taken and searched, and this hair was found on her—it is of the same quality and description as that we had in the pile she went to.</p>

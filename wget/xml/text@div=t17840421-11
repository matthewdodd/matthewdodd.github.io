               <p>My uncle's house was broke open the 28th of last month, I was alarmed between two and three in the morning by the watchman's rattle at the knocker of the door; I got up instantly, and asked what was the matter, and the watchman answered, get up, there are thieves in your house; upon that I put on my clothes, and went up stairs into the garret to awake the coachman; it was very dark; I afterwards came down in the first floor into my uncle's room, who was ill of the gout, and when I had lighted a candle, I went to the street door, and let in the watchman and some others that were with him; the street door was shut, we examined the kitchen and there was nobody there; I opened the area door, and the watchman and the others proceeded to examine the house, and in the cellar where the coals were put, there they found the three prisoners at the bar.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that coal cellar within the house? - There is an area about four or five feet wide between the house and the coal cellars.</p>
               <p>Can they get into the coal cellar without coming into the house at all from the area? - Yes, the coal cellar opens into the area.</p>
               <p>Were any of the doors of the house broke? - No, there were two holes made in the door, and another in the post to which it is fastened, but they had not got it open, they had not got into the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this is an attempt to commit a burglary, but it was discovered before it was committed, certainly we cannot consider the coal cellar on the other side of the area as a part of the dwelling house, there is therefore no proof of the burglary, though there was a clear attempt to commit it.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoners. Young men, you have by your conduct on this occasion brought yourselves to this bar, to be tried for your lives upon a capital indictment, and you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270023"></xptr> have had the good fortune to escape, through being, (as I hope it will turn out happily for you) interrupted in the commission of an offence, which there is too much reason to fear, from the evidence, you have attempted to commit; I shall abstain from saying all I think on the subject, therefore, there being no other charge against you, and no intention of further prosecuting you, you will be discharged; and, I hope, the risk you have run of your lives on this occasion, together with the disgrace of being brought into this Court of Justice, will be a warning to you, and that you will be thankful to God for having escaped the punishment due to such a crime.</p>
               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury, before Mr. RECORDER.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, at 43, Leonard-street—on Monday night, about 9, I was returning home, within a little distance of my own house, and I saw three men standing near there together—the prisoners are two of them—I am sure of that—one walked across the street, I am not sure which, one disappeared, and one I saw go into my house—the door was closed and locked by a spring lock—I put the key in and locked it myself when I went out—seeing this, I went up to the door and pushed it—it was locked and fastened—I then knocked with my knuckles—the door was opened, and Blackburn showed himself, and Phillips was close behind him—I laid hold of Blackburn by the collar directly, and told the other man I wanted him—he could not get quite away from me, because I had assistance directly—I afterwards examined my house; nothing had been disturbed—I</p>

I live at 1, Little Norfolk-place, Curtain-road, and am sixteen years old—I was standing next door but one to Mr. Barker's on this night; it was close upon 9; two or three minutes either way, I can't swear which—I saw three men standing at the door—I am sure the prisoners are two of them—I heard one of the men say, "I will be over at the corner, and you go on," and he went over to the corner—I can't say which one said those words, but be left the other two at the door, and went across the road—I then saw the two go into the house, without any noise—they must have opened the door, because I saw Mr. Barker shut the door and take the key to the fish-shop, a little higher up—I saw him go out—it must have been opened with a key—when the two men went in they shut the door—I then saw Mr. Barker go up to the door and push it, but it did not open—he then knocked with his knuckles, and it was opened—I saw him lay hold of some one at the door, and when I came out with the second box of bottles I saw that he had two.</p>

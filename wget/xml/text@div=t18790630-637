                  </hi>. I am a dork in the Savings Bank Department of the General Post Office, and live at Oxford Villa, Herbert Road, Shooters' Hill—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a deposit book of the Amalgamated Society of Car<lb></lb>penters and Joiners, Paddington Branch, Harrow Road, No 4895—when money is paid in to this account the entry is made in this book, and the clerk at Harrow Road sends it to the General Office, showing the amount paid in, the person paying it in, and the address of that person, and we then send the person an acknowledgment receipt note—I find an entry in words and figures of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid in on 24th September—it does not show by whom it was paid in—in the word "fifteen" the "t" is missing, and the figure 1 before the 5 appears to be in different ink—this acknowledgment receipt note for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was posted in due course to Mr. Gilling—the entry in the book appears to have been altered from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the book was sent back to our office by the secretary of the society some time in May I believe, and then it was discovered that it was wrong.</p>

I live at Maryland Road, Harrow Road, and am secretary to the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, Paddington Branch, of which the prisoner has been treasurer for over two years, and was so up to 7th May last—on April 15th I discovered an error in the deposit book after it had been returned—it was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short in the casting up</p>

               <p>on comparing it with the cash-book—I keep the cash-book—the money which is received in every fortnight is entered in the cash-book, and when it amounts to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it is the treasurer's duty to bank it—he would receive it from the check steward—the prisoner kept the treasurer's book—I was not secretary at the time this happened—I told the prisoner I could not make the book right—he said it was quite right, he had banked 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 24th September—after that I told him as he was going to bank some more money daring the fortnight we must get the acknowledgments together and see if they tallied with my cash-book previously to 29th April—he produced the acknowledgment you have and these two others, and they made my book right—on 30th April I went to the post-office in Johnson's Place and showed the books to Mr. Beach; he looked through the acknowledgments in the book and thought it was a mistake at the General Office—on 10th May, after the prisoner was out of office, the book was sent to the General Office—I thought it was an error on the part of the post-office—the deposit book is kept locked up in a box, but it is in the treasurer's custody while he is banking the money, and he produces it at the next meeting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> During the time the prisoner was treasurer he has constantly had money passing through his hands—I do not know of the books lying at Manchester, and the amounts accumulating during my term of office—Mr. Hinckston, since 1st January, has been trustee and referee—I cannot say that his position is higher than mine—it has not been a matter of dispute between us—I have seen him outside—he was not brought hen by the prosecution—I knew on 5th May that the prisoner was short in his Money by this, a letter which he wrote to me—I have a copy of it (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Mr. Coomber,—I am truly sorry to tell you I am unable to meet the cheque for Brother Anderson's funeral benefit," &amp;c.) On the receipt of that letter I communicated with three of the senior trustees of the branch and got them together at Paddington—one of them was Mr. Hinckston—I sent for the defendant and he said he had got no money at all—I suggested that we should borrow the money of the landlord of the house to bury the young man, and he lent 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not arranged that the defendant was to have time till Friday—I did not know of his being in difficulties, nor have I heard of it—on the following day we communicated with the chairman—I was the chief person who got up the emergency meeting—if the money had been paid the matter would have dropped—Mr. Hinckston was not deputed to act for the society in getting this money—I have heard since that he did get it—the meeting was convened for Wednesday, 7th May—Hinckston brought the money to that meeting—I saw him on Tuesday night and told him I had summoned the committee, and he promised to be there, so I did not think it necessary to summon him, and he came with the prisoner, and 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was handed over, which is the sum I asked for—I am not aware that 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was put on the table—Hinckston did not say where he got the money from—I was under the impression it was himself paying it—I do not know that Hinckston at that time knew of the altera<lb></lb>tion in the book, or that he had 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there that night—I thought that as a friend he was going to assist Gilling—he thought I was rather hasty in convening the meeting—I do not know that that was the reason that the 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not paid that night—the prisoner up to that time had always attended the meetings, and we never had any unpleasantness before—the prisoner was taken to the police-court by a detective on 6th June—on 10th</p>

               <p>May I sent the book back to the post-office to be rectified, and I have never had it since—I communicated with the Executive Council at Manchester at once, and carried out their instructions—I gave no receipt for the 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the trustees took the money and we made a minute in the minute book—at that time he had not the acknowledgments in his possession—he gave them to me on 29th April—he had the book in his possession between 15th and 29th April for the last time—I cannot say if he had destroyed the savings bank book, whether the only proceedings we could have taken against him would have been for being short of the money—there are provisions in the rules where we can take proceedings against men who do not give up books and documents—if he wanted to bank money he could have got the book on May 31st, at the ordinary branch meeting—we were very glad to get the 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, for the prisoner's sake—I have heard that 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was put on the table—the meeting lasted about half an hour—when I found out about there being another 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. wrong the matter was out of my hands—I don't know why Hinckston was not called at the police-court.</p>

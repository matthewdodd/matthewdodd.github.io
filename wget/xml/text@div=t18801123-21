               <p>Saturday evening I received a basket from the prisoner's wife about 6.30—it contained a little old coat and a bottle, or something like it—I did not take it out to see—I have known the prisoner and his wife as customers.</p>

As he owed me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he promised to bring me something for it the following day. He had not mentioned what it was, but on account of its being dark I could not see him. On Wednes<lb></lb>day night I went to receive some money from a customer of mine, and when I got home my wife went out on an errand. While she was out I had occasion to go to the area. I saw the basket with a long string to it. I took it into my room In the basket there was a painter's smock. I considered the man had left it I had bought the bacon of, as I had lent him that smock a few months before That is all I can say to account for the things being in my possession."</p>

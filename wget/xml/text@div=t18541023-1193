                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Atfield, of Holland-place, Lam<lb></lb>beth. On 12th Oct., about 9 o'clock, the prisoner came for some sheeps' kidneys—he had three first, and then he said he would have another—they came to sixpence, and he put down a half crown—my father, William Cross, was there, and he gave him two shillings change—the prisoner left the shop with a woman—I took up the half crown and bit it, and found it was bad—I followed the prisoner with the half crown in my hand—I gave him in charge, and gave the half crown to the officer—it was not out of my sight.</p>

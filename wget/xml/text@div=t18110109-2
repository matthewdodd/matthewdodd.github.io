            . On the evening of the 2nd of January, after my labour was over, I went to buy a jacket in Whitechapel, I called in at the King's Arms public-house in Wentworth-street, about nine o'clock, I staid there about an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any liquor before you went there - A. I had three glasses of gin, and some small beer in the course of the day, and one pint of porter there and no more. About a quarter after nine I pulled out a dollar, one of the men in the public-house knocked it out of my hand, and put out the light.</p>
               <p>Q. What men - did you know them - A. I had seen them there that night; the prisoner was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your dollar again - A. No; the candle was lighted again, and I made a sad noise with them about it; I made a complaint to every one there and the landlord heard me; I staid in the house till about half after ten, and then we were all turned out of the house; I was going towards home, I was knocked down; there were five of them; I cannot say who it was that knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in a public street then - A. Yes. After I recovered myself they followed me about an hundred yards, they then surrounded me and put me again a dead wall, stretched my arms out, one held me by my throat, and stretched my jaws open; the prisoner was at work at my pocket, his hands were in my pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what you had in your pocket at that time - A. Yes, three dollars and three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you counted that money after you lost the dollar in the room - A. No, but I am certain it was safe. I took the money out of my pocket, and put the remainder in, and I had not taken it out afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that the prisoner had his hands in your pocket, had any other person his hand in your pocket - A. There was another besides him, there was one hand in each pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing to you at this time - A. They said nothing, only surrounded me; the prisoner, after he had got the money from me, he said, let the b - r go; I immediately received a heavy blow on my head; the prisoner was standing at my right side, and had his hand in my pocket, where my money was; I heard the money rattle when his hand was in my pocket, and they left me with my breeches down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they search any of your other pockets - A. They searched all of them, they gave me a violent blow before they left me; I was quite senseless; when I came to myself I looked round, I found they were gone; I buttoned up my breeches and went home.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on a Wednesday night - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the Wednesday night did you see the prisoner again - A. On the Thursday morning following.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it, dark or light - A. A lightish night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it star light or moon light - A. I did not take that notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you light enough in the public house to distinguish the prisoner - A. Yes; before I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came out he followed you, and they said nothing to you - A. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not know his voice so as to know him again - A. There was a lighted lamp against the dead wall where they robbed me, it was about an an hundred yards from the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us what quantity of liquor you had in the day, I now ask you whether you was drunk or sober - A. I was as sober as I am now; I was neither drunk or sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in that state now - A. No. I had the liquor in me, drunk I was not. I saw the prisoner in Norton Faldgate on the Thursday, and the officer took him on the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you take so much notice of the prisoner in the house - A. Why they were tossing up for liquor I suppose, and I, like another foolish young man, was looking on.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you partly certain that the prisoner was one of the persons in the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your money in your breeches pocket or your jacket pocket - A. It was in my fob pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they let down your breeches before you heard the money rattle or afterwards - A. They undid my breeches at the very first start; the prisoner had his hand in my fob pocket, and after they left my pocket my breeches fell down, and when they left me all my money was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you at home on the evening of the 2nd of this month - A. Yes. I saw the prisoner at my house that evening. I did not see any thing of the prosecutor untill I heard him make a great noise, he was stripped to fight with some other man; I called the watchman and turned them all out. The prisoner made no complaint untill I called the watchman, he then told the watchman that he had dropped a dollar in the house, and somebody had picked it up, he made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090004"></xptr>no complaint of any body having used him ill.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was sitting in the house in company with a drover, he and I were having a pint of beer together, the prosecutor came in, he had three crown pieces in his hand, tossing with another man. The publican came in after the tossing was over.</p>

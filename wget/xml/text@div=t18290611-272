            , in 1815, for breaking open my house - I gave evidence on that trial - the prisoner is not that man: I am quite satisfied he is not the man, or else I do not know the man when I see him - I consider him not the man - I believe him not to be the man; I am satisfied of it.</p>


               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you are sure he is not the man? A. I mean to say I have my doubts about it; I conceive he is not the man - he is not the man; I have no doubt of it.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you sure the prisoner at the bar is not the man? A. I really believe him not to be the man - I think I can swear I am sure he is not: but fifteen years is a long time, and may much alter a person, but I believe him not to be the man; I will swear he is not the man - I have not seen the man since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the prisoner since? A. Yes; Mr. Wontner gave me leave to see him in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to hear he was in Newgate? A. His friends, no doubt, wished me to come and identify him; I am a fellowship-porter, and work at Billingsgate - I was suspended, but the suspension was taken off last hall-day, the second Wednesday in this month - it was for six months on suspicion of doing wrong, taking two Dutch-plaice - they were in a boat where I was measuring them, I brought them up, and they suspected I took them improperly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept any place of public entertainment lately? A. I have been to many such places; I kept a bear and badger bait, in St. Luke's, for three or four years- it is more than ten years ago; I got a reward for Tisley's conviction, and a Tyburn ticket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was it you were found out to be brought here? A. About a week or ten days ago, I think; I do not know who sent for me - I do not think it was the prisoner; he might occasion it - it was from some of his friends no doubt; any man might find me at Billingsgate - I never saw the prisoner at my house; a gentlemanly sort of man asked me to come here - he said a man was taken up, named

               <p>Q. Then what made you say you believed he came from his friends? A. I cannot understand these equivocations - he told me what he came upon; I should be sorry to swear he is the man, when I do not think he is; I did send the prisoner a bit of fish into Newgate a few days ago as I felt for him - I did not know him.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JACKSON. I knew John Tisley about sixteen years ago; I am a silk-weaver, and now work for Mr. Archibald, of Mitre-court; Tisley was convicted of burglary about sixteen years ago - I knew him very well- he was not an acquaintance; he was older than me a good deal, but he lived next door to me; I did not associate with him - the prisoner is not that man.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Tisley was your next door neighbour, perhaps you attended here and give him a character? A. No; I was but eleven or twelve years old, and lived with my father and mother; I have not seen him since - he was about the prisoner's height, but much stouter; he had dark chesnut hair and dark eyes.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know he was convicted here? A. I recollect Armstrong's father coming and apprehending my brother in the room of him, but he let him go again -I think it was sixteen years ago, but cannot be sure; I recollect him by a certain mark he had on his hair; he had some marks of white hair - he was not very intimate with our family, only his mother kept a mangle, and we took our things there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see this prisoner? A. I have known him about eighteen months: he lived in the neighbourhood, but not next door; he goes by the name of

               <p>COURT. Q. You knew Tisley very well, and know this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110113"></xptr>man very well? A.

            . I am not related to the prisoner - I am the mother of the man who was transported - I do not know the prisoner; I never saw him before to-day - I am quite sure he is not my son; I knew nothing about him till I was found out - they at first said it was my son, till I was brought up: my son was transported for life - I do not know what has become of him - I have not seen him from that day to this; I never saw the prisoner in my life- I went to Loader, and desired him to come and say it was not my son; there is not a bit of likeness between the prisoner and my son: I have had but one letter from him; that was ten yearsago - I live at No. 7, Turvey-street: I know Jackson; we live pretty near each other; not far off - that is not in the same street; I never saw the prisoner with Jackson; I am sure I never saw him before - I first heard of this about three weeks ago, and went to Loader -I have not been to Newgate since my son was there, nor sent any of my family there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you known Jackson? A. I did not know him till he came and told me to come here - my husband is still living; Jackson did not live next door to me - I keep a mangle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Jackson ever bring things to you to mangle? A. Why I forget; he knew my son - I do not think his father and mother ever lived next door to me, but the young man says he lived in the same neighbourhood - I lived in Winson-street, Spitalfields, at the time of my son's misfortune - I never heard of Jackson before this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you did not know Jackson when he was a boy, eleven years old? A. No.</p>

            . I am married, and live at Bethnalgreen; my husband is a painter. I am sister to Tisley, who was transported - I am older than him; it was seventeen years ago; or it may be not quite so much; I have only heard of him once since; I know nothing of the prisoner -I never saw him before; I have lived at Bethnal-green all my life - I do not see any likeness of my brother in him; he is very unlike him: I never saw the prisoner till this morning - I am sure he is not my brother, nor is he the man who was transported: I do not know Jackson; I lived with my brother before he was transported - my mother keeps a mangle; I came here with Jackson this morning - Loader did not come with us: the first time I saw Jackson was on Saturday; I do not remember his coming to my mother's about the time my brother was transported - I am now about thirty-seven years old; I and my brother lived with my mother: I have known Lydia Foulkes these eighteen years; I never saw Loader till Saturday; I never saw the prisoner in Newgate, and know nothing about fish being sent him there; I went to see my brother in prison about seventeen years ago - I have not been to see the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Look at the Jury - was your brother taller or shorter than the prisoner? A. I think he was much of the same height; rather stouter, and rather darker hair.</p>
               <p>Q. Not carrotty, or inclined to be sandy? A. Yes it was, but it was darker.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that man, and tell me, on your solemn oath, is not that your brother? A. No, he is not; I never saw him with my eyes before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Jackson did not live next door to you when your brother was tried? A. Not to my knowledge - I never saw him before Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. If it has been sworn that at the time your brother was convicted Jackson lived next door, and used to take clothes to be mangled by your mother, that is false, is it? A. I do not know; he might have done that - I cannot say; I lived with my mother then; Loader did not ask me to come here.</p>
               <p>MARTHA LOADER. I am the wife of the Samuel Loader. I am come to say the prisoner is not the man - I was only merely coming by this morning, and as I was in the yard they called me in. I gave evidence on Tisley's trial - the prisoner has not a feature like the man; I cannot say about his size, it is so long ago; the prisoner is an entire stranger to me - he is not acquainted with my husband in the least: no present has been sent to him in prison by me or any of my family.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM VANDERSTEEN. I am a silk manufacturer.</p>
               <p>The prisoner has worked for me for the last twelve months he is a man I much depended on for his work; I have not known him longer than twelve months; I do not know where he came from.</p>

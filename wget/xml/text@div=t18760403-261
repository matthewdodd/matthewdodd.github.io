I am a florist, and live at 10, Sandhurst Terrace, Kensal Green—on 18th September, the prisoner called on me and said he was very pleased that I had attended to his father's and late wife's graves, and he wished to settle my account, it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he tendered me this cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., written on plain paper, drawn on the Continental Bank, Lombard Street, signed, W. A.

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 352). On Wednesday morning, 7th July, about 4 o'clock, I was on duty in North Street, Ratcliffe, and saw the prisoner come out of the back premises of the Blacksmiths' Arms, with three coats on his arm—when he saw me he dropped them and ran, I followed him into Black Bull Court, about 200 yards from the prosecutor's—he jumped over a wall, and I lost him for about an hour; when I went with Cox, another constable, to a lodging in that court, I saw him looking out at a window—I went up to him, and told him I wanted him for a burglary—he said, "All right, I will go"—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the coats.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Blacksmiths' Arms, Stepney. On 7th July, about 5 or 6 minutes past 12 o'clock, I went to bed, having fast<lb></lb>ened all the doors, and left everything safe—I was called by Eyres, and came down about 4 o'clock in the morning; the back door was open, and a policeman was standing in the passage with my three coats on his arm; a keg of <hi rend="italic">Old Tom</hi> had been shifted from the bar into the skittle ground—anybody who got in at the back door could go to the bar, and have access to the house—these are my coats, they hung in the bar parlour the night before—I missed a decanter of brandy, and a decanter of rum, and a four gallon stone bottle of rum was carried into the passage from the bar—I went into Black Bull Court with the policeman, and he saw the prisoner looking out at a window in his shirt sleeves, with a handkerchief on his head; the policeman said, "That is the man"—there were two policemen—Eyres was quite sober—the back door had been opened by a skeleton key—it had been locked, and the door bolted inside—I cannot say how that was unbolted, I am sure it was bolted at half past 10 o'clock the night before—there was a little hole near the bolt, I do not know whether they could get their fingers in.</p>

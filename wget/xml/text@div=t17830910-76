               <p>I pawned the coat for half a guinea, on the 17th of July; I was coming down Drury-lane, and I met one of my shipmates, he asked me to drink some hot; we went and had three pots of brandy hot and a quartern of rum, he said, he was going to sea again, I said, I was out of work, I worked for Mr. Davis, in Park-lane; he pulled out an outside jacket and put it on; he desired me to pawn his coat, and he would give me a silk handkerchief, and when he went down to enter on board a man of war he would send me the money; I said, if he would sell it I would give him a guinea and a half; Lane knew me from a child, I told him it was my coat and that I had but just bought it, I bought a gilt breast buckle the day before, with five stones in it, of the prosecutor; I happened to stop to make a little water being very much intosticated, and the prosecutor said, I know you have stole my coat; the mots arose and asked me the matter, I told them the whole affair, that I had bought a coat which had been stolen, but that I did not know it; the prosecutor said he would send me to gaol, and the people said break his windows, I did take a handful of mud and bit the window, but did not break it; the people told me to go away, I said, I was innocent; I might have walked away and gone to sea, or to America, where I have been, and nobody would have followed me:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100116"></xptr> I did not think I should have been tried to day, or else I should have had witnesses and my Captain to appear to my character.</p>

               <p>Jury. I understood the first evidence said, that the witness had confessed this before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court. The confession has been searched for, having been reduced into writing, and it cannot be found, therefore you cannot take into your consideration any confession at all.</p>

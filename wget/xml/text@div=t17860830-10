               <p>I lost my pocket book on the 17th of July; I went to the Bank to receive a dividend of thirty pounds; I was paid in a thirty pound Bank note, and when I received it I put it into this book, my banker's book, where I keep my running cash, and I put the book in this outside pocket, with my hand over it for fear of having my pocket picked, going from the Bank; after I got seven or eight yards from the front of the <placeName id="t17860830-10-crimeloc51">Change gate</placeName>

               <p>Court. If you put your hand so instantly back into your pocket, I should think you must feel his hand? - No, Sir; I drew my hand out and put it back again directly, and the book was gone that instant.</p>
               <p>Did you feel the hand at all or not? - I did not feel the hand.</p>
               <p>You felt or saw nothing till you missed the book? - I did not; after I had got the book from him, I said, now, what have you to say for yourself? why, says he, I found it; aye, says I, so you did, in my pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300019"></xptr>What did you draw your hand out of your pocket for? - It was a very warm day; I drew my hand out to cool it.</p>
               <p>Was your handkerchief in that pocket? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you did not draw out the book with your hand? - No, I can make a safe oath of that; I am very clear in that.</p>
               <p>But in the act you describe of just raising your hand, and putting it immediately back again, how could there be time for any person to get that book out and you not feel it? - I apprehend he knows his business very well, what I may say, a good workman; I have two witnesses who saw the transaction, and they went with me and took him before the sitting Alderman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheridan, Prisoner's Counsel You walked from the Bank to the Change? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you stop at all? - No.</p>
               <p>You saw the prisoner standing by you when you missed it? - I saw him close to me; I did not stand still, nor he did not stand still; no person was near me on the side where he was.</p>
               <p>What is the reason you apprehend he knew his business? - Because he was so sudden in his motions.</p>

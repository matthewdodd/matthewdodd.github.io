               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of your own knowledge? - A. No; I have suspected him before, and I have forgiven him once before.</p>
               <p>- WILLIAMS sworn. - I am Mr. Swallow's clerk; I was out on the 25th of July; one of my fellow-servants informed me that he had suspicion; I immediately said, on Waterfield; he said, yes: I said, I am sure he has something about him, besides what he ought to have; as soon as I had got to the accompting-house, I found Waterfield was gone, and I told a man to run after him; I was apprehensive that the man could not find him, so I run out myself, and called him back; as he was coming into the warehouse, he pulled out a piece of soap from his breast; I immediately said, Waterfield, it is of no use; he put it down in the accompting-house, and said, that is all I have taken; I informed him I was not satisfied with that; he put his hand into his breeches, and pulled out another piece of soap; I produce the soap.</p>
               <p>Q. It is your property? - A. It is the soap that he was working on that day; it was warm when he cut it, and it was warm when he brought them into the accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You forgave the poor man, and let him go home? - A. He begged of us not to tell Mr. Swallow.</p>
               <p>Q. He was let go? - A. He was, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he lived in the house? - A. Twenty-five years.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have suspected him these five years that I have had the business.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What wages had he? - A.Nineteen shillings a week.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence, but called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

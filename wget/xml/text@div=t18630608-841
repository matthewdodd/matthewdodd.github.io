                  </hi>. I live at 6, Park-road-terrace, Forest-hill—I am an attendant in the British Museum—I and the prisoner married two sisters—the prisoner's wife occupies a house next to mine at Forest-hill—there is a garden attached to each house, divided by a wall about five feet high—my cellar window looks out upon the garden, underneath the back parlour window—it is about ten yards from the garden wall; the kitchen is built</p>

Shortly after 3 o'clock, on the morning of 20th May, I went to the prosecutor's house, in consequence of an alarm of fire—when I got there the fire was out—I accompanied Mr. Neale in making a search of the premises—I found that the house had been entered by the back kitchen window; the cross-pieces of the frame work had been broken out, and the whole four panes of glass smashed—the bottom part of the heavy framework had a slight cut in the lower left-hand corner—when that window was removed a person could get in or out—I found that the gaspipe had been out in two places, one about three or four inches from the meter, and the other about twelve or fifteen inches—one was a cross cut and the other lengthways—these are the pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it appeared to be done by some rough instrument; not cut clean as with a knife—I was present when the inspector found this shoemaker's knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) lying about a yard from the meter; it has been notched like a saw; such an instrument as this would produce those cuts—I saw this knife fitted into the cuts in the framework of the cellar window, and they exactly corresponded—the gas was turned off when I got there—if it had been turned on the flame from these outs would have been about a foot below the ceiling above it—I found the boards there burnt for three or four yards immediately over the pipe—there had also been a second fire close against the door leading from the passage to the cellar—there was a mat outside that cellar-door, which had been slightly burnt—there was a pecu<lb></lb>liar smell of some strong spirit having been near that spot—I did not find any spirit there—I afterwards found some at the prisoner's shop at King's-cross; it had a very strong turpentine smell—I found this long meter key lying in the prosecutor's cellar, about a yard from the meter—there were a number of wine and beer bottles there; some appeared to have been recently broken, by the necks being knocked off—I examined the outside of the premises—I found traces on a dust bin at the back of the scullery in Mr. Neale's garden, of some person having got over the wall—the dust-bin is within about a yard of the top of the wall; a person could easily get over—on the other side of the wall I found the footmarks of one person; there were not more than two or three distinct footmarks on the mould close to the wall, within a foot and half of it—the footmarks pointed towards the wall—on the Friday morning succeeding the fire, after apprehending the prisoner, I went to his shop, 217, Gray's-inn-lane—it was a shoemaker's—in a cupboard in a parlour at the back of the shop, I found this</p>

On Wednesday morning, 20th May, I was on duty at Forest-hill, about a quarter to 3 o'clock, and met the prisoner coming from Forest-hill towards London, about a mile from the house where the fire was—the road he was coming would lead me to that house—I asked him where he came from—he said, "From Anerly-gardens' (that would be his furthest way round)—I asked him where he was going to—he said, "To Covent-garden-market," and that he must be there by half-past 5—he had a bottle of wine in his hand with the neck knocked off—he said, "Will you drink?"—I took it from his hand and held it up to the light, and saw the cork floating in the wine—I thought it might be drugged, so did not take any—he left the bottle with me, and I threw it over the fence into the long grass—on Friday morning I went to the place and found the bottle; it contained about a quarter of a pint of port wine—the prisoner appeared tipsy and very restless, he wanted to be getting on—this was under a gas-lamp—I kept him in conversation four or five minutes, and am certain he is the man—no one could make a mistake in him—he said, "Is there a chance of my getting a cab?"—I said, "Not this time of morning," and he started off running towards London—he had a double-breasted overcoat—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) is the same coat, only it was not torn then—I know it by the button<lb></lb>holes being worn—I noticed that when if was on, the top button was buttoned—I was at the station-house at Sydenham on the Friday morning, and saw the prisoner reading a board outside the station gate, which had no reference to the fire—I told the sergeant that that was the man, and he was then taken in custody—I identified him the moment I saw him; he was not dressed in the same way—I went that afternoon with the inspector and sergeant to the prisoner's house, and found this coat—I noticed that the sleeve smelt of tur<lb></lb>pentine.</p>

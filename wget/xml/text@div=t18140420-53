On the 26th of October last, the prisoner came to our house, about seven o'clock in the morning; she came to ask leave to boil a few potatoes; when she came my father was gone out to work; he went out about six o'clock in the morning to work. When she came, there was no one else in the house but my mother and me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner stay with you - A. She stopped until about half after eight. I lent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200032"></xptr>her a wooden dish to carry the potatoes. Me and my mother went out when she did; we locked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window below secured - A. Yes. I looked about the house before I went out, every thing was safe. I returned about half after six in the evening. When I returned, the house door was open, the window had an iron hasp to it. The pane of glass over the iron hasp was broken, and the iron hasp was undone; the window was not open. The glass was broken, and the door wide open. The window appeared as if it had been opened. I found it shut, and the door wide open. The post of the door was twisted of one side; so that she could get the lock out of the outside post; the post of the door was twisted.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose any person had twisted the post from outside or inside - A. From the inside. I and my mother came home together. I missed my mother's cloak first.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what you lost of your own property - A. I looked for my own property; my box was empty. I had seen my box in the morning. I missed four gowns; the best of the gowns were worth eight shillings; I missed three petticoats, value seven shillings; I missed one bonnet, value eight shillings; four habit-shirts, three of them worth one shilling; four pair of stockings; I missed three shifts, value eight shillings; five caps, four of them worth two shillings. These things were my own property.</p>

                  </hi> I am an India-rubber manufacturer, of 89, Southampton Row—in 1849 I patented an article called an accu<lb></lb>mulator, which was exhibited in the Exhibitions of 1851 and 1862, and also at the Paris Exhibition of 1855—one application of it was applied to door-springs, which I called "R. E. Hodges' patent accumulator ABC door-springs"—that was on all the wrappers I had printed and put round the accumulators when I sent them out—I know the defendant—he pur<lb></lb>chased door-springs of me for eleven years, ending in 1866; then I refuted, for some reason or other, to supply him—he then said that he should be left to his own resources, or thrown on his own resources—these door springs are not my manufacture—they are in pattern the same, but the workmanship is inferior, and they are not marked as mine are on the rubber with my name—this is one of mine (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not authorise the printing of this wrapper by Bell—I never authorised the prisoner or any one else to make a wrapper for me, or to sell goods made by other persons as mine—the printing of the two wrappers corresponds exactly, except that my address is at the bottom of one, and Bell, the printer's name, is at the bottom of the other—they wore in Class 28 at the Great Exhibition of 1851, and in class 10 at the Paris Exhibition of 1855—when I sold them to the defendant I sold them in the same wrappers—he was perfectly familiar with my wrappers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I see all your accumulators have on them "R. E. Hodges, Patent, London? "<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on the article itself, and the size A—the defendant marks his A, B, and C—my name is cast on the brackets—I have always manufactured them in the same way—there was a little change only after my patent expired—I no longer put patent, but patentee—I still called them R. E. Hodges' patent accumulator—I took my patent out in 1849, and it expired in 1863; it was not renewed—the specification is not confined to door-springs—I consider my trade mark to be the words "R. E. Hodges, patent accumulator ABC door-springs"—anybody has a right to make them now the patent has expired—they are known as A B C door-springs, and those made by me contain my name—as regards the article I claim the words "A B C door-springs" as part of my trade mark—I don't recollect any other article in a different trade in which the letters of the alphabet denote the size instead of figures—I tried to get something special, and marked them at first A and B, and afterwards C—I never marked any D—the defendant's name is not on his.</p>

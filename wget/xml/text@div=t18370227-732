                  </hi>. I am a silk-weaver. On the 28th of January I was near Mr. Pige's shop, at the corner of Swan-street, Bethnal-green—the prisoners accosted me at the door—the man asked me if I had change for a half-crown—I said I had not, but I would get change, and, having a half-crown in my hand, I got change at the Black Dog—I came back and gave the man the money, and he gave me a half-crown—the money was one shilling, two sixpences, and six penny-pieces—the shilling was given to the man, and the woman had the two sixpences and the six penny-pieces—the man said to the woman, "I will take the shilling, and you go and get what you want"—I went to Mr. Pige's shop, and, on putting the half-crown to my mouth, I found it bend—I came out and saw the prisoners—they saw me, and both began running—I ran after them, and met the policeman in Bacon-street—I gave him the bad half-crown, and he took the prisoners in my sight—as they were going back, another half-crown fell from one of them, when they had walked about a dozen steps after they were taken—I was walking behind them—there was no one between me and them—I am sure it dropped from one of them, because there was not a soul in the street, but the prisoners, the policeman, and me—I took it up and gave it Leach.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 97.) I was on duty about half-past ten o'clock that evening—the prosecutor pointed out the prisoners to me, and gave me this half-crown—I took the prisoners into custody, and the lad said, "You gave me a bad half-crown for my money"—"Me," said the man, "give you a bad half-crown?"—he said, "Yes"—I said "You must go back with me to Mr. Pige's shop"—I took the prisoner's arm, and his hands were under his apron—I thought they were in his pocket—I said, "Keep your hand out of your pocket," and immediately this other half-crown fell—the prosecutor took it up, and gave it me—I took them back, and found on the man a good shilling, and on the woman two sixpences and six penny-pieces—they gave their address, "No. 6, Spicer-street"—I made inquiries, but could not find that they lived there.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. Q. Where do you live? - A. I live with Mr. Gaimes; he keeps a jeweller's shop in St. Paul's church-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 15th of August do you remember any body coming into the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. At what time of the day? - A. As near as I can guess, about one or two o'clock, the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man? - A. I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. What did he ask for? - A. He asked to look at some pearl broches; I took out a tray, and shewed him a great number of articles; when I had shewn him some, he asked to look at more; there was another young lady in the shop, and she took out the tray in which this diamond locket was; he looked out articles to the amount of twenty-three pounds; when he had looked them out, he gave me a direction to send them to Mrs. Rumley, No. 25, in the Change, pointing out to the Old-Change; when I had selected these things together, I missed this diamond locket; he asked me first of all, whether I could talk French, and I said, no; he said then, he would be in the way to interpret; he said they were for a lady that was going to the East-Indies; he gave me this direction, and went out.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you observed this diamond locket before? - A. Yes, the moment the tray was taken out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss it? - A. The moment he left the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been in the shop? - A. About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. During the half hour he had been in the shop, had any body else been in? - A. No, there was not any person whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody came during the time he was there? - A. No, not a soul.</p>
               <p>Q. You are certain that nobody came in from the time he came in, to the time he went out? - A. There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed it the moment he went out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not attempt to pursue him? - A. No, I supposed he would make off as soon or before I got out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see which way he went? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You took no steps to apprehend him that night? - A. I took this direction, and found it was false; I am perfectly satisfied he is the man, though I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was gone, what did you do? - A. I put the things together; I went to the place where the direction was, and found it was false.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any body at this No. 25? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lived there? - A. I do not know; there was no such person as Mrs. Rumley; I saw a woman and a child there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give his directions in writing? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. You have stated to my Lord that nobody came into the shop for the half hour he continued in the shop? - A. There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name of that young lady that served in the shop with you? - A. Mary-Ann Gibbs.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place was Mary-

             in the shop with you, at the moment the prisoner first came in? - A. Not at the first moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you happened to shew him any articles before she came into the shop? - A. Out of the first tray.</p>
               <p>Q. In what tray was the diamond locket, mentioned in the indictment, deposited? - A. In the second tray.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that, before Miss Gibbs came into the shop, that you had not opened the second tray at all? - A. I did not, because she gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if I understand you right, Miss Gibbs drew out the second tray; at the time she drew out the second tray, are you able to state whether the diamond locket was there? - A. I am sure it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you parcelled up a variety of articles to the amount of twenty-three pounds, to take to Mrs. Rumley? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any such thing amongst the things which he had selected, as a diamond locket? - A. No, there was not; those were pearl broches he had selected to purchase.</p>
               <p>Q. When and where did you see the prisoner at the bar? - A. Not till Tuesday, the 11th of September, when we saw him at Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This happened on the 15th of August? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From the 15th of August, to the 11th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120033"></xptr>September, you had not seen the prisoner at the bar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated that the prisoner at the bar was in the shop half an hour; when you saw him at Marlborough-street, had you any doubt whatever in your mind about the prisoner? - A. None in the least; the moment I saw him, I said it was him; I pointed to him, and said it was the person.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. Q. Where do you live? - A. I live with Mr. Gaimes, I serve in his shop; he keeps a jeweller's shop in St. Paul's Church-yard; I was there on the 15th of August last; I remember the prisoner coming into the shop when Miss Coles was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. I know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner at the bar was in the shop when you came in, when Miss Coles was there? - A. Quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you came into the shop, what was passing? - A. He was looking at some bracelets, out of the first tray.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed after you came into the shop? - A. I took the second tray out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to swear whether or not there was a diamond locket in that second tray? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are certain? - A. Yes, quite certain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. Do you happen to know what the bought price of that was? - A. It cost twenty-eight guineas; the prisoner looked out some goods, and ordered a quantity more to be sent, to the amount of twenty-three pounds; he had the bill made out; he had not money enough in his pocket, and ordered them to be sent to the Old-change, No. 25, where, he said, there was Rumley on the door.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you the bill of parcels here that was made out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was destroyed, I have no doubt; we have a number of false directions of this kind, we take no account of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. (To Miss Gibbs.) Q. Are you quite sure that there was no such article purchased as a diamond locket any way? - A. No, he never even mentioned it, he left the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. He left the shop, and what then? - A. He left the shop, and then we missed the diamond locket immediately; we did not miss it before he left the shop in any way whatever; after he was gone, we looked out the goods; he was to have some more handsome things brought, he said, besides what he purchased.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you accompanied the last witness, Miss Cole; did she pack up the goods pursuant to order? - A. Yes, she went away with them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner? - A. Last Tuesday, at Marlborough-street; I am confident it is the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the slightest doubt in the world? - A. None in the least.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You had never seen him from the 15th of August till the 11th of September? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you are sure he is the same person? - A. Quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen him before? - A. No.</p>

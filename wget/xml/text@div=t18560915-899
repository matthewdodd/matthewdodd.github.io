                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 130). On Thursday morning, 28th Aug, about a quarter or 10 minutes past 3 o'clock, I was on duty in Brick-lane; and saw a man run from the passage of No. 26, Brick-lane—it is a passage between Nos. 25 and 26, and leads to a factory at the back, and is in the parish of Christchurch, Spitalfields—I sprung my rattle, and he ran towards Osborn-place, and down Halton-street—another constable caught him—I kept him in view all the time—he got away again, and I tried to stop him but he ran past me till he came to Thrawl-street, and I ran and got past him—he came back the same way, but not so far, and was stopped at the top of Thrawl-street—the same officer tried to stop him, but he ran back towards me, and ran in at the door of a house in Thrawl-street, into a passage, and I found him in a stooping position on the stairs, on his hands and feet—it was dark, but there was gas light—I kept him nearly in view the whole time, and am quite certain he is the man I chased, and as he passed me in Thrawl-street, I saw something similar to this crowbar in his hand, it looked like iron—I took him out from a kind of coal place under the stairs, and found this crowbar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under where he was—I took him to the station, then returned, and found that No. 26, Brick-lane had been broken into; a quantity of watch works were strewed about the floor, and some broken glass; the things had been knocked about and upset—the ledge of the back parlour window shutter was burst, and there were marks on it, which I afterwards compared with this crowbar, and found that they were just the very width—there are some wooden boards in the passage</p>

I was on duty, and heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner run from the door, with something in his hand resembling this crowbar—he ran across Brick-lane; I followed him—he turned short round, and ran down Osborn-place, which is my beat; I followed him 200 yards down, and was about to take him into custody, when he struck me twice with an iron her, once on the arm and once on the right shoulder—I believe it was intended for my head, but I put my arm up—I ran back, got constable 130, and he went up Osborn-place—another constable made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at him, but passed him—he turned round again, and ran into Thrawl-street, and into No. 7; I lost sight of him then for two seconds; another constable came up, turned his light on, and I saw him in a cupboard; under the stairs, in a crouching position—there was no one running but the prisoner—this crowbar was found underneath where he was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch maker and jeweller of No. 26, Brick-lane. On the Wednesday night, near 12 o'clock, my premises were all safe—after I retired to bed, I heard my dog bark, he made a great noise, and got out of bed and checked him—my wife did not feel satisfied, and she get up, looked out at the back window, and saw a light—I got out of bed, and saw a light reflected on a shed at the back—my wife said; "The house is in flames!"—I rushed down stairs, and as I was going down, a case if watch movements, which was on the counter, fell on the floor—I opened the street door, and two men rushed out; one was stout, with a cap and jacket, one seemed taller than the other—I called out, "Police! stop thief!" but being in my night dress, could not follow—from the prisoner's size I should say that he is one of them, but I could net swear to him—my window shutter was wrenched at the bottom, and the bolt bent, so that they could lift it—I have compared the crowbar, and the dent fits exactly—it was deep, it had wrenched away the paint, and gone into the wood above; then is a stone sill at the bottom—crowbars used by carpenters are not turned up in this way—I never saw one turned up like this, and the point is hardened steel—I am of opinion that the marks must have been made by an instrument of this kind and size—I missed nine watches and seventeen silver spoons, two butter knives, one with a silver handle, and one mother of pearl, two silver snuff boxes, and one scent box, value altogether 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my window looks to the front of Brick-lane—by opening the parlour window they got an entrance into the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at 12, Fireball-court, Shore<lb></lb>ditch—the prisoner lived in the same house—he is my landlord—on Mon<lb></lb>day, 23rd May, between 11 and 12 at night, I was in the one-pair room, where Mr. Bream lives—the prisoner insulted my wife—we did not quarrel, but we spoke sharp words to each other, and he promised that there was something in store for me the following morning—I saw him next day, about 1 o'clock, in Houndsditch, and he came across to me, and we made friends again, and shook hands—I was going to a public-house to have some beer, and he asked me to his own place—there was a man named Moore there—I had no beer there—as I entered the place the parties were drunk—they quarrelled with me, Mrs. Leary and Mrs. Donovan did, through the words that happened the night before—Moore was sitting down drunk, and he got up beside the women, and we had some words together, and my wife came down stairs and put me outside the street-door—after I had been out for some time, I went and stood up against the door—no; I made a mistake, I stood outside the door, till Moore came out—he did not come out; he stood in the passage—he made a kick at me, as I thought, and I put my hand to return the blow to him—Bream jumped out, and took hold of me and took me up to the next door, and Moore went on his way—I then returned back and stood at the street door—that was about half-past 4 o'clock—I stood at the door until close upon half-past 6, or between that and 7, with my hands in my pocket, and three halfpence, looking out for my wife, to get some more halfpence from her, to make up enough for a pint of beer—as I stood there the prisoner came up; the passage is very narrow, two abreast can't stand in it—I had to stand on one side to give him liberty to pass—he walked in, returned in a few minutes, pressed me dose to the wall and drove something through me that he had—it went through my coat, trousers stomach and all—I turned round and said, "Did not I make room enough for you to pass by without hurting me to that degree;" I felt hurt and kept rubbing myself—he stepped outside the door, put hit hand that he did the deed with under his leather apron, and said, "You b—b—I will break the eye in your head, and six like you."—he then went away—I saw my wife coming out of a neighbour's door opposite, and I followed her for the halfpence for the beer—we went up to a friend's room—I then put my hand in my left breeches pocket, and when I took it out it was full of blood—my wife then undid my trousers and said I was stabbed—I found that I was stabbed in the stomach—I was taken to Dr. Brown's, in St. Mary Axe, and from there to the London Hospital, where I was attended by Mr. Gill—I staid there till the next afternoon—I was afterwards attended at home, by Mr. Hadlow, a surgeon.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where were you going? A. Home; it might be a quarter past twelve o'clock, or rather more - I had had part of a pot or two of beer at a shopmate's house: I am certain we had no more; I was not tipsy then - I never said that it was a woman that robbed me - the women muzzled me - no woman came in the room till I had sprung off the bed - I am married.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 22d of August, I was crying half-past twelve o'clock in Hackney-road - some one called me; the watchman said "This man has been robbed in the second court in Kingsland-road" - the prosecutor did not appear drunk - he spoke very well; when the Bow-street officer went, I saw the two prisoners - the prosecutor did not know them till they got up, and put their clothes on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Jefferies, the officer, say he would have nothing more to do with it? A. Yes, in coming out of the court he did say so; the prosecutor was there, and must have heard it; he was rambling on at a terrible rate - no property was found - not on any man; he said he had been robbed in the last house, and his property was brought and put into another house.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I went to the house about ten minutes past two o'clock - the prosecutor said he had been robbed of a suit of clothes - we knocked several times, but could get no admittance; when we got in, we found the two prisoners in bed with a young man; the prosecutor swore to Mears, but not to Hibbert till about half-past ten o'clock the next morning - they denied having anything to do with him: he appeared sober at two o'clock, when he spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search both the houses? A. We searched two houses - there was a third house we did not go into.</p>

On the 1st of December, I saw ninety-nine; I saw them on Thursday, the 1st of December, all safe in the field; there were three gates to the field; when I saw them they were all secure. On Saturday I went to the field; I counted them, and found twenty-one missing. I gave Mr. Duckwell information. I came to London on the Sunday week; in consequence of information I received at Smithfield, I went to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. You have marks for those he rears, and other marks for those he buys - A. I saw a part of the marks, a part was cut out, but enough left; I could ascertain it was my master's marks.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. In consequence of information that I received, I went to Mr. Buckley's house in Virgil-place, Mary-le-bone; they are very small houses, this house consisted of two rooms, a shop, a room above it, and another place as a slaughter-house, that was at the back of the premises; the slaughter-house was behind the shop, and a room above. When I went there, the prisoner was not at home; I searched the shop, and found twenty-one skins; them skins I afterwards produced at the office; the skins were most of them in a very putrid state; there was the appearance of slaughtering by the congealed blood, and plucks hanging up, as though sheep had been recently killed there. I took the skins to my own house. I apprehended the prisoner on Friday the 9th of December, at the house of

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live in Taylor's house - A. No; the prisoner lived next door. Taylor keeps a horse and cart; the prisoner was his next door neighbour.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you went there the prisoner was not at home; you searched the shop, and found the skins - A. Yes. I apprehended the prisoner about a quarter of an hour before twelve on the 9th of December, I told him I apprehended him for having stolen some sheep; I took him to the shop where the skins were then deposited, and asked him how he came possessed of the property; he said, he bought twenty-one sheep of a man in Oxford-street on the Thursday week previous to his apprehension, he said he gave forty-two pounds for them, he had no receipt, nor did he know the man he had purchased them off.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110016"></xptr>Q. That is the day they were lost - A. Yes. The putrid state the skins were in I was ordered by the magistrate to keep as many as were sufficient; I have kept four; I shewed the bailiff and shepherd the skins. This is one of the skins.</p>
               <p>Q. to Duckwell. Look at that skin, does the mark answer - A. Here is the letter P on the near side; this is the brand. The mark on the skin answers to this brand; this is one of our own breeding, it is a half bred merino.</p>

               <p>(The skin and the brand handed to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The mark of the brand and being a half bred merino, you have no doubt of it being your master's sheep, have you - A. No, I have not. This is another of the skins; this one I bought of Mr. West in Smithfield, it is marked with O on the shoulder, with red ochre, and over the loin, and on the hip with ochre, and it has a mark on the head that I gave it at the time myself. I bought five of Mr. West; the other four remained in the field.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Mr. Duckwell, were you always equally clear to the marks of these sheep, were not you asked at Bow-street about these skins - A. Yes; I was then as positive to the marks as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q, You found four that you bought of Mr. West in the field, and therefore you think that is one of your sheep that you lost - A. I am certain it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you sold none of the half bred merinos - A. Yes, some, not lately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley Did you find any one with particular horns on one of the sheep skins - A. Yes; one that I could swear to out of forty thousand; it is a circular horn that I bred myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Were is that horn now - A. The skin was in a putrid state.</p>
               <p>Q. The horn it not is it - A. No; it is not worth while bring the horn without the skin.</p>

               <p>Q. Who occupied them two rooms - A. A person that went out of them last; the prisoner took them rooms; when he took them, I cannot say, but the shop and slaughter-house he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he occupy them on the 2nd of December - A. That I cannot say. On Friday morning the sheep disturbed me of my rest, they awaked me out of my sleep about a quarter before three o'clock; there were no sheep when I went to bed about ten o'clock, they were not there then; the first I heard of them was about three o'clock in the morning; I never saw them. That is all I know of them.</p>
               <p>AUGUSTNS READ. I am a pig-killer. I know the prisoner; he came on a Saturday to me, I can hardly say when it was; he asked me if I would assist him in killing a few sheep; I told him I was but of little use to him; I said, sheep killing was a thing I did not understand; if it was any thing in the Pig killing line I could help him. He told me he bought I could do a little towards it; I did; I helped kill nine sheep and took the fat off them; the prisoner and me were together; I killed them underneath the apartment of the last witness, next door to where I live.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a person of the name of Taylor lives next door - A. Now he lives up at the corner. The sheep that I killed was afterwards carried to market twelve of them. I never saw any more than twelve; Taylor took the twelve to market.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Where did you see these twelve - A. In the place where I killed them, and I saw but twelve.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Alexander Lowe, who lives in the parish of St. Mary, Rotherhithe—I have lived with him ten years. On the night of the 21st of December I shut up the house before ten o'clock—I am sure I bolted the door and secured the windows—I and an old lad named Beckham, a relation of Mr. Lowe's, were the last persons up—we both went to bed together—she is not here—between one and two o'clock in the morning I heard a noise like a crushing of wood and hammering—it seemed to come from the lower part of the house—I slept on the first floor, and the old lady slept with me—I got up, and after hearing the noise about a quarter of an hour, I called to my master, who slept in the next room, to know if he was up—he did not answer me—at last I heard some-body talking in the alley—I then got up, but I did not go down stairs till seven o'clock in the morning—I then found a chisel on the kitchen stairs, which is below the parlour floor—I gave it to Mr. Lowe—I found a piece of candle in the back yard, and the back-kitchen window was broken open—I am sure I had shut the shutters of that window the night before—they are inside shutters—the passage door was unfastened—I am sure I had shut that—I found marks, of a chisel on he panels between the shop and the passage of the house—my master is a slop-seller—I had left some towels in a basket, and I found them, about the floor, and cupboards doors were open in the kitchen—nothing but plates and dishes were kept in those cup<lb></lb>boards—they were not moved—I had left the cupboards shut at night—when I went into the yard I found a piece of candle under the kitchen window, and a piece of sand—paper out of a lucifer box, and the panel of the window shutter which it here—I do not Know the prisoner—nobody lives in the house but myself, my master, and the old lady.</p>

I was on duty, at Rotherhithe, on the night of the 21st December, and between one and two o'clock I saw the prisoner in Charlotte—row, about five or six yards from Mr. Lowe's house—I did not know him before—he was coming up the row in a direc<lb></lb>tion from Mr. Lowe's—there was some person with him whom I have not seen since—I did not hear them speak to each other—the prisoner had an old pair of shoes in his right hand, and this chisel in his left hand—</p>

               <p>he dropped it and the shoes—I told him to put the shoes on, as he had none on—I did not have them afterwards—the other man made his escape—I secured the prisoner, and searched him at the station-house—I found in his coat-pocket some tallow—it appeared to be part of a candle from the shape of it—there was some tallow on the chisel—he did not say any thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 22nd of December I went to Mr. Lowe's house—I have brought the pieces of panel her which I found outside the kitchen window—here are two pieces, they are pieces of a shutter—they have marks on them, corresponding with the chisel which Taylor has produced—there was enough of the shutter taken out to make way for a man to come in—they were inside shutters they must have got through the glass part to get to the shutter—I observed footmarks in the back yard—marks of feet without a shoe—the yard has a close-boarded fence seven or eight feet high round it.</p>

I had been to a singing place at a public-house, and was returning home, and as I came along, I turned up the court to ease myself, the policeman laid hold of me, and said I had dropped the chisel—I never had my shoes off, nor ever had any chisel in my possession.</p>

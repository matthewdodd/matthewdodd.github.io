            , a person belonging to Mr. Wood, informed me there was somebody stealing coals from the craft; Vent then ran over the craft that I was in, with Bellamy, it was a very light night, me and Bellamy rowed the boat out, and Vent was in the same boat, and he loaded his blunderbuss; the two men that had been robbing the craft were in a skiff, and had rowed away; they were in blue jackets, and long blue trowsers, they were shoving the skiff from the craft in which the coals were.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that craft from the craft in which you afterwards found the deceased? - A. Nearly one hundred yards; the men made their escape over the craft where the deceased lay; there were two men in the boat that had the coals; they ran the boat ashore; I saw one of them make for the shore; the other disappeared, I did not know what became of him; one was a good deal taller than the other, and the tallest of the two went ashore.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the deceased one of those persons? - A. No. I remained in the boat that we went out in; the watchman gave me charge of the skiff with the coals in it; Bellamy went about his business; being towards high water, he had the craft to moor; the prisoner at the bar went in pursuit of the man that disappeared; he could not find the man, and he said to the watchman belonging to the other wharf, an man of the name of Brodie, why do you not come and assist; the man said he could not get at him; says I, I will put you over in the boat, which I did, and brought him to the assistance of the other watchman: I saw them go over several of the craft; the prisoner fired his blunderbuss at the time that they made their escape; as the men got away, he loaded the piece again, and then they went over the cabin of the deceased's barge, and as they stumbled over the cabin, they awaked the deceased, and I heard the deceased say, if I had fire-arms, I would shoot you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased at that time? - A. No, I believe he was in his bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say whether he was in such a situation that he could have seen any body? - A. No, he could not; the prisoner went away, for about ten minutes, in search of the men that made their escape; and then he came back again to the barge where the deceased lay, and he desired Bellamy to turn him out, that he might see who he was; Bellamy did not attempt to turn the man out; I did not hear him say any thing: Brodie also declined, and the prisoner said, then I will have him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Bellamy or Brodie assign any reason why they would not turn the man out of the cabin? - A. I did not hear any; the prisoner then came to the cabin and desired the deceased to turn out, that he might see who he was, and what he was; he said, come out, that I may see who you are and what you are; the man did not come out immediately; says he, if you do not I will fire at you: when the prisoner at the bar requested him to come out a second time, the deceased came up the steps from the cabin into the barge, and said, do you think I am afraid to see such a rascal as you.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Could he have mistaken him for either of the men that disappeared? - A. I should think not, because he came up in his waistcoat and breeches, without his coat or stockings; and he was a smaller man than either of those who made their escape.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it? - A. A very clear night; I think it was a moon-shiny night. The deceased put one hand across his belly, as if he was making a kind of guard, putting himself in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300019"></xptr>a posture of defence, and held the other hand up; I do not know whether he meant to strike.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he hold it in a threatening posture? - A. He did. He then said again, do you think I am afraid to see such a rascal as you; then there was a word or two passed between them, I do not remember what; they looked at one another very stedfastly in the face, and then the piece went off.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Some words passed; were they words spoken by the prisoner or the deceased? - A. There was something said by both.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that which was said, in an angry tone, by either or both of them? - A. There appeared to be anger in the face of both.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. How many persons were there near the deceased and the prisoner, at the time the piece went off? - A. I was so agitated I cannot say; Bellamy says he was in the barge, I did not know it; and there was a little boy in the barge with me, and I did not know it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What length of time had elapsed between those angry words, and the piece going off? - A. Not two seconds, I suppose; it was immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. What sort of craft was that in which the deceased was? - A. It was a sailing-barge.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it contain? - A. I believe it was empty.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nothing on board to protect? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The skiff had coals in it? - A. Yes; there might be eight or nine bushels in it.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time these two men made their escape over the barge, in your view, you say you only noticed one of them who got completely off? - A. I saw one go over Mr. Wood's craft on to their wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the other went you do not know? - A. No; he disappeared.</p>
               <p>Q. At what period was it that Vent fired the first time? - A. At the time they were making their escape over the barge where the deceased lay.</p>
               <p>Q. You conjecture that upon the man's stumbling over the cabin, it awaked the deceased? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he said, if I had fire-arms I would shoot you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The deceased did not make any enquiry what was the matter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he mean by you, when he said, if I had fire-arms I would shoot you? - A. I suppose the persons that had stumbled over the deck, and awaked him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he made use of that expression, do you think I am afraid to see such a rascal as you, who did he address himself to? - A. Vent.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did either of them call the other by name? - A. Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. This man who went away had got on a blue jacket and trowsers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Ten minutes had elapsed between the time of his going away and his returning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the deceased came up out of the cabin he had no jacket on? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then before any conversation took place between the deceased and the prisoner, he desired Bellamy to go and turn that man out? - A. Yes; and he declined to go, and Brodie declined to go.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he said he would turn him out? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a lighterman, in the employment of Mr. Wood; between one and two o'clock in the morning, I perceived two men upon Mr. Wood's wharf, stealing coals; it was a very moonlight night, and a very clear moon.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish the persons who were stealing the coals? - A. I could distinguish their cloaths, but not their persons; they were dressed in blue jackets and trowsers. I then went to Vent, he was fishing for ells with a found net; I told Vent what I had seen, and he requested me to call one

            ; I thought him a long time coming, and I saw Germaine upon the wharf; I desired him to help me row after them; they brought their boat right up towards the deceased's barge's stern; they both went over the deceased's barge's stern, and rowed right round to another wharf directly; as they were rowing towards the deceased's barge's stern, Vent said, come to, d-n your eyes, come to, or I will fire at you; as they were getting up the barge's stern, he fired at them; they did not make any offer to stop; I went to the deceased's barge's head, and holloaed, stop thief! and I saw both these men quit the barge where the deceased was, and run the other way; then I desired Germaine to bring Brodie on shore; I went on board the deceased's barge, for I expected he had wounded one of the men, for I saw one of them limp; but the mast being in the way, I cannot say I saw them both go clear away from the barge, but I saw them both clear of the cabin; Vent came half way after me, and said, d-n him, I will have him out, for I had told him I had seen one of them limp, and that I thought he had shot him; in consequence of that, he said, come out, you rascal; says I, for God's sake, mind what you are at; that is an innocent man, you may depend upon it, that is in the cabin. I did not know then who it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then how came you to say it was an innocent man? - A. Because I saw them go clear away.</p>

I was sure one of them went on shore; but as for the other, I did not know but he might have dropped in the craft; a man came out and said, I am not afraid to come out to such a rascal as you; and then he put the blunderbuss about three inches from him, and fired directly; and I saw his shirt all in a blaze of fire.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How did he hold up his hand? - A. He put his arms upon the scuttle sliders to lean in that position to talk to him, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not hold up his hand then? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How did he hold the blunderbuss? - A. In this way; half bent, as it were, and it was about three inches from the deceased, at the time, or four inches at furthest; I was close to his right elbow, and Brodie and Germaine were in the boat; upon my turning my head, to say, look at the man's shirt all on fire, I heard Vent say, there, d-n you, take that; and then he took up the but end of the blunderbuss; but I cannot say that I saw him strike him; and he ran away that moment; I cannot say which way he went; I saw him upon his legs about half a minute afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did he live? - A. Not more than half a minute; he fell down side ways into the barge's cabin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he got quite clear of the cabin, so as to be upon the floor of the barge? - A. No; he was on the steps.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are sure that the person who came from the barge and had robbed the craft, went to the deceased's vessel? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And one of them so lame, that you thought he could not get clear away? - A. I thought he he could not.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you had never seen the person of the man in the cabin? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the deceased came up, he was leaning over the scuttle? - A. Yes; when Vent said, d-n you, you rascal, come out, and as the man was coming out of his cabbin, he said, I am not afraid to fight such an old rascal as you; he leaned upon the scuttle sliders.</p>
               <p>Q. For the purpose of talking to Vent? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any words took place between the deceased and Vent? - A. No farther than I have said, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Germaine by at the time you were by? - A. Yes; both him and Brodie.</p>
               <p>Q. And you swear that no words took place, except those which Vent made use of? - A. No more, I swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased make use of any words at all, except those you have stated? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor Vent? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an opportunity of seeing every thing that passed; upon your oath was not the deceased with one hand round his belly, in this way, and the other held up so? - A. No; the man that was in the boat might say so, but he could not see so well as I could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Germaine was in the boat, and not in the barge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the boat from the barge? - A. Five or six feet; it was upon the barge's quarter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How came you not to go in to the cabin to turn the man out? - A. I said, no; it is an innocent man, why should I take an innocent man.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say he was an innocent man? - A. Because I saw the two men clear away from the cabin of the barge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was upon the shore, joining my master's wharf, a little before two o'clock upon the 15th of September, I perceived two men coming down from the upper side of Mrs. Hodges's wharf, the adjoining wharf to my master's; I saw them halt at the bottom of my master's craft; I did not think they were going to plunder my master's craft till Bellamy came to me, and told me, there were two men loading away on the outside; I said to him, go to Hungerford and get a wherry; he made answer, there were no sculls to be got; I told him to go to the Waterman's-arms, and call Nicholas Vokins, tell him it is for me, and he will lend you a pair; he went to Hungerford, and procured a pair of sculls, and a wherry; Germaine at the same time came up the water with some wood; I asked Germaine to accompany us in pursuit of the people that were taking the coals; they rowed me round the craft, till we could see that the men were actually loading the coals out of my master's craft into a skiff; as soon as they saw us coming towards them, one that was upon the put, jumped into the skiff, and they rowed up to where I first discerned them come from; they rowed the skiff to the stern of the barge, where the deceased was; I called to them to surrender or I would fire at them; they were not inclined to surrender; they both got out upon the cabin of the sailing-barge; I fired after them; I was then a considerable distance from them, and one of them immediately disappeared, and in a very small space of time we came up to the stern of this sailing barge, we came nearly to the barge's quarter, before the cabin, and there was the skiff, with a quantity of coals of my master's property; I saw one of the men retreating along the side of the same sailing barge towards the shore; I called to him; says I come to, or else I will fire at you;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300021"></xptr>Germaine said, there is one of them gone into that cabin, and said, he is in there now, I saw him go in; I repeated my call again to him that was in my sight, retreating towards the shore, and told him to come to or I would shoot him; the man in the cabin, answered from the cabin, you bloody rascal, if I had fire-arms, I would shoot you, you b-y b-r; upon his threatening to shoot me, Germaine said, mind that, mind how you come on, he says if he had fire-arms he would shoot you; with that I called for Brodie to come over to assist, and Germaine, I believe it was, rowed the boat across to fetch him over; he came, and I desired him and Bellamy to fetch the man out of the cabin that had threatened to shoot me, that I might see who he was, they both declined it; I called to him, and said, what do you say you will shoot me, then come out and surrender yourself or I will fire at you; he made answer, fire and be d-d you b-dy rascal; he told me, he would turn out and fight me, or any old b-g thief like me; when he stepped up the cabin steps, he put his hands in a position to fight; and said, now you b-r, come along; I stepped back one step from him, and the ring that fastens the rope was in the way, so that I could not get clear away to the shore; then he ran towards me; I was in danger of being thrown over board, and I unfortunately fired at him; I then went to the foreman belonging to my master, and desired him to see if any medical assistance could be got for the man; he came back and told me the man was no more; he went with me to the watch-house; I directed them which way to go to the bottom of Northumberland-street; I went home; I told them I should be there if they would call for me, and in about twenty minutes they called and I surrendered myself up at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Germaine.) Did you apprehend at the time you saw one man go towards the shore, that the other remained in the craft? - A. I conceived that he had concealed himself among some of the craft.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate that to the prisoner? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him to mind what the deceased said, when he said, if I had fire-arms I would shoot you? - A. I believe I did.</p>

On the 10th of November, the prisoner came into my shop, in Tottenham-court-road, and purchased half a sheet of paper, and wrapped up two old knives and forks, which he stated he was to leave there for the conductor of one of the omnibuses—I said it was a mistake —he said no, it was all right—he went to the public-house, and then came and asked us to let him look at the <hi rend="italic">Dispatch</hi> newspaper—he stood with his back to the door, reading the paper—while we were at tea a coach came to the door, I went to speak to the coachman, the prisoner went out past me, I turned, and missed three volumes off the counter—I went to one shop, and he had just offered them for sale.</p>

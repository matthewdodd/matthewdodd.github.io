On the 2d of May we set a watch there; about four o'clock in the afternoon, in consequence of information, I went to No. 13, and saw the prisoner coming up the kitchen stairs - I collared him, and asked him where the lead was which he had stolen? he said he had none - one of the workmen called out "Master, it is in the vault;" we went to the vault - he then said he had got the lead on him, and took some from his trowsers' pocket, and I took some from his inside waistcoat pocket, which was marked - it had been fixed to a water closet. He said it was his first offence, and on the way to the office he offered to replace it.</p>

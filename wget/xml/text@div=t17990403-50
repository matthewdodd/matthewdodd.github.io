             sworn. - I am a slaughterer of horses; I purchased a black mare, and took it to Smithfield to sell; I purchased it of the prisoner and his father together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them before? - A. Yes; they used to come up to Billingsgate for fish, and then go down into the country with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give you any account of this mare? - A. He said, he had been at Potton-fair, in Bedfordshire, and bought it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say so, or the father? - A. It might be the father, they were both together in the yard; but I paid the father the money for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you buy her for? - A. I gave 33s. for her for slaughter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they another mare with them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not kill her then? - A. No: when they were gone, I thought she seemed to be in foal, and I desired my man to put her into the stable with my own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. A mare with foal you buy for slaughter? - A. I might not see that all at once.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe the father was the person that gave you the account of the mare? - A. I cannot say justly whether it was the father or the son.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear which it was that gave you the account of the mare? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Who received the money? - A. The father.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has ran away? - The father.</p>
               <p>Q. He has never been able to be apprehended yet? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner was at home, and there taken? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He opened the door for you, did not he? - A. The officers can tell you that, I was gone round to see for the father when he made his escape.</p>

Yes, in bed; the father went off without his clothes, and I brought the prisoner to town in a chaise-cart; and in coming down the hill from Highgate the cart broke down, and threw us out; I was very much hurt, it was three o'clock in the morning, and he did not attempt to get away; we walked all the way from there.</p>

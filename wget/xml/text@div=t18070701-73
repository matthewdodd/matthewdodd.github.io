            , I am a pot boy to Mr. Bateman, he keeps the George and Dragon, Buckingham-place, near Fitzroy-square. I saw the prisoner at the bar take two pint pots of Mr. Lee's from No. 11, Buckingham-place; they were hung up on the rails, she held them in her hand, and then took three more that belonged to Mr. Bateman; I stopped and asked her where she was going with them; she said she was going into Tottenham Court Road to collect Mr. Lee's pots; a carpenter took her to Mr. Lee's; I did not go with her.</p>

            . I am a wine cooper. Me and my fellow servant were working a pine of wine at Mr. Lee's; I was going of an errand, I saw the prisoner and the boy Wantley quarreling about pots; she said she was going to gather pots for Mr. Lee, she said she lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. That you knew to be false. - A. Yes; I told her she did not live at Mr. Lee's; there was a man present that was paid at Mr. Lee's last Saturday night; he took her to Mr. Lee's; I went on, and when I came back she was at Mr. Lee's.</p>

On the 3d of June I was going up the New Road to get a pennyworth of new milk; I saw these two pots upon the iron spikes at the door; I took them to get some milk in; the boy said they were not my pots, he wrenched them out of my hands; I told him I was going over to the cow house for some milk, and then I would take the pots to his house.</p>

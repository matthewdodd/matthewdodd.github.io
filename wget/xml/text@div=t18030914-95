Yes; I live at No.3, St. Ann's-street, Westminster, it used to go by the name of St. Ann's-lane: On the 18th of July, in the evening, I was in company with my brother at Mr. Walker's; I had breakfasted with him in the morning, and had seen him in the afternoon, and he was in my company the greater part of the Sunday evening, and slept in my house that night; my weddingday was the 19th, and he supped with me that evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did your brother lodge with you at that time? - A. He has lodged at my house a great number of times; he was at my house a long while; it might be two months, or three months, I cannot say exactly, till he was taken up; he would sleep three or four nights, or a week together, at my house, and then he would sleep at my brother John's for one night.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his business? - A. A farrier.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he carry on his business at your house, or his brother John's? - A. No; his wife died at or near Oakingham, and soon after he buried her, he sold the lease of his house.</p>
               <p>Q. That was in March or April, was it not? - A. It is impossible for me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he sold the lease of the house before your wedding-day? - A. I cannot say; it might be about two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any other residence than your house, and your brother's? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Mr. Weston.) At what time in the evening of Sunday had you seen your horse in the paddock? - A. About seven o'clock; I missed it in the morning between seven and eight o'clock.</p>

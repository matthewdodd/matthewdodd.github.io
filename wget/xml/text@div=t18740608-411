               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187406080023"></xptr>
               <p>they then went together to Moorgate Street station, where they followed a gentleman, and at the corner of Circus Place, Underwood got in front of the gentleman—Buncher was about 10 yards ahead of him, and Mackay a short distance behind him—a policeman on the beat then came round, and they all went to Moorgate Street railway-station a second time—it was then 10.45 or 10.50—they followed a gentleman in a similar manner, and then went up Moorgate Street and remained there till about 11.40—I saw the prosecutor and a lady come out of the station—the three prisoners followed them—Underwood ran ahead, and went to the corner of Great Bell Alley—Buncher went through a court, and got to the other end of the alley by Coleman Street—Mackay followed the lady and gentleman behind, and when they were at the corner of Great Bell Alley, Buncher whistled, and Underwood went to the corner of the next turning, 12 or 14 yards further on, and immediately the gentleman got to the turning, Underwood sprang at his breast, but I could not see what he did—the gentleman placed his hand on his breast, and one of the officers knocked Underwood down—I saw Mackay go over to the other side of the road—I took him in custody.</p>

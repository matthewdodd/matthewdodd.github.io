                  </hi>. I am a smith, and live in Charles-street, Drury-lane. On the 18th of May I was in company with a person named Sullivan, a Sbopmate of mine, at his lodging, the one-pair front of No. 18, Charles-street—we were having some supper—about one o'clock in the morning a person below called for a light—Sullivan told the person to come up and take one—the person came into the room, and lighted his candle—the pri<lb></lb>soner and another followed behind him, and commenced ill-using me—they beat and kicked me—I fell down, and a half-crown and two penny pieces fell from my right hand waistcoat pocket on the floor—I was knocked down, and rendered insensible for about five minutes, the blows were so heavy, I was stunned—I bled a great deal—I have a cut on my eye now—when I came to, I saw the prisoner offer Sullivan two penny pieces, and say that was all he had picked up—Sullivan said he saw him pick up a half-crown—he said he did not, and had not got one about him—I had had a little drink, but was sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith, and work along with Evans. I lodge at No. 18, Charles-street, Drury-lane, in the first floor. On the 18th of May we had been out together, and I invited him home to supper—about one o'clock in the morning I beard some one below calling for a light—I told them to come up and take one—the prisoner and another followed the person up who came for the light—they did not speak a word, but began to heat Evans—he fell down, and half a crown and some halfpence fell from his pocket—the prisoner came and offered to give me two penny pieces—I said 1 had seen him pick up a half-crown, which I had—the prisoner said "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, that is all I picked up"—he knew me by working in the neighbourhood—I told him to give me the half-crown—he said he had not one about him, and had not picked up one—I asked him to let me search him—he would not—I sent my wife for a policeman—Evans was insensible at the time, and could not speak—he was sitting by my bed-side—they blew the candle out twice, and tried to get out, but could not, as I have a curious fastening to my door, co that they could not open it—the policeman came in about ten minutes, and took him into custody—the the prisoner staid in the room all that time—he did not speak—he only kept walking about, and trying to get out at the door—when the policeman came up he had the money in his hand, and offered it to him—it was a half-crown, two shillings, and a half-penny—I believe he offered it to him as won as he came in, but I cannot rightly say—I was looking after my room</p>

               <p>more than after him—he said that was all he had about him—Evans and I had been out together that evening—we left off work at half-past seven—we had been sitting in a public-house, and had three or four pints of stout—I only know the prisoner by seeing him about the streets—Evans and I went into another public-house, and there saw the prisoner—I did not drink with him, nor did I see Evans do so—the place was so full I could not see.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

I am the wife of last witness—I was with him and Evans at supper—I heard my husband direct some one to come up for a light—he knew the man that called for it—he had hardly been in a minute, when the prisoner and another flew in, and beat Evans shamefully—I stood on the threshold of the door and screamed out "Murder "two or three times—they did not strike my husband or me, only Evans—the money dropped out of Evans's pocket—I saw the prisoner pick up two penny pieces and a half-crown—he went to my husband with the two penny pieces, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, here is all I have picked up"—I said "You have picked up half a crown besides, I saw you do it"—he said, "It is false, I have not a farthing about me"—my husband sent me for a policeman, and fastened the door—when the policeman came, Evans gave the prisoner in charge—I saw the policeman find in his hand a half-crown, two shillings, and a half-penny—he did not offer it to the policeman—the policeman said he should search him—he then opened his hand, and the policeman took the money out of it—I did not see my husband strike the prisoner.</p>

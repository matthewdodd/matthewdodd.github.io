                  </hi>. I am a foreman at the West India Docks, and live at Assembly-row, Mile-end. On 30th July I met the prisoner—she asked me the way to Euston-square—I went with her to a coffee-shop in Whitechapel-road, and slept with her, and made an appointment to meet her the next night—I did so—she took me to Mr. King's coffee-shop, Seymour-street, Euston-square—we slept there that and the following night—on Monday morning, 3rd July, I awoke at six o'clock, and found her nearly dressed—she had told me over night she wanted to get up early to go over the way to a friend, previous to her going to Birmingham, and told me to wind my watch up, and not to put it on the bed, but put it on the drawers—I did so—she went out, and stopped out about half an hour, came back to wash herself, and then said she should step out again for ten minutes—I was in bed; and as she opened the door she took my watch with her left hand—I jumped up, and ran down stairs in my shirt, and told the female to stop her, as she had taken my watch—the female went out—I dressed myself, and went to the police-station—Mr. King came up with the bill—I went to my waistcoat, where there had been a half-sovereign and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and found nothing but 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner never returned—my watch was worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have never seen it since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waitress at Mr. Edward King's, Seymour-street—he keeps the house—it is in St. Pancras parish. On 1st July the prisoner and Penny came—on the 3rd, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, just after the prisoner left, Penny came down stairs and said, "Stop that woman, she has stolen my watch"—I went out, but could see nothing of her—an officer brought her back—she asked me if I did not know her—I said I had some recollection of her—she asked if I did not remember her sleeping with a dark man—I said, "Yes"—she said, "Do you Temember his saying anything about losing a watch?"—I had said nothing about a watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the detective police of Birmingham. I read something in the "Hue and Cry," and found the prisoner, on 7th Aug., in a coffee-shop at Birmingham—I read to her a letter from Mr. Penny, and told her she was charged with stealing a watch—she said she knew nothing about the watch, and did not know any Mr. Penny—she asked in the train who was coming against her—I put the "Hue and Cry" in her hand—she read the paragraph, and said, "Oh this is the person is it; this Mr. Penny I do not fear him; I thought it was some one else; he is a nasty shabby fellow, a draper's assistant, who robbed his master, and offered me a silk dress; and because I would not accept it, he has <hi rend="italic">trumped</hi> up this charge"—she said she had taken half a sovereign from his pocket, and paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., part of the bill at the coffee-shop; that she had slept with him two or three nights, and he wished to marry her.</p>

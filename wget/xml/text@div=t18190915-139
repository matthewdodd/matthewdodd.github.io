            . I attended the two ladies - the prisoner was one. They asked to look at some shoes; I fitted her sister's foot - she liked the shoes, bought them, and paid 4 s. 6 d. for them; they were not fixed upon until I had fitted the prisoner. I tried several pair on her, but she said none of them fitted her. I was going to the place to get some more, but she told me not to trouble myself to get any more, for she would call another time, as she was not in particular want of them. The prisoner's sister paid me two half crowns, and I gave her 6 d. in change - she had fixed upon a pair of shoes; I wrapped them up in a piece of paper and gave them to her. The prisoner sat opposite to her in a chair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you not hear her say she would take one pair as she had given so much trouble - A. No. There were seven of us in the shop.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's mother. I remember the ladies coming to the shop; one was fitted with a pair of shoes - I heard the prisoner say she would not take any. I observed her take a pair of shoes from behind her chair, and roll them up in her scarf; I went and inquired if she had bought them. My son followed her to the door, and asked her what she had got? She said, not any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Be particular as to the words that passed - A. He asked her what she had got? and she said, not any thing. He felt in her scarf, unrolled it, and took out a pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your son said he knew nothing about it - A. No. not till I informed him.</p>
               <p>Q. When she said she had nothing, did she not say she thought her sister had paid for her shoes - A. I did not hear her say so.</p>

               <p>Q. On your oath did she not - A. After she came into the shop she did. She was examined at the Police Office that evening, and was let at large to appear again on Tuesday evening if she was wanted - she did appear.</p>
               <p>Q. A young gentleman called at your house after she had been examined at the office - A. I did not see him - I heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not after that that she was proceeded against a second time at the office - A. Yes. She belongs to a respectable family.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not your son said he believed it was a matter of accident - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ARABIN. Q. Did her sister leave the shop before her - A. Yes, she went away soon after the accusation was made, leaving her sister there.</p>

             re-examined. My mother gave me information; the prisoner was going out of the street-door - she had been fitted in the back-shop. When she got to the shop-door, I said to her,</p>
               <p>"Pray have you got any thing belonging to me?" She said,</p>
               <p>"No Sir, what do you mean?" I told her I suspected she had got a pair of shoes of mine; she said she had not. I put my hand on her scarf, felt something hard, like the heels of a a pair of shoes, and took them from under her scarf. She said,</p>
               <p>"It is quite a mistake - I am sorry for it." I said,</p>
               <p>"I am afraid I have too many of these mistakes, and I really cannot let you go."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she not say that she thought her sister had paid for them - A. Yes; her sister paid for her own shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did her sister say that she was to pay for all that were bought - A. Yes, in the front shop she said so - she is of a most respectable family.</p>

               <p>MISS COLLINSON. I am the prisoner's sister. She and I went out shopping together - we live together with our<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150050"></xptr>mother, and are independent. I carried the purse, and was to pay for whatever we both bought. Our mother had been out with us part of the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was discovered that she had not paid for the shoes, did you not say,</p>
               <p>"I am sorry for it - here is the money." - A. Yes; I have often been shopping with her. Wrong was never imputed to her before.</p>
               <p>Q. You got up after paying for your shoes, not knowing that she had bought any - A. Yes.</p>

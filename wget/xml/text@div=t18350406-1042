                  </hi>. I am clerk to Henry Bradshaw Fearon, wine-mer<lb></lb>chant, Holborn-hill. On the 24th of March a porter came to the house with this note, signed "D. Hill"—I received it—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"Union Pottery, Vauxhall. Please to send by bearer, 2 gallons best brandy; ditto, rum; ditto, gin; packed for the country; do not keep the man long for the permit, for the cart is waiting for it in the City. Yours, D. Hill. Please to put them in one hamper." We have a customer named David Hill, who lives at Union Pottery, Vauxhall—I believed it to be his hand-writing at the time, and delivered the goods—I saw the prisoner on Thursday, the 26th of March, in consequence of receiving a second order, which was brought by another porter about three o'clock in the afternoon—I then went out into Holborn, and saw the porter who brought the second order—he pointed out the prisoner to me as the man who gave it to him—he was standing nearly opposite the entrance to our house—I am quite sure it was the prisoner—I asked him who gave him the note—he said Mr. Hill's foreman—I then said it was very strange Mr. Hill should send an order by a strange porter, when his own cart was at our door delivering goods (which was the case)—he then contradicted it, and said a strange man had given it to him, a tall man at the gate, who he did not know—I took him over to Mr. Hill's in about half an hour, as he wished me to go with him—he told me he was employed at another pottery, two or three doors from Mr. Hill, and asked leave to go in to his employer—he got out of the cab, and went in to his employer's—I followed him—he went in to the upper part of the premises and I took him—I found he was employed there—I saw him in custody at Guildhall on the next day—I told him we had received an order in the same writing two days before, and delivered the goods—he said he knew nothing of any but the one he had delivered, and expressed his surprise at our having had one before—he said he knew nothing of the first order.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live in Green-court, Coleman-street. I received a letter from the prisoner on Tuesday, the 24th of March, in Farringdon-street, where I was standing as porter—I was to take it to Mr. Fearon's—Henry, one to Mr. Fearon's servants, sent me into the counting-house, and gave me the letter back—I took it and gave it to Perritt, and received a hamper—I did not see what it con<lb></lb>tained—when the prisoner gave me the letter, he told me to take it to Thompson and Fearon, and wait for a hamper; to take it to Farringdon-street, and wait for him—I put it on my knot, and as I was going down the hill, he overtook me, and said, "They have not been long filling it—I shall not trouble you to take it to the General Post Office," (where he had said I was to take it)—he said, "I will take a cab and go there quick, because the cart is waiting"—he went to the first cab on the stand, and took the hamper from me—he went up Skinner-street, with the cab, and I saw no more of him—he went away without the bill, which was given to me with it.</p>

On Thurs<lb></lb>day, the 26th of March, about half-past six in the evening, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner running, and two more after him, in the Lambeth-road, about half a mile from Vauxhall—they called out to me to stop him, which I did.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Whitecross-street. On the night of the 21st of May, I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor in conversation about a watch. I heard Syre say, you have got my watch. I said to the prisoner, give the gentleman his watch, and then go about your business. She said, what was I, I was no watchman. I told her, I was a watchman. I took hold of her arm, and said, she should go to the watchhouse, and then I will see whether you have got the watch or no. I had got hold of her arm in Chiswell-street; I felt something touch my hand. I catched hold of the watch; I cried out to Syre, I have got your watch; and when I came to the watchhouse I laid the watch on the table. The officer of the night took the watch.</p>

            . On the 21st of May I was officer of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watchhouse by the watchman. The prosecutor followed, and said, the prisoner had robbed him of his watch. The watchman laid the watch on the table; the prosecutor said it was his watch. The prisoner said he gave it her as a compliment. This is the watch.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY BUSBY</hi>. I keep the Grapes Public-house, Earl-street, Seven Dials—about 3 o'clock, on the afternoon of 6th of this month, the prisoner came into my house—there was a woman drinking in front of the bar, and he laid hold of her pot of beer and drank out of it—the woman came up to my wife and complained—the prisoner was about to spit in the woman's face, and struck her, and I turned him out—as I was turning him out he said to my wife," You b—b—h, I will do for you"—when I got him outside the door he pushed it a little way open and spat in my face, and said, "You b—I will do for you, and all the b—house"—about twenty minutes to 12 he came back again in front of the bar, and wanted to kick up a quarrel, which I prevented him doing by turning him out again—he then said, "You b——, I will do for you before long, and all the b—house"—he went away, returned in about ten minutes with a ginger-beer bottle, with which I received a blow on the nose—I did not see who threw it—I should have fallen, but I was caught by some one there—I was afterwards taken to the Charing Cross Hospital, where I have been attended by the doctor ever since—I lost very nearly three quarts of blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was up all Friday night—I got a drop of drink too much—the beer I drank belonged to a friend of mine, and I never had a word with this man till he gave me this black eye, and turned me out.</p>

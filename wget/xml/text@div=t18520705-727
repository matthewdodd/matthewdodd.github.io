                  </hi>. I live at 14, Carr-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. This day three weeks I was at work in the brick fields in Poplar New Town—about twenty minutes to 6 o'clock I saw the prisoner's wife run out of the house and the prisoner's brother after her—she hallooed out, "Save</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185207050034"></xptr>
               <p>me!"—I did not see a knife till it entered my cheek—the brother came behind me for protection, and the prisoner stuck the knife into my cheek—I had the presence of mind to keep my mouth shut, or he would have cut my tongue out; I felt it rattle against my teeth—he then made a cut at my throat—I put my hand up, and it wounded my finger—I could not work for nine days—I struggled with him, and said, "George, come and take the knife, or else he will kill me?"—one of the men said, "Here comes a police<lb></lb>man," and he threw the knife away—I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I hope the Lord will forgive him if he is saying anything against me wrong; I did not know anything of the transaction till last Monday week, when I was sent for at Poplar Union. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was taken up at the time—he would have run away, but a policeman showed him. a pistol, and after that a child could have taken him away.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the brick field, and saw the prisoner's brother and the woman run out—the brother called out, "Save me!"—Dunn ran forward and stopped the prisoner—they both fell together—he said, "George, George, the knife!"—I pulled him off him, and the blood was running from Dunn's mouth—they called out "Police!"—the prisoner threw the knife away, and the police came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I saw the prisoner when he was brought to the workhouse—in the course of the night he had two epileptic fits—he was not suffering from fits when he came, but he was most posi<lb></lb>tively insane—in the course of seven or eight days he became rational—he continued in a state of insanity at least seven or eight days—he had had a fit, I believe, in the station-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you form a judgment of the insanity, whether it was likely to be the effect of sudden passion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was most likely to be the result of drink; he had been drinking, I understood, three or four days; it was a combination of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> and epilepsy—I should think it most likely he was in a state of insanity at the time he rushed out; I think there can be no doubt about it—I cannot undertake to say positively when the insanity came on; I had never seen him before—whether it came on through fear, or before he came out of the house, I cannot say—I should think he is sane now—if he refrains from drink he is safe to be at large, but if he gives way he is liable to be subject to it—the excitement of drink would bring on epilepsy again.</p>

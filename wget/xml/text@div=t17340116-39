On Saturday Night (4 Years ago next June) I went to Mr. Collins's against the Glass-house at Salt-Peter-Bank in Rosemary-lane, where I met the Prisoners, whom I had seen there divers Times before. They ask'd me to go out with them that Night. I agreed to it, and coming down Rosemary-lane, about 9 at Night, we saw the Prosecutor's Door open. I slipt in, took the Key out of the Pin of the Window, and then we went away together, to see if we could find another Chance, but not meeting with any, we returned about 2 in the Morning. I took out the Pin of the Window, threw it in the Kennel, pull'd the Shutter half off, and Whitesides went in while Ford and I stood watching without, and Whitesides handed out three Shirts, a silk Handkerchief, and eighteen Cotton Handkerchiefs, which I took in my Apron. There was a Woman in Bed in the Shop, and she cry'd out Thieves. I went down a Turning by the Side of the House and hid the Goods, and when I return'd the Prisoners were gone, but I found them two Hours after at Collins's. - One that buys stolen Goods, but keeps a private House. - Whitesides was an Evidence against his Wife three Years ago. - I told the Prisoners where I had left the Goods, and at 9 in the Morning we went to fetch 'em. I took 'em away, and carry'd them to the Brill near Pancras, and sold 'em all but one Shirt to

             sworn. - I keep the Black-Lion public-house, and stables, at Bayswater: On the 15th of May, the prisoner at the bar brought a grey horse to me, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, he asked me if I would buy a horse of him; I asked him how he came by the horse; he told me he bought it, on the day before, at Chertsey-fair, of a chimney-sweeper; I then told him, neitner the horse should go out of my stable, nor he from my hands; I thought he did not come honestly by him, as I knew the horse; I had seen him a great many times before, I had seen the old gentleman ride him, he has used my house, with cattle, for some years; the prisoner begged to be released, and said he did not come honestly by it; he was a very remarkable horse, he has two spavins on both his hind legs; I took the prisoner to London, put him into a coach, and took him to Bow-street; the Magistrate desired me to keep the horse till I had further orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew Mr. Cole the horse? - A. Yes; I am sure it is Mr. Cole's horse; I shewed it him the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a horse-slaughterer? - A. No; I keep a public-house, and am a livery-stable keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Magistrate that this man confessed he did not come honestly by it? - A. I swore it there; I told Sir William Addington so; what he said was, that this horse was not his.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear, that the man ever confessed he came dishonestly by the horse? - A. He said the horse was not his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he stole it? - A. He said he did not come honestly by it.</p>
               <p>Cole. The horse that I saw at Mr. Peake's was my horse, and had been for a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was on the road, and saw a man who looked like a chimney-sweeper, with a horse; I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said; it was going to be slaughtered, and I bought the horse of him; I gave him a guinea and a pint of beer.</p>

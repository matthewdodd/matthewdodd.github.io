             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was going to Pancras on foot between eleven and twelve o'clock, in the day time, and a man came down after me and overtook me, and he began talking to me about his being a soldier, and what countries he had been in, this was in the high road, he said he had been in very cold countries, and very hot, that he could not bear them; when we came about half way down the fields, he asked me where I was going, whether I was going to Kentish Town or to London, I told him to Kentish Town, he told me he would shew me a nearer way, for he was going that way to speak to his brother-in-law, who was hedging and dirching that way; I went with him, he took me across two or three fields, till we came into a foot-path, he went along there a good way, and came, a good many people that was at work there, and when we got under a little hedge, he damned me, and told me to give him all the money I had, he took me by the collar, I gave it him, and he let loose of me, and bid me go to hell; he struck across the fields towards London, I suppose, he ran away, I went on and got through some yards into Kentish Town; I never was in that place where I was robbed before in my life, I went to the house where I was going, and I told the people what a misfortune had happened to me.</p>
               <p>Do you know the man again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he a tailor or a short man? - A tall thin man, that is him, he had a striped waistcoat, such as the lamp-lighters in general wear.</p>
               <p>Can be you be positive about him, do you think you may not be mistaken? - No, Sir, I am very sure it is him, I have seen him before in Kentish Town doing the lamps, I fancy he had a job there for a few days.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LENTUM sworn.</p>
               <p>I was informed this man this lad, I was sent after him, and I took him the 5th of November in the morning about half after six, in the fields between Highgate and London; he was described by several people to me.</p>
               <p>Did the man say any thing when you took him? - He confessed that he robbed the lad before me, and the same before the Justice, when he was committed to prison.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him to induce him to confess! - No, I asked him how he came to do so, he pretended he was a little in liquor.</p>

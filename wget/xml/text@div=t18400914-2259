                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on the 26th of August, and saw the prisoner in Collingwood-street, Bethnal-green, about half-past one o'clock at night—I noticed that he limped, and had only one shoe on—I observed his right hand in his pocket—I came up to him and found he had in that pocket ten live pigeons, and one duck just killed—I asked him where his shoe was—he said it hurt him, and he had taken it off and put it in his pocket, and it must have dropped out—I asked him whose pigeons those were—he said, his brother-in-law's—I first asked what he had in his pocket—he said, "Live stock," and took one out—I asked how many he had got—he said, fourteen or fifteen; that his brother-in-law had bought them, at 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, of a man named Lazarus, in Humbleston-street, Commercial-road, to take to market in the morning—I asked where he was going to take them to—he said, to his brother-in-law's, in Prim<lb></lb>rose-street—he said, on his way to the station-house, that he had a duck—I took off the shoe he had on—another shoe was afterwards produced which corresponds with this—I have the pigeons here—four of them are young ones taken from the nest.</p>

He keeps pigeons—there were fifteen in the loft above the back-room—you get to it by a trap door from the back-room—I counted them on Saturday, the 22nd—they fly up into traps, and cannot get out unless they are opened—we let them out occasionally—I missed twelve on Wednesday, the 26th, soon after seven o'clock in the morning—they were worth 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I examined the loft in con<lb></lb>sequence of something a neighbour said, and found the roof of the dor<lb></lb>mer torn off—the bottom of the dormer remained firm—a person could get in there—I was up there on Tuesday morning, it was safe then—I after<lb></lb>wards saw some pigeons in the policeman's custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Wednesday, the 26th of Au<lb></lb>gust, about one o'clock in the morning, I was in Commercial-road, and heard a cry of "Police," and heard somebody coming up Grove-street, just before—I went down a court in Grove-street, got over the back-wall of Mr. Dale's, a surgeon, and on the roof of Mr. Hobbs, a baker—I saw some tiles off the roof—I saw a woman, when I got over the wall, pick up this shoe off the ground, just by the back-door of Mr. Hobbs's premises, which are three or four doors from Finmore's—I examined the roofs of three or four houses along there, and found the tiles broken all the way along in three or four places, in the direction of Finmore's, but I did not go quite to Finmore's—I could see marks on the roof of Hobbs's house, where they had got up—they had broken the water-shoot—I compared the shoe with the wall, there was mortar and whitewash on the shoe, and mortar and whitewash rubbed off Hobbs's wall—I produced the shoe to Shaw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stage coachman, and live in Coram-street, Russell-square. On the 8th of July, I was returning home from Maryle<lb></lb>bone about two o'clock in the morning, and met the prisoner in William-street, Lisson-grove—she asked me to give her a glass of something to drink—we went to get into a public-house, but it was closed—I walked with her about half a quarter of a mile, and on my returning home by the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I saw the prosecutor about a quarter before two o'clock, standing at the corner of Devonshire-place, in company with the prisoner—I went away for about two minutes and a half, and when I came back the prosecutor asked me if I had seen a woman going away—I had not seen them together above a minute—in conse<lb></lb>quence of what he said I went in search of her—I found her in bed at a pork-shop in William-street—she appeared to be asleep—I awoke her, and asked if she knew me—she said, "No"—I asked if she knew the pro<lb></lb>secutor, who was in the room—she said, "No"—I told her to get up and dress—she said she could not dress before me: and seeing only her gown hanging up, I said, "You are not undressed"—I lifted the clothes, and she had every thing on but her gown—I asked her for the handkerchief—she said she had not seen it—she got out of bed and put her gown on—she denied having the handkerchief—she was going to be searched at the sta<lb></lb>tion-house by a woman, and I said, "Leave your shawl here," and in taking her shawl off I perceived the prosecutor had given it to her in lien of money—the prosecutor denied giving it to her.</p>

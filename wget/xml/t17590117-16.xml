               <p>Rochford. I did not take them in: but he came a second time; he having had three shillings at first, and the second time he wanted two shillings more, and I let him have that.</p>

I never heard any thing ill of him 'till this affair; he is a very civil well-behav'd young man; the prosecutor said to me the prisoner had taken the buckles a month before he took him up; I ask'd him why he did not take him up sooner; he said because he promised to pay him for them.</p>

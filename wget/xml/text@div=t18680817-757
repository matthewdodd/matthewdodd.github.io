                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, at 169, High Street, Borough—I have known the prisoner about six years—he was about twelve months in my employment, as traveller—he left about 13th July; he went away without leave of absence—I next saw him at the Southwark Police Court—I have a customer of the name of Restall—I always understood that his name was William, but I find it is Henry Restall—he owed me 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I requested the prisoner to get a bill from him—the prisoner always said that Mr. Restall would not accept bills—I at last sent him to tell Restall if he did not pay the account I should put it in the solicitor's hands, and he</p>

I am a wheelwright, and carry on business at 129, Stepney Green—I have had dealings with the prisoner about twelve months—I can only read a little—I can write my own name—I know nothing of this bill—I did not sign it, or authorise anyone to do it for me—my name is Henry—I have a grandson of the name of William, but he is only eight years old.</p>

            . I am a waterman at the coach-stand, Whitehall. I heard an alarm of Stop thief! I looked round and saw a man running fast with a great coat under his arm. In attempting to pass him I caught hold of the arm of it; he threw it down, and I picked it up. I did not know him.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DAUNCEY. I am a fruiterer. I saw two men come from the Horse Guards; one of them kept the prosecutor's man in conversation. I saw the prisoner advance and snatch at the coat twice; the third time he completely got it off, put it under his left arm and ran. I called Stop thief! and went after him. He passed the coach and threw the coat against the wheel. I was on one side of the stand, and he on the other. I knocked my hat against the pole of the coach, and could not take him. I still followed and secured him, and brought him back three or four yards. He asked me where the gentleman was that owned the coat? I said I would shew him. I took him over to Mr. Child's. I have every reason to believe him to be the man who took it. I did not lose sight of him after he dropped the coat. I was close to him. He turned back and met me. I collared him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The coaches were between you? Yes; I came round the first coach; several other people were pursuing him. He asked me who the coat belonged to before I mentioned it. It was a moonlight night.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard the alarm, saw about two hundred running, and run with them. I was tired, turned back, and met the witness half way, close to Whitehall-place. He said,</p>
               <p>"You are the man who stole the coat, and that he saw me take it off the horse." I asked him where the gentleman was that belonged to the coat? I was locked up with the soldiers till the prosecutor came. When taken before the Magistrate, he said he was knocked down by the pole of the coach. He said the man took it from the off side; if so he must have passed the servant. If I took it he must have seen me through the horses.</p>

             re-examined. He took it from the road side of the horses. I am sure I saw him take it.</p>

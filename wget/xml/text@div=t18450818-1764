I make door-mats and clothes-pegs, and live in Dowing-street, Deptford—I do not go about the country—on this evening I had done nothing to affront my father—I went to him to stop him from throwing the punches away, because they were used in the business, to stamp names in the beer-cana—he struck me with his fist—I had not struck him at that time—my mother came up directly after to stop him from striking me—my little brother was near him, with the iron in his hand—he took it out of his hand and ran after me—I had struck him before he ran after me, when he hit my mother—I ran into the water to avoid him, and at last succeeded in getting away from him—I was going down the road and saw him run after my mother—I went back, and saw him strike her twice on each side of the head with the iron—she</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Fennell, a surgeon at Wimbledon—the prosecutrix came to our surgery on Monday, the 28th of July, about eleven o'clock at night, and showed me two severe wounds that she had received on each side of her head—they were lacerated and contused, such as might be produced by any blunt instrument, such as this iron—they must have been inflicted with considerable force—I considered her life in jeopardy at the time, and up to about a week ago.</p>

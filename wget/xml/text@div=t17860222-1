               <p>Court. You are the widow of the deceased? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner a <rs id="t17860222-1-deflabel4" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>When was he discharged from your husband's service? - I think, to the best of my remembrance, it was a month the Thursday before the deed was done.</p>
               <p>What business was your husband? - A <rs id="t17860222-1-viclabel5" type="occupation">milk-man</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17860222-1-victim51 t17860222-1-viclabel5"></join>.</p>
               <p>What was the occasion of his being dismissed from his service? - It was that he did not do his work against his master came home.</p>
               <p>How old is this prisoner? - I think he is between eighteen and nineteen.</p>
               <p>Where did he come from? - Out of Bedfordshire: I understood he went to see his mother, in Bedfordshire, after he was dismissed.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay away, before he returned to your house at Kentish town? - I think about a week or ten days.</p>
               <p>Did he come to your house after he returned? - Yes, he did come to our house several times, and I gave him victuals several times.</p>
               <p>Did your husband know of that, Madam? - My husband knew that he had been to the house, but he did not know that I gave him victuals.</p>
               <p>How did he employ himself after he came back to Kentish Town? - He had very little work to do after he came out of the country.</p>
               <p>Then he hardly earned his living, did he? - No, my Lord, he did not, and that was the reason I gave him victuals.</p>
               <p>Did he lay at your house after he returned? - Not to my knowledge he never did.</p>
               <p>But do you know in fact that he did, though without your consent? - No, he never lay a night in the house that ever I heard of.</p>
               <p>When did this accident happen? - On Saturday morning, the 11th of February, I found it out.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning? - It was about ten minutes after two or rather better.</p>
               <p>Was you in bed? - I was.</p>
               <p>In what room? - In the room under where my husband slept.</p>
               <p>Was you called or how? - I have a little girl of four years old lay with my husband.</p>
               <p>A daughter of yours? - Yes, the child called me, that waked the other in the other room, and my little boy after called to me at the top of the stairs.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - I did not hear her call, it waked the other in the other room, my little boy, who lay in the other room, on the same floor, he lay along with Trotman, and he called me.</p>
               <p>How old is that boy? - Ten years old this September.</p>
               <p>What is that Trotman? - A lodger in the house.</p>
               <p>Is he a man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is his Christian name? - John.</p>
               <p>Did the room where Trotman and your little boy lay communicate with the room where your husband lay? - Only the stair parted them, my little boy came and knocked at my door, and told me his father wanted me, I went in directly, and by the light of the moon, he seemed to be quite black with blood from his face to his waist, the moon shone very bright, and there are two large windows in the room, he was sitting up in the bed, and as far as his waist appeared black and covered with blood.</p>
               <p>Did he speak to you, good woman? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220004"></xptr> When I saw him, I said, Horseman, my dear creature, what is the matter with you? he said to me, Lord bless you! something has run over my face; I said, Lord bless you child! run over your face! why you are nothing but blood; he made me answer, have you got a candle? I said, no child, I did not wait for a candle: I went down immediately, and got a candle, and when I came up, I found him beat and cut all to pieces; his forehead, and his eyes and nose were cut all to pieces; I asked him to tell me how it came, and he said I do not know, do not ask me, I do not know how it came. I called Trotman up, to go and fetch his nephew to me, and likewise to order the doctor and surgeons to come, that live at Kentish Town, then I went and got the pillow case off the pillow to wrap round his head, to try to stop the blood, then I got him to lay down in the bed, then I turned myself round in the room, and I found a stick laying by the drawers between the fire-place and the drawers, I took the stick up in my hand, this is the stick, but there was no blood upon this.</p>
               <p>(Produces a hedge-stake.)</p>

               <p>Did you ever see this stick before? - I saw it at the time it was cut, which was the Sunday before this accident happened.</p>
               <p>You never saw it in your husband's room before? - No, it never was there before.</p>
               <p>Who cut it? - Trotman and the prisoner went out on Sunday to cut some sticks, and they brought in three.</p>
               <p>Who had that? - This was the prisoner's stick.</p>
               <p>Did he bring it in with him? - To say whether he brought the stick in his hand, or whether Trotman brought them all in, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Why did you say it was the prisoner's then? - Because it was a rough stick, cut off an elm tree, when it was brought in the prisoner cut it round the head as you see.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do that? - I saw him doing it on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>What did he do with this stick after he cut it round? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see it after he cut it round till this time? - I have seen him with this stick in his hand when he has been out of the door.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him with it more than once? - I cannot say whether once or twice, but I have seen him with it.</p>
               <p>Do let us look at that stick.</p>
               <p>(The stick handed to the Court: it appeared upon inspection to have lead poured into a hole in the top.)</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any thing done to this stick besides cutting it round? - No, I never did; then I took this iron bar standing between the fire-place and the drawers, the drawers are not a yard from the fire-place, it appeared to stand leaning one end of it against the fire-place, and the other against the drawers.</p>
               <p>Was there any appearance of blood upon it? - Yes, there were marks of blood upon it, and several hairs upon the end of the bar, but I believe by carrying it backwards and forwards they are off.</p>
               <p>Was the blood fresh? - Quite fresh, it was then.</p>
               <p>You could not have any account from your husband how it happened? - No, he never could give any account till the time he died; it was done on Saturday morning between one and two, I imagine it was, and he lived till the Sunday se'nnight following, till the 19th of February.</p>
               <p>Was he in his senses till he died? - Yes; he had not the least idea how it happened, he never could tell how it happened.</p>
               <p>Was his scull fractured? - Yes, it was, but I did not understand the nature of any thing of the kind; but it was cut and mangled in a desperate manner.</p>
               <p>What was the reason you did not lay with your husband that night? - My Lord, I did not lay with him for six or seven nights, I have a little child about fourteen months old, that was very bad, cutting his teeth, and to prevent disturbing my husband, as he worked so hard, I lay with a woman.</p>
               <p>Was your husband used to sleep sound? - Very sound in his first sleep, till he waked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220005"></xptr> about four o'clock, and then he used to be very wakefull.</p>
               <p>Have you any thing to alledge against the prisoner at the bar for being guilty of this? - No other, but by finding the stick in the room, and likewise the stairs being so critical, I thought it was impossible for a stranger to have done it, without taking any thing.</p>
               <p>How could a person get into your house without being let in? - God Almighty knows, my Lord, I cannot tell how, unless he got in, in the evening, and concealed himself in the house.</p>
               <p>When you went to bed, did you fasten all your doors and windows? - I fastened all the doors, my Lord, the windows down stairs are not made to open.</p>
               <p>How are they above? - Above they slide up and down.</p>
               <p>Sashes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether these were fastened? - They were all down when I went up stairs, we never did screw them, only slipped them up and down at pleasure.</p>
               <p>Did you find any of them up in the morning? - No, never a one of them.</p>
               <p>Was there any little room of any kind in your husband's room, or within it? - No, there was none, there are three cupboards in Trotman's room, they are the length of the room, to put lumber in.</p>
               <p>Were these cupboards down to the floor? - No, not down to the floor, I imagine they are a yard from the floor.</p>
               <p>Then a person to get into one of these cupboards must have stepped upon something? - They might have stepped upon the bedstead, which is under the cupboards.</p>
               <p>Is there room for a man to stand up in it? - No, they must either lay down or sit in it.</p>
               <p>Is there a cupboard in your husband's room? - No, never a cupboard there.</p>
               <p>Your husband, I find, discharged this prisoner from his service, upon account of neglecting his duty, and not doing his business against the time of his coming home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was his reason? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any enmity between them? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>So you know of no grudge from the prisoner against your husband? - No, my Lord, I never heard anything of the kind.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether any thing was taken away this night from your husband? - I missed nothing but a few farthings, which were in a bason, in a closet where we kept our china, in the room where my husband lay.</p>
               <p>How many farthings were taken away? - I cannot say precisely to the quantity, but I imagine there might be about sixpenny-worth, there were a great man more that lay in rows, in sixpenny-worths, there might be half-a-crown's-worth for what I know.</p>
               <p>That was all you missed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is this all the evidence you can give? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Will the prisoner ask any question of Mrs. Horseman? - No.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Do you know any thing of a stick? - Yes, I saw the prisoner at the bar send for a pipe, and melt lead in it.</p>
               <p>How long was that before this poor man was wounded in this way? - As nigh as I can recollect, it was either Tuesday or Wednesday before.</p>
               <p>How did he melt the lead? - He put lead in the bowl of a tobacco pipe, and put the pipe into the fire, and I saw him take and pour it into the hole of the stick.</p>
               <p>Look at the stick and shew us where it was? - Yes, I will take my oath to the stick, here is the place where it was poured in.</p>
               <p>Court. (Looks at it.) Gentlemen, you will look at it, but it seems to be of no consequence, it is only to fill up the hole.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner when he melted the lead? - At Mr. Horseman's house, he stood directly by the fire, nobody was in the house but me, and the child in my lap.</p>
               <p>How long before Mr. Horseman died, did you see the prisoner at his house? - As nigh as I can recollect it was four or five days.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him at the house any time after he melted the lead, till the time Mr. Horseman died? - He has come into the house after Tuesday, but he has not stopped.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he ever lay in the house, after he was turned away? - Never, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you lay there every night? - Mrs. Horseman, and me, and the two children, lay together every night.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Mr. Horseman ever saw him in the house, after he was turned away? - Not to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>When did he die? - On the Sunday morning, about a quarter after seven.</p>
               <p>What do you impute his death to? - To the wounds he received.</p>

               <p>Court to the Headborough. Was it his voluntary offer to go back or was he persuaded by the people to go back? - We were all gone away over the way, and while we were there, there came in news that there was a confession.</p>
               <p>Was it by the influence of others, or was it his own voluntary desire and proposal? - His own voluntary desire and proposal.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. You hear what this headborough says? - I do, it was not my desire, when I got out of the place several people were there, and bid me go in and say what I did, and they told me that would clear me.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this prisoner at the bar is indicted for the wilful murder of

[Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and then added,] Gentlemen, this evidence is only circumstantial, yet it produces a very strong suspicion certainly in one's mind against the prisoner, but to say there is any direct testimony against him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220013"></xptr> nobody can assert, but they lay a very strong foundation to introduce the confession he has made: I should not for one, though he is very near the state of manhood, chuse to rest singly and merely on his confession, as he is not at full age, though he is above that age of discretion, which the law assigns to be at the age of fourteen years, and certainly it is near the time that human reason is supposed to be mature, therefore, I thought, and my learned brother, and Mr. Recorder agree with me, that it was extremely proper to have the whole circumstances of this case laid before you by evidence; these circumstances, Gentlemen, you have heard, and I cannot but say they operate very strongly on my mind to introduce this confession: Now, the headborough, who seems to be a very sensible man and master of his business, has given a very full account, I think, to authorise and warrant the Court to permit this confession to be read; the Justice of the peace is, I find, an old gentleman, or else he should have attended the Court, but the prisoner having absolutely persisted in his innocence, until they were carrying him off with the commitment, he, in the presence of the headborough, voluntarily, as he swears, begged and intreated to be carried back again to tell the truth of the case before the Justice of the peace; the Justices were all gone except Mr. Machin, he tells you that all sort of time was given to him, that he made this confession with all sort of deliberation, and that it was read to him: I think it unnecessary to read it over to you a second time, it cannot have escaped your memory, it is a full express confession of the fact, and he takes the murder entirely upon himself, and declares that no one else was concerned in it; there is an expression in it, whether true or not, that he did hear Mrs. Horseman express a wish that her husband was dead, whether that was the motive or spring of this horrid action I cannot say: Now he says he is innocent, and that with respect to this confession, some people after he was gone out suggested to him that it was better he would tell the truth, and that would clear him; that is not very consistent, I think, to suppose a man who confesses he is guilty of a wilful murder, and so barbarous a murder as this is, that he should be cleared, that his life should be saved by making an ample confession of the crime, but the headborough being asked again, does expressly tell you it was the voluntary wish and confession of the prisoner: If you are satisfied, Gentlemen, upon the whole, that he is guilty, you will find him so; if you see any reasonable doubt, you will acquit him.</p>

            ; what have you to say, why the Court should not give you judgement to die according to law.</p>
               <p>(Proclamation made.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. Prisoner, you have been convicted, upon evidence which excludes all possibility of doubt, of a crime in itself the most heinous of any that human nature can commit; we are told from sacred authority that the blood of the innocent cries to Heaven for vengeance and atonement, and the voice of God and man agree, that whoso shedeth man's blood, by man also shall his blood be shed: If such is the nature of murder considered in itself, how deeply aggravated is your guilt, when we consider the peculiar circumstances of your case, you have had no palliation from provocation or the influence of ungovernable and fatal passions, but actuated by the most deliberate and diabolical malice, the unhappy victim of your crime was the master whom you had served, who had never injured you, and to whom you owed nothing but reverence and duty; inflamed with the thirst of blood, yet deliberate enough to form an artful plan, for effectuating your internal purpose, you laid in wait for your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220014"></xptr> master's life, and in the dead hour of night when all the innocent part of the family were lulled in rest and seeming security, you crept forth from your lurking place, and in the defenceless and harmless state of sleep, with more than savage ferocity you butchered and mangled your master in the most brutal and inhuman manner; for guilt so aggravated as this, all mercy from the laws of your country must be excluded; far be it, however, from man to set bounds to the mercy of the Most High; happy will it be for you if the attonement of your guilty blood, joined with the deepest remorse and repentance during the short time that remains for you to live, should prove sufficient to obtain that mercy from him hereafter, which justice must deny you here: In the fervent prayer, that his mercy may so work upon your sinful soul as to produce that change which is necessary to your salvation, it remains only for me to pronounce upon you the awful sentence of the law, which must inevitably be carried into execution, which is, that you be carried from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of execution, there to be hanged by the neck till you are dead; and that your body be delivered to be dissected and anatomised, according to the statute, and the Lord have mercy on you sinful soul.</p>
               <p>Mr. Akerman. My Lord, the prisoner now says the accusation against the woman is false.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix to the Jury. Gentlemen, I beg you will ask him whether what he has said is true concerning me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix to Prisoner. Am I innocent of what you have said?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes: (the prisoner was taking away, but brought back again) She is innocent of every thing I have accused her with.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the motive that urged you to the commission of this horrid crime?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. It is thought proper by the Court that the sentence should be executed as near as conveniently may be where the murder was committed, make out the order accordingly.</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice GOULD.</p>

            . I was visiting Ilfracombe, in Devonshire - I live in Margaret-street, Cavendish-square. -On the 9th of October I wrote a letter to Miss Hetherington, of No. 56, Margaret-street, Cavendish-square, and enclosed in it a 5l. Bank note and a sixpence; I took the number of the note, but not the date - I delivered the letter with my own hands at the Post-office at Ilfracombe; I saw the post-master, and told him it contained a 5l. note -I saw him mark it as a money-letter: on my arriving in town on the 26th or 27th of October, I learnt from my friend that the letter had not arrived - I had written my name on the Bank note - (looking at one) this is my name and the Bank note I sent, and the number is the same, I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You made a memorandum of the number? A. Yes, but I have lost it; I cannot recollect the number, but the writing on the note is mine - I had been at Ilfracombe about a month, and received the 5l. note there, from Mrs. Willis; I generally write my name on notes which I pay away - I had no other 5l. Bank note at Ilfracombe, nor for the last six months, and can positively say I have not written my name on a 5l. Bank note for the last twelve months; I may have been in possession of one since July, 1830; the date of the note, and have written my name on it, but do not remember; I only swear to this note by its having my name on it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You miss your memorandum, had you shown it to any body? A. Yes, I sent it to the General Post-office by Miss Hetherington; it was the memorandum I made at Ilfracombe - the name of Parminter on the note is my hand-writing; I have not put my Christian name - I remember omitting to do so, and writing the name on the note diagonally, as this is.</p>

            . In October last I lived at No. 56, Margaret-street, Cavendish-square - I did not receive any letter on the 12th from Miss Parminter, containing a 5l. note - I expected one, and attended for the postman that day. but he did not come; Miss Parminter some time afterwards gave me a paper with a number on it; I took it to the General Post-office, by her direction, and showed it to a clerk in the Secretary's-office - he took the number down on a paper, and returned me the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290059"></xptr>original paper; I do not recollect what I did with it - it is lost: I have looked for it - I do not recollect the number.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you keep the house? A. No, I am in a situation there - seven or eight persons live in the house; there are two females and only one servant; the letters are delivered usually about half-past nine o'clock, except on Mondays; this was on Friday - I gave up expecting it about half-past ten, and paid no further attention to it; I afterwards went to the Post-office with the memorandum - I showed it to a person there; I gave it him to copy - he gave it to me back again immediately; I was not aware that it was the original memorandum, and do not know what I did with it; I did not return it to Miss Parminter - I have searched my writing-desk for it.</p>

            . In October last I was clerk of the money-book, in the Inland-office. On that morning I remember receiving some money-letters from Rollo; the addresses were entered in the money-book by my assistant - I signed my initials to the bill; (looking at it) here are my initials which I signed; I was assisted that morning by Mr. Hinton, as it was a heavy morning(Monday) - I gave the letters to Hinton to be entered in the book, and after he had entered them, I received them back from him; they were directed to different parties: he had about fifty of them - here is one money-letter entered in the book, in the name of Miss Hetherington, No. 56, Margaret-street, London - this was on the 12th of October; the entry is dated Friday, the 12th of October - I keep the letters till I deliver them to the letter-carrier, who produces receipts for them, corresponding with the directions; I cannot remember who the carrier was - I am not acquainted with their names; before or shortly after the addresses are entered, receipts are made out corresponding with the addresses, and delivered over to be sorted in the different divisions; after the letters are sorted in the different divisions, the amount of postage is counted up - the amount is first entered in a docket, and afterwards copied into a charge-book; the letter-carrier who tells it up with the officer, signs his initials to the paper - the carrier then has the letters not containing money, and receipts for the money-letters; he brings those receipts to me, and I deliver money-letters corresponding with the receipts - he enters his name in the book opposite the address, as an acknowledgment that he has received it; the name signed against the letter in question, appears to be J. Moulden; I know him by sight, but do not know his hand-writing - I cannot recollect who received the letters that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Hinton always assist in the office? A. No; it was a heavy morning: Saturday is almost as heavy a morning as Monday - Hinton is a clerk in the establishment; there are fifty or sixty letter-sorters: they all know they can get letters by producing the receipts, but they must sort them out of the regular course to get them - we only look to see that the receipt corresponds with the letters.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If a man whose name you knew brought a receipt in another name, would you deliver the letters to him? A. He must put his initials to it; any lettercarrier producing a receipt would have the letters - I do not know the men; there are two hundred and twenty carriers.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPPARD. Q. The carrier's name is not on the receipt? A. No, if a carrier brings a receipt, I conclude it is in his division, and give him the letter on his signing the book - I knew the prisoner as a carrier, but did not know his name; he would know the manner of obtaining letters as well as the others.</p>

                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18321129-118-victim1112 t18321129-118-viclabel658"></join> - he has been there about eighteen months; I do not remember whether he told up the letters of the second charge of 1l. 8s. for the Cavendish-square district on the 12th of October - these initials G. T. on it, I believe to be in the prisoner's handwriting; this is the docket for 1l. 8s. - here is G. T. in pencil; we take the initials in pencil from the carriers -I was afterwards present with Mr. Peacock and the prisoner; Mr. Peacock, the solicitor, showed him the initials in my presence, and said to him, "Did you tell this charge?" he said he did, and that the initials were his: Margaret-street, Cavendish-square, is in the walk of a man named Hazell, who is assistant to Moulden, they were the only two on the walk - it is not at all irregular for one letter-carrier to tell up a charge for another; it is done daily, for expedition sake - the prisoner's seat is in the first division of the letter-carrier's seat, No. 1; Moulden's seat is next to the prisoner - eight, ten, or twelve sit in that division; there is a small partition, about two inches high, between them: last October I remember the prisoner asking for leave of absence - I think it was about the 15th or 20th; he said he was going to Chichester, because he was unwell, and wished to go there, as his friends lived there- leave was granted him for about ten days; he had told me before that Chichester was his native place - I have often seen him write - (looking at the 5l. note) I believe this " G. Simes, 17, Spital-street, Guilford," on the front of the note to be his writing, but do not positively swear to it - here is the same name and address on the back; I believe that also to be his writing - there is no letter d in the word Guildford; I think both addresses are in his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Carriers sometimes tell up the amount of postage for each other? A. They do if one is engaged at the moment the charge is called - they occasionally charge their seats in the division; while he was in that walk he would sit in that seat - I am present while they are engaged; the prisoner generally sat in the next seat to Moulden - I do not know that I can be positive he sat in that particular seat that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they each a desk? A. No, a small table - he could not occupy a seat in another division; each man has a table about two feet six inches wide, enclosed by a small partition - I have no doubt these two pencil letters are the prisoner's hand-writing; also the address on the front and back of the note - I have not a doubt of either of them being the prisoner's writing; I will swear the pencil letters are his - I do not consider it a disguised hand; the endorsement is not so natural as that on the front of the note, but still it is his - I consider it a little disguised; the note was first shown to me about the 25th of October - I am not certain who showed it to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you told the particulars of the charge, and asked whose hand-writing you thought it? A. I believe the idea of it being the prisoner's hand-writing arose in my own office - there was no charge against the prisoner then: he was absent on leave at the time, and I wrote to him at Chichester to attend the office a certain day; I knew the note was supposed to be stolen when I was asked about the hand-writing - he admitted at once that he had told up the charge, and the initials were his; I am not quite certain whether he knew he was suspected at that time - he was told so at that meeting.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can you tell whether the addresses were both put on the note at the same time? A. I cannot; I took a day or two to consider before I discovered the similarity of the prisoner's hand-writing; we referred to other carrier's hand-writings, the letter not being in his delivery - my assistant selected out the book, and then we made up our minds that it was his writing: my assistant (Hoskins) may have said to me "This is very like George Tucker's hand-writing" - I agreed with him; nobody desired me to say it was his writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you seen the note before the assistant pointed it out to you? A. Yes; when it was first put into my hands I did not form an opinion of it - I had my opinion that it was his hand-writing without reference to any document, but it is usual in the office to refer to documents; directly my assistant told me his opinion I formed mine, without reference to any document.</p>

            . In October last I was a letter-carrier to the General Post-office; my walk was the Cavendish-square district - Margaret-street is in that walk; the letters there would be delivered by Hazel, my assistant. On the 12th of October I was on duty in the morning at the Post-office; if a letter had come directed to Miss Hetherington, it ought to have come into my possession - if it was a money-letter, the receipt of it would come into my hands first; I should have given Hazel the receipt for letters for delivery in Margaret-street, and he would take it to the clerk to get the letter; (looking at the book) here is the entry of Miss Hetherington's letter; I do not make the name signed against it to be "Moulden" - I do not know what to make of it; I am sure it is not my hand-writing: no such money-letter came into my possession on the 12th of October - I know the prisoner very well; he sat by my side in the office on the 12th of October; when I deliver letters to Hazel, I tell the postage up; Tucker has been in the habit of telling the letters up for me almost every morning; I do not recollect whether he did so that morning or not - he brought in the second charges for me that morning: some letters were sorted for Hazel from this charge; if there had been a receipt for a money-letter in that charge, he would have an opportunity of taking it; the letters delivered to Hazel corresponded with the charge of 1l. 8s. - I cannot say whether I told them up that day or not, but if the prisoner had told them up, and told me, I should have put it down; when the prisoner told them up, I put down the amount, without looking to see if it is right; I always trusted to Tucker - on that morning he brought out the second charge; when I deliver over the letters to Hazel, I do not check them to see that he has the letters named in it - I trusted to Tucker's word; I do not know whether Hazel has them.</p>

               <p>Q. On that morning did you deliver the other charge? A. Yes, and such of this charge as had the letters which were for my part of the delivery I delivered; I have seen Tucker write several times; "
               <persName id="t18321129-118-person1123">G. G. </persName>
            Simes," &amp;c. on the front of this note, I believe to be Tucker's writing; I do not know whose this is on the back.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290061"></xptr>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner brought out the second charge, amounting to 28s.? A. Yes - I mean he brought it out from the office, which is about a dozen yards from where I received it - he had to go into another office for it; I did not see him tell over the charge - he does that in another office, not the one I was in; he has to cross another office to bring the letters to me - receipts are not so bulky as letters, merely slips of paper mixed with the letters; if he dropped a receipt the charge would be wrong when retold; if he told me it was correct, I should take his word, without retelling it; I have seen him write almost every morning for the last six or seven months - I first saw the Bank note last Tuesday week; when I was asked if I knew the hand-writing I knew the object of the question; I believe the writing in front to be his - I can say nothing of the back; I think they are written by different persons - I was not shown any of the prisoner's writing to compare with it; but last Tuesday I looked at the mail-cart book, with his writing in it, to see if it corresponded with his writing or not; I did not ask for it - it was shown to me: the signature was 
               <persName id="t18321129-118-person1124">G. </persName>
            Tucker: I looked at it to see if it agreed with the name of Moulden, not with the name on the note - Mr. Critchett never gave his opinion of it before me; the prisoner always sat next to me, and in one place in the division: he did not change his seat while with me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On the 12th of October there were two charges? A. Yes; Hazel brought out the first charge, which was 2l. 5s. 8d. - I checked that with him, to see if it was right; Tucker brought out the second, and I trusted to him to tell me the amount - I received the letters from him, which I delivered; I checked with Hazel those I delivered; I have several Members of Parliament on my beat- they have gone out of town, and I have got Tucker to write me their directions, to send their letters on; I have seen him write a great many directions.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you receive the letters you delivered from Moulden himself? A. I believe not; I received part of them from Tucker; I do not examine the letters to see if they agree with the bill; I saw that my letters were the same as they were charged to me, which I could tell by reference to my own books, I found mine were 13s. 5d. - I ascertained that was correct; I believe I received the letters from Tucker - I looked them over before I left the office, to see that the 13s. 5d. was correct; I knew nothing of the other part of the charge.</p>

            . I am an assistant inspector of letter-carriers at the Post-office. I have known the prisoner eighteen months - I have received letters from him, and am acquainted with his hand-writing - he is assistant carrier to the Bedford and Fitzroy-square walk; the letters in that walk are generally all delivered by eleven, or between eleven and twelve o'clock on common days - I believe this "
               <persName id="t18321129-118-person1130">G. </persName>
            Simes," &amp;c. on the front of this note to be the prisoner's handwriting - I never corresponded with him; I received two letters from him on official business, stating that he was too ill to attend his duty, and have seen him sign his name to the dockets - he only signed "
               <persName id="t18321129-118-person1131">G. </persName>
            Tucker." I have also seen him write his name when he entered the returned letters; that entry contained in his handwriting the address on the letters, and his signature; I have no knowledge of the character of his handwriting but by comparison; I saw this note first about a fortnight ago; the suspicion on my mind when I first saw the note was, that it was the prisoner's independent of any comparison - it was previous to my comparing it; my mind was chiefly made up when I first saw it - I believed it then to he his; the writing on the back of this note seem to me precisely the same, and I believe it is the same hand-writing - I believe it to be the prisoner's; I remember giving an order last November, for all the carriers to be on duty in the evening - it was in the morning I gave the order, it was the day before the prisoner was apprehended - he was present when I gave the order - I was close to his seat when I gave the order - I gave it aloud to every one who went out - he must have heard it, they were to attend that evening - he did not attend in the evening; I have reason to believe all the others were there, all that could possibly be there - I am sure the prisoner was not; I cannot be positive whether all the others did attend; I had heard of the charge against the prisoner - they were merely called together, as two clerks were to come to recognize a person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You told the whole party as they went out to attend? A. They were all told of it round their several divisions - and as they went out, I told them individually; nothing was said about the cause of their attending - the prisoner had returned from Chichester on the Monday previous, in consequence of a letter sent to him - the note was first shown to me by one of (Mr. Stow's) the president's clerk; I did not then know the prisoner was suspected, and had no reason to suspect it, not till about a fortnight after - two other persons have been suspected, but not of this identical act; the writing both on the back and front of the note, I believe to be the prisoner's, and his natural writing - I afterwards compared it with the book to convince my mind further of it; my opinion was more confirmed by the comparison - the prisoner's district<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290062"></xptr>is not a very large one; he might be engaged on a heavy day, till about twelve o'clock or a little after.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPPARD. Q. Was it in consequence of seeing the hand-writing on the note that you first suspected the prisoner? Yes, I had heard nobody say they conceived it to be his writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On what day did the prisoner come from Chichester, in consequence of being written to? A. On the Monday; he was on duty that day, and was taken up on the Tuesday - it was on the Monday I told him to attend in the evening.</p>

I never knew any person of the name of Simes in my life; nor did I know there was such a street as Spital-street in Guildford, for I have only called on Mr. Pink there a few times, merely in passing to and from Chichester, where my friends reside; but, if the fact, as it now appears that Mr. Pink lives in Spital-street, shall, from its unfortunate coincidence with the address upon the note, appear to press against me, does it not also furnish a strong argument in favour of my innocence, furnishing, as it was likely to do, a certain clue to detection: if, indeed, I were guilty, (the serious consequences of which every person in the post-office is well aware of) is it probable I should have obeyed, as I instantly did, the summons to attend at that establishment, or would not a natural impulse have induced me to seek for safety in flight; I attended at the Post-office, and was there informed of the charge against me, yet I voluntarily remained to meet it - gave readily and candidly every explanation in my power, nor did I hesitate to write the name and address required by the Post-office solicitor, although if I had really committed this offence I must have well known I was thereby promoting my own condemnation: I need hardly observe that nothing is more fallacious than the opinions which are formed upon hand-writing, nor would any person he safe if such a test were for a moment to be depended upon by a Jury.</p>

            . I am a twopenny-postman, and knew the prisoner at Chichester; I came from there eight months ago: I believe the coach arrives at Guildford about half-past twelve o'clock - it changes horses there.</p>

            , the Prisoner, came in about 11 a Clock, and call'd for a Pint of Drink. That Michael Young knowing some of them, they drank Punch together. That they call'd for a two Shilling Bowl, and Michael Young bid them make it a half Crown Bowl; but when the Reckoning came to be paid, he would not pay any Thing toward it, but challenged any of them to fight. That they went out of the House, and in a few Minutes Joseph Hutton and the rest of the Company came in again, and about half a Quarter of an Hour after Michael Young came, and brought with him five or six Men. That then they went out together, and stay'd out better than a Quarter of an Hour, both of them very bloodyThat when they came in they wash'd themselves, and Joseph Hutton said to Michael Young, I hope there will no further Trouble come of it; and Michael Young said, None should come on his part, and the deceas'd said, None should on his part; and they shook Hands and were Friends. Landry Dawson depos'd to the same purpose, adding. That when the Prisoner came in, he deny'd to be in Liquor, and that he refus'd to pay part of the Reckoning, upon which high Words arising, he challeng'd to fight one of the Company; but the deceas'd said, He should not fight with that Person, because he was not an equal Match for him; that then the Prisoner challeng'd him, or the Best Man in the Company. That the Deceas'd reply'd, If he was so bent on fighting, himself was the Man. That then they went out of the Doors of fight, but

             would not fight without having some of his own Friends present, and so he ran down to the Water side and brought several Men along with him, and then they went out together into the Fields and fought fairly, and when they had done shook Hands and parted. Another Evidence depos'd to the same <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172212050008"></xptr> purpose, adding, That the Prisoner having call'd for a Pot of Flip, and the Company having drank part of that, when the Reckoning came to be paid, did refuse to pay part towards the Punch, that thence the Quarrel arose, that they went out, fought fairly, and were Friends again. There were several other Evidences to the same purpose, who all swore for the King.

That they having done Michael Young came upon him again, slung him down, and knee'd him very much; that then he said he had enough, for he believ'd had he struck two Blows more he should have dy'd. Another Evidence depos'd to the same purpose, adding. That the deceas'd, after relating this Matter, cry'd out, O Michael Young! O Michael Young! A Surgeon, who was call'd to him, depos'd, That when he came to him, he found him labouring with a Shortness of Breath, and a Fever, and the Appearance of a Contusion upon his Stomach; that after he was dead, upon opening him, he found a Large Collection of Matter between the Pleura and Diaphragma, and he did believe he dy'd of the Bruises. Another Surgeon depos'd, That he, at opening the Body, did not perceive any outward Wound or Discoloration of the Stomach, nor apparent Bruise, but a black Eye; but upon turning up the Sternum, did find about half a Pint of corrupted Matter, which he suppos'd might proceed from the Rupture of some Vessels by some violent Straining, or by a Fall.

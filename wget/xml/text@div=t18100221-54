When the porter goes out, I commit the ticket to his care; he is to receive the money, and to account for it to the other clerk. This is the book which he has, and is marked off with the receiving clerk's initials, Thomas Vincent, if paid.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went into Mr. Deakin's service, I understood I was going to be bookkeeper in a short time. I expected, by a person that recommended me, that I was to have twenty-five shillings a week; instead of that, I only got a guinea. I sent to Mr. Deakin to have my wages raised; in consequence of that I was discharged. I wished to pay Mr. Deakin; I had not money enough; I got a place at Mr. Savage's; I wished to make the account right, If Mr. Deakin would have given me time; he wished to have it immediately; it was out of my power.</p>

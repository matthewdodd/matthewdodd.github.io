On the 15th of this instant June the watchman knocked at the door between twelve and one in the night. We got up and found a window shutter taken down, and the sash broke, and one square of glass out. The window shutter was fast at out going to bed before eleven o'clock. I could not tell what was lost out of the window till afterwards, when I saw a bag of things which were taken out of the window. The watchman told us he had taken the thief, and a bag of things, which was gone to the watch-house. About nine in the morning it was brought to our house, and in it were the things laid in the indictment, which I knew to be my mistress's property.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 15th of June, between twelve and one, having been been my rounds, I hung up my lanthorn, and sat down: about five minutes after hearing some glass break, I went with my rattle, but left my lanthorn behind, towards the place: when I came within about forty yards of the White Horse I heard the glass break again; then I knew where it was. (This house had been attempted twice before, and I put them by.) By the reflection of the lamp I saw hands moving at the window, and heard glass break again. I advanced nearer, and saw hands go in and draw goods out. There were two men. I came within seven or eight yards of them: they saw me, and stood and looked at me as if they had an intent to attack me. I saw some goods hang out of the window, and some in a sack by the window. I gave a spring with my rattle, and they turned about and ran away. I pursued them both. They left all behind them. They both took one way. At last one wheeled about and went another way, but I followed the prisoner, and rattled still as I ran. He ran into a yard, formerly the manor house in Finsbury. I stopped the gate. Another watchman came immediately. I said, Stand at the gate, I know where he is. Then another came. Two of us went in: then I heard the prisoner jump down off the wall, which was ten feet high: he was got into a close place, about six or eight feet broad. I got over and took him in a vault. There was no way to get there, but by going over that wall, or through the house to which the vault belonged. We took the prisoner back over the wall, and to the watch-house. I knew the prisoner before, by seeing him about with a bad gang. He shammed as if he was asleep when I took hold of him. There were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280004"></xptr> a couple of keys and a pack of cards found in that vault in the morning by the person that owns the vault. He was never out of my sight, when running, till after he got in at the gate of the yard. I found these two chissels (produced in court) about two hours after he was taken, hid in a corner near Artillery Court. We compared them to marks made in the window shutter, and found the marks were done by them.</p>

            . I am the constable. I was on duty betwixt the 15th and 16th of this instant in the watch-house, and heard the alarm given by Taylor with his rattle (it is in the same form with a child's rattle, which they swing round, only it makes a greater noise.) I ran out with two watchmen and the beadle, and made towards Mrs. Hubbard's house. I found this bag within three or four yards of her house, in the foot way, with the things that are now in it. I have had them in my custody ever since. (The goods laid in the indictment produced in court, and deposed to by Rutherford as the property of her mistress.) The watchmen were rattling as they ran to Taylor's assistance to this yard, which is about thirty or forty yards distance from Mrs. Hubbard's house, on the opposite side the way. When I came into the yard I saw Taylor, and another watchman or two. I heard Taylor say, He is gone over the wall, pointing to where a brick was fresh broke out. Taylor got over. Presently the prisoner came over, and Taylor after him. When the prisoner jumped down we secured him, and took him to the watch-house: then I went with Mr. Crowder the beadle to Mrs. Hubbard's with the bag. Her servant, which is now here, was very particular to every article.</p>

               <p>About seven or eight o'clock I went to the other end of the town to my uncle, coming home I came down Fleet-market, and went into a cook's shop, and bought some meat and a halfpenny-worth of bread; I went to a public house and eat it with a pint of beer. I staid there till about eleven o'clock, then came directly home to my mother's. I knocked at the door, and could make no-body hear. I did not know where to go to lie, searing I should be taken up as a disorderly person; then I thought it best to go over this wall and sit down in the necessary house. I did, and fell asleep. I had not been asleep long before this man came and awaked me. He laid hold of my collar, and said, you are the man that broke the window. I said, I know nothing of the matter.</p>

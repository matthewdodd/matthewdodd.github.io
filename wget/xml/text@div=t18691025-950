On 1st October, from informa<lb></lb>tion I received, I went to the Fulham Workhouse—inquest was held there on the body of a newly-born female child—I afterwards went into the infirmary of the workhouse and saw the prisoner—I told her she must-consider herself a prisoner, for concealing the birth of her female child—I told her I should go and search her box, to see if I could find any linen, or to see if any provision had been made—she said, It is no use for you to go there, you will find nothing."</p>

I am the wife of Alfred Beau, and live at Brookland House, New Road, Hammersmith—the prisoner was in my service as cook—I thought she appeared pregnant, and taxed her wild it she denied it, and said she was suffering from a female complaint—on 30th September she became very unwell—I advised her to go to bed, and went up to see her—I then taxed her with having been delivered of a child—she told me she had been—I asked her where it was—she said it was not in the room, it was in the cellar—and it was found there afterwards.</p>

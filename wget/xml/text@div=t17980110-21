             sworn. - I am a widow; On Tuesday, the 19th of December, the prisoner came into my house, I <rs id="t17980110-21-viclabel112" type="occupation">keep wine-vaults</rs>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me take it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see me put it down? - A. No. He said he did not mean to take it away.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.When had you last seen it in its place? - A. Some hours before; my nephew had seen it very shortly before.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I was drinking tea with the last witness; I heard a noise like the rattling of halfpence; I went into the shop, and saw the prisoner in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.Running or walking? - A. Walking.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him have hold of any thing in the shop? - A. No; about three minutes before, I saw the till in its proper place; when I went into the shop it was drawn out, and put upon the counter.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was the till locked? - A. Yes, but the key was in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had just left work, I looked in for a glass of gin, and as I went in at the door a man struck me, and knocked me backwards; I am quite innocent of it.</p>

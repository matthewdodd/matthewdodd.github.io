            's property.) I went to his house, and ask'd for him. His wife was out. She came in, and the prisoner said he thought that the boy came honestly by them. She went and took the things out of a chest; he was in the room at the time she delivered them to me. I think he said he gave half a crown for the dessart spoons, and 8 d. and 6 d. a piece for the others.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth each?</p>
               <p>Brown. The dessart spoons are worth about 6 s. each, and the others about 18 d. each.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make a demand of any money?</p>
               <p>Brown. No, he did not. The boy was there at the time. He said the first thing he brought there was in order to buy a pair of buckles. The prisoner is a shoe-maker, or cobler; his wife keeps a cutler's shop, and sells buckles and sticks. The boy and he were examin'd before the justice, where the boy confessed the stealing and he the buying of the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he knew them to be stolen?</p>
               <p>Brown. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time watch or use any means for finding out the persons that robbed you. - A. Never before that morning; I found them out on Saturday morning the 4th of July; my wife sat up till three o'clock in the morning, she came to bed then. I concealed myself in the parlour below stairs; about four o'clock the two young men came down stairs it was day light; they began dusting their clothes. One of them put his hand into the window where there was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160015"></xptr>pane of glass broke; he said there is a double curtain here; that was the parlour where I was. The other came back through the passage to the bottom of the stair case, where there was another broken; he put his hand and said here is another curtain there is two windows to that parlour. I was concealed in that room under that window; there are two windows in that room, one in the yard and one in the passage. I saw them, but neither of them could see me. He then went to the tap-room; I

             the curtain of one side, I saw him through the window, it was the same man; the other man was walking backwards and forwards in the passage at the time; he went through the tap-room to the bar door, he took this file and put it between the bar-door and forced it open.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see at that time where the instrument was. - A. No, he took it from the fire place and forced the door in the wrong way: it was locked when I went to bed; he was in the bar about a minute and a half; I heard the halfpence jingle: the other went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they speak to each other at the time. - A. Not till they went up stairs. As soon as he came out of the bar he fastened the bar door again, he put this file on the mantle piece and went up stairs to his comrade and said all is well. I went for an officer, he came and took them in the room; I pointed out the man that went into the bar; the officer found five halfpence which my wife had marked the night before, and a bottle of rum under the bed head; we took them to Bow-street. When we came back we found another bottle in a hole in the floor by the bed's head; they had drawed it off the cask. I had gauged my cask the night before, I guaged it again in the morning; there was a deficiency of a pint and a half. I had lost rum frequently before, and halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. These two bottles must contain more than you missed out of your cask. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of your rum. - A. I valued it at three shillings a bottle.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was the prisoner that went into the bar. -

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the proceeding night to the morning my husband has been speaking of, I marked twenty old halfpence and nine new ones; I put them in the till; there were other halfpence that were not marked. I sat up till three o'clock, I went to bed and my husband got up. The officer shewed me the halfpence; they were the same that I had marked the night before.</p>
               <p>- SMITH, I am an officer of Bow-street. I searched the prisoners, I found nothing upon them; under the head of the bed on the floor I found a bottle of rum; there was no cork in it, it was full. On the bed I found a waistcoat; Williams owned it, with five halfpence in it; he said they were his halfpence what he had got in change the over night. I shewed the halfpence to the landlady at the time I took them down to Bow-street. I came back again; I found another bottle under the floor; that was corked.</p>

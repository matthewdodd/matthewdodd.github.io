                  </hi>. I am cashier in the London department of the West of England Fire and Life Insurance Office, 20, New Bridge-street, Blackfriars. On the 28th of July last I received instructions from the prisoner for the insurance of property in a house No. 59, High-street, Lambeth—the Company was established at Exeter, and the Directors sit there—the policies are written in London, and sent to Exeter for the signature of three of the Directors—they are responsible for what I do in London—the instructions given me, on this occasion, were to insure 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on stock-in-trade, as a butcher, and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on household goods and furniture, in the name of Charles Cordwent—the prisoner did not tell me his name—I thought his name was Charles Cordwent—I understood it so—I acted upon those instructions—this policy was issued by another clerk, from the instructions which I took—it was issued by our office—I know two of the signatures to the policy, and I know the attesting wit<lb></lb>ness—he is at Exeter, I believe—he is the Secretary of the Company—in consequence of the instructions I received, this policy was written and sent to the Directors in due course—at the time the instruc<lb></lb>tions were given, I made an entry in this book—a receipt is given for the money at the time the instructions are given—I received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the prisoner on this occasion—supposing the policy to remain in the hands of the Company, after the premium is paid, the party would be entitled to be paid that policy—we have had instances of losses occurring before the policies were issued, but the Company always pay on the receipt—I gave a receipt to the prisoner on this occasion.</p>

The prisoner occupied the one pair back room—he is a baker—I was in the habit of calling him of an evening to go to his work; generally about a quarter to eleven o'clock—on Monday evening, the 9th of August, I was in my room, in which I can bear what is going on in the prisoner's room—about a quarter before nine I heard him come up stairs, and heard some talking in his room—I did not hear what was said—the talking did not continue more than two or three minutes—it was the butcher-boy and the prisoner—the butcher's boy went down stairs, after asking the prisoner what time he should call him—the prisoner said, when he shut up shop, about nine or half-past nine—about ten minutes before ten I called him and told him it was ten—he said, "I know it is"—I then returned to ray own room—about ten I heard him run down the stairs—I heard him speak to some one when he got to the bottom of the stairs, but I do not know who it was—I remained in my room—I am quite sure the person who ran down stairs came out of his room—I then smelt as if there was wood burning somewhere, and went down stairs—about two minutes before the prisoner went out, I had heard the cracking of wood, which I thought might be by the striking of lucifer on the wall—it was after that that I smelt fire—when I went down stairs and came to the prisoner's door, I found the flames coming from under<lb></lb>neath the door, and at the side of the door—the door was shut and locked, and the key was in the door, outside—I had four children up stairs, three were in bed and asleep—I got the children out of the house, after giving an alarm in the house—the butcher's boy ran out naked—the furniture in ay room is my husband's property.</p>

               <p>rather clean—the flooring was laid on joists, and under that was the ceiling of the room below—there was dirt and dust there—the shavings did not appear to be in that dusty state in which they would be from lying there a long time—the door-post was scorched—part of the wood and shavings in the first hole appeared to have been on fire—I had no difficulty in getting the first piece of flooring up—I had a <hi rend="italic">goodish</hi> bit in getting the last piece up—I saw a hook round in the hole by the policeman—I saw no place from which the hook had apparently come, no more than on the head-board—a bottle was also found close by the hole, which smelt as if it had contained turpentine—it was empty—the hole was about two feet from the door, on the side of it—this is the bottle now produced.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant L</hi> 6.) On Monday night, the 9th of August, I was at the High-street station—in consequence of hearing a cry of "Fire," I gave notice to Campbell, and proceeded with him to No. 59—I went into the back room first floor—I found the smoke very thick—the fire was out—it did not require any further water—the constable who took the prisoner has had the boards in his possession—I saw them taken up—this large board was taken from the floor next to this small piece, which was taken up next to the skirting towards the door—we had some trouble to take up this large piece—it extended towards the wall, on the right-hand as you go into the room, and likewise to the left towards the bedstead—there was a hole at the end of this small board, and here is a piece which I picked up in the hole, which corresponds with it—the hole was near to the small end, which was most burnt—this small piece has been sawed off from this piece, and it matches the part which is still on—there is a piece of wood on it, which fits in the other piece—I also found Some shavings, which I have produced, and there was a quantity more,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184109200134"></xptr>
               <p>which I have left behind—I found some at each end of the flooring the largest quantity was found at this end, and the smallest quantity at the other—those found at this end were the cleanest, because they were not so much burnt as the other—they were burnt—when I took up a few shav<lb></lb>ings with the dirt, the dirt between the flooring and the ceiling of the room below smelt of turpentine—I found this bottle within a foot of the hole, where most of the fire had been, alongside the bedstead—there was a tea-spoon full of turpentine left in the bottle, not more—I am satisfied it was turpentine, it smelt so—it smells somewhat of it now—I think I could have collected about a tea-spoonful—it was quite clean and clear, such as painters use—I saw a piece of fat pork taken out of the hole—it appeared as if it had dropped off from something which had been hanging up—there was a nail just over where the fire was—whether it bad dropped off that I cannot say—I also found a hook in the hole—there was nothing attached to the hook—I produce a saw, which I found on the top of a half-cupboard or sideboard—I have not pot the door-post here—I took nothing to pieces only the board—the door-post was burnt very trifling—these other boards were thrown down stairs, and I got them from there—there were three chairs, a bedstead, a bed, a palliasse, three blankets, a pair of sheets, a bolster, two pillows, and a counterpane in the room, a bedstead, which laid down on the side tied up, and a box belonging to Cordwent—I should say all the articles were not worth more than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the outside.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police superintendent</hi>). I was at the station on Good Friday morning—Hoare and Daley were brought there in custody—I entered the charge, and said that the tin which was found in their possession had been stolen from this gentleman, who was sitting in the office, and said, "And he charges you with receiving it, knowing it to be stolen"—Hoare said, "I know who I had it from, I had it from this per<lb></lb>son," turning round to Mrs. Daley—he then commenced a statement, and I said, "Well, if you wish to make a statement and approve of it, I will take it in writing"—he was getting rather lengthy—I said, "I shall have to state it before the Magistrate"—he said, "Very well, take it in writing"—I proceeded to do so from his dictation—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I read it over to him, and he signed it—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I am a metal dealer, living at No. 44, Compton-street, Clerkenwell; in consequence of a com<lb></lb>munication made to me by a man named Kingsley, in my employ, that Mrs. Daley had sent a man to ask me to go down to her to buy some metal, I went with my cart to Mrs. Daley's, who keeps a marine store shop, near the Hermitage Bridge; I saw Mrs. Daley there; she showed me some bags which she said contained tin, and asked me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound for it; the tin was in ingots; I put them on the scale; they weighed 3 cwt. 1 qr. 14 lbs; I agreed to give her 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound for it, and upon calculating the amount I made it 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I paid to Mrs. Daley in a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, five sove<lb></lb>reigns, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver; I took the tin from Mrs. Daley's premises, in her presence, and put it into my cart, and when in the act of driving away towards home, the officer jumped up into my cart; he asked me what was in the cart; I told him to look, and I stopped the horse; he examined the</p>

The above statement is strictly true, and was taken in writing by my own request, this 21st March, 1806. T. Hoare. Witness, Thos. Pillow")—when he mentioned Kingsley's name, I said, "I suppose you mean the man who ran away out of the cart?" he said, "No, that man is a stranger to me, a young man who asked me for a ride, I do not know his name"—I have calculated the amount, and think it would be 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, at 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Pillow here stated, that it was</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per cwt., which was</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">odd for the six ingots</hi>)—after Hoare had concluded his statement, I told Daley to give up the money she had got about her to the officer, and said, "If you do not, you must be searched by a female searcher"—she handed a <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie</hi> to Bridget, with some sovereigns in it, and I said, "Where is the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note?"—she said, "I never had a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; you never lost sight of me; I could not have got rid of it; he never paid it to me"—while Hoare was making his statement he produced this white memorandum book, and referred to this entry.</p>

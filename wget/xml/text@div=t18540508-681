                  </hi>. I am a widow, and carry on business as an iron<lb></lb>monger, at Conmore-place, North Brixton. On 11th April the prisoner came and handed me this order—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "Half gross of screws, inch and half inch. J.

I keep the Beehive, Carter-street, Walworth—on Tuesday, I think it was, 4th April, the prisoner came to my house, and asked for two bottles of the best port wine, and change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—he said it was for Mr. Cook, the builder, whose office is in the neighbourhood, and for whom I have cashed cheques before; I gave the prisoner the wine and 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he went away; I sent my servant to follow him, having a suspicion, and put the note in my cash box until about the 15th, when I paid it to one of the collectors to Nicholsons, the distillers, Mr. Bouts, and saw him write my name on it—it was returned to me on the 17th as forged—I am sure this is the same note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

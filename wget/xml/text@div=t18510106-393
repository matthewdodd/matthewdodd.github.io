               <p>of Mr. Wellington Williams, of Gutter-lane. I have been in his service four or five months—I am seventeen years of age—I know the prisoner Hart—I first became acquainted with him about two months ago—he was then in Gutter-lane, crying "Old clothes"—I sold him a jacket within about twenty yards of my master's house—I believe I got a shil<lb></lb>ling for it—he asked me where I worked—I said at Mr. Williams'—he asked me what he dealt in—I told him collars, shirt fronts, ladies habits, and children's dresses—he asked me whether I had any soiled collars to sell—I told him no—he then asked me if I could get anything—I told him I could get things, but I should not—he said, "If you do get any things I will buy them of you, and give you a better price than any one else"—we then separated, and I saw him again in a morning or two after<lb></lb>wards—he then asked me if I had anything I could sell him—I told him no—he asked me if I could get anything—I told him no, I could not—I saw him again in two or three mornings afterwards—he then asked whe<lb></lb>ther I had got anything for him—I said not—after I had seen him six or eight times, I agreed to let him have something, and there was an arrange<lb></lb>ment made between us—I was to come down to White's Ground, under the archway—I told him I did not know where it was—he said, "Then meet me in Artillery-lane"—I did not go—I saw him a morning or two after that, in Gutter-lane—he asked me why I did not come down—I do not remember what answer I made—I went down to White's-row, last Monday week—that was the first time—I had not seen him anywhere before that, except in Gutter-lane—on Monday week, I took the articles stated, to the archway, in White's Ground—I had taken them from my employer four or five days previous, I believe on the Thursday, and deposited them at a tobacconist's in St. Martin's-le-Grand—on Monday week I took them away from there—I took an omnibus at the corner of Cheapside, and went with the goods to Bishopsgate-street—they were shirt fronts, collars, and habits—I do not know the value of them—they were in a bag—I had cut the top off the bag at the tobacconist's because it was too large, and also because there was a mark on it—when I got down from the omnibus I went to the arch—that is the archway leading to the Wellington—I went to meet Hart—I had made an appointment with him that same morning to meet him there at three o'clock—he told me to meet him at the archway in Widegate-street, and said he would be there—I went and he was not there—I crossed the road, and went into a public-house at the corner of Crispin-street—I do not know the sign of it—I went in to have a glass of beer—I was not in there a minute—I came out and went across to the archway—I did not find anybody in the archway—I looked down the street, and saw Hart and another man—Hart did not come up to the arch<lb></lb>way, but he beckoned to me—he was standing at a doorway in Tenter-street—I went down directly—he saw me coming, and he went away—I followed him to a public-house at the bottom of the street: I do not know the sign—we both went into the parlour—the other man was also in the parlour—I had seen him before with Hart—Hart said something to him, and he went outside—Hart then asked me what I had got—I had my bag with me—I told him some collars, shirt fronts, and habits—he asked how many I had—I told him I did not know—he took some of them out, looked at them, and asked what I wanted for them—at that time I heard a whistle come from the door (the other man was standing at the door)—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185101060063"></xptr>
               <p>Hart then threw the things in a corner—I think he had not then offered me any price for them—he went out, saying he should be back in five minutes—I stopped in the parlour—he came back, and went down the passage into a court-yard on the left hand—he then came into the parlour, and asked what I wanted for the things—I asked what he would give for them—he said he would give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them (I did not know the value of them—I never saw the prices of them)—I said no, I would not take that—he asked me how much I would take for them—I said 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he could not give that—I said he could not have them for less, I should take them back—he then agreed to take them at that price—he said he should not pay me unless I promised to bring down some more things—he said what I had brought was of no use—he put his band into his pocket, and showed me from 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "If you bring me down 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth I can buy them"—it ended by his giving me 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave me a duplicate to hold as a security for the two shillings—I asked him why he did not change one of the sovereigns and give it me—he said it would look too suspicious—I then left him—I was taken into custody on Tuesday morning—I gave Webb a description of him on Wednesday morn<lb></lb>ing, about half-past eight o'clock—I was accustomed to see him from a quarter-past eight to half-past eight—I told that to Webb, and he took him—when I was at the public-house I saw the servant Ellen Conway—she saw me and Hart at the public-house.</p>

               <p>person who left them was coming for them, and I and Wardle were on the watch. On Monday, 30th Dec, I was in the back-parlour—I saw New-land come to the shop, and the shopman gave him the bag—he asked for a knife, and cut apiece off—he then asked for a piece of string to tie the bag, and he had it—I saw the piece of bag that he cut off—it had W. W. and the name "Griffith, 32, Gutter-lane," on it—Newland tied the bag, and went with it to the corner of St. Paul's churchyard—he took a bus, and Wardle and I took a cab and followed it—Newland got down opposite Widegate-street, in Bishopsgate-street—he went along Widegate-street, across Petticoat-line, and along Artillery-passage to Crispin-street and White's-row—there is an archway leading to Tenter-street, and Butler-street is thirty yards from the arch on the left-hand side—the Wellington is about 100 yards from the arch—Newland went into White's-row and stood in the archway—this was about five minutes before three o'clock—he had the bag in his hand—he remained standing still in the archway about two minutes—he returned back to White's-row and went into the Paul's Head at the corner—I followed him—I had to pass the archway before I got to the public-house—as I passed the archway Hooked down, and saw Hart standing with another man near the corner of Butler-street—I then passed the public-house and went round the corner—I returned back in about two minutes; New land was not then in the public-house—I then went to the" archway, but could not see Hart—that was about ten minutes after I first saw him—I had not till then known the Wellington—the archway leads to it—I took Newland on Tuesday morning—he afterwards gave me a description of a man—I went to Gutter-lane on Wednesday morning—I saw Hart calling old clothes, and I took him—I told him it was for receiving stolen property—he said he knew nothing about it, and he was an honest man—there was nothing in the bag which he was carrying—he, had one halfpenny in his pocket, a cigar-case, a tobacco-box, and a pencil-case—he lives in Freeman-street, leading to Tenter-street, about 500 yards-from the, arch way-from information from Newland I went, to the Wellington—I saw Con way there—I received information from her, and brought her up as a witness.</p>

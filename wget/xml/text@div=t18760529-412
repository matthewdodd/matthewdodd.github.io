                  </hi>. I lodge at the Shamrock, Brook Street, Ratcliffe—on 3rd May, at 12.15, I met the prisoner in School House Street with another man—they took me down School House Lane, and wanted to give me a cup of coffee; they tied me down and the prisoner got his hands over my shoulder and took two 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces out of my pocket, and a scarf from my neck he held me tight by the throat—the other man came, and they took what I had; they went down the back lane and I met a constable in Brook Street.</p>

On the morning of 3rd May, the prosecutor complained to me and went down the lane to show me where the robbery was committed and he described the two men—I told him to go home and if I saw anything of them I would take them in custody—he got into Brook Street, I followed him up and saw two men come down Step<lb></lb>ney Causeway—the prisoner was about 40 yards from me then—I saw another constable in front—I thought the men answered the description the prosecutor gave me—two females came to the other constable, I believe, and complained—the prosecutor sung out directly "Those are the two men that assaulted and robbed me"—the other man ran down School House Lane—this man was running away and I held out my arm and stopped him—he said "That man gone down School House Lane, I haven't seen him before"—he said going to the station "I met the man in the Horseferry Branch Road."</p>

I missed my watch: I went into the water closet about ten at night, and lost it there: I missed it soon after; but it was gone: the prisoner left my house on the Friday. I gave information in Bow-street; and they sent printed bills, with ten guineas reward: I found my watch at Bow-street, in the hands of the pawn-broker, about three weeks ago, on the Monday, I was sent for to Sir Sampson's, and saw the prisoner; I believe he said he took it from the water closet, but meant to return it; I am sure he said so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Your house is in Soho-square; a hotel? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then this necessary was frequented by those that use your house? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Therefore a person finding a watch there might not know it was your property? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>This gentleman, I believe had lived at your house? - He had.</p>
               <p>You did not know much of him yourself before? - No; he had been there about six or seven days.</p>
               <p>And when he was apprehended in Bow-street, he said, he meant to return it? - He did so.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Cates, pawnbroker, in the Strand. On the 23d of April the prisoner came to our parlour door, the private door, and rang at the bell, as he had done before; he had been a customer of ours for six years: we had before received gold watches of him: he pulled out a gold watch and chain, and wanted twenty guineas upon it; I told him it was not customary to lend so much money, but if he liked to leave the watch, I would lend him ten pounds; I did so: on the 8th of May the prisoner came again; he brought the duplicate, and said, he wished me to buy the watch; I told him it was not lawful for us to buy such things while they were in pledge, but if he would leave it till Monday I might hear of some person that would buy it; according, when he was going, I thought this might not be the watch we had formerly had; I turned to the books, and saw the description of the hand-bill; I went to Sir Sampson, and Mr. Hooper was sent for: on Monday the prisoner came, and some of Sir Sampson's men were waiting to take him into custody: he was taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure that was the watch he pledged with you in April? - Quite sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. This gentleman had before pledged his watch with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Therefore he did not come either disguised, or privately, but to a person who knew him? - Yes; we have had a gold watch of his for six years, backwards and forwards.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. He gave you the key himself? - Yes; he said this little key opens the table drawer, and there you will find the two seals, belonging to Mr. Hooper.</p>

               <p>and the other would be in pearls and diamonds, handing me this paper with the prices—he brought this paper with him—I should say it is his hand<lb></lb>writing—it is either his or his brother's—I have often seen him write—I think it is his—the only thing I had in that particular way was a black pear and diamond suite—he had that—I had not the plain diamonds—about 16th or 17th December I received a communication from Mr. Char<lb></lb>man, in consequence of which I stopped an order that I was then in the course of executing for Montague—that was an order for the bridesmaid's lockets, and the pearl and diamond head ornament—down to that time Montague had been very often in the habit of coming to my premises, sometimes two or three times a week, but after that time I never saw him again until he was in custody—I saw Michael once afterwards, at our premises in Brewer Street—previous to that I had seen Michael quite as often as Montague—it was always in reference to the business in Conduit Street.</p>

White, of Great Portland Street, and recovered a portion of my property from them—I asked her questions with regard to the bills, but I don't remember how the questions were put, she offered some explanation about them—she mentioned the name of Mills, of Oxford Street, to me; he is a jeweller, but she had no transactions with him, except leaving a brooch with him, which was not sold, and was returned to her—she made her statement perfectly voluntarily—she made a compendious statement with reference to these bills; if it was in reply to a question, it was not a direct question—she was given into custody, but not by me—I think the conversation was on 18th or 19th December, 1872; at that time there was a warrant out against Montague—I should think it had been out three or four days; it was three or four days after I had seen Montague for the last time.</p>

               <p>swear that it was after October, 1872—I don't recollect what Rowley said, but my brothers kept their books on lined paper, so that when they wished to procure the books all the statements on that paper would go into them—it is no use asking me what I don't understand—do not call me a lady of business; I have made a mistake, that is all I have done—they always used lined paper, something like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mr. Montagu Williams appeared for my brother—on that occasion I heard Mr. Giffard, who was instructed for me, say, in addressing the Jury, that if Montague Goldsmith, whether he was carrying on business for himself or not would not have added a feather's weight to his evidence, and that if he wanted to raise money upon them he must in some way conceal his identity—I could not stop Mr. Giffard in what he said—if I had known the defence that was going to be set up for me I should have objected to it—from the very first, when my brother was absent, they put everything upon him, that is exactly what has been done—you are right in saying that in order to extricate me on the last trial, every mortal thing was put upon Montague, who was absent—Mr. Williams did not know it as far as Mr. Giffard did—I told my brother that if he would give me bills drawn, Sir Sills Gibbons would accept them—these bills are drawn by Montague, in his writing, but the signature and endorsement I know nothing at all about—every mortal one of these is in my handwriting, and some of them were written with my left hand, this one (<hi rend="italic">selecting one</hi>) was written with my left hand—when Montague told me he had paid over all the bills to Mr. Charman, I immediately told him about my conduct; that was on the morning he came home to me and found me ill in bed—it is an untruth that having said that he immediately left me and took himself off; he stayed in England, and he was in the house when Mr. Charman came—he was in our house in Colville Terrace eight or nine days—I stayed there till it was absolutely necessary to give up the house—my mother and my sister went with me to Maldon, as Mrs. and Miss Ward—my brother Montague had left England the day before Christmas Day—I knew that a warrant was out against him, and so would any sister who knew she had brought all this trouble upon him—I did not know that a warrant was out or to be taken out, I won't admit that—he went away, and my brother Michael remained in the house after my brother and sister had left—I was taken before they could find him, but he was always about Regent Street—I was taken five weeks before him, and he was at Colville Terrace—I had to leave because the house could not be kept up any longer; the furniture had to be sold off—I don't know where my brother went—I know Mr. Alfred Drayson—I saw him bring the jewellery which was to be shown to Sir Lionel Rothschild—my sister was there—I did not say to him "My brothers never allow me to see the jewellery; I should like very much to see it," nothing of the kind.</p>

He undertook to surrender; it happened in this way, Mr. Richards was acting for Mr. Charman, and I gave Mr. Richards our opinion that Montague was innocent, and said "Montague is perfectly prepared to surrender, does Mr. Charman wish to prosecute a man who is innocent?" Mr. Richards said "I will see Mr. Charman"—it was contrary to Montague's wish to go away—I instructed Mr. Giffard, Rebecca was his client—her instructions to me were to take it upon herself—she pleaded not guilty, and was defended, and Mr. Giffard made a very strong appeal to the Jury, as he always does—he put it, in my hearing, that Montague was the real culprit—my instructions to Mr. Giffard were in accordance with the facts, that it would appear that Rebecca was the guilty party; my instructions were also to defend Rebecca, and put the whole facts before the Jury, to take their verdict one way or the other upon them; Mr. Giffard advised me that if the facts were such as they were represented, Rebecca had no defence to the matter; upon that I saw Rebecca in the dock, and told her Mr. Giffard's advice to me on the matter—she said "Mr. Lewis, I am the guilty party, I am perfectly prepared to take the consequences, my brothers are entirely innocent," and she wanted me to say so to Mr. Giffard; I said nothing to save her from being convicted, and it was after considerable pressure on my part, and telling her she should take advantage of what the law allowed—Mr. Giffard acted on my instructions, and I must take the response<lb></lb>bility of the instructions I gave him—it was not said at that time that the whole guilt rested with Montague; from the very first Rebecca has said that the whole guilt rested with her.</p>

               <p>what to make of it"—I subsequently went home with Montague to Rebecca—Rebecca was very excited at first, and we could not get her to tell us what she really had done, but by degrees we got to understand from her that she had pawned and sold the jewellery at different places—Montague said "How about the bills, Rebecca; are they false, too?"—she said "Yes, they are false, it is all false"—she said that she had heard she would be charged, and she very much wished to make it known to my brother a few days previously.</p>

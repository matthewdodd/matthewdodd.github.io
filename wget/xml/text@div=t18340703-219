            . I am a boot and shoe-maker - I was in Shoreditch on the 21st of June - I saw the prosecutor and the two prisoners - they tried his pockets once or twice - he then crossed over to Church-street, and went into a wine vaults - they waited till he came out, and he went down New Inn-yard - they followed him; and Charles Kelly took the handkerchief out of his pocket - I told him, and we followed, but could not find him - the next night, I saw Charles Kelly, and had him taken - they were both together when the handkerchief was stolen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CHURCHILL. Q. Is this your first case this session? A. Yes; I was here last session in a case of one of the swell mob, for taking a gentleman's watch - I was the only person who saw it done - I do not know how often I have been here as a witness against boys, for robbing persons unknown - I have never been turned out of Court - I never was refused my expenses - I may have gone away without them.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you have not been refused your expenses here? A. I never was but once - I will swear I have not twice - I have gone away once or twice without them - I do not recollect having a case of two boys before Mr. Common Sergeant Denman - I was not turned out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030102"></xptr>Court, unless the witnesses were ordered out - I was not turned out after the case was over.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember last Session being reminded of a case in a Session before, and swearing to Mr. Phillips that he bullied you out of it? A. I used those words, or something to that effect - I cannot recollect whether Mr. Lee had been counsel in that case.</p>

            . The witness Tool took my boy by mistake, and then let him go, and said the prisoner Charles was the boy - I was with my boy at the time - I had not been five minutes from my master's house - the policeman asked Toole if he was sure - he said he had no doubt of it - I said, "If you go, I will go with you," - and before we got to the London Apprentice, he took the prisoner Charles, and said, "Let the other go, he knows nothing of it."</p>
               <p>THOMAS TOOLE re-examined. Q. How can you explain this? A. On the Sunday night, I saw Charles Kelly turn down a little court, and I went back for a policeman - I said to him, "There is a young fellow gone down here that robbed a person of his handkerchief last night" - I described him quite fully - we went down together, and saw this man's boy, and took him - he had a cap on his head, and I thought he was the boy - I brought him out, and a mob came round - the prisoner then came out and I said, "Take him, that is the boy."</p>

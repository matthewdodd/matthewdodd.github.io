                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Hayes, of Spring-garden-place Pimlico. The prisoner has lodged in my house since August—I left my house on the 20th of February, and came home between six and seven o'clock—he was not there—he did not return—he gave no notice of his going—I went to a box in my bed-room on the first floor—I usually keep that box value my bed—I found a poker on the top of it—it was broken open—I missed three silver watches, a jacket, shawl, handkerchief, and a belt—the jacket was found again in the coal-hole, where the basket was missing from—I should think all the property I missed was worth 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner denied knowing any thing of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Peter Cawley, of Spring-garden-place, Pimlico. I saw the prisoner coming from Mrs. Hayes with a basket with rope handles—I knew it, and asked if he had got work—he said no, but he was to have two places next week—I said was glad of it—there was a boy who, I think, was speaking to him, but just as I spoke to him they parted—this was about four o'clock on the 20th of February.</p>

I am quite sure I never allowed him to wear this boot—it was left by another lodger to get mended—it was in a closet in the room where the prisoner slept—that was not the room where the box was—the poker and the key of the first-floor room were taken from the kitchen—I did not miss the things till the next day, when I went I get a cap to put on.</p>

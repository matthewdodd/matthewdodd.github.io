                  </hi>. I knew Sampson for about two years and a half—he was perfectly capable of attending to his business up to the time he cut his throat; I was told he merely scratched it; he was about to undergo an operation—it was a month after this deposition was taken.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Henry Francis Sampson's deposition was ready as follows</hi>—"I live at 22, Old Suffolk-street, Commercial-road; I am foreman to Isaac Moses, of the Minories, clothier. In consequence of some communication with my employer, I kept a sharp look-out upon the prisoner; he was employed in the cutting-room of the establishment, on the first floor; I am employed in the same room; between 10 and 11 o'clock yesterday morning the prisoner was cutting a coat from a piece of cloth; he was marking a coat, preparatory to its being given to the party who makes it up; I think the prisoner got a yard and three quarters of cloth to make the coat; I saw him cut a coat from that piece; he did not use the whole of the yard and three quarters to make up the coat, and the piece which was left he put into the window; the two pieces of cloth produced I saw him put in the window; the value was about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the piece of cloth remained in the window the whole of the afternoon; about half-past 8 in the evening the prisoner went to the window, and removed the piece from the window to the cutting board, adjoining the window; he then took his pocket handkerchief from his pocket, and threw the handkerchief</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100063"></xptr>
               <p>carelessly over the piece of cloth which was then on the cutting-board: he came away a few steps, and I distinctly saw a small piece of cloth projecting from under the handkerchief; about a minute afterwards the prisoner took the handkerchief, with the piece of cloth, and placed them in his hat; he put his hat on, and walked away to leave his work; I walked close after him, (it was then about 10 minutes to 9 o'clock), and I communicated what I had seen to Mr. Adolphus, the manager at Mr. Moses's." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi>—"The prisoner cuts out goods which are bespoken; the bulk of cloth is kept in the Aldgate shop; the piece of cloth is given out to suit the size of a customer: a good cutter would decidedly be able to cut it closer than a bad cutter; I have never had any of the pieces whatever of any description, and never gave any away; I gave the prisoner a piece of silk velvet from Dr. Fergusson's waistcoat, but not for his own use; I thought he wanted to use it in the firm; there were five of us in the room altogether where the prisoner was cutting the coat; I never saw cutters taking away scraps, except one man, and he was discharged; I did not get the man discharged." <hi rend="italic">Re<lb></lb>examined</hi>—"hey were very small pieces of silk velvet which I gave the prisoner, not fit to use in the trade; the cutters are not entitled to the pieces of cloth which are left; after coats are cut out, his duty is to keep them on the board, and deliver them to the deputy manager, Mr. Dearbert; they are usually collected every evening, but invariably on the Saturday; this cus<lb></lb>tom is known to the prisoner; this practice has always prevailed in our busi<lb></lb>ness since I have been there, and I have been there about two years; the cutters and persons employed there have commission to purchase goods; they always purchase for cash, and do not have any account; I never recollect an instance since I have been with Mr. Moses in which the cutter has been per<lb></lb>mitted to take any of the savings; there has not, to my knowledge, been given any notice that the cutters should not take what is left of the cloth; what is left is usually made into waistcoats; the two pieces produced would make a small boy's waistcoat." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi>—"There is a rag-bag kept, in which pieces are kept; I have had words with the prisoner; he has a better salary than I have." <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>—"It is not usual to put such pieces as these produced into the rag-bag.")</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). I am a cutter at Mr. Moses's establishment. The prisoner and Sampson were also cutters. On 9th March, about 11 o'clock in the morning, I watched the prisoner, and, after cutting out a coat, I saw him place a piece of cloth on the corner of a window, close to his board—it was a piece of cloth that would make a small waistcoat for a boy, and was the remnant of what he cut out—that was all I saw of it—I left at seven o'clock, leaving Sampson there—we are not allowed to take away pieces of cloth of any description.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did Sampson know you were watching the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not know Sampson was watching him—I was not told to watch him—he was in a higher place than me—my wages are 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know the person's name who has got his place—Sampson would not have got if he had not cut his throat—if the prisoner had pleased, very likely he might have employed all the cloth in the coat—there would have been no complaint then—he had given him what was supposed to be enough to cut the coat, and this piece was left in consequence of it happening to be a small-sized coat—Mr. Adolphus was not able to be here last Session, he was on the continent—something was the matter with him, but it is not my business to know what it was—I never heard it said what it was—it was said in the establishment that he was ill and had gone on the continent for the benefit of his health—</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). On 9th March, in consequence of what Sampson stated to me, I caused the prisoner to be watched upon his going away, between 8 and 9 o'clock—I allowed him to leave the pre<lb></lb>mises, and then called him back, and took him to my private room—I accused him of having property which belonged to us, and he said, "I have not"—I sent for a policeman, who was on the premises, and in his presence repeated the same question to the prisoner, he said, "I have not"—I asked him to open his coat and waistcoat; he did so, and I saw nothing there—I then said, "Have you anything in your hat?"—he said, "I have not"—I said, "Take it off, and let us see"—he did so, and said, "You see I have nothing in it but a handkerchief"—I took the handkerchief from the hat, the lining of the hat was turned up, and from it fell the cloth produced—I then taxed him with this being our property; he denied it, and said he had had it by him for six months—I gave him in charge—when a piece of cloth is given out to a cutter, the remnants ought to be laid aside, and given to a person who goes round to collect them once or twice a week—no one is allowed to take any pieces away—we employ seventeen or eighteen cutters—the prisoner's wages were 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week, and his dinner and tea—he has been with us eighteen months or two years—he must have known the rules of the establishment—it is no benefit to me losing the prisoner.</p>

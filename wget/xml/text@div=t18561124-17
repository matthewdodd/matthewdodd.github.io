I saw him in Great Tower-street—he entered the shop of Mr. Blizzard, a pawnbroker—I saw a pistol in his hand, and heard him say something to the pawnbroker about Deane and Adams's improvement—I communicated what I had seen, and the following day the pistol was claimed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Tower of London. This pistol has the crown on it—that mark is affixed on property which is brought into the Tower for public use—arms of this sort are at present under my care—this pistol has belonged to the Crown—they are never sold, to my knowledge—I know the prisoner—his duty would lead him constantly to where the pistols are kept—oh 5th Nov. he was interrogated by Mr. Eaton, the storekeeper, in my presence, and was asked how he got posses<lb></lb>sion of the pistol he had pledged the previous evening at Mr. Blizzard's—he said that it was given to him on London-bridge to pledge, by a man named Ryan, whom he had known ten years—we asked if he could produce the man—he said that he did not know where he lived, and it was a question whether he could find him—we gave him a certain time, and on his return we gave him into custody—I miss five pistols of this kind from the stores.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long has the prisoner been working in that department? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four months, I think; up to this time he has borne the character of an industrious honest roan—I have heard that he was employed for many years in the Post-office, and subsequently in the London Docks, under the War Department—thousands of these pistols were sent away to the Crimea during the late war—I am not aware that a large quantity of arms returned were sold at Liverpool, by authority of the Government—it is doubtless the fact, that large numbers of these pistols went to the Crimea, and were lost, with other things, after being landed—I cannot say that I ever saw this pistol until it was produced from the pawn<lb></lb>broker's, having a large quantity under my charge—I know that a pistol bearing this number was supplied to us by Colonel Colt, in Oct., 1855—this paper which I am looking at is not in my writing; I do not wish to refer to it—I was not in that department in Oct.—it does not appear to have been used.</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal foreman of the War Department of the Tower of London. The prisoner has been employed there twelve or thirteen months; the labourers, of whom he was one, leave work at 4 o'clock precisely; and, as they leave, they undergo a search by two constables—on 4th Nov., I gave the prisoner his ticket about ten minutes before, at his request, imagining that as he had been engaged the previous evening by Lord Kingston, that he was anxious to get to his Lordship that evening, as he applied earlier than the proper time, rather than wait for his number to be called, which was very low down the list—I cannot say whether he was searched or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it an unusual thing for persons in that department to ask for their tickets a little time before the time of leaving? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not usual; a man may ask for it, and get it, but he is always searched before he leaves; the prisoner has frequently done it, saying that he was going to Lord Kingston—I have seen a letter which Lord Kingston wrote to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in the service of the Crown in that department? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two years in Nov.—I have not marked any pistols since Feb., but previously to that I marked thousands of them.</p>

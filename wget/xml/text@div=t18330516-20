             (police-constable, G.85). I went with the prosecutor and took the property.</p>
               <p>MR. DUNKLEY. This is my property; the value of the whole is about 1l. 9s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How is it possible for any human being to swear to these filings? A. I can swear to them - I don't know how much there may be in London; I have no private mark on any thing - I did not know that the prisoner worked for any other person - I sometimes have watch cases to clean - I scrape them when I am compelled; we do not return the filings to the owner of the watch, we use them in our work.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know the watch-springs? A. No further than their being the prisoner's work; he did not make any for himself but at over-hours - I did not miss any of the property - the prisoner's box was open.</p>

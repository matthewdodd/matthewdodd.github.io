                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant, and live at Uxbridge. I have a heap of Derbyshire coal—on the 5th of March I missed some large lumps from my heap—some were afterwards produced to me which exactly corre<lb></lb>sponded with the coals on the heap, and fitted the vacant space—it had been a very sharp frost that morning, and the surface of the coal was covered with hoar frost—the pieces shown to me retained the white frost, and the vacant space where they were taken from was without it, which shows they had been very recently taken.</p>

On Sunday, the 5th of March, about five o'clock in the morning, I was going round by Mr. Lebas' wharf, and saw the prisoner on the top of the wall, with a piece of coal in his arms—on seeing me he laid the coal down on the wall, and ran away—I did not lose sight of him till I got nearly close to him—I then saw it was the prisoner—I had known him before very well—about a quarter of an hour after I went to the house where he lodged, about 300 yards from the prosecutor's, and found</p>

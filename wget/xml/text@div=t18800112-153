                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. My daughter showed me this coin, and I went out, and said to the prisoner "What do you mean by this?"—he spoke thick, and I could not understand him—he had had a glass—I stood against the door, and he said "How much longer are you going to keep me?"—I said "Till the policeman comes"—I was not holding him—after the police came he said that he got it from a man outside, and then from a mate of</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E R</hi> 50). I was called—Miss Rabe charged the prisoner, and I said "How did you come by this kind of money?"—he said "A man out in the street gave it to me as a sovereign, and I thought it was a sovereign"—I said "I think there are not many men going about giving away sovereigns in the streets"—he said "My mat who I work with gave it to me as a sovereign in payment for my weekly wages"—I said "Could you tell me the names of your mate, and the man out in the street?"—he said "I cannot"—I said "Can you tell me the name of your employer?"—he said "No"—I found nothing on him—I had accident<lb></lb>ally pushed against him five or six minutes before, and apologized to him for it—I took an observation of his name and appearance, and he appeared perfectly sober, but when I was called into the shop he was shamming drunkenness—I reminded him that I was the constable who had spoken to him five or six minutes before—he said "You are the constable," and he then revived, and became sober almost immediately—he said in answer to the Magistrate that he found the coin in Museum Street—he had not said that before—that was the third account he gave of it—he was sober when he was at the station—Mr. Rabe gave me this medal.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I will swear he was perfectly sober in the shop, but he may have had just one glass—I said before the Magistrate, I think. "He revived, and became sober almost immediately," not "he almost became sober immediately"—I did not know him before he pushed against me—he had been employed by the parish—he gave his correct address.</p>

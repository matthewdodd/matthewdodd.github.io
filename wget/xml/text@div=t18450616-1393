                  </hi>. I live at Leytonstone. On the evening of the 12th of June I saw a hamper on my premises—I had expected a ham<lb></lb>per from town containing gin, which I bad reason to believe it contained—on the following morning it appeared to have been opened, and nine bottles were missing—there were only three remaining out of a dozen—each bottle contained about a pint and a half—they are what are called quart bottles in the trade—about six of them hold a gallon—I gave notice of the robbery—I think the hamper had come to me on the 4th of June.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 60.) I received information from Mr. Scale that some bottles of gin were stolen from his house—I traced some footmarks leading from Mr. Cotton's shrubbery through some high grass to a holly bush, where I discovered a small hamper, and a few steps further on I found eight bottles of gin covered with dry leaves and bushes—this is one of the bottles—I have compared this with the bottles in the hamper—when I had discovered these I remained on the watch till about four on Saturday afternoon, 14th June—I then had a hint that some persons were near the spot—I concealed myself, and saw Abraham Chapman and Williams come and get over the fence—they went to the spot, kneeled down, and removed the leaves—one of them, who I believe was Abraham Chapman, said, "Here is only one bottle, we are done"—I and Dennett then rushed out, and pursued them into the forest—I took Abraham Chap<lb></lb>man—I told him I took him on suspicion of stealing some gin—he said he knew nothing about it—Williams escaped at that time—I found on Abraham Chapman nothing connected with this robbery—the one bottle which they said was left was drawn out from the leaves, and was rendered visible—as soon as they saw that they said, "Here is only one bottle, we are done"—they came over the fence, went directly up the walk, and turned to the spot where the bottles were.</p>

I was with Huttoo when Abraham Chapman and Williams came there, and jumping over the fence in pursuit of them—I saw Thomas Chapman concealed against a little bush under a brick wall, twenty or thirty yards from where the gin was hid—I afterwards took Williams at Bow—I found on him this piece of brass, and Hutton found some brass near where the hamper was.</p>

            . I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; he owned to me he took two handkerchiefs and a table-spoon ; that he pawned one of the handkerchiefs in Bride-lane, ( producing one deposed to by the prosecutrix ). We went to the silver-smith where he said he had sold the spoon broke in two, next door to the Cross-keys tavern , Holborn. The woman remembered she bought such. a spoon of the prisoner, but it was cut in pieces, saying he had two tea-spoons and a pair of buttons in exchange, which he acknowledged was truth. The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence.</p>

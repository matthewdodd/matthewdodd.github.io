               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Perfectly well. He was received on boards the hulks, at Woolwich, in June, 1809. I received him at Woolwich, from which he was removed to Sheerness. I saw him on board the hulk at Sheerness, after being removed from Woolwich. I remember his being delivered from the hulk at Sheerness, to go abroad.

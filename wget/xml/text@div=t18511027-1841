                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at Uxbridge. These are my shoes—I had them on my counter about five weeks before this transaction—I afterwards missed them—the prisoner worked for me—I do not know that I had seen these shoes for five weeks—I went to the prisoner's lodging, but I could not find him—I had seen him pass my shop the day I missed the shoes—he had borrowed the shoes of me while his own were being repaired—he brought them back, and put them on the counter, and I put them on the shelf—I did not lend them to him again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I not borrow them again after I brought them back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I was obliged to tell you several times to bring them back.</p>

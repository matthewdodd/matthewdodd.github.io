            . I am shopman to Messrs. Ash and Smith. On the 31st of July last, about nine o'clock in the morning, as I was stooping behind the counter to get a brush out of the drawer, on getting up I saw the prisoner Lawrence standing in the shop, he wanted to know the price of a waistcoat piece in the window, I told him the price, he said it was too dear for him. he could get it cheaper in the City, he then went out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body with him then. - A. No, he went out and returned with the prisoner Jefferson, we having lost a piece of kerseymere the week before the same time in the morning, I returned to the accompting house, at the bottom of the shop I saw the prisoners pointing to different things in the shop window, they then got very near the door, Jefferson came very softly in the shop, he proceeded about half way up the shop, stooped down and took up the piece of velveteen, it was laying down by the side of the counter along with some more; he put it under his arm and proceeded towards the door again, I then ran out of the counting-house, and called out stop thief, the prisoner dropped the piece of velveteen on the threshold of the door and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he stopped. - A. Yes, they got hold of him in the street, he got away, and Mr. Anderson stopped him and brought him back to the shop, I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. That was Jefferson. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Lawrence, do you know. - A. I did not see him go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at the shop window when Lawrence took this piece. - A. No, I missed him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the value of this piece of velveteen. - A. Yes, five pound.</p>

            , about two months before Christmas, 1789; I had seen him some times before I saw the prisoner; I saw the prisoner the 20th of September last, between the hours of twelve and one in the day;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120020"></xptr>Templeman came into my master's shop; having been visited by him before, I made no hesitation to follow him out of the shop; I guessed his purpose: when I came out, Smith and Platt were under the Piazza; I walked with them across James-street; Platt says, d - n his b - g eyes, he has threatened to acquaint the Duke of York with our proceedings, but the Duke of York is as big a d - d b - r as himself; the prisoner was close by, and heard this conversation; I next saw the prisoner the 22d of September, which was Wednesday, about the same time, between twelve and one; Templeman came into my master's shop, with this paper in his hand (delivered in); he said it was an order from the Duke of York for me to attend him in the orderly room; I asked him to step with me across the Garden, meaning to take him to one Simms, who keeps a stall there, whom I had acquainted with the transaction; they both went with me; Smith was at the door; no more passed; Smith heard Templeman's representation, but did not speak, as I recollect; I saw Mrs. Simms; her husband was not there; I desired them to go to a publick-house, and call for a pot of beer; Mrs. Simms went for him; while she was gone, they both said that the Duke of York was then waiting, and I must go immediately; I said I had no objection to go, but would not go without a friend; Templeman said they had no notion of waiting, and the Duke of York would be gone; Smith answered, should he be gone, they could easily send for him; Templeman said, if I would not go, they would fetch a company, to oblige me to go; meaning, as I understood, more soldiers; I told them, if they would go to a publick-house any where, and call for a pot of beer, I would pay for it, so as to wait till my friend came; they said they would go to no publick-house; with that a conversation ensued, and they said, what a fool must I be to stand to be exposed in the street, when two guineas would stop the affair; they both joined in this conversation; I told them I had not two guineas, nor would I give it, if I had; Smith said, the Duke was so much a soldier's friend, he would see them through any thing; I said, I made no doubt of the Duke's justice, and I hoped he would be my friend, as well as theirs; with that, they went to the White Horse, in the market, and called for a pot of beer; I did not go in; I paid for it; I was still looking out, in expectation of Simms coming; they did not seem pleased; they thought themselves too much exposed, they said; we went to the Northumberland-arms, kept by Sessions, in Russel-street, I do not know his Christian name; there Templeman asked for pen, ink, and paper: Sessions desired them to walk into the back room; they called for pen, ink, and paper; Sessions had no paper; I sent for a sheet; then they both said, if I would produce them a guinea, I should go at liberty, and never be molested again; I called for some liquor, and went to see for Simms; I left Templeman and Smith there; I was absent ten minutes; I went home for the guinea; I met Simms; he went there just before me; I came there directly; the prisoner and Templeman were there together; Simms was set down, with a pint of beer, in a distinct box; he got up, when I came in, and said, Sharpe, are these the men that extorted money from you? I said, those were two of them; Simms said, good God! are you in liquor? they said no, they were as sober as he; then he said it was worse in them to behave in that manner, because they must be little acquainted with the laws of their country; had I done any thing, or acted any indecency with them, they should have taken me before a justice; for by extorting one shilling in the manner they had done, it would most likely affect their lives; and he said to me, Sharpe, have you at any time taken, or received, any indecent liberties with those men; I declared, as I do now, before the face of God, and my sacred oath, that as I hope to receive no mercy at the hand of God, that I never knew whether he was man or woman; they acknowledged that I had not; they said I was innocent; but they said every body knew that soldiers pay was very small, and money they must have, some way or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120021"></xptr>other; with that, I expressed how unhappy I should be to take the life of a fellow-creature, and would sooner suffer than do it; I told them they were young men, they might live to be an ornament to their King and country; and begged, for God's sake, they would leave off this practice; they both expressed, Smith particularly, he was pleased to say, I spoke to them like a gentleman; Simms spoke to them nearly in the same manner; with that, I told them, that I would not give them a guinea, but if they would give this discharge, I would give them half-a-guinea, and no more; they promised to give me a written discharge; I said, my giving them this money, I should be pestered with Platt, who had been with them two before; Smith declared to God, in the most solemn manner, as God might receive their souls, that I never should, for Platt was down on garrison somewhere in Scotland; with that, I got change for the guinea, and produced the half-guinea; Templeman wrote this, and read it to Smith, and asked him if he was agreeable to sign it; he said he was agreeable to what Templeman was, and they signed it.</p>

               <p>I gave them half-a-guinea, and laid it on the table; Templeman would not take it up, till Smith said he was agreeable to take it; whatever he agreed to, he was agreeable to; then Templeman took it up; nothing more passed at that time; we went away; I saw no more of them that night; Simms was in the room at the same time.</p>
               <p>Now attend to the question I am going to put to you: Upon what inducement did you part with that half-guinea? - Why, Sir, if other things had been brought forward, I could explain more; it was fear of my character, and losing my bread, which they had threatened to deprive me of, if I did not give it: I saw the prisoner again on the 20th of October, a month all but two days, passing and repassing before the Queen's-head, during the time Platt was demanding to have the same sum given to him equal to those two, and which I gave him in that house, in the presence of Simms: on the 4th of November Smith was taken into custody; I took Templeman, and he impeached Platt and Smith; I do not think Smith said any thing before the magistrate; I am quite certain he is the man that was with me at Session's house; there was no creature in that house but us during the whole time.</p>
               <p>Court. It appears to me, from your evidence, that the giving the half-guinea was a voluntary offer of your own. - They proposed two guineas, and came to one guinea; at last, I told them, whether they would give me this discharge or not, I would give them no more than half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>Court. But after they had publickly acknowledged to Simms that you were perfectly innocent, and they agreed to sign this paper, it was a voluntary offer of your own to give them half-a-guinea? - It was to let me go about my business unmolested, without any charge of indecent behaviour or unnatural practice.</p>
               <p>Was that the condition upon which they agreed to sign this paper? - It was.</p>
               <p>Then they would not have signed the agreement, unless the half-guinea was paid?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120022"></xptr>- They told me they would not; that was the condition they made.</p>
               <p>You would not have parted with this money, unless they had agreed in future not to charge you with unnatural practices? - I should not, for I had been distressed before for two months.</p>
               <p>What was your idea, supposing they had made this charge against you, and that you had been brought to trial for for it, did you apprehend it would affect your life? - I did not know; they swore it would; they told me, two days before, that two was enough, but there were three of them would swear away my life; I told them my life was indifferent to me; that was on Monday the 20th, two days before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I sign my name to that paper? - You made that mark, I was present at the time, as I stand here before God.</p>
               <p>Court. And he consented to the acceptance of the guinea? - He did.</p>

The discharge was wrote by Templeman; and I saw it signed by Templeman; and this prisoner, who could not write, put his mark upon it; I did not hear it read over, to my knowledge; I was very angry with myself that Sharpe would not let me take hold of them; and Sharpe begged and desired I would not, because it would take their lives from them: I am certain to the prisoner Smith.</p>
               <p>Court. If I understand you right, the proposal of giving the half-guinea came from Mr. Sharpe, and was not imposed upon him by the prisoner and the other man? - They said they would take half-a-guinea, and should lose a guinea and half by not taking him to the Duke of York; they proposed a guinea a long while, and then came to half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>The half-guinea would not have been parted with by the prosecutor, unless they had given him that discharge? - No, it was on that foundation, that they should not molest him any more; they said no other soldiers could come nigh him, for they were all draughted to go abroad: Sharpe opposed my taking these men into custody, in order to bring them to justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Simms, did you see me put pen to paper that night? - Yes, Sir, I saw you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120023"></xptr>take a pen in hand, and put your mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Is the room divided into boxes, or is it one entire room? - It is one entire room; there is a table; I sat by the fire-place, and had a pint of porter; it was a back parlour.</p>

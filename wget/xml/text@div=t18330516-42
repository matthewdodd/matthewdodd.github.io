               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I suppose you are the general voucher of the marriages there? A. Yes, Sir, but I generally object, unless the persons are a little elderly - I remember this marriage, because the woman was particular, and the prisoner was bald-plated then, but he has got a wig since; but I know him altogether - I have not seen him since 1822, but I have a strong recollection of him.</p>

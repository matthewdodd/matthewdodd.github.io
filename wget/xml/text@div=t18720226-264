                  </hi>. I am in the employ of George and Henry Scovell, as foreman, at Cotton's Wharf—on Tuesday, January 16th, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, this warrant (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was brought to me in the ordinary course of business—when a warrant has been left for the delivery of tea, it is initialled by Mr. Morris—I saw the initials of "J. M." on that warrant, in the proper column—it is also the custom to put on the warrant the character of the conveyance into which the packages are to be put, and upon the warrant appears "Smith's truck"—having received that warrant, I looked out the chests of tea, and found that they corresponded, and I returned the warrant to the office—in the course of the afternoon I called out for Smith's truck, and the prisoner answered—I saw the nine packages put on the truck—I had seen the prisoner at my master's premises fre<lb></lb>quently before, and I have not the slightest doubt that he is the person who was there with the truck—it was between 1.30 and 2.30 he took the pack<lb></lb>ages away—he was quite cognisant of the course of business at the premises—I rely on the initial "J. M." and that document to look out the goods—I believed that to be a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> signature, "Armstrong &amp; Co., B. Taylor," and I looked out the goods and delivered them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Anyone might produce the warrant before I initialled it—I should see if it was correct and sign it, and place it in a drawer where it would be sent up for delivery—I should make up the charges if the person had no account with us—the foreman would compare the goods with the warrant.</p>

                  </hi>.—I am wharf superintendent to Mr. Scovell—on Saturday night, 20th January, I received information, and went with Detective Berry to the Castle public-house, Old Kent Road, about three minutes walk' from the premises occupied by Mr. Bowers—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner at the Castle, and said "On the 16th of this month, you took nine boxes of tea from Customs Wharf, on Smith's truck"—he said "Yes, I did"—I said "Will you tell me to whom you delivered them, and for whom you were working, and where?"—he said "No, I can't; I was waiting about outside the wharf gates, and a party came up to me, and asked me if I would take in a truck and collect those teas, and he would meet me outside in Bermondsey Street—I did so, and he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the job"—Berry asked him if he could describe the man—he said "No, I can't; I don't think I should know him again if I was to meet him"—Berry said "Was he tall; was he dark; anything like yourself?"—he said "He might be as tall as myself, but I don't think I should know the man if I was to see him again"—Berry then told him who he was, and said that he should take him into custody—the prisoner said "There is a person here named Robinson, I very much wish to speak to; will you allow me to go inside to him?"—Berry said "Certainly not; he can be brought out to you"—I stepped into the house, and said that a person named Robinson was wanted outside—when Robinson came out I did not perceive that any communication was exchanged between them, but some two minutes were consumed by a kind of dumb colloquy—the prisoner wished to go to the urinal—he went round and returned, being in the detective's sight all the time—I noticed some<lb></lb>thing in his hand, like the end of an envelope projecting—he tried to pass that to Robinson—the detective said "We will have no more of this"—we had a cab, ready, and he forced him into the cab—the prisoner resisted very much—a lot of roughs collected round the place, and I shouted for some more police—the cab door was closed but the window was open, and the prisoner passed out something to Robinson—I had often seen the prisoner before on the premises—I rode to the station outside the cab, and the prisoner was charged at the station with being concerned in stealing some packages of tea—he said nothing that I remember.</p>

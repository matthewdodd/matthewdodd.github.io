               <p>I am a saddler. These three saddles were offered me for sale; one was my own make, I knew. They were offered by King, the prisoner. I do not know the other. Six bridles were offered with the saddles. I told Lovell, the baker, for whom I had made one of the saddles. I informed Justice Wilmot, and obtained an order to search a place in Plow-yard. I was afterwards informed by another man, such articles were there to be sold, and King was in the room then, and offered them for sale. I went afterwards with one Mr. Green, to whom a part of the property belonged, and who had got a search-warrant; and we found part of the property which is now in court, at this apartment. The things have never been out of my possession. I do not know how they came there.</p>

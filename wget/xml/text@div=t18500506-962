                  </hi>. I am a clerk, in the employ of Joseph Hornby Baxendale. He has four partners—they trade under the name of Pickford and Co.—the prisoner was in their employ—it was his duty to receive money at the Camden-station, and pay it over to me the day he received it, before leaving business.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What position do you hold? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I receive all money from the porters and clerks at the Camden station, and pay them over to Mr. Bayley, our head cashier—it was the prisoner's duty to receive money from any one who called for goods at the Peterborough shed—there were five or six employed—he had to pay to no one else but me—he has paid me money on several occasions on the same day that he received it—Mr. Baxendale hired him—he bad bad to pay me once a day—I do not give receipts for the amounts; I enter them at the time in the books which are here—a person named Parry was in the employment; I do not know what has become of him, or whether he stole any money, or was accused of it—I have heard something about his absconding, being charged with embezzling money—I never inquired into it—Parry has never paid me money on account of the prisoner—I cannot say whether he may have paid me money received by the prisoner, and entrusted to him to pay me—they did not both have to receive money at the same time—Parry was employed to receive money up to a certain date, and Stout's duty followed—I never received any money from Parry after the prisoner came there to receive it.</p>

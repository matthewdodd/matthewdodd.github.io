                  </hi>. I live at Waltham, in Essex. On Thursday evening, the 22nd of February, I missed four pieces of plank, between seven and eight o'clock, from my cow-yard—I found some afterwards in the house occupied by the prisoner—his wife was at home at the time, but not him—there was only one room in the place—it was about two o'clock in the afternoon—he was at work on the road at the time, and the officer apprehended him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's house, and saw the plank—I took the prisoner at work on the road at Stratford—I told him I took him for stealing some planks from Mr. Robinson's, and I had found one in his house—he said he knew nothing about it—I took off his shoe, and measured the footmarks on the ground the property was stolen from—there were marks in the yard, and they exactly corresponded with the marks, and I made other footmarks with the shoe, and they exactly corresponded—the marks were about half an inch deep—I could distinctly see the track of the foot—the marks were fresh.</p>

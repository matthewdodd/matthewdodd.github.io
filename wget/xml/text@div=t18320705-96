            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought in; I took her into a back room, to search her - she put her hand behind her, and made a rush past me, to give the sovereign to the prosecutor, who had followed me in; I caught her hand, and the sovereign fell on the floor - I cannot tell where she took it from; she said she found it in a corner of her pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor had given her a sovereign among the halfpence, which she was not aware of till she got to the watchouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in hut built of hay and straw on Merton<lb></lb>common in Surrey.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Williams Hedges—the prisoner and his wife lodged with us for about seven months—they lived on very bad terms together—I have heard the prisoner make use of very bad expressions to her—he often said, "You d—little b—, madam, I'll do for you, I cannot do as I like here, because I am in Mrs. Hedge's house"—he said, "D—you, I will do for you, before long: as I am in Mrs. Hedges's house I cannot do as I like:" and then he said again, "Madam, d—you, I will do for you"—on Saturday, the 16th of April, Mrs. Hag<lb></lb>gerstone went out at a quarter past one o'clock in the day—I was in the White Hart, with my husband, about eleven o'clock at night, and she came and sent in for me, and she then came in with me—I did not see her go out-we staid at the bar till about half-past eleven o'clock—I did not see Claridge go out—I saw him there—my husband and I left the White Hart at half-past eleven o'clock—Mrs. Haggerstone and Claridge were gone when we went away—I was sober—my husband was not—I called Mrs. Haggerstone for some time, when I came out of the house, but got no answer—I afterwards saw her at a little gate, about twenty yards from the White-Hart—nobody was with her—it was between the White Jart and Saunders's beer-shop—she went with me down Merton-rise—my husband and I did not go into Saunders's beer-shop together—Mrs. Haggerstone was with me, but she would not come into the beer-shop—I asked her several times, and left her at the second little post, close to Wise's—that was on her road home—there is a turning to the left, just before you get to Saunders's beer-shop, which would take her home—it does not pass by the well—when we went into Saunders's it struck twelve o'clock, and when we came out it was half-past twelve o'clock—we went direct home—I found the prisoner at home—he was not undressed, but lying on the bed—I said to him, "Davy, is your wife at home?"—he said, "No, Mrs. Hedges, is not she along with you?"—when I went in again, I said, "Davy, my lad, do get up, it is a very dark night, I would get up and go across the fields and look for her"—he said he would see her d—d first: he supposed she was at some of her wh—tricks"—I said to him. "Stop Davy, don't judge her, for it is a dark night"—he said he would see her d—d before he would go outside the doors—I then said to him, "Oh, Davy, don't say so; come my lad, come get up and go and look for her"—he said, "No, I won't; and God send I may hear of her corpse before long"—and then, between sleeping and waking, I did not go to bed for half an hour after—I did not go to sleep when I went to bed—he got up after a bit, and I thought he was going after his wife—I spoke to him, hoping he was going after her—he said, "No; I will be d—d if I do," and said he was going to undress himself to go into bed to his children—he said, "She neither shall by aside of me, nor yet of my children no more"—I said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Davy</hi>, come my lad, come"—he said, "No: I would see her d—d before I go out to her, nor shall she enter my house any more"—this was while I was up—I went to bed after that, but could not sleep—I was aroused some times after that, and heard persons come to the side of the bedge—I rose up momestarily and heard what they said—I hallooed to the prisoner two or three times while the persons were outside, "Davy," but got no answer—I said to his eldest daughter. "Mary, is your father awake? wake him up"—he awake, and I said, "Davy, there is something the matter with your wife: do Davy, get up, pray do; I will go with you"—"No," he said, "I will see her d—d first, and I hope I shall see her corpse directly"—I said, "Come get up, I will go with you" and then the men outside said, "Pray do</p>

               <p>come, Davy, for Mr. Parsons wishes you to come" (Parsons keeps the White hart)—the prisoner said, "No; I will be d—d if I get up"—the men did not go away for some time—my husband began d—g and swearing at the prisoner, saying "Why do not you get up?"—he said, "No"—then the news came afterwards that she was drowned—the men did not say she was drowned at first, they said she was ill—he was awake when they said she was drowned—he then began to make a howl, and my husband said, "Are you an Irishman?"—he did not get up before the morning—he cried out while howling, "Oh, Claridge, you have done me, Oh, Claridge, you have done me! why did you not stop it? Oh, Claridge, why did you not stop me? I am done it—I am done it—I am done it"—(Mrs. Haggerstone had washed for Claridge)—when he said he had done it, he said, "The devil was with me while I done it—my husband did not hear all this, he was gone to work—he works on the rail-read, and is obliged to go to work on Sunday morning—this was about twelve o'clock in the day—it was at one o'clock in the day on Sunday that he said, "The devil was with me when I done it, &amp;c." and he said it when in bed that night, before he got up—I swoke my husband, and told him of it—my husband always went to work on Sunday morning to repair the new rail-road, because it is out of order—there are six of them at work there on Sunday—it was before the people came to arouse the prisoner that he used the expressions—before Green or any body came, and told him what was done—that is true.</p>

On the 16th of April I lived in a little cottage just by Miss Paynes's—next to the farm-house—I was going home that night, from the White Hart—I had been down there to do some business—I left there as near twelve o'clock as could be—it was about ten minutes after twelve o'clock when I got home—just opposite Saunder's beer-shop there is a turning to the left, which leads to the Winding-shot field, and to the hut where Haggerstone lived—when I got a short way up that lane, I saw a man and woman at a stile on the right-hand side—I should not know them again to swear to them, it was very dark—I can swear it was not the prisoner—the person was taller than the prisoner—the man moved from the stile when I came up, and I passed between the two—I did not get over the stile—I never saw Claridge till after this—as far as I cam judge, the man was about the size of Claridge—he was dressed in a lightish coloured frock, or flannel waistcoat—I could not tell which, but it was a light dress—my house is about a hundred yards from the well in which Mrs. Haggerstone was found—shortly after I got home, I heard two persons walking through the gate into the little field, and talking together very gently—that little field leads into the Winding-shot field—it appeared to be a man and woman talking—I went to bed a few minutes after—my lodger was afterwards called up, when Mrs. Haggerstone was found in the well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On the 16th of April I was at work on the rail-road at Merton, and was at the White Hart at Merton—I suppose I was there four hours—I saw Mrs. Haggerstone there for about an hour and a half—I was there before she came in—I believe I went out before her—I should think that must have been half-past eleven o'clock,</p>

I was called on to examine the body of Mrs. Haggerstone on Sunday morning, the 17th of April, about half-past two o'clock at the White Hart—at that time I only made an external examination—it appeared that she had been dead above an hour—there was the appearance of a blow on the right side of her face, and a great deal of swelling—I did not consider it possible at that time to ascertain how those appearance had been produced—when the swelling had subsided there appeared indentations of knuckles—it was by candle-lights that I first saw the body, which is the reason I could not decide then—I thought all the external appearance of the body were those I should have expected to have found in a person who had been drowned—I observed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183605090250"></xptr>
               <p>scratches about the legs and thighs, both interior and posterior—they appeared to have been made by brambles and thorn s—they were scratches of that description—I afterwards made a more minute examination and opened the body by the Coroner's directions on Wednesday—the immediate cause of death was in my opinion from suffocation by drowning—there was no appearance whatever of external violence on the head—on each outer side of the wrist there was the appearance of blows, I think those blows were produced before death, I think they could not be caused by falling down the well—it was a very deep well—I should think twelve feet deep and three feet wide—there was some bar in the well against which she must have rested at first—I think it very likely she might he bruised by going against the sides of the well—there were many appearances of blows on the back—I think they might be cause by falling down the well against the bar—I am informed the well was formerly a pump and some bars remain across the well against which she must have rested—there were a few scratches on her arms—I think the scratches in the interior of the thighs were produced by bram<lb></lb>bles, and I should say prior to death—I examined the organs of generation at the post mortem examination on Wednesday—there appeared to have been recent excitement of those parts but nothing conclusive—I think there was no appearance of force on those parts, nor any laceration, nothing of the kind—I should think it most difficult to ascertain that point, and it was the opinion of three surgeons with me—the excitement I allude to might have been produced in other ways also—there was the appearance of a blow below the groin near the parts of generation—it appeared to me to have been produced in the same way as the below on the face, with the knuckles, although there was not indentation, there was the same lividness parts of it—we divided the integument of the brain—there appeared nine or ten portions of extravagated blood as if that had been produced by blows—the immediate cause of death was suffocation from drowning—I have not the least hesitation about it—the blow on the head might have produced very serious symptoms had she not been put into the well.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there any blows on the right side of the face? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not observe any on the left—I certainly should have observed it if there had been—the blow near the parts of generation could not have been produced by a man's knee—it was narrow mark—the knuckles of a hand might have done it—I think constant and violent pressure of three knuckles of the hand might have produced similar up, pearances—there was some glutinous fluid which might have been—a disease, or it might have been produced in some other way—I have gone over the field in all parts of it—there are many hedges and ditches, containing brambles and fences.</p>

I came from the Crown, tipsy, that night, at a little after eight o'clock, and left my wife by the double gates at Merton, with the intention of going to her sister's, Mrs. Wright—I never saw her any more till she was a corpse—I bid two persons "Good night" in going home—one of them is a constable of the parish, named Brockwell—I went home to bed, and never heard of it till the alarm was given.</p>

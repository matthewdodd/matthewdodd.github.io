               Cutting, Clipping, Filing, and Diminishing the Currant Money of England, viz. 10 Half-Crowns, 20 Shillings, and 20 Six-pences
            </rs>. The Evidence for the King and Queen deposed, That they were all seen at work; Whittingham clipping money, S - H - Filing of it, and A - H - rubbing it upon a Leather to make it smooth. They made their Escape once from the Officers at first, but were taken sometime afterwards. Peter Whittingham was taken at the Salmon and Ball in Moorfields, and H - and A - in Mugwell-street. This was very clearly proved against them, and the clipt money was produced in Court as corroborating Evidence against them, which was shewed to the Jury. The Prisoners denied the Fact, and called divers of their Neighbours to justify their Reputation, urging, That one of the Witnesses for the King had malice against them, and did not prosecute, till they had took him up with a Warrant for suspicion of robbing the Prisoners of 50l. But yet the Court directed the Jury, That People that are Clippers, are commonly of good Repute, because they get their money easier than other men, therefore acted fairly with their Neighbours; that a man might have a fair Character, and yet be an Offender in such a Case; yet it was left to their Consciences, whether they did believe the Evidence against them; if they did, they must find them guilty of High-Treason, otherwise acquit them. The Jury having well weighed the Case, brought them in <rs id="t16940524-21-verdict89" type="verdictDescription">

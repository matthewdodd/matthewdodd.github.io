On the 20th of August, I met the prisoner in Queen-street; I knew him by sight before, I asked him to drink, as I knew his brother; I never saw him before, but by his features, I asked if he was not that man's brother, he said, Yes; we went to the Cooper's-arms, public-house, and had two pots of beer - it was about half-past ten o'clock at night. I was taken very poorly there, and a friend of mine who was there took me home, the prisoner went with me, they both stripped me, and put me to bed, he sat on the chair by the bed, I asked him to go home, he pretended to be in liquor; he took and folded my shawl up, I asked what he was doing with it; he then laid it on the table, I went to sleep, and felt him taking my pocket from under my head; I said, "Young man, do not take my things;" and he went out with my shawl, leaving my pocket on the table, and no money in it, there was a candle in the room all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sent for any doctor - A. No; I am married, my husband's name is George, he has left me - I have not found the shawl, I saw him next morning, and asked him for it, he pushed me down, and went off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not in liquor - A. No; not at all, I had not been drinking all day with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say he did not meet you before half-past ten o'clock - A. I believe it was between six and seven o'clock, I met him standing at the door of the Hoop and Grapes, public-house, he treated me with a pot of beer there, we had nothing but three pots of beer.</p>

On the night of 28th March, about half-past 11, I was on duty near Gough-square—as I was passing Mr. Hodgson's printing-office there, I heard a noise inside the door—I stayed there for about a quarter of an hour, and heard some one at the lock inside the door, as if trying to get it off—I then heard the lock taken off and laid down, and another lock apparently forced—I then saw the door open a little way—I directly pushed it against the prisoner, and got hold of him—he said, "All right; I work here"—he tried to get away—the sergeant came up and took him in charge, while I went to search the</p>

On 28th March a young man paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which he owed me; it was a florin, two fourpenny-bits, a threepenny-piece, and a penny. I spent all the money but the florin and the fourpence. I changed the fourpenny-piece in Holborn to buy a penny pie, and came into the street where this robbery was committed. As I came aloug I per<lb></lb>ceived two men go in at the door. I went in to see what it was, and one of the men came and shut the door. I could not open it again. The men went up stairs, and then came down and went out. I took the lock off, and was trying to come out when the constable took me.</p>

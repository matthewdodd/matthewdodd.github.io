I live at 3, Orange Row, Whitechapel—the prisoner married my daughter—she was staying with me on Saturday, 20th January, and had been from the Monday previous—a few minutes after 9, on the night of the 20th, the prisoner came and asked if his wife was at home; I said "No, not yet, she won't be long"—she came in about ten minutes afterwards—the prisoner was sitting on a side-table, and she went alongside of him and asked if he wanted to come home—he said he had no home for her; his father and mother had taken it—I said to my daughter "Never mind, hang off your shawl"—she went and hung it in the bedroom and stood behind the door, and the prisoner went and jumped up against her—I told my little boy to go and look for a policeman, as I did not want any row in my place—the prisoner said "You may go for a policeman, I will soon settle him"—he spoke in the ordinary way, with his mouth, not by signs. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner was alleged to be deaf and dumb.</hi>) I can understand him very well, and he understood us—he is a little deaf, but he can hear if you speak loud to him—the little boy came back and said he could not find a policeman; but it was all done then—the prisoner first stabbed my daugh<lb></lb>ter in the chin—he struck her—I did not see what with—I saw blood come from her chin—she then went to the side of the fire-place and dropped down; he pulled her down, and then she dropped down on the stove; she held up her arm, and he stabbed her in the arm while she was down—she then turned and halloaed out from pain, and then he gave her a cut here (<hi rend="italic">in the stomach</hi>)—I did not see anything in his hand; but when he was sit<lb></lb>ting</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—on Saturday night; 20th January, I had been staying at my mother's house a week—I came in shortly after 9 o'clock, and saw my husband sitting on a chair—he asked me where I had been—I said I had just come home from work—I spoke to him as I do to you, only some hard words he can't understand, and I have to go in motion—he can speak—I sat down by his side, and I asked him to come home to give me my clothes—he said he had no home; his mother and father had taken the home—I got up off the form and went into the bedroom to take off my things, and when I came back I stood by the room door, and, saying nothing, he jumped up and struck me with a knife in the chin—I don't know where else he struck me then, for I was senseless—I saw something between his fingers—I could not say what it was—I did not see the knife—I think it was a knife, I saw a point sticking out—I got to the fireplace and fell down, and he knelt down and got sticking me at the bottom of my stomach—I came to my senses when I fell down—I saw the blood coming out of my frock, and I said "Oh, mother, he is cutting me up, he is stabbing me!"—that blood was from a stab in my chest—my mother then pulled him round, and I ran out—I was taken to the hospital, and remained there eight weeks and a few days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been married to the prisoner about five months—he does not hear or speak the same as other people—when speaking to him there are some words that he can't understand, and I have to make motions with my fingers—if I talk slowly to him, he can understand me—he watches the movement of my mouth.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">TRAPPETT</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 235). I took the prisoner into custody on 20th January, about 10.30—I told him the charge was for attempting to murder his wife—he said his wife had taken a knife to him, and she had cut a piece of skin off one of his knuckles; that he struggled with her, and took the knife away—at the station he said he had been to her mother's to ask his wife for his best shirt; that she went into the front room, and when she came out she had a knife in her hand, and he took it away from her and stabbed her—there was a bit of skin off the knuckle of his forefinger on the left hand—I should say it had been done by a graze, as if he had hit his fist against something—I searched him—there was no knife to be found—he was sober—I could understand him when he spoke.</p>

I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—the prose<lb></lb>cutrix was brought there on 20th January—she was in a state of collapse, not insensible; her pulse very weak, and her face very livid—I immediately sent her up into the ward, and told the policeman to go for a Magistrate—I examined her—there was a wound, from which the intestines were pro<lb></lb>truding, and six other wounds, three on the left arm, one under the right breast, one on the chin, and one on the right buttock—they were made by some sharp-pointed instrument—the wound on the abdomen was about an inch long, right through into the belly—as far as I could judge, the bowels were not wounded—she remained in the hospital until 10th March.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The wound on the chin was through the skin—it was not deep—the wound under the right breast caused some anxiety—the stabs did not go very deep—she had very great pain in the chest, and I could not exactly tell whether the wound had gone through or not—it might have gone against the bone and so stopped, and that might have caused pain—I could not say whether it was given with much violence or not.</p>

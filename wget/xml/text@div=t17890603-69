               <p>I am a journeyman to Mr. Taylor, on the 19th of May, in the evening, coming home with my master, the prisoner was in the shop; the door was shut, I looked through the window and saw him cutting some new pipe; he took the pieces off his knees and heaved them on the shop-board, after that he came to the shop door and let me in; I spoke to him, he said he knew nothing what I meant, I told him, and he begged I would not tell my master; I took the lead away and laid it on the back part of the shop, and went and told Mr. Taylor, when I came back I could not find the lead; I left the prisoner in the shop; when I came back, the prisoner and the lead were both gone, the prisoner returned no more till he was taken; there might be about half a yard of it, about five pounds, it was a three quarter pipe; I never saw that lead after.</p>

               <p>I do not remember buying this lead myself, it was bought, I do not know from whence it came.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not you keep books of the things you receive? - No.</p>
               <p>Mrs. GLOVER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am wife of the last witness, I cannot positively swear to the lead, there might some part of it be brought there; the pipe lead was in our shop, I cannot tell who brought it; we have two brothers and a sister, they are not here; I might receive it; I might recollect the prisoner's face; I believe I did buy some lead of him.</p>
               <p>(The pipe lead deposed to by the Prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is made in my own shop by Scouton; this lead was concealed when they went with the search warrant, I can say it is mine, I have some to match it; I found this lead with pieces of flat and round iron, concealed under a kind of a bulk; I never saw any of this bore of lead, it is customary to make them of pewter, but it was the publican's own fancy; they are to draw liquors through; I am positive this part of the lead is mine, (The pipe lead deposed to by Scouton), three of these small pieces of pipe are stopped with folder, I saw him stopping them, I cut them afterwards; I cut the pieces that were stopped up out.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I do not recollect stopping any of them.</p>
               <p>Scouton. The prisoner said before the magistrate that he sold what I saw him cutting, to this Mr. Glover, that was not this pipe, it was larger, he owned before the magistrate that he sold the whole of this pipe and that too to Glover for one penny<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030106"></xptr>a pound; I heard no promise before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Scouton. Did not you hear my master say he would forgive me if I would tell any thing? - Yes, I did hear something of the sort.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I thought it my duty to do this, but I always thought him an honest man; he has worked for me two years.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know of any quarrel between him and Scouton? - No, I have lost a great deal of lead.</p>

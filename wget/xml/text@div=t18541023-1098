               <p>I was there on Saturday evening, 7th Oct.—the prisoner came, about half past 8 o'clock, and asked for half an ounce of tobacco—he gave me a half crown—I examined it, and found it was bad—I bent it in a detector—I had it in my hand—the prisoner took it, and gave me a shilling, and that was bad—I bent it, and told him it was bad—I called my mother, and I noticed the prisoner put his hand to his mouth—my mother asked him where the half crown was—he could not speak at first—as soon as he could speak he said he did not know where it was—a policeman was sent for—the prisoner then said he would pay for the tobacco, and he gave me another shilling, and that was bad as well as the first—I gave the first shilling to my mother, and she gave it to the policeman—the policeman took the second shilling from the prisoner—the prisoner was searched in the shop—he was very violent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the last witness. I recollect being called into the shop on 7th Oct, about half past 8 o'clock—the prisoner was there—my daughter showed me a bad shilling—she told me that the prisoner had tendered her first a half crown which was bad—I asked the prisoner what he had done with the half crown—for some time he could not answer—at last he said, "Ah, where is it?"—I noticed that he appeared to have something in his mouth, and he made a gulp, and seemed to swallow something—I said, "You have swallowed it"—he then tendered another shilling, which was bad—the policeman took that off the counter—my daughter gave me another shilling, and I gave it to the policeman—I think the prisoner was rather intoxicated.</p>

About twelve or one o'clock on the night of the 16th of May I met the prisoner in Amwell-street, Pentonville—she took hold of my arm, and wanted me to go with her—I refused—she wanted me to treat her—I could not get rid of her—she kept following me, and caught hold of my arm—she had not left me three minutes before I felt in my pocket, and missed a sove<lb></lb>reign from my right-hand breeches-pocket, and two half-crowns from my other pocket—I had not felt her hands in my pocket at all—she had kept hustling about me—I was quite sober—I went after her, and accused her of robbing me—she said, "I have robbed you of two half-crowns, " which she gave me back—I said, "You have robbed me of a sovereign as well"—directly I said that, the policeman came up—I gave her in charge, and the sovereign was found on her.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police-office surveyor. About ten o'clock at night, on the 15th of August, I saw the prisoner and another lad following the prosecutor and a lady; I saw the prisoner make two attempts to get the prosecutor's handkerchief, which failed; he tried a third time, and got it out, and passed it behind him to the other lad; I ran up, and took hold of them both - I had but a slight hold of the other, and he got away from me; I took the prisoner up to the prosecutor, and a watchman brought up the handkerchief.</p>

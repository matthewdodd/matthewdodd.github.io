                  </hi>. I keep the Farmers' Arms; Stratford—on 3rd December about 3 p.m. the prisoner came in, and at the same time a man who I have seen in custody this week came into the other compart<lb></lb>ment—a little cripple on crutches named Winter, who is there everything day, was there, and Mr. Williams, who belongs to the Great Eastern Railway, came in some time after the prisoner—nobody was in bar but me—I served the other man with two of ginger-brandy, and the prisoner with two pennyworth of port wine; he then asked for a threepenny cigar—the cigars were kept in a glass at the back of the bar on the each other side of the door where the gold is kept, and there is cabinet work on each side of the door—the other man was nearly opposite where the cigars were, oppsite where the gold is kept for change in a small grog glass—I showed the prisoner the cigars, he took one, and while he was smoking it he said "These are vary nice cigars, but they are hardly in season." and asked me to feel them—I put my left hand across the bar and said I thought they were all right—after he had finished that he had another two of port wine and another cigar—during the time he was smoking they both went out for a minute or two, and both returned into their separate compartments—it is about 7 feet 6 inches form where the other man stood outside the bar to the place where the glass was—on their coming back I served the prisoner with two more of port wine and another cigar, but although it was a cold day the other man only had two of ginger-brandy, and did not smoke—they when out twice—I did not serve the second cigar, the barmaid served it, as I went out of the bar for five minutes—the prisoner tried to draw my attention in several ways; he asked me to give him a sheet of paper to write an address on, and he turned his back to me, looking out at the window on tiptoe—he said "who is over at 64? is Mr. willoughby? the place with the red curtains"—I did not take the trouble to look at the curtains, but the cripple and Williams recommended him to go to the next street, where a Mr. Willoughby lived—if I had looked out my back would have been to the other bar—I left the bar in charge of my wife, and she left if in charge of the barmaid—I was not absent five minutes; I hard my wife shout, and when I came back both man had bolted—I rushed into the street, but saw nobody—I informed the police an hour afterwards—before the man went out they looked very knowingly at one another, they gave a quick glance—I was afterwards taken to worship street to a room with a lot of men—I was asked if I saw anybody I knew,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188001120128"></xptr>
               <p>and picked out the prisoner immediately from about 25—I went before the Grand Jury on Tuesday and after that I saw the second man, and gave him in charge—he was remanded to Ilford—a half-sovereign was taken from my place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> After I had the half-sovereign and the glass stolen I gave information to the police at Strarford, and about 10 days afterwards one of the detectives said that there was a man in custody at Worship Street who answered the description and would I go up—his name is Lloyd—I accompanied him there—he did not go into the room with me where the man were; one of the officers of the Court, a police officer, took me in—it was a small room and it was full—there were any in plain colthes—I did not know any of them—I knew perfectly well what I went in for—trousers on, but my impression was that there were some detectives there—I have a notion where Cambridge Road is; I should say it is about three miles off, it may be only a mile and a half—I do a pretty good business—I have three compartments—I did not see the half-sovereign and the glass taken, but I saw the person who was attested for stealing it at Stratford Police-court yesterday morning before the Magistrate—he was remanded till Sturday and I believe he is at Ilford—I have identified him as the person who was there at the time we lost the money, and I am sure be is the man—the prisoner was in the house about an hour—he came in about 2.40. into the compartment on the left-hand side, where there was a fire—I was behind the bar alone—the two men came in at the same time, within a second.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There is also a compartment at the back where there was no five; it is 6 feet 6 inches across (<hi rend="italic">Drawing a plan of the bar</hi>)—you can get in at the back; there is a side entrance; it is a corner house—I had just taken 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the glass, which I paid for tobacco and cigars, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I gave for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver—that only left a half-sovereign, which I missed when I came back and found the glass on the floor outside the har, just agaiust the door—the prisoner came in where we had a fire, and the cripple was in the same compartment sitting by the fire, and Williams was there—the wooden partiton between the compartments is 6 feet high—the third compartment is a little passage—the priosner kept on the move continually he did not sit down at all, and he was always on the talk—a man at one bar can see a man at the other bar.</p>

I live at Stratford, and am a constable of the Gteat Eastern Rialway—I was in Mr. Kidd's public-house from 3 to 4 clock on this day, in the compartement where there is a firepalce—the prisoner was there when I went in—the barmaid served me—I saw Mr. kidd talking to the prisoner while I was sitting down reading the paper—I was there shout an hour—I did not notice another man in another compartment—the prisoner was very talkative—the prisoner was showing some pictures to a little cripple, who cannot come here unless he is carried here—I did not take much notice, as I was intently reading the paper, but I noticed the prisone's face so that I should know him again—a man came in and stooped down to warn himself and said "Oh! look, that galss is going"—I looked up and saw the glass at the end of a stick going from a shelf in the other compartment, the stick being by some held by some one there—the</p>

               <p>moment the prisoner heard that he ran away—I heard the glass fall and the landlord went out—I did not see the other man—I went to Worship Street separately from Mr. Kidd, saw about 20 men in a room or call, and pointed the prisoner out directly.</p>

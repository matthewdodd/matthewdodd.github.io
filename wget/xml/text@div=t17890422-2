On the 26th, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner Pocock came in, and asked for a sheet of cartridge paper, which I sold him; I packed up my gold seals afterwards; I always take them home whether I sleep at home or in the shop; I put them on the compter; and when I had got home I found I had forgot to put them in my pocket; I went back; I found my door opened, and two men rushed out; they were pursued, and Reynolds was taken with this thermometer on him, broke as it is now; when I lost it, it was whole, and 21 gold seals were taken out of his pocket; I can swear to the property; I am sure the door was locked and fast when I left it.</p>

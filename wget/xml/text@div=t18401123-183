                  </hi>. I keep a marine-store shop on Saffron-hill. On the night of the 18th of November Boyd came to my shop with this piece of brass, weighing 4 1/2lbs.—I asked where he got it—he said he picked it up in Peter-street—I said that story would not do for me, I suspected he stole it—I locked the door, and put the key into my pocket—I sent my son for a policeman—Boyd then said he had a companion outside, would I let him in—I said, "No," that would be letting him out—the policeman then came and took Boyd—I told him there was a person outside—he went out, and returned with Bradshaw—both the prisoners were then taken—Brad shaw said at the station that he should lose his work, and that he worked for Mr. Southgate.</p>

I found Boyd in Mr. Coul<lb></lb>son's shop when I got there, and saw this piece of metal—I went out, and found Bradshaw on the opposite side, twenty or thirty yards from the door, standing still—I asked him if he knew the boy in the shop—he de<lb></lb>nied it at first—I asked him to go over the way with me to see if he knew the other boy—he went, and they seemed to know one another after being in the shop, but at first Bradshaw said he did not know Boyd—Boyd said at the station that he should lose his work—they both mentioned Mr. Southgate as their master.</p>

I have been in the general trade, but I am not in business at present—this article is not brass, but a mixed metal, which is called cock-metal—brass is made of copper, zinc, and some pewter—this metal is more brittle than brass—I have no doubt I could break this with a hammer, but I could not break brass—this has more zinc in it than brass has—it would not sell for brass in any marine store-shop—they do not give so much for it as for old brass—I should think this would not be called brass in the trade.</p>

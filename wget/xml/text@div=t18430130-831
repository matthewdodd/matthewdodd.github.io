                  </hi>. I am a Thames police inspector. About half-past six, on Saturday evening, the 14th of Jan., I was proceeding down the river; I saw a skiff between the two lower tiers, Horsleydown, with two men in it—as she passed close to me I saw a bag similar to this one under the back thwart—I said to my men, "Shove astern directly "—the two men in the boat began to pull across—I jumped out of the boat into the water, ran after them up the stairs, and lost them—I came back, and found no bag, but a few black oats in the boat, and directly after one of my men handed me a bag of oats—I went to the tier, and found a barge of oats, and one bag there had had about a bushel taken out of it—I have compared those oats with those in this bag, and have no doubt of their being the same—on Sunday morning I went to the prisoner's house—he was not at home—I left word that I had picked up his boat, and he must come to the Thames-police for it—when he came I asked where he was the night before—he said he left the boat at five o'clock, and went home to tea, and he was at home at six.</p>

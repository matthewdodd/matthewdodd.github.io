                  </hi> I am gate-keeper of the goods-station of the Eastern Counties Railway, in Brick-lane—the prisoners were porters there. On Sunday, the 4th of July, it was their duty to unload the trucks of the goods and fish that came from the country, and to put them on the platform—about two o'clock that afternoon I received directions, and placed myself where I could have a view of the platform—there were two trucks there, one contained pods of shrimps, and the other beer—about twenty minutes before three o'clock I saw Cherry go to the truck—there were five baskets, he took one off, and then took another—he lifted up the lid of the third one, put his hand in four times, and put some shrimps into his pocket—I then saw Allen go to the same pod—he took two handfuls of shrimps out and put them into his right-hand pocket—I then saw Baker go, take a handful out, and place it in his waistcoat pocket—he then took another handful, which he sat down to eat, on a case containing goods—I saw Wood go and take two handfuls, and place them in his right-hand pocket—they were there when they were taken by the officer.</p>

               <p>generally tied with three strings in front of the lid—it is my duty to look after them—these pods were all fastened—I looked at them in the afternoon again, and one string had been cut—it was open enough to admit a man's hand in flat, but there was not room to take a handful of shrimps out—I saw perhaps forty or fifty shrimps were taken from Wood's pockets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It is not unusual for the tie of a parcel to be out? I have seen it before frequently—to the best of my belief a hand that was doubled and made larger by a handful of shrimps could not have been got out of the basket.</p>

I manage the Red Lion, St. Giles's—on 29th October the prisoner was served with a pint of beer—he gave me a shilling—I put it in my mouth, told him it was bad, and gave him in custody with the shilling—on 24th October a shilling had been tendered, but not in my presence; it was found to be bad—we took care of it, but I cannot identify it, as I gave five bad shillings to the constable—they had been tendered between the 23rd and the 29th.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—on 24th October the prisoner was the last customer in the bar at 12 o'clock—I had emptied the till, and there was no money there—he put a shilling down—I went to the further till to get the change—I afterwards remembered that it was him—I took the coin out of the till a few minutes after he left and found it was bad—I gave it to my husband, who gave it to the constable, with. others—the prisoner had been there with a woman on the Wednesday before, and had two half-quarterns of rum; he paid with two separate shillings, but I did not notice that they were bad—I am confident that they were shillings.</p>

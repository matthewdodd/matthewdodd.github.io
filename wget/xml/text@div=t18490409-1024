                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, E</hi> 390). On the night of 6th April, about half-past eleven, I was on duty on Chadwell-heath, and saw a wagon going towards London—after it had passed I saw the prisoner come from behind a shed, go to the back of the wagon, and take something off; I do not know what—he crossed the road towards a hedge, and was out of my sight about two minutes—he then crossed the road again and went towards his home—I knew him before, and knew where he lived—just before he got home he threw something over some timber, and went in doors immediately—I went to the place and found this sack (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then met Crawford, and we went to the prisoner's house and took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Mollett's horse-keeper. On this night I was with the wagon, and had care of it—we were going towards London—there was a sack of potatoes on the tail—it was safe at a quarter-past eleven, when we were about 100 yards the other side of Chadwell-heath—when I got off the wagon at Ilford turnpike I missed it—this produced is it—it is Mr. Mollett's.</p>

I met Amos about half-past eleven, and in consequence of what he said I went to Wilson's house and took him into custody—Amos produced this sack, the bottom of which was very dirty, as if it had been in some ditch—the front of the prisoner's smock was all over dirt the same as the sack.</p>

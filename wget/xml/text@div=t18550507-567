"—I said that information had been given to me on the previous day from his former employer, that within the past month the prisoner had paid him the sum of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to compromise a matter in which he had been concerned, participating in robbery with his fellow clerk, who had been convicted that week and sentenced by the Court, and for whose defence the prisoner had paid as much as ten guineas; and, holding up this memorandum, I said, "I have discovered in Messrs. England's account great defalcations; you have abstracted the vouchers from the pass book; I have a painful duty to perform, and must give you into custody"—he said, "Oh dear! oh dear!"—I said nothing about compromising the matter, up to the period I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>likely to have another; it will kill her. John Checkley."—(I had previously desired him to produce the vouchers)—after I had read that, I said that I had a painful duty to perform, but in justice to myself and the mercantile community I must not consent to any arrangement—he repeated that if I would consent to an arrangement, everything should be repaid if I would overlook it—he further asked to be allowed to look at this memorandum, which is several sums taken from Messrs. England's account (the sums in ink are in my writing)—he looked at it, sat down at a desk, and put some pencil figures against five sums—I had asked him the amount of his defalcations, and he asked to look at the account, but I said nothing about showing mercy to him—when he had written these sums in pencil he handed it back, and said, "I do not think I can account for those sums"—I insisted on knowing what further amount he had abstracted, and he mentioned the London Dock Company, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and petty cash, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that you gave him a blank cheque? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I allowed him to draw the cheques, and signed what he presented to me, using my own judgment as to whether the accounts were due—when I signed those cheques I believed that the amounts were due—it was his undoubted duty to pay the cheque to the party to whom it was drawn—if he had paid the money in any other way, and kept the cheque, I should have discharged him for it, although there would have been no dishonesty—when he presented several small sums under 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Smith and Fenn, whalebone-manufacturers, Aldersgate-street, and have been to five years and a half—Ford was in their employ, and had been very nearly six years. One morning, six or seven months ago, he came and asked where my master was—I said, "Up at breakfast"—he said, "We might have a dexen or two of bone*"—I asked what he was going to do with them—he said he could find sale for it—some time after he said the same again—about the middle of that day he asked roe to go with him, and at night I went with him to Cottrell's, in Lon<lb></lb>don-wall—Cottrell was in bed—we went to a public-house to have a pint of beer, and Cottrell came in—Ford asked if he would come down for some bone in the morning—Cottrell said he would, and he came in the morning about ten minutes after seven o'clock—I gave him between five and six dozen of bone—on Friday morning, the 2nd of October, Cottrell come there, and Ford gave him some bone, that evening I and Ford went to Cottrell's, he gave Ford 2Z. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said if we had got any more bone he could get rid of it—Ford told him to come the next morning; the Saturday, and he came about twenty minutes past eight o'clock—my master was up stairs—Ford, John Merison, and I were on the premises when he came—I told Merison to go down, and wash his master's basin because we wanted to get him out of the way—he went down the ware-house—when he was gone I gave Cottrell between four and five dozen of bone—Ford was at that time in the warehouse—I was in the shop—Cottrell went off with the bone I gave him—Ford was about thirty yards from me—he could see plainly what was going on—on that evening when Ford came back from his tea he gave me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said that was my share—he did not say any thing else—I had had no other dealings with Ford—there was no transaction between the Friday evening when we got the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the Saturday evening when I received the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was taken into custody, and admitted to give evidence, and have now come from the computer.</p>

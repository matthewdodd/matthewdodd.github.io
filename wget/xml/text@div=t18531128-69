About half past 2 o'clock on Wednesday morning, 16th Nov., I was on duty in Bishopsgate-street, and heard a noise at the back of Mr. Orpwood's—I heard a window break; I went to a door at the back of the yard—the door was barricaded up—I pushed it aside and saw Wells—I forced the door open and took him—he said, "I am done now"—I took him to the station—I did not return again for some time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silversmith and watchmaker, No. 62, Bishopsgate-street Without. On the morning of the 16th Nov., I was awoke by a noise between 2 and 3 o'clock, I got out of bed and saw two men on the roof of my parlour, which is under the first floor—it is a leaden flat—I opened the window, and sang out to them—they said, "Don't be alarmed, we are policemen"—I came down and found the window broken in the parlour, which looks into the yard—I found the window of the kitchen at the back of the parlour had been opened, and the bolt had been endeavoured to be put off the 'staple—there were appearances on my wall of a person getting over, and descending into my yard—I have no doubt that that was the road pursued by somebody—the glass was sound the night before, and the shutters all safe—it was in the yard of No. 81, where the man was taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far is that from your premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is a wall ten feet high between those premises and mine.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Your back parlour window was broken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I saw that immediately after I was alarmed, and went down—it was that part of the window nearest to the kitchen, that was broken—the glass was entirely broken out—the window was smashed—I think there are twelve panes of glass in that window, and one was smashed—I examined the kitchen window between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning—no one slept in the kitchen—I had not examined the kitchen window at all before; it was my servant's duty to attend to that; but I always see my house fastened—I would not swear that I bad seen that window fastened that night—there were marks of an instrument being used on the window, and a piece of iron that was in my yard, for the purpose of lifting up a sink trap, was bent—the policeman got a ladder, which was about, and got on the roof of my parlour—the wall that separates me from No. 81 is perhaps four feet from my parlour, and by jumping across my yard a person would come to the flat of my parlour—the kitchen window is level with the surface of the yard.</p>

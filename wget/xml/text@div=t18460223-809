                  </hi>. I am wharf foreman to Grissel and Peto. I was returning from dinner on the 31st of Jan., and the prisoner was pointed out to me as having a bulky appearance—I stopped him—I thought he had some tools of ours—I asked him what he had—he said, some lead he had found on the timber, and he produced one piece of lead—I said, I should call an officer—he then produced three other pieces—the counting-house where this lead was taken from, is five or six wharfs below ours, but those who gather the coals and other things walk through the mud.</p>

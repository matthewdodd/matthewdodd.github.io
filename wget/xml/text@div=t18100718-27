               <p>Q. When you went to bed what did you do with your pockets - A. I put them under my head under my pillow, I went to sleep; I awoke in the morning about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at your pockets - A. Not at that moment; it was half after five when I missed the pocket. There were two pockets upon one string; the string was cut, and one of the pockets was entirely gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was in that pocket that was gone - A. There were thirty-six pounds; three ten-pound notes and four one-pound notes, in a red pocket book; the leather purse was in a canvas purse, in that canvas purse there were four crown pieces, two half crowns, and the rest in small change to the amount of two pounds two shillings in silver; and a good many things in the pocket that I cannot give an account of.</p>
               <p>Q. This was at half after five that you missed it - A. Yes, exactly. I asked the old gentleman that was asleep with the prisoner if he saw the prisoner out of bed; he said he missed the prisoner out of bed at four o'clock in the morning.</p>

I received them of my husband that same morning, the 20th of June; I had got a five pound note that I got the silver from. He gave me forty pound and two crown pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been with your husband when he received this money - A. I was not present when he took it; he had left the money in the landlord's hands at the Artichoke public house; he received it in Bartholomew-lane, at the bankers. It was prize money; my husband has been to sea a great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before - A. No further than on the Sunday before he slept at the Red Lion at Uxbridge, in the same room as we did.</p>

               <p>Q. So you first got acquainted with the prisoner on the Sunday before, and he was quartered at the same house as you were - A. Yes. We were travelling up from Wales to receive this trifle of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Then on the Sunday he continued travelling up with you the same road - A. No; we were not together on the road; he came the same night to the house at Kensington and asked for a lodging; it was granted.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner again after you missed your money - A. I never saw the prisoner from the morning that I missed my money until I catched him in the Borough last Friday week; I saw him at the door of the house where he was quartered at; he was standing picking his teeth; he turned into the house and shut the door after him, he jumped over the paling of the yard and went into the next house and went under the stairs; I went into the next house with a constable, and saw him coming out from under the stairs of the next house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come out of the stairs of himself - A. No; the constable bid him come out, and he said he would; I asked the prisoner how he could do such a trick with me; he said why did not I take it a little quieter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched at that time - A. He was searched when he was taken into prison; I did not see it. I had never seen him before I saw him at Uxbridge; I do not know what business he is.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you lodged it in any persons hands before you gave it her - A. Yes, with the landlady of the Artichoke, forty pounds ten shillings; I took it from the landlady and gave it to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get that money from - A. I received a draft of Messrs. Cook and co. in the Adelphi, they are prize agents; forty-seven pounds four shillings and sixpence, I received it as prize money; the draft was drawn upon Messrs. Downes and co. Bartholomew-lane, and there I received the money. I had come up to town on purpose to receive this money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect in what notes you received for that draft at Messrs. Downes and co. - A. Yes; three ten pound notes, two five pound notes, seven one pound notes, a half crown piece, and two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of having changed any of these notes - A. None of the tens, both of the fives I had changed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you first met with the prisoner - A. At Uxbridge; I had never seen him before; he came in of the Sunday night, he went off on the Monday morning before us, he left the house sometime before us; I stopped to have breakfast. He came into Kensington and spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at the Artichoke at Kensington that morning when you took the money of the landlady and gave it to your wife - A. Yes; and through his persuasion, and telling me that soldiers and sailors suffered by putting their money in landlord's hands, I took it out; that is the way that I lost it, by taking it out of my friend's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Now at the house where you lodged that night did you all lodge in the same room - A. This man and another slept in another bed in the same room; we went up all to bed together.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see your wife do any thing with her pockets when she went to bed - A. No; I laid down in the bed and went to sleep. The next morning we were awake near at one time; I saw her look for her pockets, she missed them; I sat up in bed and missed the prisoner; I saw his bundle at the foot of his bed; I thought the man was not gone. He had left his bundle there for a decoy.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you after that search his lodgings - A. I searched him first and found on him a silver watch. I went to his lodgings in Weston-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was his lodgings - A. I was informed that the prisoner came from that house; I went to the house and searched the prisoner's room, I found a piece of new Irish cloth, a coat nearly new, and a great many other things that appeared to be nearly new clothes, and some shawls, and then I came to Union-hall, I told him I had the trunk and the goods;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180017"></xptr>he asked me if I had got the note; I asked him what note, he said, a ten pound note; he told me it was in a canvas bag over the mantle piece, in the room where I found the goods; I went to the same room that I went to before, and over the mantle piece I found a purse containing a ten pound note. This is the note and this is the purse. The next day I told him that I had found the purse and the ten pound note; he said he found the money in the road the night before the robbery was committed.</p>

            . I live at 196 Tooley-street, in the Borough. The prisoner came to my house on the 29th of June, between nine and ten in the morning, he was in company with a woman, he said he wanted a piece of linen; after some time he selected one piece and some shawls, the whole came to three pounds ten shillings and sixpence, he tendered me a ten pound note, and I gave him the difference; I am sure the prisoner is the man; I recollect an endorsement at the back of the note, I observed it particular, I did not write any thing on it myself; I paid the note away in two hours afterwards, and the person that received it wrote my name on the face of the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him write your name on it - A. No: I can swear to the note by the endorsement.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am very sorry that my prosecutor is so hard against me. I found these notes going to the Artichoke public house. I am quite unprepared.

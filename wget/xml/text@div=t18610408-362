                  </hi>. I am a Scripture Reader, and live at High-street, Stepney—last Wednesday fortnight I was going down Petticoat-lane, and had my watch stolen—I caught hold of the person who stole it and called "Police"—I held the man for a little while—there was a crowd, and the prisoner came up and twisted my finger, making me loosen my hold, and the man escaped—a policeman came up, but the prisoner left—I saw him again last Saturday, and gave him in custody—he said that he was not near the place, but I am sure he is the man—I did not know him by sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The policeman took me out of the market where I deal, and you told the inspector that you did not knew it was me, for I had not got so much beard. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You were looking on one side and slfutting your eyes, and I said, "It looks like the man, but he has more beard on than he had when he rescued the man—if I had a doubt, I would not swear to, you."</p>

I was on duty in Petticoat-lane, heard a cry of "Police," and saw Mr. King holding somebody—I saw the prisoner go behind him, twist his hand, and rescue his prisoner—I pursued the man who was liberated, but could not catch him—I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

            . I lost a black silk cloak, and a muslin apron, I missed the muslin apron on the 27th of September, and the black cloak on the 4th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you keep them? - The black cloak was in the upper room, and the apron in the lower room of the house; the prisoner was a lodger of ours, she lodged with me till the time that she absconded. If she had lodged with me to the Saturday, the day following, that she went on the Friday, it would have been three weeks. I accused her with the apron on the 27th of September, and she absconded immediately; I found the duplicate of it at Mrs. Edwards's house, and money to fetch the apron out.</p>

             gave me the duplicate and some money to give to Mrs. Hughes to fetch the apron out; I believe it to be the 4th of October. I had only the duplicate of a cloak, but I had the money to fetch both apron and cloak, as I understood her husband had the duplicate of the cloak. She has a brother that is a man of great property, and he allows her a guinea and a half every month; and it is generally paid at my house. She makes sailors jackets, and slops, so it is called.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My husband and I had a few words, and I left the house, and when I left the house Mrs. Hughes lent me the gown and apron to pawn; as soon as I took my money I paid Mrs. Edwards seven shillings and six-pence I owed her, and left the money for Mrs. Hughes, for the things; Mrs. Edwards has got a son that is transported, and she said she would get forty shillings by me likewise; he is here in Newgate now, and has got two children.</p>

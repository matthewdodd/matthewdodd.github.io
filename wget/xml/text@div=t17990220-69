            : On the 20th of December, in the morning, I received from Mr. Franklin a great number of blanks, I put them into a chest in the press-room, in the Tower of London; Turnbull was employed that morning, with three others, to work the press, they came to work about seven o'clock, and a little before nine, I ordered all the men to go to breakfast, they all went out; in about half a minute Turnbull came in first, Dalton followed, and shut the door; Dalton stood by the door, Turnbull came up to me with a pistol, saying, once or twice, give me the key.</p>
               <p>Q. What key was that? - A. Of the chest which contained the money; I then caught hold of the pistol, he wrenched it from me; holding it to me again, he says, give me the key; the key laid upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200077"></xptr>the press-block before me; he took up the key, unlocked the chest, and took out one bag, which he put within his coat.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was the box, from which this bag was taken, in your sight, and in the same room? - A. Yes; I then offered to move out of the hole where I was sitting to feed the dies, and Turnbull, stepping towards me, said, if you stir I will shoot you; Mr. Chambers was making breakfast at the fire-place.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did that bag contain? - A. Six hundred and sixty-eight coined guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. When Turnbull was gone, how much was missing from the chest? - A. There were four bags; but part of the contents of one of them was spilt in the box.</p>

It is: On the morning of the 20th of December, I delivered to Mr. Finch a quantity of gold blanks to be coined into guineas; there were four bags, each containing six hundred and sixty-eight pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you deliver these bags to Mr. Finch? - A. About seven o'clock in the morning; and about nine, in consequence of an alarm, I went down from the mill-room to the press-room, and I missed Mr. Chambers and Mr. Finch; I saw one of the labourers unlock the door of the passage that leads from the press-room to another part of the Tower, and let them out of that passage; I took up the money, and found deficient two thousand three hundred and eight guineas.</p>

What pasted when you, Drake, and Bryce, were together? - A.Bryce said, captain, will you go up stairs, and drink a bottle of wine; I said to Bryce, who is to pay me for this voyage that I am going upon; Bryce said, captain, I will pay you one fifty pounds to-morrow morning, at ten o'clock; and when we all go on board, you shall have the other fifty pounds, Mr. Bryce told me, that a chaise should be ready the next afternoon at three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet any of the parties again the next day? - A. About seven o'clock the next morning, Saturday the 29th.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any appointment made to meet at Drake's? - A. No; I was there the next morning at nine o'clock, and Bryce came at ten; he gave me a forty pound, and a ten pound, Bank of England note, they were to go in the chaise at three o'clock; I went at three o'clock, and he said, the chaise would not be ready before six.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay at Drake's? - A. Not all the time; Bryce came to me about half past five, and said, the chaise is ready, captain, are you ready to go; then Bryce and I went to the Inn, and the chaise was ready in about five minutes time, and we got into two chaises; we found at the Inn, Pollard and Turnbull, and a person unknown to me, but I knew those three extremely well; Bryce, and the person unknown, went into the first chaise; Mr. Pollard, myself, and Turnbull, were in the hind chaise, and the other chaise kept the head of us all the way; we travelled, as near as I can tell, three or four and twenty miles before we shifted horses, both chaises stopped at the same place; we alighted and had a dish of tea, and, in about five minutes, we were in the chaise again; we were not five minutes out of one chaise before we were in the other; we drove on together about twelve miles further, I do not know the name of the place.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you arrive at the end of your journey? - A. Between two and three o'clock in the morning, I believe near three; it was on the Sunday morning, the people were gone to bed; we knocked at the door, and they turned out, and we had a glass of gin a piece; Bryce then asked the landlord if he could find us a guide to go over the marshes to Holly haven; the landlord said he would go himself, what would you please to give me; Bryce offered him seven shillings; the landlord said he would not go under half-a-guinea; and then he hired the countryman to carry their coats.</p>
               <p>Q. Who hired the countryman to carry their coats? - A. Bryce; he asked half a-crown, and he gave him four shillings.</p>

               <p>Q.It must have been cold weather - did you set out to walk across the marshes? - A. Yes, it was very cold; we got to Holly-haven a little before five o'clock in the morning, as near as I could guess, it was a long time before day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got there, who paid the landlord, and the man for carrying the coats? - A. Bryce.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might that be from where you got out of the chaise? - A. About six miles.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name of that place? - A. Richmond Sluice-house.</p>
               <p>Q. All parties were very sung there? - A. Yes, very comfortable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your boat there? - A. No; she did not come till three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to expect your boat would have been there? - A. Yes; I expected she would have been there, because Mr. Drake gave her orders to go round there before we came to town.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done in consequence of that? - A. Pollard and Bryce went out shooting at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all the party breakfast together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you all dine together? - A. Yes; all in one room.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200079"></xptr>Q.Was any thing done to hasten the boat round? - A. Yes; Bryce went round himself to Gravesend, to see if the vessel had gone round.</p>
               <p>Q. Where about is Holly-haven? - A. Upon the Essex coast, just before you come to Lee.</p>
               <p>Q. How is that by Gravesend? - A. Nearer the Nore.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Bryce get from Holly-haven to Gravesend? - A. By one of the wherries.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come back before your boat arrived? - A. No; I never saw his face after till the other day.</p>
               <p>Q. You had received fifty pounds - did he give you any more? - A. No; he gave the other fifty pounds to Turnbull, in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say he gave it to him for? - A. He gave it to Turnbull to give to me when they should be on board the vessel, I thought they were all going on a party of pleasure; before Bryce went away, he borrowed of me a two pound note, least he should be short of cash; when my boat came, my people came on shore, and had a bottle of wine; just before six o'clock in the evening, my two men, my son, myself, and Mr. Turnbull went on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Pollard then? - A. He came down to the platform, and the gentleman unknown; they shook hands with Turnbull, and they went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Then none of them went upon this failing party but Turnbull? - A. No; I thought they were all going; I got under weigh, and lay at Sheerness, made fast, and continued there all the next day, Monday; it blowed very hard, and Turnbull was very sick.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was sick, I suppose he went on shore? - A. No; he said he was afraid of getting cold; and on Tuesday morning we set fail, and got to a place called Ramsgate.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Turnbull go on shore at Ramsgate? - A. No; he said he was afraid of catching cold; then we went on to Dover, we got there on Thursday about eleven o'clock in the morning; as soon as I got there, I hauled my boat up, and got on shore; then Turnbull said, captain, what house do you use; I said, the sign of the Gun; he said, captain, I will come to you there in half an hour, and he came there to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did he go by? - A. I never heard his name in my life till he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened at Dover? - A. We had a very comfortable dinner, and plenty of liquor, and walked about the town.</p>
               <p>Q. What application did Turnbull make to you respecting the boat? - A. He asked me if I would put him into Dunkirk, or Calais, or Ostend; I told him there was a fair wind, but I could not without a proper pass for my people; he said, he would endeavour to get a pass; and he wrote a letter, desiring me to give it to Mr. Pollard, or put it in the post when I got home.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know that letter again? - A. No; I can neither read nor write.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you about any thing he had left behind? - A. Yes; he said he had left seventeen hundred guineas in the hands of Mr. Pollard, in a trunk, or chest, I did not know which.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a fair wind for the other coast when he told you that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you find him in custody? - A. The next morning I heard that he was taken and I was applied to to know if I had got any property of his, and I gave the constables the letter I had of him, Mr. Hills and Mr. Collison.</p>
               <p>Q. The letter that you gave to the constables-was that the same you received from Turnbull? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the fifty pounds you received in London? - A. I put that, and the other fifty pounds, both into the hands of

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am one of the moniers of the Mint; I received this parcel from Mr. Parker, which I have had in my custody ever since.</p>

               <p>Pollard's defence. I was there shooting two or three days, and doing business; the landlord there gave me an order for twenty dozen of porter; I had no business with Turnbull, nor did not know the man, or any thing at all about him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he kept the shop of an ironmonger? - A. There were both old and new iron in his shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to represent here, upon your oath, that he carried on the business of an ironmonger, as other ironmongers do in London? - A. I do not know any other.</p>
               <p>Q.What does his stock consist of? - A. Ironmongery, locks, and keys, and sundries.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live? - A. No. 64, Upper East Smithfield.</p>

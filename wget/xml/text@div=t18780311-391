                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 176<hi rend="italic">l</hi>). On Saturday, 9th February, about 9.15 p.m. I went to Lack's Dock, Vauxhall, and saw the prisoner and another man fighting—I asked them to leave off, but they refused—I tried to separate them, and they took off the belts which they wore round their waists, struck me across the back with them, and knocked my helmet off—I took the prisoner into custody—he was rescued by some of his companions, and I was knocked down—McBrien then came up, and the prisoner made his way to 6, White Lion Court—I pointed him out to McBrien, who followed him—I then went to White Lion Court—McBrien was at the door, partly in, and partly out, and I saw the prisoner strike him twice on the head with a bar similar to a poker, it was like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—McBrien towards the stairs—another man was there with a great stick in his hand—the prisoner went upstairs—Glen came up, and took McBrien towards the station—he was insensible and covered with blood—I struck the other man who was there, and the prisoner then made a third violent blow at McBrien, but missed him, and caught the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. There were ten or fifteen roughs there at the first part of it, and I was knocked down by them—it was about ten yards from where they were fighting to White Lion Passage—the bar was used about ten minutes after the fight—I stood inside the doorway—I saw the door open on the ground-floor—I did not go in—the person who used the bar came down the stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I am sure the prisoner was one of the men who was fighting—I lost sight of him before he got to 6, White Lion Court, but I had pointed him out to McBrien, and to Glen also—I saw his face, and am certain he is the man.</p>

               <p>about 9.30, I went to Lack's Dock—the back of the houses in High Street, Vauxhall, looks on the back of the houses in White Lion Court—I saw Gray on the ground—he pointed to the prisoner, who ran across the road—I followed with Glen, and am quite sure the prisoner is the man—he ran into 6, White Lion Court, and the door was shut, but it opened immediately, and I got in, and caught the prisoner by the left shoulder, and told him he must go to the station with me for assaulting 106<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he said nothing, but dealt me a blow on my head with some blunt instrument, which knocked me insensible—I did not feel a second blow—he is the man I caught hold of—I had seen him before, and knew him by sight—I had been on that beat since Monday morning—I have two wounds on my head, and one on my arm—I feel the effect still—my helmet was knocked off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I knew him before, and knew his name was Quillegan, but I did not know his Christian name—I have seen him a good many times—the man who struck me was not on the stairs when he struck me the first blow, I never saw him anywhere but in the passage, another man was there who I cannot identify—a light shone from the top of the stairs over the balusters—it was sufficient for me to see the prisoner's features.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. When I got into the passage my attention was at once directed to laying hold of the prisoner—I put my hand upon the shoulder of the person immediately in front of me and that was the prisoner—there was no time for anybody else to come up—it must have been a blow from the man whose shoulder I touched—I saw nothing in his hand before he went in, but his back was to me—there was time to get a poker between the time of the door shutting and its being opened again, if it was convenient, and there was no time for anybody to have interposed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the police—on the 9th February I was called to the station and found McBrien with a large wound over two inches long, on the back part of his head, going down to the bone; and another not quite so long on the front part of the right side of his head—either of them might have killed him—this instrument would have caused it; great violence which must have been used—I kept him in bed 12 days, and he is under my care now.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 7 <hi rend="italic">LR</hi>). On 9th February, about 9.30. p.m., I was in High Street, Vauxhall—I went to Lack's Dock and saw Gray down on his knees with his helmet off, and the prisoner, whom I knew as living at 6, White Lion Court, standing in front of him—Gray pointed to the prisoner and said "That man has knocked me down, take hold of him"—I made towards the prisoner—he ran—I followed, accompanied by McBrien—I did not lose sight of him—I followed him to 6, White Lion Court—I was in advance of McBrien—I entered the door first and McBrien passed me in the doorway, and I think he had hold of the prisoner when I went in, but I am not positive—the prisoner went upstairs, fetched a piece of iron like this, and came down, and McBrien was going to lay hold of him and he struck McBrien with it twice—I am sure the prisoner is the man—McBrien was just in front of me—he fell towards the foot of the stairs—I saw a third blow struck, but it missed him—when he fell I had my arm around his neck and the blow struck the door—Gray was behind me, my helmet was off—I pulled McBrien out into the street, put him in a place of safety, and went into Vauxhall Walk to look for the prisoner,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187803110111"></xptr>
               <p>and saw him on top of a blacksmith's shed, the wall of which is a portion of White Lion Court, and the shed is a lean-to against the wall—a person could get over the top of the wall at the shed—I got on to the shed and he rolled off into the back yard of No. 6—I went into High Street and saw him come out of No. 10—the back of High Street abuts on the houses where he lives—I followed him—he ran and went into a house in Vauxhall Square—I followed him into the house and found him in bed with his clothes off, except his neck-tie—there were two little boys in bed and he rolled in at the foot—I afterwards went to No. 6 and found this iron bar and McBrien's helmet—No. 10 is where most of the gas men work and low people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. When the door of No. 6 was opened I did not see the prisoner at first—the blow was not dealt when the door was first opened—I saw the prisoner get away from McBrien and go upstairs—McBrien had the same opportunity of seeing him go upstairs as I had—he came down with a poker in his hand—McBrien was not standing there all the time, he was trying to get upstairs—there was a light at the top of the landing—I think it was a lamp, it stood on a table just in the doorway—I Could not see it, I only saw the light from it—McBrien did not go up any of the stairs before he was struck—I saw no other men on the stairs or in the passage.</p>

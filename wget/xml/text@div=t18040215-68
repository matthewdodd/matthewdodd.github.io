Yes, by Mr. Berleyson, on the 26th of January, from Swallow-street to Mr. Berleyson's house; I was helping, carrying a dozen in baskets, each of us; I was coming back with my empty basket, and met him with his dozen on his shoulder; I then went down the stairs, and filled my dozen, and returned to Mr. Berleyson's house; I did not meet him, nor could I find him in the cellar; I asked his master where he was; I then went the second time, and did not see him in the cellar of Mr. Berleyson's house, nor in Swallow-street cellar; when I was going back with the empty basket, I found him going down the other stairs in Swallow-street with the empty basket; I chastised him where he had been, he said, he had been to Glasshouse-street to ease himself.</p>

             sworn. - I am a servant; Mr. Berleyson employed me to see the wine removed out of the cellar; I was in office there for that purpose; the prisoner asked me what I wanted there; he said, there was no occasion there for me; a little while after, he wished me to carry half a dozen baskets; I told him, I did not carry wine; presently a person came in the cellar, he made answer, there was another watchman coming; I told him I was no watchman, but I was employed by Mr. Berleyson to see the wine removed, and I should be there; soon after that, he missed coming in his turn; they came regular one after the other, and he did not come in his turn; I asked him where he had been; he said, he had not been in the cellar with me; I asked him when he come again where he had been; he said, he had been in Glasshouse-street to ease himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that time he went out he had a dozen bottles? - A. I am sure he had a dozen bottles every time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You do not mean to say that he had a dozen the last time he went out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice every time? - A. Yes, I marked every dozen that went out on the wall, and likewise every dozen on a wooden cellar-candlestick that I had in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How many dozen were there? - A. Fifty-six dozen, and five bottles of wine.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JONES sworn. - I am a chairman: On the 26th of January, between the hours of one and two, I just left Mr. Berleyson's house, I was going home to my own dwelling-house, No. 7, Haydon-street, and saw the prisoner in Leicester-street with an empty basket of a dozen of wine; he was talking to another man, saying, he was at work for a publican below Mr. Berleyson's, about one hundred and sixty yards from Swallow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Leicester-street in the way to Glasshouse-street? - A. No, quite contrary.</p>
               <p>- SLATER sworn. - I billed the wine, and am a wine cooper; there were fifty-four dozen and five bottles drawn from the pipe; I live at No. 1, Little Berkeley-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150053"></xptr>Grosvenor-square; we drawed from Swallow-street, and billed it in Sackville-street; I drew on Thursday, the 26th instant, forty-three dozen of wine, and put it on my left-hand side distinctly on the bottles; I drew one dozen, and put it to the other, that made forty-four, and then I drew ten dozen in quarts, which made fifty-four dozen and five bottles; I do not include what was drawn after that, there came twenty-two after that, but that is not included in what was taken to Sackville-street; I know nothing about the removal of the wine; in all there were fifty-two dozen moved into Sackville-street, and two dozen and two; there were fifty-four dozen and five drawn from the pipe.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Rather a short pipe? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you marked only fifty-four dozen and two, did you mark them as you put them in? - A. I scored them as they brought them in, I told Mr. Berleyson how many; he was not there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I speak before God Almighty, that I never took a bottle of wine in my life.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

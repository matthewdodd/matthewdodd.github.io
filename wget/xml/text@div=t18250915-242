I then asked him if he had any thing more; he said, so help him God he had not - but a friend of mine, who was there, was not satisfied, and asked if he had no box: I went up with him to his bed-room - he opened his trunk, and I there found a paper of stockings, containing eleven pairs - he owned that he had taken them.</p>

I saw the prisoner open the bag - he took out the handkerchiefs, which Mr. Dutton said were his; the prisoner said he meant to pay for them: Mr. Dutton said it was a very idle excuse, and asked if he had any thing else; he said "So help me God I have not! if you find any thing else you may go as far as the law will allow you;" he begged and prayed very much that he would not prosecute; we then went up stairs, and in the box, which was opened by the prisoner, we found the stockings, which Mr. Dutton said were his property - the prisoner said he knew they were.</p>

               <p>On the 28th of February at night, about half past eight, I saw the two prisoners; the woman had the coat in her apron, that was about three yards from this house; the man prisoner was with her when they came to the door of Mrs. Moses, who is indicted as receiver, but is not in custody; the man took the coat from the woman; she went into Mrs. Moses's with the coat; I saw the woman looking at the coat and I went in; immediately on my going in, Mrs. Moses threw the coat away behind the counter; I secured the two prisoners, and went and took the coat from behind the counter, and I advertised it the next day.</p>
               <p>Why did not you take Mrs. Moses? - I did not know at that time that I was justified to take her into custody, as I knew where to find her, and I shall take the earliest opportunity of that.</p>

               <p>I found the coat in the Minories; I kicked it, and took it up; coming along Rosemary-lane, I met Flannagan, knowing him to be a taylor, I asked him the value.</p>

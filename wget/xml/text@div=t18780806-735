I live in Gawthorn Street, North Bow—on Sunday morning, 7th July, I was at Temple Mill siding—I arrived on duty about 8—the Enfield, Swaffham, and Downham trueks were there, and appeared all right between 11 and 12—Gooding and an under shunter named Murphy were then on duty, and Elliston should have been watching the culvert nearly opposite the trucks; but he was with Gooding 175 paces away from where he ought to have been—I went off duty then and came on again about 8 p.m.—in consequence of what I then heard I went with Smith and Otter to the Enfield truck at 11.40 p.m.—Smith untied the sheet and showed me a hamper and some biscuits on the ground—the hamper appeared to have been pilfered—at 1 a.m. on Monday I examined the Downham truck—I found a case with only tobacco-dust left in it, and a paper parcel directed to Mr. Bennett, of Downham—I subse<lb></lb>quently inspected the men's lockers, and in one, which was pointed out to me as Gooding's, and unlocked in my presence, and several others, I found 16 qtr. lb. packets of tea like these two—on Monday, 8th July, I went with Inspector Russell and other officers to Gooding's house—Russell told Good<lb></lb>ing he would be charged with being concerned in robbing the trucks—Gooding said he knew nothing about it—afterwards, while washing his face in the back kitchen, Gooding said "If any one has put anything in my locker, I know nothing about it"—I had not said anything to him about the locker nor heard it mentioned—I said "Well, since you have mentioned it, I will tell you what I have found in your locker, and that is 16 qtr. lb. packets of tea"—he said "I know nothing about it."</p>

On Monday, 8th July, about 2 a.m., in consequence of information I received, I went to Gooding's house with Baker—I saw Gooding, and said, "Gooding, some trucks at Temple Mill siding have been robbed on the previous day, and some of the property has been found," and that I was going to take him into custody for being concerned with others in stealing it—he made no answer then—I commenced to search the front room—Baker then came in—Gooding asked Baker to allow him to go and wash—they went into the washhouse—I heard Gooding say in the washhouse, "If there is anything found in my locker, somebody else has put it there; I have not"—I had not heard any one say anything about the locker—I gave Gooding to another constable, who took him to West Ham station—I sent another constable for Elliston, who was also brought to the West Ham station—I there said to him, "Elliston, I am going to take you in custody for being concerned with others in stealing a quantity of property from trucks at Temple Mill siding"—he made no answer—I had previously said, "I am going to search your house; have you any property belonging to the company there?"—he said, "I know nothing at all about it"—the charge was read over to the prisoners by the acting</p>

                  </hi>. I am deputy inspector of permanent way in the service of the Great Eastern Railway Company at Stratford—Elliston is a watchman, and walked half a length when he first went on duty and then he would take his station at the culvert and watch the rest of the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Great Eastern Railway watchman—on Sunday morning, 7th July, I was on duty in the brickfields adjoining the siding—three men came there to spread some sand and dry it ready for Monday morning—I saw no one else there that day—those three men belong to the stools where they make bricks.</p>

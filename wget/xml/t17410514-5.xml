On the 24th of April, we were together in my Shop, and he went up Stairs with some Goods to a Warehouse, which I have, and while he was there, I had occasion to go up after him. When I got into the Room, he seem'd to be in a great Flutter, and would not stand upright; however I pulled him upright, and then this Callimanco drop'd from his Clothes: I said, you Villain, have you robbed me? and he did not speak a Word; so I brought him down into the Shop, and asked him, why he gave himself up to such practices ? and desired him to inform me, if he had robbed me of any Thing else, and how he had disposed of it. As to the Callimanco, he said, he took that to give away to somebody, but he would not tell me who that somebody was. I then asked him, if he had taken any thing else, and he said; if he informed me, perhaps he should not be used the better for it. I kept him some time in my Shop, and then carried him before a Magistrate, and when we were there, we thought it might be proper to search his Lodgings; but he declared he had nothing there of mine: We were not willing to take his Word, so I and the Constable searched his Lodgings, and found these pieces of Leather, some of which I can swear to be mine. I asked the Prisoner, if these were not mine? and he said, they did not all belong to me, for he had bought some of a Leather-cutter in Maiden-lan ; but that Leather-cutter being sent for, said, the Prisoner had bought of him some Time ago, but that none of those peices were ever his.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Master sent me up into the Warehouse, and the Stick fell out of this Callimanco, and I took it in order to roll it up again, and he came up and said I had an Intent to rob him. As to the Leather, I had it by me, and worked for my own Customers before I lived with him.</p>

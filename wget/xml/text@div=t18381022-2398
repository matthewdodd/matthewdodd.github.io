               <p>"J. Reitterhoffer again promises, if the Marquis of Downshire return him his character, or give him the opportunity of justifying it, to destroy, or even give up, all letters and documents which substantiate his publication.—J. R., presuming that the feeling entertained towards him by the Marquis of D. is such as to preclude the possibility of a personal interview, suggests that his wrongs should be inquired into by two gentlemen, the one to be appointed by the Marquis of Downshire, and the other by himself, whose decision J. R. will willingly abide by. Should this suggestion meet with approval of the Marquis of Downshire, a com<lb></lb>munication to that effect, addressed to the care of A. Renton, 210, Piccadilly, will be immediately attended to.</p>
               <p>"P.S. Whatever further exposal, for my justification, this unfortunate affair (about the sudden and mysterious death of poor Lady Mary Hill) may incur, the Marquis of Downshire will have, no just complaint of having been taken by surprise."</p>

               <p>"My Lord—It was not until yesterday that I knew, beyond all doubt, that the person, who called at No. 4, Agar-street, Strand, upon two occa<lb></lb>sions, and branded me as a liar and a coward, threatening to horsewhip me and break all the bones in my body, was your lordship, under the assumed name of that despicable fellow, Lord Marcus Hill. Without further alluding to the generous and honourable feeling such conduct de<lb></lb>notes. I will at once acknowledge that, compared to the conduct pursued towards me by your father and uncles, it is meritorious in the extreme;—for you only seek to exterminate me by a sudden and positive death, and not to torture and rack me by cruelties unparalleled in the history of aris<lb></lb>tocratic villains. In order to show your lordship that your threats cannot intimidate me, whatever effect they may have had upon the weak parties whose agencies I had employed to dispose of my pamphlets, I beg to inform your lordship, that I shall shortly open a shop, where I shall in person superintend the sale of my pamphlets; when the spot is decided upon, your lordship shall have the earliest intimation of it; when the world shall see who has—the most courage—your lordship in attempting to carry your threats into execution, or 1 in resisting them. But should your lordship thirst for immediate revenge, your wishes can be gratified if your lordship will send a line to the above address, appointing a place and hour where and when, I shall be happy to attend your lordships com<lb></lb>mands. The enclosed handbills will convey to your lordship something of my intention, the completion of which has only been delayed by the diffi<lb></lb>culty I have experienced in finding an eligible public situation for vending the pamphlets. In conclusion, I reiterate what, upon every occasion I have alluded to in my communication with your father, viz., that I seek but for justice; and until I have it, I will pursue every legal means within the compass of my ability to attain it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the defendant's service in March this year—I first went into his service at the commencement of the general election, about two years since—he is a printer by business—I assisted him to move to Union-street, Borough—before that he lived in Drury-lane—I how the man Reitterhoffer—I saw him once at Drury-lane, at Teuten's—I how that placard—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—it purports to be printed by Reitter-hoffer, at No. 4, King's-road, Chelsea, but it was printed, in fact, at No. 59, Union-street, with that false name and address on it—allow me to observe, Mr. Tueten objected to print the bill with his own name on it, and Reit<lb></lb>terhoffer then said, "You can put my name, at King's-road, Chelsea"—the second large bill was printed at the same place, by the same person, and the smaller one was printed at the same place.</p>

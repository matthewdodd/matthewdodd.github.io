                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 96). I took the prisoner into custody on 27th January, in the street close by his own house—I said, "I am a police-officer, and shall have to take you in charge for embezzling various sums of money belonging to Mr. Mumby, your master"—he said it was a bad job, that he had been out collecting orders and monies, that he got beastly drunk in the evening part, and that in crossing Regent's Park he was garroted by three or four men, and robbed of every penny-piece he had about him—I asked him how they garroted him—he said by pressing his throat very tightly—I asked him if he did not come home in a cab—he said, "Yes, I did; I paid the cabman half a crown, which I found remaining in my pocket"—I asked him if he had given information to the police round about the Regent's Park, as there were plenty of them there, and park-keepers—he said, "I have not; I spoke to a policeman this after<lb></lb>noon in Homerton, and asked him what was my best course to pursue"—I asked him the number of the policeman, but he could not tell me—I then took him to Seething-lane station—after he was committed for trial, I told him that any inquiry I could make respecting the garotting I would willingly do, I would not care what trouble I took over it if he could give me the slightest clue.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I deny emphatically that he ever suggested to me that he would make any inquiry. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I spoke to him twice about it—he said at one</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On Monday, 19th January, I went on my first day's work for the prosecutor; I was on my feet for a considerable portion of the day, and had no dinner; towards the evening I unfortunately took several glasses of drink, and became intoxicated; I was attacked near the Regent's Park by a number of men, thrown down and robbed; feeling 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left in my pocket, I got a cab and went home; I intended to have gone at once to the prosecutor, told him all, throw myself on his sympathy, and make arrangements to pay him, but I felt too much ashamed and humbled, but on Thursday I wrote to him, stating I would pay him every farthing, and my wife took the letter; I have been twenty-three years engaged in com<lb></lb>mercial pursuits; unhappily, for the last few years, I have been addicted to drink, and have lost several situations in consequence, but as regards honesty and integrity I stand pure and unsullied.</p>

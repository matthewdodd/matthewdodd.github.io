            , the Prisoner's Apprentice . On Wednesday the 9th of December , about 11 at Night, I went to Bed, and fell asleep, but was awaked by a Noise between 12 and 1. I heard my Mistress (in the Room under me) cry Murder ! For God's Sake don't murder me! For the Lord's Sake, Robin , don't murder me ! Pity me! for Christ's Sake! - for my poor Family's Sake! - Then she call'd me, Charles! Charles! Charles! and once she cry'd louder than ordinary. The Prisoner said, G - d d - n you, what do you want with Charles ? I was afraid he would come up to me, and so I stepp'd out of Bed, and was going to get out of the Window , to save my self, but a Child that lay with me (who was lame, and could not speak plain , tho' it was ten Years old) cry'd Sharly ! Sharly! do no go. Then I consider'd with my self, that by venturing out at Window I might be accessary to my own Death, and so I went to Bed again. I heard a great many very violent Blows, which by the Sound seem'd to be given with the Tongs, or the Fire-shovel. By and by the Neighbours cry'd Murder! and I heard the Street-Door open, which I thought the People without had broke open. Then I said within my self, By the leave of the Lord I will venture out, as soon as the Mob comes in; but presently I heard the Prisoner come up Stairs into his own Chamber.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How do you know it was I that came up, when you did not see me?</p>
               <p>Bird. Because as soon as you came up I heard you scolding again - I got up, and was going down Stairs, about 6 in the Morning, I heard a low Voice (which I thought was my Mistres's) and it said, Charles, go and strike a Light, and take the Tin Pot and draw some Beer. I did so, and brought it up. And the Voice said again, Set it down upon the Chest and leave it there. I did so; but I neither saw his nor her Face, for they were both cover'd in the Bed. - Then the Voice bid me make a Fire, which I did; and while I was blowing it up I heard 2 or 3 dismal Groans. Then I went to my Work.</p>
               <p>Court. What Work.</p>
               <p>Bird. The Prisoner is a <rs id="t17320114-9-deflabel50" type="occupation">Waterman</rs>

This was between 6 and 7 o'Clock; and about 8 Job Allen came to me, and told me my Mistress was dead. Then I have lost a very good Mistress, said I; and with that I ran home to know the Truth of it; and there I saw Dr. Smith, and the Constable, and the Prisoner, and I found it was too true! my poor Mistress was dead indeed! - Then I went to my Work again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How do you know but it was your Mistress that came up Stairs? for you said you thought it was me, only because you heard my Voice after I was come up.</p>
               <p>Bird. I thought it was not possible that my Mistress shou'd come up Stairs so readily, after the Blows that she received, and the Groans and Cries that she made.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . Did you hear us both go down?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140007"></xptr>Bird. I don't remember that I heard any more than one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you come home to Dinner the Day before this happened, and your Mistress told you she'd give you no Victuals, for she intended to make away with her self?</p>
               <p>Bird. No. I came home to Dinner, and there was cold Beef; I desir'd her to let me broil it, and she said, with all her Heart; I might do as I wou'd - She was as good a Woman as ever broke Bread.</p>

Then she got from him, ran down Stairs, and out at the Street-Door; he follow'd; I open'd my Window, and saw him beat her in the Street, and force her in again.

When they came into the Chamber, I heard a great many unmerciful Blows, which by the jarring Sound I thought to be given with the Fire-shovel or Tongs; and, as if her Breath was almost gone, she cry'd, Oh!

This was between 12 and 1. I jump'd out of Bed, ran to the Window, and look'd out. He ran down Stairs, and came out of the Door in his Shirt, with a Candle in his Hand; his Wife was lying in the Street. He damn'd her for a Bitch, and said she was drunk. He set down the Candle on a Bench, and taking her by the Arms, dragg'd her backward up the Steps into the Entry, and shut the Door; as he was hauling her in, I called out, You Villain! you wicked Rogue! you have thrown your Wife out of the Window, and kill'd her! All the Neighbours were alarm'd, and several came out, and said, For Christ's Sake don't use the poor Woman so, but let some Body help her; but he would let no Body. After he had got her in, I heard several Groans, and thought she might be in Labour, for she was so near her Time, that she look'd every Hour, but about 6 she dy'd, and half an Hour after he went out and brought a Mid wife.

Her Right-Hand was cut all a-cross the Fingers, and the Window-Post was bloody with strugling. The Prisoner said, see how the wicked Jade has cut her Hand with the Glass-Window in getting out. But I look'd, and there was not one Pane of Glass broke, nor was any of the Glass bloody, but only the Post.</p>

            , the Husband of the last Witness. On Wednesday the 9th of December , the Prisoner came Home between 11 and 12 at Night, and begun to scold at, and beat and abuse his Wife; she thought to escape by running down Stairs, but he was too nimble for her, and catch'd her just without the Street-Door, and beat her so barbarously, that he rais'd all the Neighbours, who cry'd out, shame on him. He beat her thro' the Entry up Stairs, and in the Chamber she cry'd, Oh! Oh! Oh! and afterwards, O Robin ! - What are you going to do? - For God's Sake spare my Life! - Don't kill me! - for Christ's Sake! - for my poor Family's Sake. Then I heard a strugling, a rustling like the rustling of a Tarpaulin , the Woman gave a great shriek, and something rush'd out of the Window at once - I could hear very plain, for there's only a Deal Partition betwixt my Room and the Prisoner's - I and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140008"></xptr> my Wife jump'd out of Bed, and went to our Window. The Prisoner came out of his Door with a Candle in his Hand. His Wife was then lying on the Stone Pavement, she lay like a Log, and neither stirr'd Hand nor Foot. He set down the Candle, took her by the Shoulders, and haul'd her upon her Back up 3 Steps. - My Wife and other Neighbours call'd to him, and cry'd, Murder! He took no Notice of them, but dragg'd her in, and shut the Door fast . - Then he dragg'd her up Stairs. - It must be he that did it, for No-body was there to do it but himself, - and I heard several heavy Groans; but whether they were hers or his, I don't know.</p>

             . I have lived next Door to the Prisoner 3 Years, - there's only a thin Partition between us, so that I can hear every Word that's spoke in his Room. For this 12 Month past, I have frequently heard great Out-cries of Murder. And particularly about 3 Weeks before her Death, he came home in a jealous Fit, and beat her, and swore he'd Murder her, if he was hang'd for it. I heard her cry, O for God's sake Mercy ! Pity me! - Pity the tender Infant within me ! Damn ye, for a Bitch, says he, I'll send you, and your Infant to the Devil together ! - I'll split your Skull, and dash your Brains against the Back of the Chimney - I know I shall come to be hang'd at Tyburn for ye. And that Night as she was kill'd, I heard him beating her again, and a great many Blows he gave her. She begg'd, For God's Sake! - For Christ Jesus's Sake! and for her poor Children's Sake ! that he would not kill her! and she call'd, Charles ! Charles! Charles! and gave a great Shrick! Then I heard Mrs. Anderson get out of her Bed, throw open her own Window, and cry out, He has thrown his Wife out of Window! I struck a light, and saw it was then about half an Hour after 12. Mr. Anderson and his Wife lodge in the fore Part of the House, and I in the back Part. After the Prisoner was taken by Mr. Betty, the High-Constable, I heard him say, I will not wrong my Conscience, I believe the Blows I gave her, and my threatening to fetch my Cane, was the Cause of her going out of the Window, but I was not in the Chamber at that time. He was before the Justice 8 or 10 Months ago for abusing her, and throwing her upon the Bed, while he had a Knife in his Mouth, and swearing he would rip her up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you hear me in another Room when the Out-cry was of her being thrown out of the Window?</p>
               <p>Fleming . No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you hear the Blows?</p>
               <p>Fleming . Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. And did not they found as if they were struck against a Door to get it open?</p>

We pass'd the Door, for we were going to a House a little beyond, but looking about we thought we were gone too far, and so turning back, I heard the Woman say twice or thrice, For God's Sake, Robin, save my Life! - Don't throw me out o'Window ! - I did not imagine that the Fellow would be such a Villain to do it , for if we had thought he would, I believe we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140009"></xptr> could have catch'd her and broke her fall; but suddenly the Casement burst open, and she came out with her Back foremost, and fell down on the Stones. There was a Candle in the Chamber, and I saw a Man there, near the Window, which I believe was the Prisoner, but I am not sure of it. I was within 8 or 10 Yards of her when she fell, she groaned, but was not able to rise. Presently the Prisoner came down with the Candle in his Hand, went to his Wife, and took her by one Arm to lift her up, but finding her helpless, he said, G - d d - n ye,

Then the Prisoner set down the Candle, took her by both Arms, dragg'd her in, and lock'd the Door. We went and acquainted the Watch with it, but they took no farther Notice than to Laugh at it, and next Morning I heard she was dead.</p>

               <p>Furnell . No; I saw you, or some Man like you, near the Window; and before she came out, I heard a rustling, as if it was in Opposition, and as she came out she gave a terrible shrick.</p>

On the 9th of December, between 12 and 1 in the Morning, I was coming along Ropemaker's-Fields with Mr. Furnell, and just as we turned out of Church-Lane , I heard several Blows, and coming nearer, a Woman's Voice cry'd, For God's Sake, Robin , spare my Life! - Murder! - For God's Sake spare my Life this time.

            . On Wednesday the 8th of December, about 3 in the Afternoon, I saw the Deceas'd, and asked her how she did? O, says she, I shall be murder'd to Night! Why so? says I. Why, says she, the Child has told me that my Husband is gone to eat a Leg o'Mutton and Turnips at Will Perkins's, and there he'll get Drunk, and then come Home and Murder me. He had kept Account of my Reckoning from the 11th of March, but now he has moved it to the 11th of April, and wants me to lay my Child to a Man in the Country; and he said if I would not, he wish'd the Devil might appear to us both in a great Flame of Fire, and carry him away before my Face if he did not Murder me when he came Home at Night. And so she desir'd me to leave my Cellar Door open that she might ran in and hide herself when he came; I told her she should not go in the Cellar, but I would leave my other Doors open, and she should come into my Room and Welcome. And so I did, and I don't know whether or no she was coming to me, but he met her, and she turn'd back, and about Midnight, when he came Home I heard him swear, he'd make her remember leaving the House. He beat her up Stairs, she cry'd out, O, says my Child, that wicked Man is beating his Wife. I heard something fall into the Street, and then his Door was open'd. I ran out, and he was dragging her in. O Mr. Hallam , says I, (clapping my Hands) take pity of her, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140010"></xptr> she's a dead Woman. He made me no Answer. I lean'd over the Bench at his Door to save her, but he pull'd her Legs into the Entry, and then threw her down, and said, Dead or Alive , lie there! and so he shut the Door against me, and bolted it. Many a time have I seen him beat her, and two or three Nights in a Week I have heard her cry out Murder, and have often gone to help her, and got behind him , and held my Arms round his Neck thus - while she has run away for fear of being murder'd.</p>

On Thursday Morning before Eight, the Prisoner call'd me to come to his Wife; I was not quite dress'd, he desir'd me to make haste; he went away, and return'd in 5 or 6 Minutes to hasten me. She had spoke to me the Friday before to be her Midwife, and I knowing her time was out, thought she was in Labour. But as I came along with him, he told me his Wife had met with a sad Misfortune; I ask'd him how? O Mrs. Lane, says he, she got out of a Window while I was in another Room. When I came there, a Neighbour said she was Dead, and so I found her, for her Face, Hands and Feet were quite cold, but her Body was a little warm. - Another Neighbour came in and asked him how she got up Stairs, and he said she walked up. At Night we stripp'd her, and I search'd her Body. There was a great Bruise on her left Arm, and several lesser Bruises on her Back and Sides like Slashes. Her right Hand was cut. The Child was full grown, and black from Head to Foot, especially on the left Side.</p>

            . About a quarter past 12, on Wednesday Night, I happened to be up, and a Neighbour called to me, and said, Hark! there's a crying out, our little Neighbour is in Labour; but presently there was a great Shrick , and Cry of Murder! So I went and sat at Mrs. Mingo's Door, which is almost over against the Prisoner's . The Deceased cry'd, For Christ's Sake , don't murder me! for God's Sake! for my poor Family's sake, spare me! - Charles! Charles! Charles! - G - d d - n you for a Bitch , says the Prisoner, what do ye call Charles for? This was follow'd by 3 or 4 heavy Blows. The Window was forced open, and she came out, and seemed to catch at the Sign-Post in falling, but miss'd it, and came to the Ground. She gave dismal Groans. The Prisoner came out in his Shirt, it was speckled Shirt, and with a Candle in his Hand; and going to lift her up with one Hand, he said, G - d d - n the Bitch, she's drunk, and has thrown her self out at Window . Then he dragg'd her in, shut his Door, went up and shut the Casement, and put out his Candle.</p>

             , Surgeon. The Overseers of the Poor desired me to view the Body of the Deceased. Her Arm was bruised, there were 3 or 4 Marks on it, like the Marks made by a Stick, and there was a Wound in the Palm of her Right Hand, above an Inch long, and a quarter of an Inch deep; it seem'd to be a Stab with a Knife. I did not take notice of the small Bruises. On Saturday, the Coroner order'd me to open the Body. - The Abdomen was full of contused Blood, the Womb was rent 7 Inches, and the Infant, which was dead, but full grown, was forced out of the Womb, all but its Feet. The first thing we saw when the Tegament of the Belly was opened, was the Child's Right Hand; and I believe the Fall was the Cause of her and the Child's immediate Death.</p>

            . About 4 a Clock on Thursday Morning, I was going to wash at a House at Dick's Shore (I am a Washer-woman) and I called at the Prisoner's House for a Pint of Beer; he had got a Pot of Water in his Hand, and he said, Have you heard this unhappy Fate? My Wife has thrown her self out of the Window. I wish you'd carry up this Water, while I draw your Drink. I went up with the Water, and said, How do you do, Mrs. Hallam? How happened this ? Why, says she, I can't tell very well; I unfortunately drop'd my self out of the Window, I feel a Pain in the Bottom of my Belly; but if I should do otherwise than well, there's Anderson and Fleming are so hard-mouth'd, that if my Husband should come to a Tryal, they will swear his Life away; and therefore I beg you would speak in his Behalf, for he is innocent of throwing me out of the Window. The Window has 3 Lights, the Casement is in the middle, it is about a Yard high from the Floor.</p>

            . On Wednesday, about 10 o' Clock, I went to the Prisoner's House, and ask'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140013"></xptr> him to go with me to Cock-Hill, which he did, but missing the Person I wanted, I invited him to dine at my House: We had a Mutton-Pye and a Goose for Dinner, and a Half-crown Bowl of Punch betwixt 8 or 9 of us, and each Man had a Pint of Drink besides, which was all the Liquor that was then drank. Some Men were quarreling at my House, and he parted them - I never knew him quarrelsome - He stayed till past Eleven at Night, and then went away, neither drunk nor sober.</p>

I can call 20 or 30 more to my Character, but I will give the Court no farther Trouble: I had ten Hours Time to make my Escape, which I should have done, If I had been guilty; but I rather chose to stay and take Care of my Children; and I am as innocent of her going out of the Window, as the Child in the Womb.</p>

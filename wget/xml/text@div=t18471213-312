I saw him on Notting-hill—be put down his basket, and went into a stationer's shop—he came out with a sheet of brown paper, went to the Castle public-house, made up a parcel in the brown paper, and went to the receiving-house with it—when he came out I stopped him at the door, and asked where he got the parcel he had left—he said he bought it of his master, Mr. Brewer—I took him to Mr. Brewer—the prisoner kept crying, and said he was very sorry for what he had done; he hoped Mr. Brewer would do nothing to him, as his children would want bread—I found this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at the receiving-house.</p>

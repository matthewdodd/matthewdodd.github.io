                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I accompanied the witness Collier to the house in Compton-street—the prisoner, David Millen, was sitting by the fire, with the child—Collier stated what he came for—David Millen said, "Ah, it has come to this, has it?"—Collier went immediately to the window, and while his attention was drawn to the window, David Millen said to me, "I suspected there was something wrong about this desk"—on a couple of nails over the fire-place was this sounding instru<lb></lb>ment—Collier turned round and made use of some expression—I turned immediately to the window, and Collier then had got the drawer open—he then took out this knife, and both David and Pamela Millen said, "That is the knife the desk was broken open with"—the drawer was then taken out and put on the table—the small book was produced, and on opening it there was the word "Reform," and Collier said, "This is Mr. Queade's property"—Pamela Millen said she did not know or did not recollect it—I cannot say which—Collier then said, "I shall now make a stricter search"—David Millen then took this knife out of his right-hand pocket, and, to the best of my belief, the mull out of his left, on which was written Dr. Queade's name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single. I was in the service of Mr. Taylor—he turned me away yesterday morning—while I was sitting at breakfast he came and asked me to let him look at my subpoena, and he told me to leave his premises in half an hour, and take my things, or he would throw them into the street—I asked him where I was to take them to, as I was to be here at twelve o'clock, and that was half-past eight o'clock—I re<lb></lb>ceived the subpoena at Bow-street, on Friday week—he knew I had got it—he looked at it at Bow-street—I had been in his service one year and nine months—the prisoner Pattison lived as cook in the same service—I was housemaid—Pattison left on the 26th of December—I saw the writing-desk at seven o'clock in the evening of the 17th of January, the day it was lost, in Mr. Queade's sitting-room—Pattison had not been to visit me on the 17th—I was not aware of her being in the house between the 17th and 30th—I was out in the evening of the 17th, and while I was out the desk was gone—the cook is not here—I had leave to go out on the 17th, and I went about a quarter past seven o'clock, and returned at a quarter past ten o'clock—it was on a Wednesday—the last cook left last Friday—Mr. Taylor had her taken to prison.</p>

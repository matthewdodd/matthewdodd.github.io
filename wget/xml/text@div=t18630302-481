                  </hi>. I am a merchant at 52, Marlborough-street, an importer of French goods—two or three days before 28th January two or three persons, of whom the prisoner was one, came and said they wished to have some carriage-clocks—I had not got any then, and they persuaded me to get them for them, which I did, and they said they would come in two days after—on 28th January the prisoner came alone, asked to see the carriage-clocks, and I showed them to him—he selected some, but said he would decide on the matter in a short time, as he expected his two other friends to meet him at my house in a short time—having a cigar in his hand, he said, "Would you have the goodness to give me a light?"—to do that I had to leave him alone in the warehouse while I went to get a light—he was standing before the three clocks—I returned instantly and gave him a light—he laid, "I am going to take a cup of coffee in the neighbourhood; I shall be back in a few minutes, and we will decide the matter"—he lighted his cigar very comfortably, spoke a few words, and then went off—in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour I opened one of the boxes, and missed one of the clocks—they were each in a little box—he did not come back—I gave information to the police about half an hour afterwards—on 20th February I went with a policeman to 36, Percy-street, Tottenham-court-road, and there saw the prisoner—I asked Mr. Walham, who was there, what the prisoner and his two friends were doing there—he said, "They wish to have carriage clocks"—I said, "The same as this fellow robbed me of a month ago"—I gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>into the warehouse, because there is a small passage between—it might be twenty minutes between his first looking at the clocks and my missing one of them—I was in my warehouse and counting-house during that time—nobody else was in the warehouse—the prisoner was a perfect stranger to me.</p>

On 20th February the prosecutor came to the station—when we got to 36, Percy-street, he pointed to the prisoner and said, "That is the man that stole my clock"—the prisoner looked round at him, and said, "I never saw you before; I know nothing about your clock"—he was carrying this bag, with two large pieces of cane in it, which swelled it out to a great size.</p>

I have known the prisoner a good while by coming down to the King William—he repre<lb></lb>sented that he knew the law—I had a young man named Moore in trouble, and the prisoner said he would do all he could for me—I was at Lambeth-street police-office, when Moore was examined—the prisoner came up to a young woman who was with me just outside Lambeth-street office—Moore was at that time in custody—the prisoner spoke to her, and asked me what I was crying about—I said, "About a young man that was in prison"—he asked me what about—I said, "About a watch"—I saw him again after that—we went to a public-house and had some porter—I saw him again on the 8th of October, which was a week afterwards—he asked me to go with him to get the depositions—I paid him on that occasion three shillings—he told me to come up to the Old Bailey with him, as he was going to get two subpoenas—I went home to get some money, and then returned down here—I got some money—he asked me for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get two subpoenas—I gave it him—he went away for seven or eight minutes—he then re<lb></lb>turned and said he could not get it without I gave him another shilling—I gave him the shilling to finish paying for the two subpoenas—he said it was for that purpose—he returned with two long pieces of paper and a piece of parchment—the papers appeared to be new ones—they were quite</p>

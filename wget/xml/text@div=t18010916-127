               <p>Q. Do you know of any cotton that was taken from Messrs. Ives's to Cox's? - A. Yes, in January last.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any transaction in March last? - A. Yes, on the 17th of March, three parcels of cotton were sent to Cox, weighing about four hundred weight and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sent that? - A. Jones and I; Cox told us he could not pay us any money then, he would see us in the evening; and, in the evening, he gave a bill for twenty-nine pounds, odd shillings; Jones kept the bill; the day before it was due, Jones brought it to me to indorse it, as he would get it discounted by the publican, Philp; I indorsed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Cox or Jones upon the subject of that bill? - A. Yes, Cox did not pay it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drew that bill? - A. It was drawn by Jones, and accepted by Cox; it was made payable to me; two days afterwards Cox paid fifteen pounds of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Were you present? - A. No, Cox<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160073"></xptr>told me so, and so did Jones; Cox has paid two pounds since to me at two different times.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What became of the bill? - A. Jones and I made up the money, and he got the bill from Philp.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.How do you know that? - A. Jones told me his aunt got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of it after that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Describe how you got the cotton? - A. The cotton is kept in the warehouse in bags, one upon another; we separated the contents of one bag into two parcels, and sent it to Cox.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was he to give you a pound for it?- A. One shilling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You think there is no great harm in robbing your master? - (No answer.)</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first give the account you have been giving to-day? - A. I cannot answer as to the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any account of it till after your master suspected you of the robbery? - A. No, I conceived I was suspected.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that by giving evidence to-day, you save yourself from being prosecuted? - A. I do not know that the law prevents that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you shall be prosecuted after this?- A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in your master's service now? - A. Yes, and have been ever since.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did you give your account till your master told you, if you did, you should be continued in his service? - A. He never made me any such promise.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that by giving evidence to day, he will continue you in his service? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But you expect to be continued in his service? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you expect to be dismissed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the person that went to Jones, and asked him to take a walk and see Newgate? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not after he was discharged and acquitted at the last Sessions? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not ask Jones to take a walk and see Newgate? - A. No, but he asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. You were to meet Sapwell on the road - were you not? - A. Yes, but that was not a plan of my own.</p>
               <p>Q. And then, when you were taken before the Lord-Mayor, you told this story? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You never had any hope of advantage in giving evidence against these two men? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hope to escape being prosecuted by accusing them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you repeat that no, in the face of the Jury; are you bold enough to repeat it, having once sworn it?- A. I certainly had hope.</p>
               <p>Q.Then what did you mean by swearing that you had no hope - do you not do it for the very purpose of getting your own neck out of the halter? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Cox? - A. I saw him the morning I presented the bill; in the month of March last, Jones applied to me, and asked me to do him the favour to discount him a bill at a short date, drawn by Mr. Cox to Mr. Bircham; I asked him for the bill; he said, he had not got it; he went away, and fetched it; I found it was not indorsed; I desired him to get it indorsed; he brought it back indorsed by Bircham and Jones; I gave him the money for the bill, twenty-nine pounds, nineteen shillings, and six-pence; Jones said, there is a week's score, you may take that out of the bill; he returned again in about half an hour, and said, I had reckoned the money six-pence short, and I gave him six-pennyworth of copper; I did not take a farthing for discount, I think it had two days to run. When it became due, I went to Mr. Cox, in Worcester-place, Thames-street, and presented the note; I saw him, he said he could not take up the note then, but he would take it up in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. He made no objection to the bill then? - A. No; the bill was not taken up, and I employed a notary; I do not recollect his name; he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that bill at last paid? - A. The money was brought me by Jones; I gave the bill to Jones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did Jones tell you he had merely written the bill, or do you recollect that you saw the name of Jones on the bill, as the drawer? - A. I saw the name of Jones at the bottom of the bill.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not say, that that bill was drawn by him as he was directed by Bircham, the superior clerk; and did not he refuse to take from you the money for it till he should speak to Bircham? - A. He did; he said I must speak to Mr. Bircham first.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner was acting under his direction?- A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who was the drawer of the bill? - A. It was drawn from Mr. Cox to Mr. Bircham; I promise to pay, so many days after date, to Mr. Bircham.</p>
               <p>Q. What business had Jones's name at the bottom of it? - A. I do not know.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Of your own knowledge, or do you speak from the information of others? - A. I know by the weights not corresponding.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take stock? - A. Yes, since this happened; we could not take stock before, the warehouses were so full; there were sixteen hundred bags of cotton in the warehouse.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the appearance of those bags which you saw there? - A. I was at the weighing of many of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they the appearance of having been plundered? A. It is very difficult to say.</p>

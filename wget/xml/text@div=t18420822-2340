                  </hi>. I am a perfumer, and live in Titchbourne-street, St. James's—the prisoner was my shopman for about two years. In con<lb></lb>sequence of suspicions I entertained, I had an interview with Vallance, the policeman, on the 12th of August, and soon after the prisoner left the shop, he was brought back in custody—he immediately begged for mercy, for the sake of his wife and family—I replied, that my mercy was only to the innocent men whose characters were brought into suspicion by his conduct—I saw taken from his pockets four packets of soap, and two packets from his hat—I have not the least doubt they are my property—something was then said about some oil of carraway, which induced me to accompany the officer to the prisoner's lodgings, where we found other property.</p>

I put up this soap—I know it by handling so many packages—I counted them before I went to my dinner, and on my return I missed more than these—these correspond in every respect with the soap belonging to Mr. Hendrie, and if opened, you will see a mark inside of "C O" in the corner of the white paper—(<hi rend="italic">one being opened, was so marked</hi>)—there is nothing in the exterior to enable me to identify them, only by handling them and doing them up.</p>

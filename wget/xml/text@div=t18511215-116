                  </hi>. I live at Holly-street, Dalston; I am secretary to the Kingsland Equitable Loan Society. We hold our office in Myrtle-street, Dalston—the prisoner came to the office in May this year for a loan of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a form was handed to him—I do not know whether I was there or not, but I saw him at his house on 23rd May, at 29, Gloucester-street, Cambridge-heath-road—I found him living there by the name of George Blake, that was. the address on the form of application—I took the form with me—I had it in my hand—he did not read the form—I asked him for his receipts for rent and taxes—he produced them—I asked if his name was George Blake, he said, "Yes"—I entered into conversation about his trade, he was a fellowship-porter—I asked him what a fellowship-porter was—he said he was con<lb></lb>cerned at the water-side, and as far as I can recollect, with barges—I asked him to produce his authority for being a fellowship-porter, and he said it was in the City—I had this paper in my hand, and asked him if it was his appli<lb></lb>cation-paper;</p>

               <p>he said, "Yes," and he wanted the money to furnish apart<lb></lb>ments for some of his friends who were coming up from the country to see the Great Exhibition—the name of Bamfield appears on this paper as a secu<lb></lb>rity—I afterwards applied to the address here given as the address of Bam<lb></lb>field—the prisoner and Bamfield attended at the office the same evening, and the note was signed—I think it was on 23rd May I was at his house, and they came to the office in the evening—I saw the prisoner sign this note, and he wrote the address under it—I advanced 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the prisoner on that occasion—the deduction was for the stamp 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the interest of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at five per cent., and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the rules—I advanced the money on the prisoner's representation that he was a fellowship-porter; and also he produced receipts for his rent and taxes—I saw Bamfield sign this other signature (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—"We jointly and severally promise to pay to Mr. Ambrose Stone 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for value received.

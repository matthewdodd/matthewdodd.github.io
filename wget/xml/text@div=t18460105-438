I assisted him in watching the two prisoners—I first saw them in Poland-street—they passed me, and looked across towards me—I saw Thompson at the corner of Portland-street, and he called my attention to the prisoners—they got on to the corner of Oxford-street, and turned—I immediately ran up into Oxford-street and saw Brown standing there—he could see into the shop where Moore was,</p>

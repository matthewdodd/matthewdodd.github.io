                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 78, Chiswell-street. The prisoner has been in my service nearly four years—on the 10th of Aug. he gave me notice to leave my service, for some reason about the housekeeper—I said I would endeavour to make all right, but he insisted on leaving—on the 19th of Aug., in consequence of information, I told him I was fearful matters were not altogether right, and I wished to know whether he had anything belonging to my stock, which he had not accounted for—he said all that he had had he had accounted for to Mr. Norris, my foreman—Mr. Norris was present, and said he had no account of anything that he had had from the stock—I said to the prisoner, "Have you a watch?"—(I saw he had one wearing in his waistcoat—pocket)—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Let me see it"—he produced it, and I recognized it as one taken from my stock—I said, "That watch is a portion of my stock; you had better give it to Mr. Norris"—that was all that transpired with reference to the watch—I asked Norris if he knew anything of the prisoner having the watch—he said no, there was no account of it at all—the prisoner remained perfectly silent—I told him I could not suffer him to be in my house another night, to go home, and return with his father the following morning, and we would examine the various articles in his presence—on the following day he did not come, but his father came two or three times—on the 21st his father came again, but still without the prisoner—I sent Norris to the station, to get an officer, and go to his father's house—they returned that afternoon with the prisoner—I told the prisoner I wished his box to be searched, as there was an officer present, was he agreeable to it?—he said, "Yes"—we went up to his bed-room, where there is a chest of drawers, one or two drawers of which he occupied; and there was a small box in the room be<lb></lb>longing to him—in the box we found a pocket—book, containing some du<lb></lb>plicates and a few odd papers—I saw the pocket-book opened, and saw the duplicates—when goods are redeemed, we are required to indorse the amount of the interest on the duplicates, and I see on these duplicates the amount of the interest is indorsed—when goods are redeemed, it is the duty of the per<lb></lb>son in my employ to deposit the duplicates first in a drawer in the shop—in the evening an account is made up of the business that has been done, which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184609210112"></xptr>
               <p>is done by looking at the amount on the duplicates—one of these duplicate is for a gold guard, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; another, for Wellington boots; and another, for a ring; and here are the corresponding duplicates with them, which denoted the redemption of these things—here is one single duplicate of a shawl, for 5s,—after the accounts are made out, it is the person's duty to mark off the redemption in the book, and to file the duplicates; they are kept in case we want to refer to them, and to show that the articles have been redeemed—neither of these duplicates have been filed—I do not recollect that I said anything to the prisoner about these duplicates When they were found in the pocket—book, and I think he did not make any remark—we then looked amongst his clothes in the drawers—we found a cigar-case and a waistcoat, which were mine—there was another box belonging to him, in another port of the house—I saw that forced open by the policeman, and in it were several books, a sheet, a small case of teeth instruments, a parallel pen, a ruler, and several other articles—he said he placed the sheet there for the purpose of getting it washed; and two of the books he spoke of, as having picked them up in the parlour or counting-house—the value of these things, exclusive of the duplicates, is about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The prisoner had three weeks before his notice would expire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know that a former per<lb></lb>son who had been in my employ had left through not being able to agree with the housekeeper—Mr. Norris was my foreman, and it was customary for per<lb></lb>sons in my employ to have articles from the stock for their own use, with the foreman's permission, and to have the price deducted from their wages, when I settled with them—they have the goods at what we call cost price, from the unredeemed pledges, or any property I have on sale—a young man would have no business to take an article till he had had it of the foreman—if there had been a simple transaction of his taking one, and then saying," Put it down," I would have had no objection—there was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due to the prisoner, I think—I was at Ramsgate five or six weeks this year—I left Mr. Norris in care of my business—he always had the care of it—I do not reside in the house myself—I do not know that Norris went to Gravesend as soon as was gone to Ramsgate—when I first charged the prisoner, he said, "All I owe for, Mr. Norris knows of," or words conveying that sense—while he was in my service, he used to go home to his father's, as I supposed—he used to go home every other Sunday, and he could go at other times if he wished—when the persons bring back the duplicates, we make a mark in the book, to show that the articles have been redeemed—that is done before they are filed—I knew these articles belonged to my sale—stock, by marks which are on them—on this watch here are two scratched marks of my own—I knew it to be the property of my stock—here are marks on the other articles.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to the prosecutor—in consequence of some suspicion I entertained, I made a communication to Mr. Sowerby on Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening, the 19th of Aug.—I was present when he asked the prison if he had had anything from the stock that he did not know of—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "No, I have not"—I heard him asked if he had a watch in his pocket—he said, "Yes," and produced it—Mr. Sowerby asked me if I was conscious of his having it—the prisoner said no, I was not—I was not con<lb></lb>scious of it at all—Mr. Sowerby told him to give up the watch to me, and he did so—Mr. Sowerby then desired him to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> home, and come the next day with his father—his father came the next day, and on the third day, and Mr. Sowerby desired me to accompany an officer to his house—I went there and</p>

               <p>saw the prisoner brought out of the water—closet by the officer—he said, "Don't take me or, "Oh, save me, Turpin!"—he was brought to his master's house, and the drawers and bed-room were examined the books and the sheet were all the prisoner told me of—he said the books fell in the counting—house, and he picked them up—I saw the other things found.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you came back drunk, did he tell you he should feel it his duty to tell Mr. Sowerby, if ever such a thing occurred again <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I deny that, or that I told him that if ever he did anything of the sort, I would put him to rights, or anything to that effect—I never had any quarrel with him about the alternate Sundays—I asked it as a favour, but had no quarrel, it did not last two minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner took it?</p>
               <p>Leader. Yes; between six and seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to Mr. Burt's, he called for a pint of beer, and enquired for one of the lodgers. I drawed him the beer and he sat down, and stayed some time; soon after this a gentleman's servant came in with a bundle of linen.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the last witness?</p>
               <p>Leader. Yes; he called for a pint of beer, and laid the bundle down on the table; he went to the door and took a coach; somebody called to my master, and asked whether he had put the bundle by?</p>
               <p>Q. Who called to your master?</p>
               <p>Leader. My fellow servant; he said, no, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090028"></xptr> had not, and sent me after the man to see to take him.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know the man took it?</p>
               <p>Leader. Because the man was missing, and there was nobody in the house but him; I went after him, and catched him at Green's, the Three Tuns.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go into the Three Tuns?</p>
               <p>Leader. Because the prisoner had bid me to tell one of our lodgers to come there to him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he tell you that?</p>
               <p>Leader. Before this man came; the lodger was an old clothes man; I was to tell him to come there at breakfast time, and bring the hats with him. On going in, there I found him; he asked what I wanted; I told him I wanted him, and told Mr. Green to keep him there till I fetched my master; he sat by the bundle, and had his arms on the table; my master took it away from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when he took it?</p>
               <p>Leader. My master took the bundle and gave it to this man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man say it was his?</p>
               <p>Leader. No; he asked my master to drink; he said he would not.</p>

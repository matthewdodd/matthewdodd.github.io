             sworn. - I work at Mrs. Rixson's; she takes in washing: On the third of August I was there to assist her in ironing; about ten o'clock the prisoner came to Mrs. Rixson's and said he was going to Somers Town to receive some money; Mrs. Rixson gave him some bread and butter, and I gave him part of a pot of porter; he went away; he did not return till five o'clock in the afternoon, and then he brought a woman with him, and he asked Mrs. Rixson to let her sit down. After they had sat awhile, the woman sent for a pot of porter, and then they had half a pint of gin; the prisoner asked Mrs. Rixson to give his friend a cup of tea; and when we were sitting down at tea, the prisoner went out, and did not return till after tea; Mrs. Rixson went into the wash-house, and I went up to my ironing again; I heard the prisoner come in; I went down stairs, and there was some argument arose between him and the woman, about some money, and the woman and he left the house; in about half an hour after they were gone, Mrs. Rixson missed some silk stockings; she said some of the women had got them; the women were all very ready to strip; I said to Mr. Rixson, I would go to the prisoner at the bar, to know where that woman lives that came in with him. I went to the prisoner to know where this woman lived; I laid hold of his coat, seeing the stocking hang out of his pocket; I told him they were the property that I wanted; the prisoner lived as far as Tothil-street; he said the woman lived over the way; we walked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180093"></xptr>back together as far as the Infirmary, then he struck me; I was going to carry the four stockings I had taken out of his pocket to Mr. Rixson's, when he drew out another stocking and a glove from his small-cloaths, I believe.</p>

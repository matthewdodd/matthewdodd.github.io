I was opposite Richardson's show; all at once, there was a great bustle, and I felt something pulling from my side - I turned, and saw a short man in a great coat, cutting the bottom part of my pocket off, with a knife or a pair of scissars. I said, "You have got my pocket and my little property;" he said,"No, I have not indeed;" he turned to get away from me, as I had got hold of him, and gave the pocket to the prisoner. I saw him take it from his hands - I called, and the officer came up and took him. I can swear positively the prisoner was close to me, when the other cut my pocket and took it from him. I did not hear any conversation between them; I saw it in the prisoner's hands.</p>

            . I am a book-binder. I was standing close to Richardson's show - the prisoner and a number of others made a rush - I saw them about this woman's clothes, and one man took something of a light colour from her person, which he gave to the prisoner - the woman said, "That man has got my pocket;" I said, "The other man (meaning the prisoner) has got it." I saw him drop it at his feet, and the prosecutrix took it up.</p>

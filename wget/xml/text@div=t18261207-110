            . I live at Barnsbury-place, Islington, and am a watchman. On the 8th of November I stopped the prisoner at the top of Barnsbury-place, with two doors, the board of a bench, and a bench-screw; I asked where he was going to take them - he said he was going to take the doors to Mr. Bright, and the other things to his father- I said he had no business to bring them, as they belonged to Mr. Payne; he said it was all right, and Mrs. Taylor knew the same; I said, "If you like to go back to the building, I will go with you;" I went back, and saw Mrs. Taylor - she said the board and screw belonged to his father, and he had borrowed a hammer of her to knock the board off with, but she knew nothing of the doors.</p>

The prisoner had worked in this house a month before; he came on the 8th of November, and asked me to give him a light, to go and take the screw out of the bench, which his father had sent him for, and the board; I gave him the light, and went into my own house, No. 3; while I was there he went out with the property - I had not seen the doors.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of George Eates, and live in Garden-walk, Rosomon-street, in the parish of St. James's, Clerkenwell. On Tuesday, the 29th of September, he gave me five sovereigns to pay our quarter's rent—I placed them in a drawer, and afterwards removed them to a trunk, expecting the landlord to come every day—on the 4th of October, I put them on the dresser, behind a large dish, in a piece of brown paper—my mother was present when I put them up—I missed them on Thursday, the 8th—the prisoner was washing in the house at the time I missed them—she was in the wash-house, near the room—she came to assist my mo<lb></lb>ther, who is a laundress—the prisoner remained there on the 8th, and worked there the next day—she had no occasion to come on the Saturday, and did not come back—I met her in Rosomon-street with a constable, as I was going to her lodging—she was coming to our house—I said, "Ann, you are guilty"—she said, "Guilty of what?"—I said, "Stealing the money "—I did not tell her what money—I said, "Ann, you are the guilty person; you had better tell me if you have got it or not "—I knew she had got it—I thought of getting it back.</p>

I was at the station-house when the last witness came, and I went to Rososmon-street, and took the prisoner into custody—I took her to the station-house—I said nothing to her—I went with her to No. 1, Jerusalem-court, St. John's-square—I there saw four sovereigns in a small box, put into a larger box—the prisoner showed it to me herself, in a paper, which I produce—she said it was her lodging—she put her fingers into the small box, and said, "There it is, policeman," and produced the four sovereigns and paper—I did not hear any promise or threat used to her in my presence, to my recollection—she said at the station-house, if we would let her go she would give up the money—three shillings and twopence was produced from her person when she was searched.</p>

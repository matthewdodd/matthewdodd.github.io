                  </hi>. I live in Queen-streeet, Hoxton, and am an account<lb></lb>ant; my wife takes in needle-work. I was at home about three weeks ago, when the prisoner came in to buy a toy—she asked my wife if she could make her some caps—my wife undertook to make them—in a day or two the prisoner came and asked leave to bring a few things there, which her boxes would not hold, as she was a servant about to leave her place—on the 17th of January, when I came home, I found three or four bundles—one contained these three handkerchiefs, another these five yards of ribbon, and this shawl—I took the same things to Mr. Rogers's shop.</p>

               <p>GEORGE GOUGH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am the servant of Mr. Thomas Willan; the owners of the horses are Thomas Willan, John Willan, and William Smith; Barney and Lediard were employed under me: On the 4th of May I found the prisoner holding a horse, while Lediard was cutting the hair off; I asked what they did it for, and they said, to make a fishing-line; I found eight horses served in the same way; I found a quantity of horse-hair upon Lediard, between his shirt and his skin, (produces it); there is better than a pound and a half of it; it is worth a shilling a pound; every one of the horses was disfigured a good deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it lowered the value of the horses very much? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had no concern in pulling it off, I only looked on; the horse had got a very thick mane, and he cut a little off, and took a few hairs out of the tail; it is very common in my country; I did not know any harm.</p>

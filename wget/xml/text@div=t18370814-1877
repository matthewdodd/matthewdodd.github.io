                  </hi>. I am a hosier—my shop is in Oxford-street, at the corner of Cavendish-street. The prisoner had been my porter for about three weeks—on the 28th of July I found seven handkerchiefs in the area under the shop-floor, concealed between the flooring and the rafters I went through the kitchen to get there—I had missed them—I took them from the place, and charged the prisoner with having taken them—he said he took them, and wanted one for his own use, that he took them down stairs to see how they would look on, and seeing we were looking for them, he was alarmed, and hid them—they are my property, and are worth about 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—one would have been worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

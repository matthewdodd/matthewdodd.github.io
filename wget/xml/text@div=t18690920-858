I am the wife of John Buckner, and keep a sea-man's lodging-house, at 6, Ship Alley, Wellclose Square—the prisoner Franini lodged at my house prior to the 3rd August—I knew Pignatilli—he told me he was a shipping master—on 3rd August, he came to me and said, "Have you got any men who want to go on board of a ship?"—I told him I had six or seven in the house, and I mentioned Franini—he took Franini out, and afterwards brought him back, and Pignatilli said, "I have shipped your man"—he handed me this advance note for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoners both understand English—Pignatilli said, "I expect 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from you, for shipping him—he said it was a foreign ship—I asked him when it was going out, and he said, "The day after to-morrow"—I said, "I suppose it is all right"—he said, "Yes," and I gave him the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave Franini 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of</p>

Phillips and Tempory, the owners, whose names appeared on the advance note, but could not find any such persons at the address given—I did not know Franini's name while he was staying at my house—I heard it afterwards—he said his name was Alexander Herbert, when he was shipped—I had seen Pignatilli before this, passing my door, but I had no business transactions with him—I have not inquired whether he was a shipping master.</p>

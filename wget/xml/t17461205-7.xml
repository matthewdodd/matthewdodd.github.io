               <p>The Prosecutor being a Foreigner, his Evidence was given by an Interpreter.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask Walthogen what he has to say against the two Prisoners at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. He says he saw them before they robbed him, but he has got his Things again.</p>
               <p>Q. In what Manner did they rob him?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. She took the Watch out of his Pocket, the tallest of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did one of them rob him of both Watch and Hanger?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. The tallest robbed him first of the Watch, and the other of the Hanger.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him, if he knew when they did it, and whether he saw them do it?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. Yes, my Lord, he did see it when she first took it out of his Pocket. Then she played<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174612050009"></xptr> with it, then went down Stairs; then the other came up Stairs, and took the Hanger from him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he in Company with them?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. They pick'd him up, and carried him to their Lodgings, then shut the Door upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them pick'd him up?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. The tallest pick'd him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him how he came by his Things again?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. He went down Stairs, then they denied i t; then they throwed him down upon the Floor; then he insisted upon having his Things again; then there came a Matter of four of them, and opened the Door; then they offered him the Hanger, but he would not take the Hanger without the Watch.</p>
               <p>Court. I hope he will keep better Company.</p>
               <p>To the Prisoner. Would you have him asked any Questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would have him asked, whether he knew that I took it, for I was a Bed and asleep.</p>

             brought me this Watch; they desired to have a Guinea upon it. I asked her whose it was, she said she would not discover her Friend. Buckley said she would fetch the Man that owned it, when I would not lend her any Thing upon it without; she at first brought in a tall Irishman, to whom she said it belonged. Then she told me it was an Ambassador's Cook in Suffolk-street : But both were cut in their Description of it, both as to the No and Maker thereof.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you ask this Witness any Questions? he swears that both of you came together to pawn this Watch. He asked you whose Watch it was, and you told him you would not discover your Friend; whereupon he refused to lend Money upon it, nor would not part with it without knowing the Owner. What have you to say for yourself?</p>
               <p>Buckley. He gave me the Watch to keep for a Crown, till he came the next Morning, but I never saw any Thing of his Hanger.</p>

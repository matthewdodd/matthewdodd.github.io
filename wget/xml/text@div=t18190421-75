I locked it again, and hung the key up, behind the counter. My father came home in about half an hour - my mother serves in the shop. I had been out of the shop, leaving her there - nobody but us was in the shop until my father came home. I then told him what had happened, saw him open the till, and take out the note, and write Mrs. Crampton on it - (looks at it) - this is it. It has Mrs. Crampton on it in his hand-writing.</p>

               <p>"The prisoner, T. Bradbury, voluntarily says, I live at No. 2, Bagnio-court, Shoe-lane, Holborn, and keep a horse, which I let out to hire. Having accumulated 4 l. in silver for the use of my horse, on a Sunday evening, about five weeks ago I went to Mr. Phillips, Coach and Horses, Warner-street, Clerkenwell, and asked him to give me four 1 l. notes for it, which he did;

About a week ago I paid one to Phillips, and on Tuesday last I paid another to How, but I gave my address, Shoe-lane, No, 2, Bagnio-court to the young man in the shop; the same young man gave me the change, and delivered me the hay - I never paid

            . I am landlord of the Coach and Horses, public-house, Ray-street, Clerkenwell. I had known the prisoner a fortnight before he changed the notes. On Sunday, I believe it was the 17th of January, he brought 4 l. in silver, and asked me to give him notes for it? I accordingly gave him four 1 l. bank notes for it - I always write the person's name that I receive notes of on them - it is my invariable custom. The notes I paid him must have had my writing on them of the names of persons I received them of - I always indorse them myself. I paid him the four notes myself - (examining those produced) - neither of these, I am certain, have ever<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210041"></xptr>been through my hands, nor did I ever pay any of them to him - I always look at them when I pay them away, to see they are indorsed. When I am absent my people tell me who they take them of, and I indorse them myself.</p>

            . I am an inspector of bank notes - (examining the note in the indictment) - it is forged in every respect, and is not Draper's writing; paper and every thing else are forged; the other two are also forged in every respect. All these appear to be the same paper, and off the same plate. One is signed Draper, and another Hogsflesh, they are not like their signatures; all three appear to be written by the same hand - there is an appearance of a water-mark, which is put on afterwards.</p>

I lost the linen in question on Saturday, the 2nd of March; I had put it on the foot of the stairs in a basket, with a large basket over it; it was linen which I had taken in to wash. I always leave the street door open in the day-time. I was folding shirts not a yard and a half from where the basket was, but in a room, and the door prevented me from seeing any one take the clothes. In about half an hour after I put the basket there, while I was folding the shirts, I heard a small creak of a basket; I opened the door, and saw the empty basket laying on the ground, and the full one was gone. I looked out at the street door, towards Hoxton-square; there were three persons and myself. I went a little further, and saw the prisoner against a chandler's shop, on the other side of the road, in the maket place; he had the basket with him; it was about five or ten minutes before twelve; I hallooed out; but I can't say whether stop thief or not, and he locked over his right shoulder, and seeing me, he went three or four steps further, and dropped the basket. I pursued him, and called out stop thief. I saw somebody lay hold of him, a young man named

            ; he got from me ever so far; but I saw him taken, and went on until he was. I am sure the prisoner is the man who had the basket, and who was secured. He was brought to my house, and the linen was brought back also; it was the linen stated in the indictment; part of it is here; I examined it at Worship-street, and it was the same.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I knew nothing of the prisoner before, nor did I see him go out of my house; I never lost sight of the prisoner at all. Four sheets are the only part of the linen that is here; my husband pays the rent and taxes of the house in which the linen was stolen.</p>

               <p>EDWARD HARDY. I live about four yards from the prosecutor's house. I was at my own door, and heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner with a basket before him, coming towards me. Directly he saw me, he threw down the basket, and shewed fight, and knocked me down. I got hold of the tail of his coat as I lay, and he ran away, dragging me after him; I never left go of his coat.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it; I heard a cry of stop thief, and the lad stopped me, and I know nothing of it.</p>

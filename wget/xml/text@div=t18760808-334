                  </hi>. I live at 1, Glasshouse Street, and the prisoner lived in the same house, the bottom room and the middle room—she is a widow—on the 12th July, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing by her door, where she was standing, and she said "Joe, you stand me a pot of beer"—there were two other women there, one sitting down and the other on the bed asleep—I said "I can't afford it," and she said, as I was going upstairs, "You old b——r," and she knocks me down and knocked me silly—she had a glass in her hand—I ran to get a policeman and gave her</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman N</hi> 472). I was called by the last witness to the prisoner's house; he was bleeding very much from the lip, nose, top of the head, and back of the neck from the cuts—I told the prisoner I should take her into custody for assaulting Purcell—she said "You s——you want to lock me up"—she made a blow with a sack needle in her hand—she was sober—I had to get the assistance of another constable—she was very violent and had to be thrown down—going to the station she said "He has been provoking me all the morning, I did do it"—there was blood on the doorstep inside the passage and on the pavement—I found this salt cellar, broken as it is now, inside her room door, and after I took her to the station I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was blood on the salt-cellar and hair; I could not see whether it was blood on the knife, but there is some stain on it—Purcell was sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and lived at 2, Spital Square, at the time of this occurrence—I went to the prosecutor at the Leman Street police-station and examined his wounds—there was a very deep wound on the upper lip, from one side of the mouth to the other, and several smaller wounds on the scalp—the wound on the lip extended into the nose, it was partly incised and partly lacerated; I should say it was done by a sharp instrument, a blunt knife would cause it—the wounds on the scalp were more likely to be produced by the salt-cellar.</p>

He burst in my door, and I said 'Go out.' He said 'I will burst you in with a kick before I go out.' He had been bleeding from the nose at that time.

All the morning he had been knocking and beating his wife about, and he was bleeding from the nose at the time he came into my room. He broke the spring lock in and I put my hand out, and he up with his boot and there is the print of the nails of the boot all over my arm. I received the two kicks on my arm.

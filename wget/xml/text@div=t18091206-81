On the seventh of December, in the morning, I saw the prisoner leaving the harness room with his hands behind him, under his coat. I called to him, to know what he had got under his coat; he said, nothing, and ran as fast as he could. I called stop; I was near to him, and he was stopped; I went and took hold of his collar; he said, he had got nothing that belonged to me; he opened his clothes immediately, and a young man picked up the bridles and gave them to me; I did not see him drop them; I knew the bridles to be my property.</p>

            , 25, Brook-street. On the seventh of December, I was going through Bleeding-heart yard, I heard Mr. Butler, cry, stop that man; the prisoner was the man; and when Mr. Butler collared the prisoner, I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060041"></xptr>take the bridles from his coat and throw them against the door; I picked them up and gave them to Mr. Butler.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was truly unfortunate to come through that place, it being a thoroughfare; I did go to the harness room and holloaed out Thomas, to the ostler. I might be running, as I generally do in my travels; I told him I had nothing, and unbuttoned my coat to shew him. I hope my lord you will not think there is the least shadow of my guilt in that boy's evidence. I have been an unfortunate man through life.</p>

               <p>Q. You keep the whole house. - A. Yes. The two prisoners came to lodge with me the Friday before Christmas day, they had the back one pair of stairs room at five shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Q. They rented it jointly, did they. - A. Yes, and they had all the articles mentioned in the indictment in the room for their use; Miss Stears never went out of the room but once, till they left the lodgings, after staying five weeks. I think it was the 26th of January, when they went way.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they paid you any rent while they were there. - A. No, not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Jenkins use to go out frequently. - A. Yes, half a dozen times of a day. They went away in the morning before I was up, they never gave me any warning.</p>
               <p>Q. After they left the lodgings, did you go into the lodgings. - A. No, not till the Thursday following, when the week was up, then I sent for a smith, and had the door opened, then I observed all the things in the indictment gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found these things since. - A. No, nor never heard of them.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's niece. I was there two or three days before they left the room.</p>
               <p>Q. The account that your aunt has given is true. - A. Yes. I was at a house in Tottenham Court road, I saw Jenkins go by, that was a week afterwards, I followed her, she asked me what I followed her for; I told her for stealing the things, she told me if I would go back and not follow her, she would return them in a few days, I followed her as far as Covent Garden church yard, there she sat down for about an hour, and then she got into a coach.</p>
               <p>Jenkins's Defence. I can only say that Miss Stears through ill health knew nothing of the transaction between me and Mrs. Tod. I wrote a note to Mrs. Tod, that she should hear from us in a day or two. I believe it is for owing her the money that she has done this; could we take all these things away, as she opened the door for us; there are other lodgers in the house, there is other keys that opens the door, and there is a large yard that any body could easily get in.</p>

               <p>Stears's Defence. It is a very unjust thing laid to our charge. I acknowledge that I do owe rent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a rag-merchant, residing at Tottenham—on 27th March last, Tuesday, I was at the White Horse public-house—I don't know the time exactly—it was evening—it might be 7 or 8 o'clock—I had offered man some money for a donkey—I offered several different prices—I went up to a sovereign—the prisoner was present—he stood just by me, and he said, "Shew him the money, <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi>, and theu he will take it"—I pulled out a sovereign and two halves—I was going to show the man the money, and the prisoner grabbed his hand over mine and took the two half-sovereigns—the sovereign I stuck to—I tried to hold my money, but could not—I asked him several times to give me the money, and he seemed to laugh at me—I knew what I was doing—I had not touched any beer till quite the afternoon—I took a little between 3 and 4 o'clock—I was not drunk—the prisoner is the man.</p>

On 27th March, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was passing the White Horse public-house—I was called, by the last witness, to take the prisoner into custody—I found him in the tap-room, with about thirty or forty bad characters in the room—I knew nearly all of them, both by name and character—the house has been licensed many years before I was there—I told the prisoner the charge—he said, "I never had the money"—I asked the witness, in the presence of the prisoner, what money he had had in his purse—he said, "One sovereign, two half-sovereigns, and somesilver"—he showed me his purse, which then contained one sovereign, one half-sovereign, and some silver,—I searched the prisoner after I got him in custody, but only found some silver on him—as I was coming from the magistrate's, after the prisoner had been remanded, he said "I suppose this will be six months for me."</p>

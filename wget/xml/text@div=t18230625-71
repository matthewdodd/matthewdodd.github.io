On the 21st of May, about one o'clock in the day, I went to my shop window, and on endeavouring to take out a tray, found it would not move from its place, but on moving it about, we got it out, and found the print of a large instrument sticking to it; my young man took it out, and on examination I found some one must have put his arm through the iron bar, and had bored a hole of an inch diameter close to where my valuable property was. I went to the watch-house, and at the hour of setting the watch, I questioned them all, and gave them directions; I told Willsher to watch my premises, and if he saw any suspicious characters to take them into custody. My dwelling house is in St. Mary, Colechurch, and in the ward of Queenhithe.</p>

            . I am watchman of Cheap ward. On the evening of the 21st of May I saw Mr. Brook; I had seen the prisoner several times before that; the first time was on Monday morning, the 19th, shortly after midnight, on the north side of the Poultry, going towards the Mansion House; he passed me; I looked at him, seeing him lurking about; I stood still, and saw him turning round to observe me, and on going round my beat again he met and passed me, and went back towards Bow church. I lost him, and in the course of the night he passed me again, and went towards the Mansion House, and crossed over to Mr. Brook's side of the way, and on coming to the top of my beat I met my father; he passed Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250034"></xptr>Brook's house, and went round by the side of a board; my father afterwards watched him. I saw him three times in the course of that night in the Poultry, and saw him again on the Wednesday morning between twelve and two o'clock, as I was coming up the Poultry, round Mr. Deputy Brook's house, I saw him there, and am quite sure of his person - there is a strong gas-light there. At ten o'clock on Wednesday night Mr. Brook gave me directions to watch his house, and nearly at one o'clock he passed me; I ran and told my father, and we followed him up Cheapside and took him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner several times, first on Monday morning, the 19th, three or four times, from twelve to two o'clock, loitering about the Poultry, Old Jewry, and Cheapside, and saw him pass Mr. Deputy Brook's house. I saw him on Wednesday morning, near one o'clock, pass the end of the Poultry, just by Mr. Deputy Brook's, and I saw him again next night, about half-past twelve o'clock, passing along Cheapside, and took him, and saw the officer find a handle of an instrument, a clasp knife, and a bent nail on him.</p>

I searched him, and found the handle of an instrument on him, a crooked nail, and a knife. The handle fits the part of the instrument found in Mr. Brook's window.</p>

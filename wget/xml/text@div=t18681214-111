                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 863). On 25th November, about 10.40, p.m., I was with Jenkinson in Bishopsgate Street, and saw the prisoners walking together—Butler was carrying a bundle over his shoulder—he turned and saw us following him—Clark ran away—I stopped Butler and said I was a police officer, and wanted to know what he had got in that bundle—he said he did not know—I said, "You must know"—he said, "Well I think it is cloth"—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he said, "That man gave it to me," meaning Clark—I said "I must take you to the station"—he then kicked my ankles and I fell, but did not lose my hold of him—Jenkinson then came back, and we conveyed him to the station—I found in the bundle fifteen yards and a half of cloth winsey for dresses—the prisoners refused their addresses.</p>

I was with Legg; I followed Clark—he ran into Skinner Street—I caught him, he said, "What are you running after me for, I have got nothing"—I said, "What made you run, then?—he said, "I was not running out of your way"—I took him back to Legg,</p>

               <p>and conveyed them both to the station—on the way Clark said, "I have got a bit under here," pointing to his waistcoat—I looked and found fifteen yards of linsey under his trousers, of the same kind as that in the bundle—Clark said that he and Butler were standing together in Bishopsgate Street, in the morning, and a gentleman traveller asked them to carry his parcels, that they went to the West End, and came back to the Elephant and Castle, and the traveller went into a shop for about an hour, and they lost sight of him.</p>

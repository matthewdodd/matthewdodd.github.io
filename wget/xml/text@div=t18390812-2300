                  </hi>. I live in Field-lane, Holborn. On the 13th of August, I was in a public-house in Farringdon-street, between three and four o'clock in the morning—I had been out to supper—the prisoner came and asked me to treat her—I gave her some money to treat herself, and she gave me a glass of something—I do not know what it was, but when I took a mouthful of it, I was directly seized with stupor—I came to my<lb></lb>self in about an hour—I think it was after five o'clock, I found myself in the doorway of a house in Field-lane—somebody must have taken me there while I was insensible—my shawl was gone, and I missed two half-crowns and some halfpence—I met the prisoner in Farringdon-street the following morning, with my shawl on her shoulder—I asked her to give it to me, and said, if she did so without any words, I would say nothing; but if not, I would give her in charge—the landlord took her by the arm to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> her out of the house—I was by her, and she struck me violently on the face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She was drinking with a man at Gurney's—she had gin and peppermint, and gave me a glass—she came out and asked a woman to buy her shawl for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and my own shawl for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She did not—I found her shawl on me in the passage—I was as sober as I could be when I went into the house—there was no man in my company—there was a man there.</p>

                  </hi>.(<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 411.) I produce the shawl which I took from the prisoner's shoulders—it is a new one—the prosecutrix had this one on which is said to be the prisoner's—it is very old—one is worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other about 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> It is not likely I should wear the shawl for any body to see it, if I had stolen it—I was very tipsy—I left the prosecutrix and the man in the house together.</p>

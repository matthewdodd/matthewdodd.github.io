            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 28th of July, two women came; the prisoner was one of them. I was induced to look at the pantaloons by one of the women saying, they were well washed. The prisoner appeared to be the owner of them. They were pledged in the name of

               <p>EDWARD FOX. I am a porter. I live in Ham-yard, Great Windmill-street. On the 28th of July, near two o'clock, the prisoner came to my apartment; she had something in her lap. I went down stairs, and came up again. I saw a pair of pantaloons at the fire. I asked whose pantaloons they were. The prisoner said they belonged to William; the man that she was in the habit of being with. They were the same colour as these. They appeared to be wet.</p>

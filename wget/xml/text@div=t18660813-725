                  </hi>. I am a clothes salesman, and live at 45, Prince's Road, Notting Hill—on Monday night, 2nd July, about half-past nine, I locked up my shop—all my premises were then secure—the shop was full of clothes—I returned about half-past eleven to twelve on the same night—I found the candle that I had placed on the counter, moved, and a ticket was on the counter that had been on a coat—the coat was missing—I am quite certain it was there when I went out—I found a shelf on which some clothes were kept was empty, and the clothes gone—an entrance had been effected from the back window—that was fastened with a catch—some flowers on the ledge had been lifted down, and the catch forced backwards—the lock upon the door leading to the room had been forced back—the door was open—it was shut when I went away—I found a screwdriver in the shop—the constable compared it with the marks on the door—the prisoner lodged in the kitchen under my shop—he had done so about two months—I didn't see him on the night of the robbery, but I know he left the premises on the Monday morning—I heard him come upstairs and go out—I lost eight coats and some trousers—they have not been found.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman 10 X). On 3rd July I went to the prose-cutor's house, in consequence of information—I found that the window leading from the back yard had been forced open by the catch being forced back, and the door leading from the back parlour to the shop had been forced by something being put in, and the lock forced back—he gave me this screwdriver and told me he found it in his shop—the mark on the side of the door where the lock was forced back exactly corresponds with the small end of this—I think part of the socket was broken off and that made a dent in the ironwork—I went in search of the prisoner—I apprehended him in some waste fields at Hammersmith—I told him I wanted him for committing a burglary in Prince's Road, Notting Hill—he said, "I know nothing about it; it's no use asking me any questions, for I know nothing."</p>

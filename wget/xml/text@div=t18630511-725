Brandice &amp; Co., 6, Bread Street, London"—these were marked "B &amp; D," and there was a number on each case—I last saw Raudnitz in Paris at the end of November, he was staying there from eight to ten days with Brandice—I was not aware that Brandice &amp; Co. were in difficulties—Raudnitz left Paris at the same time as his partner—Raudnitz said that they were going together to London to meet their bills that fell due on 30th November—they were both together when they told me that—they owed me 17,000f. at that time, and do so still—I came to England to the Exhibition in August—I went to their place of business every day—I was eight or ten days in London—Raudnitz told me that he wanted the goods for their own business, for orders which he had to execute, and he never asked except he had orders—I believe these two letters in German (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be in Brandice's writing—they are dated 13th and 14th August, and this other also.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 37, Culford-road North, Kingsland, and am a commission agent—I was engaged by Brandice in January, 1862; he had an office in Earl-street, but we moved to Bread-street, in April or May, 1862—Brandice entered into partnership about the end of February, I think—goods arrived from Paris in September, October, and November, in that year—the first entry in this delivery-book is in my writing—this entry is in the writing of a clerk named Guttman—I know his writing perfectly—I only signed for goods which corresponded in the mark, the number, and the quantity—I saw the invoice prices of some of the goods, and some I did not—none of the goods so received were ever shipped—the invoices came by poet, and we have got invoices giving us an account of the prices—some<lb></lb>where about 20th September, I deposited nearly fifty pieces of handkerchief for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with Mr. Attenborough, of 11, Greek street, Soho, and on 20th October, 308 scarf-shawls, for 133<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I made those pawnings by order of the principal partner, Brandice, and paid the money raised to whoever was present, but mostly to Brandice—he was in Paris, but I used to pay it into the bank sometimes—I received no tickets—I remember a warrant for ninety dozen of champagne, which I got 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for, and on 28th November ten pieces of silk for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—all the articles which came from Paris were deposited at Attenborough's—I know a person named Benedict Goodman—he was a commission-agent when I first knew him—he afterwards took a place of business in Budge-row—I sold him some goods by Brandice's desire in October and November, and when Brandice was not present, he wrote to me—the prisoner afterwards knew what I had done—I was obliged to tell him that I had received orders from Brandice to sell goods, and he said, "I shall write to Paris and ask Brandice at what price to sell them"—the goods were sometimes sold a few days after they arrived—the sales to Goodman were, I think, entered in the books—I don't know whether the sales to Attenborough were, because I was not book-keeper—I do not think the prisoner ever looked at the books—here are three receipts in my writing (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and three in the prisoner's—during September, October, and November, the firm was in difficulties every pay-day—I pawned goods for Brandice before he was in partnership, and I began pawning for the firm as early as March, but the goods were redeemed—I pawned for them at Attenborough's in March, 1862—I pawned these articles (<hi rend="italic">Looking a ticket for silk for</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) with a man named Harrison—this represents goods which came from France—there are other people to whom goods were sold—I never obtained the invoice price in any one of these transactions—I pledged silk and French merino below cost price—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in Raudnitz's writing—this day<lb></lb>book contains an entry of the invoices—there was no separate invoice-book, but the invoices were entered in the day-book—a clerk kept it—it was kept in the office open on the counter—I do not see any of Raudnitz's writing in it—this item of "Savoy" is Joe Guttman's writing—I did not file the invoices, but they were put together in a pigeon-hole—two clerks made these entries, and I understand they are gone abroad—some of the writing in the bill-book is the prisoner's, and some mine.</p>

Mount Brothers, of London—the bankrupt made the entries which you see before you—I cannot say anything about them—I put the book before him, and said, "Tell me what you have done with the goods on the right-hand side?" and he returned me the book some time afterwards with the right side filled up—you will not find the same sort of thing on the left as on the right; they are not intended to be exactly opposite the same goods—my entries on the right side represent purchases by them, and it is intended that the bank<lb></lb>rupt's writing on the other side should represent the same goods—I find here 2,200 pairs of boots sold in one lot; they might come in five or six lots on the other side—I do not recollect when he gave me this book filled up, or how long he had it—I had permission to have all the papers, and I went and asked for a book sometimes—I cannot at this distance of time remember where the information came from—I saw the bankrupt twelve or fourteen times—he was not examined before the Court of Bankruptcy, at far as I know, not after I knew anything about it—the 16th February was appointed for his last examination; he was taken in custody before that—I had been busy at the accounts from the time I was employed till he was taken, and that put a stop to the making up the accounts—in the supple<lb></lb>mental ledger, folio 6, I find, Mr. Dison, 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this "October 23d, union flannel" was in this book when I first saw it—this "G.

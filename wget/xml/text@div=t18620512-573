                  </hi>. I am one of the officers of her Majesty's Court of Probate—I was present at the trial of the cause of Wheddon against Wheddon and Smith, on 14th and 15th March last, at the Court of Divorce, Westminster—the prisoner was examined on 14th March, on behalf of the petitioner—before he was examined I administered the oath to him in the usual form, to speak the truth in reference to the matter in question between the Court and jury, and after that he was examined.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair dresser, of Well's-street, Oxford-street—I am bound over to prosecute by the Judge of the Divorce Court—I am the husband of the last witness, and brother-in-law of Mrs. Wheddon—Mrs. Wheddon came to live in the same house with me and my wife in 1858 and 1859, in Carnaby-street—her conduct has always been proper during the time I have known her—she showed me some letters, and I went with her, in consequence of an appointment, to the Alhambra, on 23d De<lb></lb>cember, 1859—we expected to meet the writer of those letters, Joseph Smith—we were there some time, waiting about, and walking up and down, ex<lb></lb>pecting to see this party; we saw no one—I was in attendance at the Divorce Court, on 5th March, the day the persons rushed round my wife, I was with her, and Mrs. Wheddon, Mr. Davis, and the attorney—my wife went away after she was insulted—they called her Mrs. Wheddon—we were coming home: Mr. Davis was on one side, and I was on the other—after walking along, Mr. Wheddon came up, put his hand on my wife's shoulder, and said, "That is my wife, I will swear," then Mr. Pearson came up, and said, "That is my niece, Mr. Wheddon," we then put her into a cab and went off—there was no intention of representing her as Mrs. Wheddon—I never</p>

               <p>had the slightest notion—we were attending there at witnesse and we were going away when this happened—I saw Martin there; he came up to the cab door, and said, "That is her; that is Mrs. Wheddon, I will swear"—that was the first I saw of him that day—I did not hear him on that occasion, say anything about Newington-causeway, or what he had seen Mrs. Wheddon do—he only said, "That is Mrs. Wheddon, I'll swear"—I saw pretty well all the witnesses before the hearing of the trial—I saw Martin and Smith in company before the trial, on Thursday, the 6th, the day after the wrong identification—there was a man with them who has since been pointed out to me, named Everard, and another man whom I do not know; they were all drinking in a public-house facing Westminster-bridge—I did not see them talking—I heard the noise of some talk, but being a little afficted, I could not hear them—I saw the glass passed from one to the other—I cannot say that they were all talking together—I heard the murmurs of their voices—they were in company and drinking together—I did not see Martin and Smith together on any other day except that—I only saw one of them on the day of the trial—I know nothing about any debt from Wheddon to Mr. Pearson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney—I was consulted about this case on 1st December, 1859—the prisoner came to my chambers three times in December—he was accompanied on the first occasion by a party who represented himself as Mr. Wheddon, and two other persons, who I do not know—I fancy I had seen one of them before—I fancy his name was Brushfield—I do not know whether the other was a person of the name of Hayes—I should not know him—they consulted me about the divorce suit, "Wheddon v. Wheddon," before it was a suit—Martin was with them on each of these three occasions; I think he was alone on the last occasion—on the first occasion, Wheddon, Martin, and two others, were present—on the second, I think Martin and some other party, and on the third, I think only Martin—they remained some little time with me—they came on the 1st, the 2d, and the 9th.</p>

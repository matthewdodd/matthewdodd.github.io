            . I am constable of Bow-street. On the 12th of March, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was near Tyburn gate - and saw the prisoners coming up the Uxbridge-road, with each a basket slung over his shoulders; Brown was walking about six yards before Pembrooke; I crossed over - Pembrooke passed me - I looked into his basket and said,</p>
               <p>"What have got here; fowls?" He said</p>
               <p>"No, they are ducks" - I took him across the road, and gave him in charge of a man at the toll-gate - they were ducks; Brown seeing that I had got Pembrooke, set off running - I pursued, calling Stop thief! and a man stopped him two hundred yards off; when I came up, he asked why I hallowed Stop thief! I said, I had reason to believe he had stolen property, and as I brought him back, I saw his hand in his pocket, and heard something fall on the ground - I turned round and found a chisel; I said</p>
               <p>"You have dropped this; how did you get it;" he said he had found it. I found five ducks in his basket; there were three or four ducks, two fowls, and two bells in Pembrooke's basket; the prosecutor claimed two hens from Pembrooke's basket.</p>

            . I live at Wilsden. I had eight hens and a game cock; I locked them up about half-past ten o'clock on the night of the 11th of March, in the stable, and about six in the morning I found the stable door broken open, and missed two hens; I found them at the office two or three days after - the leg of one was broken, I had set it, and the spur had grown out.</p>

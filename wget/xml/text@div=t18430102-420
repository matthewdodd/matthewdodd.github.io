                  </hi>. I am barman to John Cook, of the City of London public-house, Berwick-street, St. James. At half-past eight o'clock, on the evening of the 29th of Dec., I saw the prisoner in front of the bar—I knew him before—he called for something to drink—I refused to serve him—master came, and ordered him out of the house, and he began wrangling with a cus<lb></lb>tomer in the bar—he was drunk—master went to turn him out—I assisted him the first time—he would not leave without being turned out—he was turned out easy the first time, not roughly—he returned in about ten minutes, and asked for Cook—he said, "I am ready for him"—Cook was in the bar parlour—he came out, and said, "Mind the stones, James," (meaning that the prisoner had something in his hand which he ought not)—the prisoner then threw a large shell at Cook's head—it missed him, and struck a large cask—Cook then went round to turn him out—I jumped over the counter, and put my left arm round his waist, to assist to turn him out—as I was doing so, his wife's sister struck me with her fist under the ear—she was in the bar—as I was turning him out, somebody opened the door, and I got him outside—as I was returning, my arm was bleeding very much, having been stabbed—my coat was off at the time—the prisoner must have wounded me, for nobody else touched me—I have been to a surgeon—my master had turned the pri<lb></lb>soner's wife's sister out while I was turning him out—that was after she struck me—there was a knife found on the prisoner at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at No. 66, Wardour-street. On the evening of the 29th I examined the prosecutor's arm—it was a punc<lb></lb>tured wound, not to any great extent, in the upper part of the fore arm, about the middle, just to the depth of the integument, extending a little under it, a little below the skin, not touching the muscles—it was not an incised wound, but punctured, such as might be inflicted by the stem of a tobacco pipe—I do not think it such a wound as a knife would make—some little in<lb></lb>flammation took place the second day—I dressed it—it is going on very well—I think it will be well in two or three days—it is very little more than skin deep—the end of a screw, in his scraping against the door, might very possiby do it—I am of opinion that it was not inflicted by a sharp cutting instrument, but by a blunt-pointed substance—it is what surgeons understand by being a punctured wound—it had a lacerated, torn appearance—it appeared to have been done with considerable violence—I can hardly say it was a stab—in extent it would have admitted the point of my little finger, and passed under the skin about two inches and a half, but not dividing the skin—I think his running against any pointed iustrument would have produced it—I under<lb></lb>stand his arm was uncovered—the instrument might be pointed obliquely——the act of pushing might tear it along his arm.</p>

                  </hi>. I went into the City of London with some friends—the prisoner came in—he was in the house two or three minutes—an altercation took place between him and another man—the landlord said he was going to strike the man, and ordered him out—he refused to go—the landlord went to put him out, and he flew behind the door—the landlord laid hold of him, and in the scuffle pushed his head against the wall, and put him out—about five minutes after he came back again, walked in front of the bar, and called out "Cook," who came out of the parlour, and called out to his customers, "Beware of the knife," or "Beware of stones"—I stepped aside, and he threw a shell at the landlord's head—it passed over his shoulder as he put his head down, and it hit my arm—the landlord went to put him out, his sister-in-law flew in between them, and said, "For God's sake, Mr. Cook, don't go near him, he will do you some injury"—the barman jumped over the bar, and went to put him out—he then came in saying, "Oh, my arm," and his arm was bleed<lb></lb>ing—the landlord ordered him to go to the doctor's—I did not see what caused the wound.</p>

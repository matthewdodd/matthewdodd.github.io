I had the Prisoners before his Majesty the Justice of Peace, where they confess'd, and their Consession was taken in Writing, tho' they refus'd to sign it; but after they were sent to Newgate, Tilson said if we'd let them go with us, he'd shew us where the Goods were pawn'd; so we took them both handcuff'd and they went directly to the Pawn-broker's, where the Goods were found, and they both confess'd there, that they took 'em out of the Shop. And Tilson told us before the Justice, that the Sugar was under his Bed.</p>

            . A little after 12, the Watch call'd and said the Street Door was open. I call'd up Mr. Gardner's Servant, and we went down together and search'd the House, but found no body hid, nor did I miss any thing: And so thinking the Door had been left open, carelesly I made it fast, and went to Bed again, without observing that the Key was taken out of the pin of the Windows. About 4 I was call'd up again, and then I found that the Window-matter was open, and the Shop had been robb'd a. I got a Warrant to search some Lodging Houses of ill Repute in the Neighbourhood. At one of those Houses we found these three Lumps of Sugar, under a Bed, and two Lads in Bed in the same Room; we charged them. They said the Prisoner lay in that Bed last Night, and that they went out about 11, but did not know what Time they came in again: However we took these two to the Constable's, and while we there the two Prisoners passed by the Window, and one of those we had taken happened to see 'em, and said there goes Tilson and Worrel! We went out and took 'em, they both cry'd, and said we should have the Goods again. At first Tilson said they had hid them in a Brick-field, but soon after confess'd he had given them to his Sister, who had pawn'd 'em. I ask'd him how they got in. He said he went down the Cellar Window (which had no Shutter) and so came up into the Shop, and open'd the Street Door and let in Worrel, but hearing the Watch, he took out the Key of the Pin of the Window, and they went off. They returned between 3 and 4, and drawing out the Pin, they put back one of the Shutters, and he went in and handed the Goods out to Worrel, who took them in his Apron. - Worrel confess'd the same.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.You must not tell us any thing that he said after that? - A. I saw the property at the pawnbroker's afterwards.</p>
               <p>CALEB WATSON sworn. - I am servant to a pawnbroker in Watling-street; here is a shawl that I took in of the prisoner on the 18th of November, and a yard and a half of silk, (produces them); he told me he had bought the silk to make him a waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of the prisoner'sperson? - A. Yes. Mr. Sampson. The shawl I cannot attempt to swear to; it is an article that no man can swear to; the piece of silk would be in that situation, but unfortunately for the prisoner, it is cut away, and the piece that is at home corresponds exactly with this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss a shawl? - A. It would have been impossible for me to have missed twenty dozen if they had been gone; it is of the same resemblance and make with other goods that I have in the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, if gentlemen of respectability to speak in my behalf, could be of service to me, I could have had them to-morrow, but to day they are not here; every person with whom I have had dealings would give me the most irreproachable character; and if other pieces of silk were cut away, they might tally with Mr. Sampson's, as well as this; my friends are three hundred miles from town, and are, I am proud to say, of the, first respectability in their neighbourhood; I served my time regularly in the county of Cornwall, and had a liberal education. <rs id="t18001203-10-verdict55" type="verdictDescription">

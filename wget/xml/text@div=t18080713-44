               <p>Q. When did you lose your money - A. On Tuesday morning last, about three o'clock in the morning, I was going to work at Messrs. Stonard and Unwin's brewhouse, near Carnaby market. I was going through Covent Garden, this woman accosted me, she pleaded a great deal of distress, and asked me to give her a glass of gin; I took her over to a public house and gave her a glass of gin; I drank nothing at all. We returned from there; she said she had something particular to say to me; we went down <placeName id="t18080713-44-crimeloc270">Southampton street in Maiden lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Do you know the notes to be yours - A. I cannot swear to the numbers; from the appearance of them they are my notes; the notes I had were chiefly new.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you in Covent garden - A. I was at a relation in Gray's inn lane.</p>

            . About three o'clock the prosecutor brought this woman to me and said she had robbed him of three one pound notes. I told the woman to empty her pockets; she produced a silk handkerchief on the table; these two one pound notes dropped from the pocket; she said that the prosecutor had given her the two notes in lieu of a half guinea he promised her; the prosecutor insisted upon it he had three, but he gave her none; I searched her; nothing was found.</p>


               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the night this happened I met with a gentleman I had known before; he gave me two one pound note and a seven shilling piece; I met with a young woman, I asked her to have something to drink, I was rather intoxicated; I went home with intention to leave the notes, I forgot it; - does it stand to reason if I had taken the money from that man that I would insist upon being searched.</p>

I was going for a pail of water when the prisoner came into the yard, and asked which was the rum puncheon - there were two puncheous there, and a man who works on the premises for a Mr. Hamilton, told him which it was; I then asked who gave him authority to move it - he said a person in Compton-street; and he was to have half-a-crown for taking it; I said it belonged to me, and I would not let it go; he then struck me three violent blows against the pump, and opened the gate, and took it out into Greek-street.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been breaking stones in Regent-street; as I was coming along Compton-street, I met a man who asked me if I would earn a few shillings, he told me to go and get the puncheon, and take it to Mr. Jones', in Hatton-garden; I went and the yard was open - I said "I am come for this puncheon" - the man said"Take it," and he took the glass off it - the woman came and asked what I was going to do with it - I told her; she told me to stop while she went to the clerk. I declare to my God, I never struck her, but I waited till the clerk came, and took me into the office.</p>

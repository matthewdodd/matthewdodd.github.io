                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Webb, of Park-road Dalston. The prisoner was employed by me as a charwoman, for the last three or four months—I lost four spoons, some knife-rests, and a broken silver table-spoon, from the kitchen—I did not suspect her—about a fort<lb></lb>night before I went before the Magistrate I said to her, "I have lost four silver teaspoons"—she said, "Indeed, who do you think has taken them?—I said I was not aware—I was in the habit of giving her washing to do—on 16th June she was given into custody—these are the teaspoons I missed, and this towel also—I never permitted the prisoner to take them.</p>

                  </hi>. On 16th June, after I had made a great deal of inquiry about this property, I went with Smith, the officer, to the prisoner's house in Shacklewell—I asked whether she had ever received, or taken anything any occasion, from my house, but what had been given her by Mrs. Webb—she positively denied that she had ever received anything from the house</p>

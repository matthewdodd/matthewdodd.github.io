                  </hi>. I am a wholesale jeweller of 80, Aldersgate Street, in partnership with Mr. Johnson—on the 16th January, about 12.30, the prisoner came in and produced this order—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "27, Ludgate Hill, 6th January, 1873:—Gentlemen, Please send by bearer two or three gold Alberts to show a customer.

               <p>knowing the prisoner, I said that I would send the chains off—he said "Unless they are sent immediately they are of no use, as the customer is waiting in the shop"—I gave five chains to Mr. Cooper, with orders to go to the shop, but I did notice then that the prisoner had left.</p>

I am manager to Wales and McCullock, jewellers—the prisoner was their porter for three months—this order is not written by my authority—these are my initials, but they are not my writing—I have the prisoner's writing here, and I believe it corresponds—I sent him out on the 16th, about 12 o'clock, or a little before, and he re<lb></lb>turned about 1.30 or 2—Mr. Cooper had been before he returned—Mr. Wales asked the prisoner if he knew anything about the order, and he denied having been to Walker and Johnson's.</p>

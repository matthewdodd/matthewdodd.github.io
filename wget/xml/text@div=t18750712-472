                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—we lived at 17 Dempspy Street—on Saturday evening, 5th June, we had been out together, and came home between 12 and 1 o'clock—we had been quarrelling before we went home, and we were quarrelling outside the door, but after we got inside the house we did not quarrel at all—I thought there was no necessity for a light as the moon was shining and I said so—he sat down two or three minutes on a chair—sometimes he has violent fits, when he is drunk—he was drunk—he jumped up all in a moment in a fit or something like that and lit the lamp—he took off the glass and the burner came off with it, and there were a lot of things on the table ready to go away—I blew it out—the window was open and the flare went in his face—he pushed me—I suppose he thought I had done it on purpose as we had been quarrelling before—I fell on the fender and before I got up he struck me with some<lb></lb>thing on my forehead—I don't know what it was—I was senseless—he was drunk at 7.30 when he came from his place—I had had a drop—I did not strike him with the lamp—it was done in a second—we were not in the house five minutes before it was all over.</p>

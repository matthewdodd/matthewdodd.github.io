               <p>My motive was not to do any thing bad, when I came out. I met several gentlemen, being much distressed, but no one relieved me: this was the last gentleman I met; he went down a turning; I asked him if I should do any thing to oblige him? he asked me to do something that was very indecent; he was going away without giving me any thing; I said I hoped he would not be so mean, as I was much distressed.</p>

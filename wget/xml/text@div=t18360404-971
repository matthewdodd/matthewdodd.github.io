                  </hi>. I am a paper-bag maker, and live in Sher<lb></lb>wood-place, Bethnal-green. I have known the prisoner eighteen months—we have been very good friends—we have not fallen out till within the last four of five weeks, but for four or five months we have been at vari<lb></lb>ance in his sort of way—I don't know why. On the 31st of March of came home from Clapton, between twelve and one o'clock at night—I was knocking at my door—the prisoner came out—he lives right opposite me, and he called me a hopping b—several times—I asked him why he did so—he struck me with some weapon—I thought it was a hammer, but I don't know—it took my senses away completely—he struck me in the forehead, over the left eye—I only just recollect those words as I fell—it took my senses away for a minute or two, I suppose—I lost them altogether—my forehead bled violently—I was covered with blood—my wife helped to dress my wound, as I have heard since—I went to the hospital, but I would not stop, as I wanted to get home to my wife and family—I went to bed directly after it was done—I found my self in bed—I don't recollect going to bed at all—I was called up by the police, when they took the prisoner which was almost directly, I believe, but I can't say—and I went to the station-house, and from thence to the hospital—they locked the prisoner up at the station-house—I was about half an hour in the hospital—they would not dress the wound, because it had swollen so—I went to the hospital next morn<lb></lb>ing—they never saw the place at all, for the surgeon was not come when I went there, and I would not stop—I have been confined at home with it, until last Monday—from Thursday to Monday—I just took a walk out, but no distance—I don't know how the prisoner came to do this, but he has been at variance about six weeks—I cannot say what about, but I have asked him for a soldering-iron, or copper bit, which he has got of mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with M'Carthy when I took the prisoner—he told him what he took him for—he made no answer—on the way to the station-house, the prosecutor said he had struck him with a hammer—the prisoner heard it—he made no answer—I returned back to the prisoner's house, and found this hammer in the cupboard by the side of the fire—the prisoner did not see it—he said nothing till he was before the magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a neighbour of the prisoner's, and live nearly opposite him. I heard the prosecutor come home, about twenty minutes before one o'clock in the morning—apparently by his voice he was tipsy—his next door neighbour was with him—he made a noise and awoke us—the next door neighbour's stairs join mine and I heard him go up-stairs—it was not a minute after that I heard the prosecutor cross the road to the prisoner's door—he commended knocking violently—he said, "Come out, you b—I have just come home in good trim for you"—I heard the prisoner's door open and shut quickly again—I heard the prosecutor say, "You cowardly b—, you have cut my head with a hammer"—the pro<lb></lb>secutor's wife by that time came down, and said to the prisoner, "Come out, you coward, and stand before me"—she said she would have his life—the prosecutor and his wife then cried "Police," and an Irish policeman, (I know by his tongue,) came up—he asked the policeman to take charge of the prisoner, and he said he could not, as he did not see the blow—the prosecutor said, "What! can't you take charge of him? "then I am to be murdered because you did not see it done?"—he said, "Then I'm b—if you do your duty"—by that time the policeman and the prosecutor went away—the wife desired him to go to a doctor and get the wound dressed—I think it was about twenty minutes or a quarter to two o'clock when I heard them come back again—I heard nothing then till I saw the prisoner brought thought his next door neighbour's house—that is all know—I believe the prisoner struck the prosecutor, but in his own defence—he never went out of his own door by what I saw—I saw the light shine through my binds, and the door shut again directly.</p>

I received a telegraphic message, and came up from the country to Cockspur-street; I examined my premises there, and found they had been broken open, and a great many goods were missing—I afterwards saw some of those goods at Bow-street, when they were produced by the pawnbrokers—some of them were goods I had had made for myself—here are some of them.</p>

Andrews, in the City, on the evening of the 18th—they were pieces of printed Indian silk, for the purpose of making dressing gowns—I saw them afterwards—I missed a grey cravat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Thomas Nelson.</hi> When I was in the cell, the officer Pocock came to me, and asked who I bought the property of; I told him the man lived in Short's-gardens, and he went away directly and came back again, and told me that he was out; on the next Wednesday He told me again that he went after the party, but he had moved away.</p>

That is true; I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner after he was examined on the first occasion; he said he could tell the officer who he bought the property of—the Magistrate consented that an officer should see him—I went, and he told me that he bought it of a man that lived in a tin shop in Short's-gardens—I went there, the man was not at home—I went again, and the landlady said he had left for three weeks.</p>

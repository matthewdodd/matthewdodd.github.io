                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live in Sawyer's-place, Chiswell-street—on Saturday night, the 15th April, I was in the parlour—my husband came in and asked if I was going to bed—I said, "Yes, in a few minutes, as soon as my little boy comes back, and I have had some supper"—I was in the act of turning a shirt that was at the fire, when he told me to look—I turned, and he presented a pistol to me, and fired it—what was in it I do not know—there was only powder in my face—I Fell down and was stunned for some minutes; I then recovered and got outside—I fell into the arms of a constable—I was taken to the hospital—my husband was not sober—he had been drinking very much all day, and I think he did not know what he was doing—he was not two yards from me—</p>

               <p>he was at the door, and I was at the fire-place—nothing had occurred be<lb></lb>tween us to provoke it—we were on very good terms—he is a good hus<lb></lb>band—I have six children—I beg to recommend him to mercy.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, G</hi> 67). On the night of 15th April, I met the prosecutor in Church-court crying that she was shot—I went to the house and found the prisoner sitting in a chair, with his feet on another chair—I said, "Well, governor, where is the pistol you have been using"—he said he had not used a pistol—he then said the old pistol he had got was in a box in the other room—I went and found an old pistol there, which had not been used—I said, "Look here governor, it is no use telling me this, you have not used this, you have been using one"—he said it was only ft bone he had used; he had not done any harm—there was a frightful smell of sulphur and powder in the room—I took the prisoner to the station, and returned to search the place—I found this box containing six caps—the constable in my absence had found the stock of the pistol.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—the prosecutrix came there on 15th March; she was scalded about the forehead and eyelids, and there was a considerable quantity of powder underneath the skin—the eyes were not touched, only the lids—I attended her for about a fortnight—she is perfectly well now, but she will probably have the marks all her life.</p>

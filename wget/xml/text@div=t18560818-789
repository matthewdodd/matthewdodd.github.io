                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Galpin, of Playhouse yard, printer and publisher. We print the Country Paper—Mr. Cassell is interested in that paper—we keep an entirely separate account of that paper, totally distinct from other business—the prisoner has been in our service about twelve months—it was his duty to attend to the business of the Country Paper—this is the ledger that the prisoner was in the habit</p>

               <p>of keeping respecting that paper—there was also a day and a cash book, at one side of which were entered the orders, and charges against the customer and on the other side the remittances received from them—it was the pri<lb></lb>soner's duty to open letters addressed to the firm, and if remittances were sent up, it was his duty to take it to the day and cash book, and to enter the remittances on the credit side of the day and cash book, with the name of the person from whom he received it—these remittances were made to Mr. Cassell on our joint behalf—he was to make out a memorandum that day, or the next day, as it might be desirable to send the cash into the bankers—that was not necessarily done every day, but before taking money to the bankers, he had to make out the account—that in the ordinary course would be an abstract from the day and cash book of the various sums received, but omitting the names of the customers—it was a recapitulation of the amounts by which we ascertained that he had them correct.</p>

               <p>has been assumed that these two sum, were posted into the ledger by me, without having entered them in the day book, and the only evidence that they have attempted to show as to the loss of this day book is, that I have entered the sums in the ledger and not in the day book, and that I was about to leave; they having discovered that there was a large amount due, and that sufficient money had not been received, they jump to the conclusion that I had abstracted the book; nothing had been said about examining the ledger when this parcel of waste paper was taken away by me; I had been in the habit of asking the foreman for two or three pieces of waste paper, and the use I made of it was to bring my lunch with me; I used the paper for that purpose; one morning I wanted this day book which was missing; I spoke to Mr. Mason and the lad, and asked where it was; they could not find it; it could not be found; it was then mentioned to the firm, and they had ascertained that I took away this parcel of paper, and I was imme<lb></lb>diately asked if I had taken a parcel of paper out; I said, "Yes;" search was made about the place again; the book could not be found; a detec<lb></lb>tive was employed, and I was called up again and asked about it, and when I had had it; I recollected having had it the day before, at half past 5 o'clock; I had occasion to use it, and that was the last time I saw it; I had no occasion to use it further that day; well, this detective was told about the parcel of paper I had taken, and it was just such a parcel as you were just told about; I called for Mr. Clew, who gave me this paper, and he was asked if he had given me any; he said, "Yes;" I asked him how many sheets it consisted of; he said, "Twelve or fourteen;" they were sheets of double demy, and folded in this way (<hi rend="italic">Folding a sheet of paper</hi>); it could not be a book; I brought it into the counting house, and tied it with string; I was out in a minute after Mr. Mason, and the only reason I did not go with him was, he was going over Blackfriars-bridge, and I was going the other way; we used sometimes to go and walk together; the detective was directed to go to my house and look at this paper; I directed where it was, and said it would be found, as I left it, with the wrapper and string; he went, and did inspect this paper; I will ask Mr. Fetter.</p>

The officer went to my house while I remained at the counting house; he came back, and was with Mr. Petter and Mr. Galpin some time before I was called up; I asked him whether he had found the paper; he said, "Yes, but not the book;" some conversation ensued, and he was instructed to go again; he was there before I reached home in the evening; I found him there in conversation with my wife and another lady, who resides in the same house; he told me that he had seen</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185608180077"></xptr>
               <p>this parcel, and was quite satisfied that it contained no book; he said he asked my wife to look at the parcel of paper, and, having seen that, he said, "I wish to look at the book he brought home," and she said I had brought none; now how easy would it have been to have taken her off her guard, and have got the book, but there was no one; you have heard the witness Mason say that the parcel was rolled, and the book could not by possibility have been inserted in that parcel of waste paper; the paper was folded by the warehouseman, and he did not tie it round with string, because the string he had was so much thicker than what was in the counting house; I am accused of the loss of the day book; how is it proved that I did abstract it? I had no desk to lock anything up, but up to a certain hour, half past 5 o'clock, I used that day book, and after that time I have no knowledge of it whatever; I did not put it away that night, nor I never did, except in the absence of Mr. Mason; Again, what was the motive for taking away that book I and what was the motive for taking away the ends of the receipt books? if the accounts entered in the ledger did not speak for them<lb></lb>selves, the receipts that the parties had would speak for themselves; and what proof has there been adduced to you that the items posted in the ledger bad not been posted in the day book? and what motive could there be for my taking away the day book I Mr. Galpin had finished his exami<lb></lb>nation of the ledger, and I had received notice to quit, because I had given more credit than I ought to do this time; in order to see that the ledger was correct, a professional accountant was called in unknown to me, and the books were taken away, and the first time I had an opportunity of seeing them again was on the day of the expiration of my month's notice to quit; it has been stated that I had the custody of this day book; I deny it; if I had, why had I not the key of the iron safe? the loss of it was brought forward to make it out worse and worse against me; but it is only on suspicion, they have no proof whatever; I had only the charge of the books in use; the current receipt book in use was there regularly in it's place, and there was no attempt to alter it in any way, but, when they found that the receipt book ends could not be found, I am charged with this; Mr. Mason's duty was to lock the books up, and to unlock them in the morning, and he does not know whether he opened the sale the following morning, and he does not know what books were taken out, and what were not.</p>

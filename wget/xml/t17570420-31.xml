            ] induced me to come and live in his house. I went and stay'd some time, but finding his daughter guilty of very mean actions I went away, and afterwards met with him in Shoreditch, when he desired me to come again. I went, and found his daughter had beat him. I have wash'd that old innocent face with water many a time. I being a poor woman could not subpaena people upon my trial. I wash'd his linen, but never wrong'd him in my life. His daughter frequently pawns things, and he told me she had pawn'd even his pewter spoons, and that he should be ruin'd if I did not come again. We went to a publick house, in order to have a pot of beer and a steak. She was in liquor, and got at the box iron; and after that she quarrel'd with me, a nd wanted more things to pledge I said, Hannah, you shall not. I took the short cut, thinking to have wash'd it with my own things, but fell asleep and could not wash it on the Sunday. I thought proper to leave this man. I saw the daughter, and follow'd her into a house, and said she was the woman I wanted. Said she, I want you. I went with her to their house, where he was in liquor. The son sent for an officer, who took the shirt out of my pocket I own, but there were hour enough for me to have made away with it, if I had been so minded.</p>

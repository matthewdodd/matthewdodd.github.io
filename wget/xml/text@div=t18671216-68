                  </hi>. I am twelve years old, and am employed at Messrs. Warner's, brass founders, of Jewin Street—the prisoner was in their service about a month before this—I saw him in Jewin Street on Monday, and he asked me if Mr. Fleming was in his box—he is the timekeeper—I said, "No, I think he has gone to tea," but at that time I saw him coming down the Crescent towards the house—the prisoner saw him and said, "Go away, and do not let Mr. Fleming see me"—I went on an errand, and when I came back I saw the prisoner at the corner of the Crescent; he said, "Do you know the copper wire cellar?" I said, "Yes; he said, "If you can get me the key of the copper wire cellar I will give you a shilling, and will return the key with the shilling to you in the morning—he did not say why he wanted it, but he said that he would lock himself in the cellar to have a chance to get his things out—he said that he would wait for the key in the public-house next door—I ran away to my masters' and left him without making any answer—I said something to Mr. Edmunds, who minds the front shop; he spoke to Mr. Fleming, who spoke to Mr. Compton Warner, who told me where the key was, and I got it, and took it next door, but the prisoner was not there; I saw him a little way off at the bottom of the Crescent, and went and gave him the key, and he took it away.</p>

I saw Coles go out with the key and go into the Bull's Head, he came out, went to the bottom of the Cres<lb></lb>cent, where the prisoner was looking round the corner—they both went round the corner—I went round the Crescent into Jewin Street—I went up to the prisoner, told him I was a policeman and should take him for inciting the boy to steal a key—he said, "I do not want the key"—I put my hand in his pocket to feel for the key and heard something drop, I found it at his feet—I searched him at the station and found a latch-key, a halfpenny, and some treacle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to John Warner and Sons, brass-founders—the prisoner was in our employ up to within a month of this affair—on 18th November I gave the timekeeper permission to allow the boy to take the key of the copper wire cellar out—any person can go to that cellar without passing the timekeeper—there was a large quantity of copper wire in the cellar at this time, but nothing belonging to the prisoner—the boy had no authority to remove the key without my permission; it is my property.</p>

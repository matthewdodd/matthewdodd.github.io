                  </hi>. I am chaplain to the Minster Union, Isle of Thanet—on 4th January I came out of a shop near the Old Jewry, and walked towards the Bank—there was a slight stoppage, and the prisoner stopped in front of me and looked me very earnestly in the face—I looked down and found my chain dangling, and missed my watch, which was a testimonial, and was worth 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the man had then gone—I followed, there was a cry of "Stop thief!" and I went to Bow Lane station—while I was there the prisoner was brought in, and I identified him instantly—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), the inscription is on it.</p>

               <p>and I had a stick and a small carpet bag in the other hand—I kept on the kerb—I was outside and my friend inside—I was talking to him—there was a particularly strong gaslight—I did not say at the station "I think that is the man, he looks something like him,"I said "That is the man"—a con<lb></lb>stable in uniform was with him—I had not spoken to the constable before—I had had no opportunity of seeing the prisoner's dress, but his look was one which I shall never forget; his countenance fixed itself upon me—Page had not spoken to me in the Poultry, he came in with the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer's assistant, at 29, Poultry—on the evening of the 4th January, about 6.30—I saw the prisoner with the great coat on his left arm, which he is wearing now—I am not certain whether there were not two others with him—the prisoner went near the prosecutor, whose great coat was open, and I saw his chain dangling—I said "You have lost your watch, Sir"—I chased the prisoner through Grocer's Hall Court, and King's Arms Yard into Moorgate Street, then through Princes Street, where he crossed to the Royal Exchange, and I took him a yard or two past Birch's, in Cornhill—he had stopped running then—he was about five yards in front of me all the time—I lost sight of him in turning the corners, but I saw him running again.</p>

On 4th January, about 6.30, Page pointed out the prisoner to me in Cornhill, and I took him to Bow Lane station—on entering, the prosecutor recognised him immediately—he gave his addres 358, Strathmore Terrace, Chelsea—I went to Chelsea but could not find such a terrace.</p>

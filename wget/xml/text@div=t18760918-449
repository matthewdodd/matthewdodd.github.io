                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Jennings, of Powis Street, Woolwich—he is not a member of the Peculiar People—I know the prisoner, and knew his child Ann—it was a healthy child up to the time of this illness, with the exception of having measles about three months before—I saw her about three weeks before her death, she seemed very poorly and seemed gradually to get weaker—I thought it was teething—about a week before its death, I saw a red rash out on it—I spoke to the mother about it—the prisoner was not present—a day or two after I saw a swelling in the neck, it got larger,-and the child got weaker—I thought it had a fever—I was with it nearly all the day before it died—I saw it on the Sunday morning before going to church—the prisoner was present—it was then very weak and low—the rash was dying away at that time—the prisoner went home to his meals—I believe the swelling in the neck was more on one side than the other, we remarked that it looked more like an abscess forming, it was swelling largely—nothing was said about medical aid; I believe the conversation was chiefly about a prayer meeting being held for the child, and one was held on the Monday evening—we have a prayer meeting when we see they are very ill—I was not present when the elder was called in—I went on the Monday evening about 9 o'clock—the prisoner came in while I was there; the child was then worse, I thought it was dying—the prisoner said he thought it would get better—I told him it would be as well not to think so—I believe he thought when the prayer meet<lb></lb>ing was on the Monday night that the Lord would deliver the child; we thought that the Lord would heal it—I was not present at the prayer meeting, I saw the child after the prayer meeting, it was very low and laid much quieter, it was sinking, it had been convulsed—I believe no medical advice was obtained during its illness, it is contrary to our faith—the parents gave it all the nourishment it could take—the prisoner was in work at the time, I don't know what wages he earned, he is a general labourer.</p>

I am an engine driver, and life at Plumstead—I am one of the elders of the Peculiar People—I was tried here on a charge of man-slanghter—it is part of our faith not to call in medical advice, except we sec the need of it; it would only be in the case of a broken limb; we should employ a surgeon to set a broken limb, but I don't suppose we should for any bodily ailment; not for consumption; that is the line we have observed fur the last forty years—I believe I have said this in the prisoner's presence</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M.D. of the University of Edinburgh, and a Burgeon, and reside at Woolwich, about ten minutes walk from the prisoner—I made a <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination of this child by order of the Coroner—externally the body was free from any marks of violence; it was not emaciated, it was in very fair condition, fairly nourished—as far as external appearances it appeared to be the body of a healthy child, except the enlargement of the maxillary glands; that would come from disease—I found a large glandular swelling on the right and left sides of the throat—the brain and membranes were all healthy, the heart was healthy, and the lungs, except trivial congestion, which would be accounted for by its lying two or. three weeks—the "stomach contained a small quantity of fluid nourishment, with probably a little wine—the liver was healthy, the spleen much congested; both kidneys, especially the left, in a state of degeneration, the bowels and other organs were all in a healthy condition; in my judg<lb></lb>ment death resulted primarily from scarlet fever, secondarily from disease of the kidneys; both those are amenable to medical treatment; by that, I mean that many cases suffering in a similar manner recover under treat<lb></lb>ment—taking the fact that the child was apparently a healthy one, apart from these matters, if medical attendance had been called in, its life might probably have been prolonged; of course I cannot say positively, no one could—I think the chances of its life were lessened by the absence of medical aid, and the health seriously endangered and injured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the Clerk to this Court—I was present at the previous trial of the prisoner, and, afterwards, when (the point of law having been reserved), sentence was passed upon him by Mr. Baron Hud<lb></lb>dleston. The learned Judge commenced by saying that he believed the opinion which these people had brought themselves to, was an honest one, that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187609180093"></xptr>
               <p>they were acting <hi rend="italic">bona-fide</hi>, but that now the Court had decided that the law was against them, and however much right they might have as grown up persons to deal with themselves in any way they thought fit, they had no right whatever to deal with helpless children, who were under their charge and who could not reason or judge for themselves; that the statute, to which he called the prisoner's attention, made it the duty of a parent having charge of an infant, to provide medical aid for it whenever it was necessary, and that if hereafter they neglected' the duty of calling in medical aid when it was necessary, they must be prepared to put up with the consequences; that it could not be permitted that they should allow their children to be without medical aid when the law stated that they should provide it; thereupon, the prisoner, in substance, said that he would communicate with the elders of his people, and now that the law—was clearly ascertained, he for himself and the others, he had, no doubt, would abide by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I never thoroughly understood that we were com<lb></lb>pelled to have medical aid, not when I was here before. I don't think I should have broken the law if I had known it had been kid down distinctly as the gentleman says; My lord spoke very nice, and I was no doubt rather excited at the time. The child was sucking at the breast, and we gave it a little sherry and water, and a little brandy and water, or port wine, and we prayed earnestly to the Lord to deliver it. We have seen the goodness of the Lord displayed many times.</p>

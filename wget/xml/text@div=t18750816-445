                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 371 <hi rend="italic">B</hi>). I was on duty on Monday morn<lb></lb>ing, 19th July, in Strutton Ground, Westminster, about 1.45—as I was passing I heard a door open on my left—I saw a man come out with a light in his hand, holding it behind him—he went towards the corner of Great Peter Street, where the prisoner was standing—I went after him, and when he saw that I was getting near to him he ran away, the prisoner joining him—they both ran down Great Peter Street, as far as Matthew Street, where the prisoner turned in, but the other man kept straight on and turned into Perkin's Rents—I lost sight of him there.—I then went back to the shop and woke up Mr. Waters; I examined the premises and found the first floor window open—the prisoner was brought back by another constable—I gave instructions for him to be taken to the station, while I examined the premises—I found nothing had been taken—I went into the station and charged the prisoner, and he took this chisel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from his pocket and "That will convict me"—he also took this cap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from his pocket and said it belonged to the man that ran away—he said at first, he did not know anything about it; there were three others, but they were strangers to him—I found upon him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. id in coppers, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, a small file, a knife and some string—he told the Magistrate they asked him to hold these things while they had a fight—I have, not the slightest doubt he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was rather a close night, rather cloudy; I could not say that it had been raining—the prisoner was about 12 yards from the house—when he was at the station he produced the chisel himself—he was standing right under a street lamp—I was about 20 yards from him then—I am sure he is the same man—the man who ran away had on a cap similar to this.</p>

I was on duty in Matthew Street, Westminster, at 2.30 on Monday morning, the 19th July, I heard a noise like two men running—the prisoner tried to pass me, and I stopped him and asked him what he was running for—he said "All right Charlie, its all right, there's a row, a fight; I must run away or get a good hiding"—I told him to come back with me and we would see what was the matter—I took him to Strutton Ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 39, Strutton Ground, Westminster, I am a tobacconist—when I went to bed on Sunday night, I left the house perfectly locked up, but forgot to put down the first floor window, which is 8 or 9 feet from the ground—I was sound asleep until the police constable woke me up—I dressed myself and searched, but found nothing was missing;</p>

               <p>I found the window a little farther up, not in the position I had left it—it is very easy for anyone to get in by the window—I left the door barred—I do not know whether anybody was in the house when I went to bed—I think nobody could be there without my knowing it.</p>

I was on duty in the Horseferry Road, on Monday, the 19th July, when I came to the Strutton Ground I saw the prisoner standing on the opposite side of the road under the lamp-post, which is 14 or 15 yards from the prosecutor's house—he stood directly in the light of the lamp; I saw his features—I heard a door open and saw the prisoner join a man running from the prosecutor's house—I went across and shortly afterwards constable 371 returned and aroused Mr. Waters—while he was doing so constable 401 brought the prisoner back, and I identified him—he denied having been there, and afterwards admitted to me that he was there—he said he knew nothing of the affair, there were three in it and were all strangers to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think he was some 14 or 15 yards from the corner of the street, when I saw his features—I saw him join the man that escaped from Mr. Waters' house—they both ran together in the direction of Great Peter Street, and constable 371 followed him—I know the neighbourhood of Great Peter Street pretty well—it is a rough neighbourhood and pretty crowded.</p>

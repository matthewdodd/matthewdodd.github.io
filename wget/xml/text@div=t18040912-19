               <p>Q. What are you? - A. I am a farmer; I had the horse in my possession for about three months; he lent him me; on the 16th of April I saw him in the stable; I missed him the next morning about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door locked the over night? - A. Yes; there are two doors to the stable, and in the morning I found the back door opened; I made enquiry in the neighbourhood, but could not find the horse; on the 23d of July I heard that it was in a livery-stable in Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing yourself of the prisoner? - A. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a horse was it? - A. It was a brown horse with a white blaze on the face, and some grey hairs dispersed all over the horse.</p>

             sworn. - I bought the horse of the prisoner at the bar: on the 21st of April I delivered it up to Mr. Ray, and I believe he delivered it up to Mr. Chandler; I have seen the horse again at the livery-stables in Worship-street; it is a brown horse, with a white blaze down the face and a bushy tail; I bought the horse for a friend; he is a Captain; the prisoner rode him in the yard; the Captain was with me, and he said, buy that horse for me; the prisoner asked 16 l. for it; I bid the prisoner 15 guineas for it; he said, he would not take less than 16 l. for the horse, he did not get any thing by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come to you on account of that horse? - A. He came by, he said; and it was a good horse, and would go in harness very well, but rather aukward; I have seen him in Smithfield for this year and a half, selling of horses.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Chandler.) Where is your residence? - A. At <placeName id="t18040912-19-crimeloc116">Thurston, in the county of Suffolk</placeName>

               <p>Q.(To Atkins.) Was 16 l. paid to the prisoner for the horse? - A. My acquaintance said, do not part from the horse; I called to him in the Minories, and said, come home, and I will pay you for the horse; and there is a man in our yard, to whom the prisoner gave a shilling for taking the bridle and saddle home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The horse was found in your possession, and therefore you were liable to be charged with stealing it, unless you had brought the man forward you had bought it of? - A. I have a witness that I bought it, but he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it happen that you know where the prisoner resided? - A. He always informed me that he kept a hop-ground at Sittingbourn, and that he kept waggons.</p>
               <p>Q. You took a receipt for the payment? - A. No; I have bought an hundred horses and never took a receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this captain? - A. Capt. Brasson; he is a master of a powder-vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Peck; he is not forth-coming? - A. No; he is in the Compter; he recommended me to this man in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. So that neither of the persons who were present at the purchase are forth-coming? - A. I have a witness that saw me buy the horse; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. I am a carman, and deal in horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a cart horse? - A. No; between a cart-horse and a nag.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with this captain? - A. Twenty years; I knew him from a child; he lives within a quarter of a mile of my house; he is not in town now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know there is a reward? - A. I do.</p>

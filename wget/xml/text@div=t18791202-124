On 12th November, at 4 p.m., I was with Newland on Ludgate Hill in plain clothes, and saw the prisoners on the other side of the street, 10 or 12 yards distant from me—I watched them three or four minutes—they went towards St. Paul's and met the prosecutrix and two other ladies—they then turned back, Harris placing himself on the right, and Johnson on the left of the lady—after going a few yards, Johnson placed himself for a few seconds immediately in front of the lady, who was walking with a bag in her hand—I saw Harris open her bag, take something out, and put it in his right-hand coat pocket—the prisoners then suddenly crossed over towards me, walking side by side, talking and smiling, and I seized each of them by the collar—Johnson looked up in my face, and seeing who I was, he struggled and broke away—he ran down Ave Maria Lane pursued by Newland, who cried "Stop thief"—I took this purse from Harris's pocket and took him across to the lady, who identified it, but did not know it was stolen till I told her—I searched the prisoners at the station, and found a sovereign and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver on Johnson, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Harris—Johnson gave the name of Johnson, and said he had no fixed residence in London—I have seen them together once before and watched them.</p>

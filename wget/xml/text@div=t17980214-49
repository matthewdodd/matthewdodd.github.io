               <p>Court. Q. When you went up to bed, what kind of security did you leave your house in-in what way were the doors fastened? - A. I sleep down stairs in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the doors fastened? - A. They were fastened with a bolt.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go up stairs for? - A.Because the watchman said, he thought he had confederates with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation was the door and windows in? - A. The front door was upon the latch before I went to bed; when I was going to bed, it was nearly eleven o'clock, the watchman came to the door, and knocked at the door again, and he asked me, if I had lost any thing, I told him, I had not, he said, he was very glad to hear it, for he had a very great suspicion of them; that was all that passed between us, then the watchman went away, and I fastened the door; by the watchman saying to me, he had a great suspicion of them, a thought struck me of this room where the clothes were hanging, I took a candle and went up stairs, and I found the room door open, there were some shirts hanging up to dry, and some taken off.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was become of those shirts? - A. There were some laying on the floor, they were rolled together apparently, I have nothing farther to say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you the owner of the house? - A. I rent the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't keep the house entirely to yourself, you let it out to a number of lodgers? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. And till a certain hour arrives, the door is only kept on the latch? - A. Only on the latch.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore your locking-up time was not arrived, for near half an hour? - A. I sometimes lock up the house at nine, and sometimes later.</p>
               <p>Q. Any of your lodgers coming into the house, might have left the door open? - A. I believe I was the last man up in the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long was it, from the time of your going up stairs, to the time of your going to bed? - A. It was half an hour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You yourself will not swear, that the door might not be left accidentally open by the lodgers coming in, and the man might come in by the door being open? - A. Such a thing might be done; when I came in, I left it upon the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very possible one of your lodgers might have left the door open, and this man have come in? - A. It might be possible.</p>
               <p>Q. The man Champness enquired when you saw him for serjeant Miller, where does he live? - A. He lives within one hundred yards, in another street in the neighbourhood, and I directed him to serjeant Millar, on the watchman saying he knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, the young man is decently connected? - A. I know nothing to the contrary.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you know Champness before? A. I knew Champness from a child; I asked him what business he had there, and he told me he came after one serjeant Miller; then I asked serjeant Taylor what he meant to do with them, and immediately serjeant Taylor said, there is nothing upon them, let them go about their business.</p>

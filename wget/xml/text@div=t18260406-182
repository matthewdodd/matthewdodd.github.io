            . I live at Bromley. I am Mr. Corpe's glazier - on the 9th of March the prisoner spoke to me to put some squares of glass in - I told him if he would buy the glass I would - he asked me where was the best place to buy it, and I told him at Mr. Tilt's - the next day he told me he had got it, and I put in two squares for him that evening - when I went I found they were larger than the size - I asked him how it was, and he said his wife made a mistake in the size, and he had given 1s. 6d. each for them - the next day the officers came - I went with them to the prisoner's house, and found this glass there - it was the same the prisoner had had put in, and the same I had been at work on for Mr. Corpe.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the prisoner's lodgings on the 11th of March - I found this square of glass on the shelf, and two new squares in the window - the other things were found by my brother officer - I asked the prisoner where he got the glass, and his wife said she bought it in Ratcliff-highway - I said "Very well, I will go to where you bought it" - the prisoner was then eating his dinner, and said nothing about it, but begged I would speak to Mr. Corpe.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>This day week in the morning I met the prisoner, and an other man with him, the prisoner had a basket on his head, between seven and eight in the morning in Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell, I suspected and seized him, there was another man following him, which was the ground of my suspicion, because I know the other man to be a very bad man; he made his escape, he had a dog, and began to unmuzzle him, and took a knife to cut his muzzle, the prisoner said, for God sake Mr. Redgrave, call somebody to your assistance, and I called a man; it gives me pleasure to represent to your Lordship, the prisoner behaved exceedingly well, and I think, I owe my life to him.</p>
               <p>(The parcel produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner know you before? - He had been in the militia, and I knew him before, but I know nothing bad of him, since he came out of the service.</p>

               <p>A man asked me to carry some things, as I was coming through Little Britain from Billingsgate, and leave them at the Nag's Head, Gray's Inn-lane, and he would give me a shilling; he came after me, and this gentleman took me, and I put them down immediately.</p>
               <p>Court to Redgrave. What did he say then? - He said, he was employed to carry them, and there was a man behind him.</p>

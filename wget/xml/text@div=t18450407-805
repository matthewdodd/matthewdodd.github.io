                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Wood, a porter, and live at No. 12, John's-place, Heneage-street, Mile-end New-town—the landlord does not live in the house—we have separate apartments in the house. On the night of the 1st of March I went out with my husband about half-past nine o'clock, leaving my child in bed—I locked the room door, and took the key in my pocket—I returned at ten—I found the street-door broken open, and also found the door of my apartment open—I missed a pair of trowsers, two shirts, and an apron—they were safe when I left the room—I found the child crying—I have not seen any of these things since.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the same house as the prosecutor. On Saturday night, the 1st of March, between nine and ten o'clock, I went out for about ten minutes, at the same time as Mr. and Mrs. Wood—when I returned, the little girl up stairs was crying—I went up to tell her not to cry—the door was locked—I could not open it—she laid quiet, and I came down stairs again, and went into my own room—I came out again, and stood at the door for a few minutes—a woman came out of the passage opposite with a cloak and bonnet, and coloured ribbons on it—she stooped down as if to pick something up, and said the little girl up stairs had frightened her very much—I asked how—she said, hearing the child cry, she thought there was a fire—I said, "The little puss, her mother will not be long"—I shut the door, and she walked by my side to the corner of the street—she then left me, and went one way, and I the other—I came back in about twenty minutes, met Mrs. Wood, and she told me she had been robbed—the woman did not say she had been into the house—she had not then, because the door was locked—the doors were all fas-tened, except the street-door—I am positive of the woman's dress—I gave a description of her person—she had a cloak on, with a large cape over it and a velvet bonnet with coloured ribbons to it—I did not notice her face, and could not swear to her features—the prisoner was dressed the same before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, John-street, Lambeth, and am a hackney<lb></lb>carriage driver. On 20th Nov. I was called by a little boy, about ten years old, from Kennington stand—he got into my cab, and ordered me to go towards Camberwell—he said, "There are two gentlemen who want you"—I went and met the prisoner, and an elderly gentleman, shorter than him, who appeared blind—I should say he was upwards of sixty years of age, his hair was grey, and he had grey whiskers—he was a short stoutish man—the prisoner and the old man got into the cab, and ordered me to drive to the Foundling Hospital—I pulled up there, from about half-past ten to eleven o'clock—the little boy had gone with me from Kennington—when I got to the Foundling, a young man came across the road; he said to them in the cab, "What a time you have been!"—some<lb></lb>thing else passed between them, but I did not understand what the words were—the prisoner then went in the direction of Russell-square—the young man got into the cab, and they ordered me to drive on to the first turning—I drove on to a public-house at the corner of Grenville-street—the old man and the little boy got out and went into the public-house—the young man had left before, but he came back to the public-house—I was paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I remained standing there, and the prisoner came back along Grenville-street—he said to me, "Where is he?"—I said, "They are in the public-house"—I asked him if he would want me again; he said he did not know—he went into the public-house; he did-not remain there many minutes—he came out with the blind gentleman and the boy—the old gentleman then ordered me to go to 6, Berners-street, Russell-square—I said to the prisoner, "What does he say?"—he said, "Go to 6, Berners-street"—the old gentleman and the boy got into the, cab and I drove there—it was about eleven—the blind man and the boy got out and went into the house; they remained there not many minutes—they came out</p>

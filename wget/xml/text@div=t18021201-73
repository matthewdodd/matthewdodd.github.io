             sworn. - Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. He lodged at my house two nights. Q. Do you remember, on the 31st of October, hearing Welsh cry out murder? - A. Yes, he said the cobler had run away with his watch; I instantly got out of the chair in which I sat, and ran out into the buildings; Welsh was gone out before me; then I went up into Oxford-street; I looked into the public-house, but could not find the prisoner; I immediately returned back to my own apartments.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you gone? - A. Not more than five or six minutes; when I returned, I saw my wife having the prisoner in custody in the passage; then we took him into the room where the watch was stolen from; I asked him if he knew any thing of the watch, and he said he would stand search, and began to rummage his own clothes, and said he had it not; we took him to the watch-house; he was searched, but nothing found upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was never out of the room till they dragged me to the watch-house; I was never in a hobble in all my life, and I am 65 years of age.</p>

               <p>Q. When you were in the street, did you see the prisoner run out of the street into the passage? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Brine.) Remember this man's life is at stake; you went out with the prosecutor in quest of the prisoner? - A. Yes, five or six minutes.</p>

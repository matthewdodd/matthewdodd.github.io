                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Harmondsworth. The prisoner was carman to me and my brother—on Sunday night, the 19th of July, the prisoner, and a boy named Finch, had to go to Kensington with an empty wagon and three horses, for a load of manure—they are not allowed to take any corn for the horses when they go out—it is a general rule foi them to have a truss and a half of hay, but no corn whatever—all my servants were acquainted with that rule—late on that Sunday night I received information of the prisoner being in custody—on the morning of the 20th of July I went to my nag's stable, and examined the bin—it was partly Ml of oats—it had been fastened with a lock before—I found the staple had been drawn—I did not see what had been in the bin before—I compared the oats pro<lb></lb>duced by the officer with those which were in the bin—I believe them to correspond—they were of the same quality exactly.</p>

On Sunday night, the 19th of July, I was on duty at Harmondsworth—about a quarter past eleven o'clock I saw the prisoner come from Mr. Tillyer's premises, with a wagon—I stopped it, and asked what he had in the wagon—he said he had his hay for his horses—I asked if he had any thing else—he said, "No A looked under the wagon, and found, tied to the axletree, a bag containing a bushel of oats—I asked How he accounted for their being there—he said he knew nothing about them—Finch was with him—I said they must consider themselves in custody—the prisoner said he hoped not, that he knew he took them, and meant to give them to the horses—I called Mr. Tillyer up, and showed him the oats.</p>

               <p>Counc. And is it not a Wedding Shop too?</p>
               <p>Hall. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And who was the Parson?</p>
               <p>Hall. I don't know the Person's Name; but 'twas a Man that once belonged to Creed-Church.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how came you to be at the Wedding?</p>
               <p>Hall. I was coming from Work, and was asked to go in and Drink. I knew very little of Holmes, but I have known Ruth the Prisoner many Years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you the Parson's Assistant? Did you stand for Clark?</p>
               <p>Hall. No; I know nothing of the Parson?</p>
               <p>Q. How dost know he was a Parson?</p>
               <p>Hall. I don't know - he had a black Gown on, and I believe, I have heard him Preach at Creed-Church, about 7 or 8 Years ago: I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173709070012"></xptr> the parson himself if he had not, and he said, he had belonged to that Church.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present all the Time the Ceremony was performing</p>
               <p>Hall. Yes.</p>
               <p>C. What, you was Father I suppose</p>
               <p>Hall. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q And how long ago is it, since this Honour was conferr'd upon you?</p>
               <p>Hall. 'Twas the 9th, of last Month.</p>
               <p>Coune. What sort of a Man was the Parson?</p>
               <p>Hall. A very lusty jolly Man.</p>
               <p>Counc. Because there's a Complaint lodged in a proper Court, against a Fleet Parson, whom they call the Bishop of Hell.</p>
               <p>Counc. The Man had a black Gown on, and 'tis not incumbent on us to shew he was in Orders.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never had but one Husband, and that' Woodward.</p>
               <p>C. But here's Hall that says he was Father, when you was Married at the Barber's Shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I'm sure if I was, I was so much in Liquor, that I remember nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why don't you remember you was at the Barber's Shop, - the Hand and Pen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No; I was very Drunk.</p>
               <p>C. Drunkenness is no Excuse in Law, for any Crime. The Jury <rs id="t17370907-15-verdict87" type="verdictDescription">

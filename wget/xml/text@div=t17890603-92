I do not recollect the day, but it is of my own hand writing, and it will express it if you wish to know particularly, I will tell you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you ever give Mr. Baverstock any other order? - Never in my life.</p>

               <p>You are sure of that? - I am sensible of that.</p>
               <p>When did you send him? - The day after his Majesty went to St. Paul's.</p>
               <p>How do you know the draft again? - I know no further than by seeing the writing before, but I imagine it is the same, I sent a draft of Mr. Yeates's to Mr. Yeates's banker; who his banker was, I cannot say; I was in the parlour when the prisoner came back, he came into the parlour, and said, Madam, here is the 100 l. he laid down before me a 50 l. and 30 l. and two 10 l. bank notes; I did not rise from my chair, but says to him, David, put them into that drawer into your master's desk, he will be in, in a few minutes; he did so; Mr. Baverstock came in soon after; he directly said, is David come in? I said yes, there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030129"></xptr>is the money in the drawer; he took out the bank-notes and wrote his name on the back of each; I said to him why do you do so, why? says he, I am but a new beginner in business, and I wish my friends when they see bank-notes, may see my name upon them.</p>
               <p>Do you know to whom they were paid? - No, I know no more of them after I saw my husband put his name on them.</p>
               <p>Did you send any other draft of 100 l. of Mr. Yeates's, or any other person's? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. How long has this young man lived with you as a porter? He has lived in my first husband's time, backwards and forwards eight or nine years; I should not have trusted him if I had any suspicion.</p>
               <p>I believe he assisted you in some things after the death of Mr. Butler; he did assist you with money at that time? - He has brought me money to assist me and my children.</p>
               <p>Court. How much? - Five guineas, and ten pounds after, he had weekly wages a guinea a week.</p>

               <p>Had you been at that drawer the day before? - I am sure I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Then how could you tell what had been in that drawer, if you had not been at it? - We had not money to make a payment, I think it was 49 l. but I am not sure, I can say positively, that we had not six guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When had you looked into that drawer? - The morning before.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a china-man in St. Paul's Church-yard, on the 27th of February Mr. Hill gave an order for some china, and he gave me a draft for 29 l. 8 s. the eight shillings was afterwards deducted, that was upon the house of Mess. Martin, Stone, Foote, and Porter; I had occasion to make use of that draft, after six in the evening, a gentleman from the country called upon me, that I wished to make a payment to, when the bankers being shut, I desired my porter, the prisoner, to get cash for it in the neighbourhood; he went out and got the cash, and at the same time, he brought me a guinea over and above the cash.</p>
               <p>In what way did he pay it you? - In gold, all in cash.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you where he got it? - He told me, he got it of a Mrs. Barlow, that kept a public-house, near at hand; I begged he would go back to Mrs. Barlow, and tell her to be careful in future, for she had given a guinea too much; I sent him back with the guinea. I remember a draft of a 100 l. which was paid into my house on the 24th of April, the day after the King came into the City; that was a draft on the house of Moffat, the draft was paid into my house, I was not at home at the time; that was on the 24th of April, I knew nothing of that, till I came home and received the cash; I found a note of 50 l. one of 30 l. and two 10 l. bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Were there any other bank-notes in the drawer at that time? - No other, I had no other in the house, at that time.</p>
               <p>There was not? - There was no other but what I mentioned; when I saw those bank-notes, I was going to pay them to Mr. Maddock; Mr. Maddock had been at my house; I wished to send them to his bankers, but as I frequently do, I wrote my name on the back of them, it was late in the evening, Mr. Maddock desired me to take them to the house of his banker, at the same time desired me to ask for his book; I did so.</p>
               <p>What payment had you to make to him? The payment of a hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You did make that payment to him? - Yes, I did, by these notes, and he desired me to pay them into his bankers, Messrs. Harrison's; I paid them in there; I only wrote my name on the banknotes, I am sure these are what I paid into Messrs. Harrison's, the same that I found in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen the prisoner write? - Many times.</p>
               <p>You know his hand writing? - Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030130"></xptr>Prisoner's Counsel. You have had dealings with Mr. Maddock the attorney? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Both before and since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you made him any payments shortly before this time? - Shortly before, and very near the time.</p>
               <p>To any amount? - Yes, I paid him a bill, an acceptance of mine; drawn by Mr. Maddock, for two hundred and odd pounds.</p>
               <p>How did you pay that? - In cash and bank-notes.</p>
               <p>It was your custom to write your name on bank-notes? - Frequently so.</p>
               <p>To whom had you paid that previous acceptance? - To Mr. Maddock himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Maddock gave you something in addition, for that 100 l? - Yes, I do not know what it was, I did not examine the paper.</p>
               <p>But you know the amount? - It was fifty-two, or fifty-three pounds, including my hundred.</p>
               <p>Of course you cannot tell of what that other cash, or money, or whatever it was, consisted? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>How many days was it before this, that you had taken up your acceptance? - I cannot recollect; it might be a fortnight, or three weeks.</p>
               <p>You, I suppose, had this entered in Mr. Maddock's books? - It was, I fetched the book way from the banker.</p>
               <p>You say you had not much cash in the house that day? - I had no bank notes.</p>
               <p>Are you certain of that? - Certain.</p>
               <p>Had you any the day before? - That I cannot tell, I cannot say upon my oath I had or had not.</p>
               <p>Had you any the day after? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had you any in the drawer, the day before? - I cannot say whether I had any in the house the day before, or the day after.</p>
               <p>How long was it after this 24th of April? - About three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Now how came you to be sure, that you had no other bank-notes in the house, on that day, when you cannot tell whether you had any the day before, or the day after? - I wanted to make Mr. Maddock a payment of 100 l. and upon that score, I am sensible I had no bank-notes in the house.</p>
               <p>Why did you want to make him a payment of 100 l? - Because I was indebted to him 100 l.</p>
               <p>On what account? - If the Court ask me, I will answer it.</p>
               <p>Do you think to get credit, by answering so? I assure I have no improper curiosity on the subject; was it on an acceptance? - It was a bill not due on that day, nor the day before; it was a bill paid to me, which I got discounted.</p>
               <p>Was it a bill that was necessary to be paid on that day? - No, nor on the day before; it was no acceptance of mine.</p>
               <p>Court. The meaning of this question, in this: whether it was a bill you wanted to pay that day? - Mr. Maddock called upon me that morning, and asked me if I could get him cash for a bill of 150 l. or a 151 l. or something of that amount, I told him. I had not cash enough, I got him cash, by a draft and cash.</p>
               <p>Then it was not for a debt, but to accommodate Mr. Maddock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you no money due on Mr. Maddock the next day, or something about that time? - Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Not to any body else, about that time? - I have bills coming due often.</p>
               <p>Court. You say, this was to accommodate Mr. Maddock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did Mr. Maddock apply to you for it? - That morning; about twelve o'clock, I got a draft for 100 l. for that purpose; the amount of that bill was 50 l. and odd, Mr. Yeates let me have it, Mr. Maddock had only 100 l. that day, that was a sufficiency for him, I let him have the remainder again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Maddock paid in something to his banker? - There was a check, and a draft.</p>
               <p>You told me just now, you did not know what it was? - I got a bill discounted for him, of Mr. Yeates, and I paid Mr. Maddock this 100 l.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030131"></xptr>When did you give Mr. Maddock the remainder of this bill? - Some little time afterwards, I cannot say how long, I believe to the best of my knowledge I gave him an acceptance of my own.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards? - He drew upon me for the remainder, and I accepted the bill, I did not advance cash.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If I understand you right, you are sure you paid in no bank notes, to Messrs. Harrison's, but those you indorsed, as the produce of Moffat's draft? - I am not sure; I paid into Mr. Harrison's all I found in the drawer.</p>

               <p>I am Clerk to Messrs. Martin, Stone, Foote and Porter, I produce a draft for 60 l. with the name of Hill, subscribed to it; I paid this draft, I have the entry in my book of the payment I made (turns to it); this is the original entry made by me at the time: (read) No. 5205, 29th of November 1788. 10 l. No. 4629, 10th of June 1788, 10 l. No. 2988, 7th of January 1789, 10 l. No. 406, 16th of September 1788, 10 l. and twenty pounds in cash.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are you sure you did not pay a 50 l. bank-note, as part of that? - Yes, I am very sure of that, I am very sure upon my oath, that I paid it as described, and no other.</p>
               <p>What day did you pay it upon? - Upon the 28th of March last.</p>
               <p>Have you any entry to whom you paid it? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Have you any recollection to whom you paid that 60 l. draft? - I believe to the prisoner, to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
               <p>I understand you not to be sure? - I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Do you verily believe he is the person? - I do, I looked at him before, and I look at him now, and I believe he is the person, it is not the first draft I paid to him, I believe I have paid two, there was the 29 l. draft of Mr. Hills, I believe I paid it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say this: whether you paid the 29 l. draft, and the 60 l. draft to the same person? - That I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>How was the 29 l. draft paid? - Two 10 l. notes, and 9 l. in cash. No. 3636, 20th of September 1788, 10 l. No. 7507, 12th of December 1788, 10 l. and nine pounds in cash.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Counsel. Yours is a shop of a great deal of business? - A banking-house.</p>
               <p>There are a great many drafts paid in a day? - Yes, I cannot swear positively to the man; but to the best of my knowledge and belief he is the man.</p>
               <p>There were many hundred people in your house that day? - No doubt of that; I have No. 406, the note I paid for the forged draft, with Mr. Baverstock's name upon it, three others are not yet come in.</p>
               <p>Where did you get that cancelled note? - From the Bank of England.</p>
               <p>Who did you receive it from there? - I cannot say who, but from the principal manager, who has these cases.</p>
               <p>Court. That will not do? - Here I have 50 l. and 30 l. 7944, 6th of April 1789, 50 l. 8373, 9th of April 1789, 30 l. each of these have the name of Mr. Baverstock, exactly the same as the 10 l. which I paid for the forged draft.</p>

               <p>Court to Baverstock. You have seen the prisoner write? - I have.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with his character of hand writing? - I am.</p>
               <p>Whose writing do you believe that to be? - To the best of my knowledge, I believe it to be the writing of the prisoner; when it was first shewn to me, before the prisoner was taken into custody, I said I believed it to be his, and do think it was the prisoner's, I believe that to be his hand writing to the best of my judgment, I think it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard, another of the Prisoner's Counsel. That is to say, that from all the circumstances you know, you believe it to be his? - From his writing being familiar to me, I do.</p>
               <p>Is it like his usual hand, the name of Richard Hill? - There are several letters that are like it.</p>
               <p>If it was exactly as his hand writing is, he could not imitate the forgery? - There are some letters in it, which is very much like his manner of writing.</p>
               <p>Why surely you do not mean to say, that you positively believe that to be his hand writing? - To the best of my knowledge it is; I cannot say upon my oath, that it is his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say any more than this now; that you conjecture it to be his? - It is to the best of my knowledge of his hand writing, and I conjecture it to be his; there is a book in my shop, which he daily wrote in.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing more like that, than a similarity of letters? - No Sir, I cannot say there is, the stiffness in the writing in general, is very much like his writing; he has not been with me above four or five months.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Bezat. Have you the draft for 29 l. that you paid? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Let me look at it.</p>
               <p>(Handed to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Hill. Where did you write your draft for 29 l. - At Mr. Baverstock's house.</p>
               <p>Who gave you the paper? - I do not remember, it was upon the desk in his inner room.</p>
               <p>Who was in the room when you wrote the draft? - Mr. and Mrs. Baverstock was in that, or the adjoining room; who were in that part of the room, I cannot say, in the bottom part they were both, I wrote it in the inner room.</p>
               <p>Were both, or either of them, in the inner room? - I cannot pretend to say, I gave the payment to Mr. Baverstock himself.</p>
               <p>Was he with you when you wrote the draft? - I was busy at the time, he was in and out of the room.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect who gave you the paper? - I do not, it was laid before me, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030133"></xptr>I was not apprehensive of any consequences and I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether the prisoner was in the room? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Baverstock. Do you mean to swear, that this draft is in the usual hand writing of the prisoner Coleman? - It is very much like his usual common hand writing, many of the letters are.</p>
               <p>Is it in general, like his common hand writing? - I cannot say the generality is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Look at this, and tell me if you believe this to be the prisoner's hand writing? - Yes, I believe it to be his writing.</p>
               <p>Have you the same reason for believing this to be his hand writing, as you have to believe this draft to be his writing? - From the knowledge of his character, and the familiarity of his hand.</p>
               <p>Do you believe this to be his hand writing? - Yes I do.</p>
               <p>Court. How is the indictment, as to the name of Richard Hill? - Richd: with two dotts.</p>
               <p>Mrs. BARLOW sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner very well; on the 27th of February, I remember him asking me for cash for 29 l. I did not see it, for I could not give him change; I told him, I had not change to give him; he sat down in my bar, and gave the change out of his own pocket, all but a few shillings, which he borrowed of me, to the amount of about 10 s. or 12 s. to make up the change.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing to you on the subject? - No further than he said, he should tell his master, he had the change of me, by reason he did not like they should know he had cash by him, on account they might very likely often want to borrow; I never did change any such note, I have changed several bank-notes, but never any drafts; I delivered a bank note to Mr. Winbolt, I wrote my name upon it; this is the bank-note, I believe I received it from the prisoner, I think I did, I recollect very perfectly changing him a 10 l. bank-note the week before I delivered the note to that gentleman Mr. Winbolt.</p>
               <p>Do you believe that to be the 10 l. note that you changed? - Yes, the note I wrote my name on, I believe it was his, I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Had you any other 10 l. bank-note? - I cannot recollect, I cannot positively swear that I received that from the prisoner, but to the best of my recollection I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I want to shew that the prisoner received that at the banker's, No. 7507,

               <p>Mr. Garrow. We understand that on the 24th of April you had a money transaction with Mr. Baverstock; did you deliver to him a sum of money to carry with other money to your banker's? - Yes, I believe it might be about the latter end of April.</p>
               <p>What was it you delivered to him to carry to your banker? - The sum made up and sent to the banker was 152 l. to the best of my recollection, I delivered a draft upon Vere and Co. for 42 l. and a bank note of 10 l.</p>
               <p>Where did you receive the 10 l. banknote? - I really do not know, I have not the most distant idea where I received it; the only circumstance that induced me to believe that I took a bank-note and draft on Vere and Co. was, because I had just seen my banker's book; and I wish the Court might understand why I presume it to have been so; for I have it not in recollection whether it was cash or bank-note; I am not positive.</p>

               <p>Have you any recollection whether you received that part in cash, and part in banknotes? - I think it very probable that this same bank note was what had been paid me before by Mr. Baverstock; it might or it might not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I apprehended the prisoner and searched him; I found upon him two keys, the key of the street-door, and the key of the room-door; he was asked what these keys belonged to; he said they were the keys of his lodgings, which was at Wild-street at his brother's; he went with us to his brother's, and searched the lodging, he pretended to lodge there; I forgot the street where he did lodge, but he said he lodged at his brother's since Christmas; I found that neither of these keys answered the purpose; I went afterwards with Mr. Winbolt to King's-head-court, St. Paul's Church-yard; I tried the key to the street-door, and the key opened it; we enquired at the barber's, where he formerly lived.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you find any thing there that he has since claimed? - Yes, the other key opened the one pair of stairs door, there I found a 70 l. bank-note, including one bank post-bill; sixty-one guineas in gold, and two half guineas; the gold I returned, the bank-notes are here.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you he had these lodgings in King's-head-court? - No, he went with me to Wild-street; he was asked whether he had any other lodgings; he said no, he lived in Wild-street; afterwards he owned the lodgings, and a number of things that were brought from these lodgings were given up to him.</p>
               <p>After the key did not agree, did the prisoner say any thing about the keys? - He said they were two keys that he picked up.</p>
               <p>Court. The tendency of this evidence is to prejudice the Court and Jury by leading them to suppose that the prisoner had something to conceal; if that something he had to conceal was connected with this charge, it is proper evidence; but if it appears it had no connection with this charge, it is then improper evidence, irrelevant evidence, which can have no other effect then to lead the Jury to suspect that he has been guilty of some other crime.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I submit it is perfectly competent.</p>
               <p>Court. It has been heard now, but I shall tell the Jury it is not to be attended to: I am of opinion, perhaps a little differing from some high authorities, I am of opinion, that if a man files; in order to know what he fled for, it is necessary to know what he was charged with.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then pursuing that, he is charged with forgery, the produce of which is found at the lodging of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Which is not any part of that which was received; therefore any other thing would be just as good evidence as that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In the case of his namesake, was not that evidence, that a great number of guineas were found upon him, not exactly corresponding with the number that was lost; but if, instead of guineas, a quantity of bank-notes had been found in his possession, would not it have been competent evidence?</p>
               <p>Court. This is not money nearly corresponding at all; it is more than double, and where the man is proved to be worth the money.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I state these to be letters intended to be sent by the prisoner, and intercepted by the officers of justice.</p>
               <p>Court. And never delivered to the persons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. The second letter was certainly obtained under the idea that the first was delivered.</p>
               <p>Court. I must have the witnesses who intercepted them.</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. They were sent to me by the keeper of the prison, he is not here, I do not know how he got them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They are proved to be his writing by Mrs. Baverstock.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not see a legal objection to refuse hearing these letters, if they were come at by promise.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Yes, but you see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030136"></xptr>they do nothing, but produce the letters, and prove the hand writing, the persons who received these letters might explain them; there might be some promise, instead of which they are stopped in limine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I apprehend the duty of a Counsel to be this; if they have a case to conduct for the publick, and illegal evidence is put into their hands, they have no power to suppress it; if the Court say it is illegal, that is another thing.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Baverstock. Will you be so good to be very attentive to what I am going to say to you; how long had the prisoner lived in your service, in the lifetime of your former husband? - Between five and six years.</p>

               <p>Was you acquainted with his handwriting; did you see him write frequently; did you ever see him actually write? - I cannot say that I have been present when he has been writing; I have seen that writing afterwards.</p>

               <p>Are you acquainted with the prisoner's hand-writing? - So far as I can judge whether any thing is or is not his handwriting; I can answer so far as to say to my belief.</p>
               <p>Dou you believe, and do not answer that you do, unless you have a conscious belief of it; do you believe that to be his hand-writing? - I do upon my honor, I do upon my oath, and these two also.</p>

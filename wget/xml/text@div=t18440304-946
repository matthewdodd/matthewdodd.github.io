                  </hi>. I live in Paradise-place, New-road, and am a clock movement maker. Last Thursday evening I got drunk and was taken to the station—I lost some money while I was there, but I do not know how much.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 67.) I found Mr. Peaston drunk in Hoxton—I took him to the station—I asked if he had got any money—he said, "Yes"—I saw him take a half-crown from his pocket, one or two shillings, two or three sixpences, and some copper—I had the half-crown in my hand, and noticed a mark on the head of it—I stood cavilling with him about it, and then I gave it him back—he put his money into his pocket and I placed him in the cell—next morning I saw there were several persons who had been locked up in the same cell with him, and amongst them were the two prisoners—I asked if he had got his money safe—he said he remembered having a half-crown and some odd pieces, but he could not tell what—I searched him and found a sixpence and a few halfpence on him—the half-crown was gone—this is the half-crown—I took particular notice of it—I am quite sure the prosecutor had it in his pocket the night before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, P</hi> 6). On 20th January, about a quarter past 6 in the evening, I was on duty in Sydenham, and saw the prisoners in front of me—they both looked back, and then stopped and put something through a hedge into a gentleman's garden—as I went past, Bryant said, "Oh, he is all right, he is nobody"—I was in plain clothes—they walked half-a-dozen yards, and then stopped—I crossed over to the other side, and saw them go back to the spot, and search about in the hedge, apparently looking for what they had put away—Bryant went to the Greyhound public-house, and I saw him have some beer, and get some lucifers, he then went back to Sullivan, struck the lucifers just inside the hedge, they searched for a quarter of an hour, and Bryant then pulled two hares out of the garden—they walked sharply up Laura-park—I followed them till I met two other constables—I then stopped the prisoners, and asked Bryant how he became possessed of the hares—he said, "I bought them"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "I shall not tell you"—on the way to the station he said that he had sold half-a-dozen hares, and had those two left—he produced 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the station, and the sergeant said that it was very little money if he had sold half-a-dozen hares—he said, "We are obliged to spend a great deal, and We want a little beer"—he then said that he had sold no hares, but half-a-dozen rabbits, and that he bought the hares in Billingsgate-market that morning, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of a Mr. Davies—I asked Sullivan when he saw Bryant—he said at 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I asked him if had the hares then—he said, "No,"—I found on Bryant two herrings, which the prosecutor said were bought at his shop.</p>

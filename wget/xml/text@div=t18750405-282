                  </hi>. On 9th March, I was passing along Hoxton Square, about 11.39—the prisoner and some other men attacked me from behind and threw me on my. back—some man that I did not see rifled my pockets, took my money, my keys, and knife—while that was being done the prisoner was kneeling on me with one band on my throat, and the other on my mouth—my trowsers pockets were rifled while in that position—there was a lamp close to me and I could see the face of the man who was holding me as plainly as I can see yours—I could see the man when I got up, he was the last to get away—he ran away, I ran after him, but some old man stopped me and he got away—I went the next morning to the police-station and gave information, and a description of the persons who had attacked me—I gave a description of the prisoner amongst others—on the Saturday evening a policeman called at my place, and I went to the station where I was shown six or seven men—I picked the prisoner out immediately I opened the door—I have no doubt about him at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in New Street, Dock Street—I know the prisoner very well—on the night of Tuesday, 9th of March, I was with him from 5.30 in the afternoon till about 1 o'clock in the morning—we went to the Eagle Theatre, in the City Road, and were there during the whole of the performance—I met him about 5.30 in the afternoon, and we had a drop of ale together, and went to his father's place, where we stayed a little while, till it was time to go to the theatre, and we came out of the theatre about 11.30, and met his father; we went home to his father's place and stayed there till about 1 o'clock, and he saw me home to the corner of Church Street, Shoreditch, where I parted from him—I did not leave the prisoner at all all the evening, except during the time we came out after the first act was over.</p>

I am the prisoner's father—I recollect the 9th March—the prisoner came to my house with a female about 6.35, and we went and had a glass of ale, and he said they were going to the Grecian Theatre—I said "Very well, perhaps I shan't see any more of you to-night"—he said "Oh, yes, you will, because we shall be back to-night"—I waited up till 11.35, and then walked up to the Grecian and met them on the road—we</p>

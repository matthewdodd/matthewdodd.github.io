                  </hi>. I reside at 22, Bear-walk, Bear-gardens, Southwark—on the night of 27th December, I had been at Astley's theatre, and was returning home between half-past 12 and 1—in London-street, Borough, I was waltzing about the pavement, with a piece of holly in my hand—the holly hit the prisoner on the ear—I begged his pardon—he said he wanted no begging pardon—I said, "I did not hurt you much"—he said, "Do you want to fight?"—he followed me, and I said, "I will make you fight"—I did not intend to fight, but I took off my coat, and danced about him—I felt something pierce my neck—I took my coat and ran across the road—the prisoner followed me, and stabbed me in the back—I went across to a doctor's shop, and I was afterwards taken to a surgeon's.</p>

I live at 106, Borough—I was passing down the London-road, and heard the prosecutor and prisoner wrangling—the prisoner pulled out a knife, and stabbed the prosecutor in the neck; then be followed him across the road and stabbed him in the back—I ran after the prisoner and stopped him—I saw him shut the knife up and put it in his pocket—I held him till a constable came, and he was given in custody.</p>

I am a tanner, of 26, South-buildings, Long-lane—I was with Keefe, going home from Astley's theatre—he had a piece of laurel in his hand, and somehow it touched the prisoner's head—the prisoner said that he was no flat, and that the prosecutor should not do that—the prose<lb></lb>cutor begged his pardon—the prisoner said he did not want any pardon, and wanted to fight—Keefe told him he did not want to fight—the prosecutor said he would make him fight—Keefe took off his coat and danced round him, but he did not want to fight—the prisoner rushed at him—Keefe ran away—the prisoner followed, and struck him on the back—Keefe cried out, "I am stabbed"—I went to lift him up, and he was covered with blood—I did not see anything of a knife.</p>

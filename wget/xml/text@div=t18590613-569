                  </hi>. I keep the Holloway Castle public-house in Camden-road—on 19th May the prisoner came there between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening with another man and asked for a bottle of ginger-beer and a pint of porter—one of them drank one, and the other the other—the prisoner put down a shilling—there was some of the ginger-beer spilt on the counter, and the shilling got wet—I gave change, and put the shilling in the till—there was other money in the till, but no other shilling—I put the shilling on the top of the other money—the prisoner and his companion remained one or two minutes, and then his companion called for a Pickwick, which came to a penny—the companion paid for that with a shilling—I tried that shilling with my teeth—it turned out to be bad—in consequence of that I opened my till and pulled out the other shilling all wet as it was—I found that was bad as well—I said they were both bad together, and I rang the bell for the waiter to call the policeman—the prisoner's companion made a bolt out at the door and got off—I detained the prisoner—the prisoner said he had pawned something in the morning and had got the shilling which he had given me from the pawnbroker—I told him it was my belief that his companion had got the <hi rend="italic">swag</hi>—he said he knew that he had got none in his pocket—an officer came and took him in custody—I gave him the 2 shillings—there was no one in the bar but me.</p>

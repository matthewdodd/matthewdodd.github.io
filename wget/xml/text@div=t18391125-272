                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Benjamin Young, of Spa-road, Bermondsey, a glue and size manufacturer. He employs about one hun-dred hands—the prisoner was one of his carmen—it was his duty every morning to get his cart loaded by one of the foremen—on the morning of the 23rd of October I loaded it—I put in six firkins of double—brown size, and twenty-four firkins of single-brown size—Clements, another carman, was to have a load of white size that morning.</p>

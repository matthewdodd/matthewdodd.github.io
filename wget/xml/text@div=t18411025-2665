                  </hi>. I am assistant inspector of letter-carriers. The prisoner has been a letter-carrier in the Post-office about two years and a half—he assisted in delivering letters in the Golden-square district—Great Windmill-street is part of that district delivered by him—Mr. M'Gowan lives in that district—there have been many complaints of letters not being delivered in that district; in consequence of which, on the 14th of October, I enclosed a marked sovereign in a letter, directed to Mr. D. M'Gowan, 16, Great Wind-mill-street,</p>

               <p>Haymarket, London, to be sent into that district—this sovereign now produced is it—I gave the letter to Mr. Boyden, an assistant inspector—I did not see what he did with it—in consequence of what I heard on the morning of the 15th of October, I went in search of the prisoner at hit walk—I did not find him there—I then went to his residence, and after waiting an hour and a half, he came there, about one o'clock—I asked him at what time he had finished his delivery—he said, "About eleven o'clock"—I said that must be false, for I had applied at the receiving-house, and had heard he had been there to sign his card at a quarter after ten—he wished to go into his house, but I would not let him—I brought him immediately in a <hi rend="italic">cab to</hi> the Post-office—he was taken up to Mr. Peacock, the solicitor's room—Peak, the officer, was there, Mr. Peacock, and several others—he was searched—he did not object to be searched—I saw a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and eight or nine shillings in silver taken from his pocket by Peak—the sovereign was the identical sovereign I had put into the letter—I have looked at it—he was then informed that in consequence of com<lb></lb>plaints from different parts of his district, and especially from Mr. M'Gowan, he was suspected of not delivering a letter that morning which was known <hi rend="italic">to</hi> have been in his possession—he was told about this par<lb></lb>ticular sovereign—he said he had brought the sovereign from home that morning—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some fragments of a letter</hi>)—I am quite positive this is part of the letter which enclosed the sovereign.</p>

                  </hi>. On the afternoon of the 14th of October I received a letter from Mr. Playle, directed to Mr. M'Gowan—I locked it up in a drawer till the following morning—I then took it to the seat where the prisoner sat, and in his absence placed it among other letters which he had to deliver that morning—I afterwards saw him return to his seat and take the letters—the day of the month was stamped on the letter, which is the regular stamp put on letters passing through the Post-office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know who put the day of the month stamp on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not—I did not see it put on—it was put on for the pur<lb></lb>pose of making it appear a letter which bad been posted.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

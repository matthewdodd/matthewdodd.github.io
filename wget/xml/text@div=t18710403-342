                  </hi>. On Saturday, 4th February, I was in Deptford, with a friend, and met the prisoner within a few doors of my lodging—she did not speak to me, nor did I address her; but she threw something into my face, which took my senses away, and staggered me into the road—I am sure it was the prisoner—I had seen her that day week—I have been acquainted with her about two years and a half—I was not engaged to be married to her; I kept company with her, and visited her on several occa<lb></lb>sions—the last time I saw her, she had a bundle with some old trowsers she was mending for me, and wanted the money for doing so—I took her to the "Navy Arms," changed a sovereign, and was giving her a shilling—she said "That is no good"—I said "How much do you want for the parcel?"—she said "Two shillings—she said that I should never enjoy the present without getting married to her—I was going to be married to somebody else, and had been called in church—she said that if she had a pistol she would shoot me; or a knife, she would stick it into me.</p>

I was house-surgeon at Guy's—the prose<lb></lb>cutor was brought there, on 5th February, burnt by some corrosive fluid thrown in his face, and has been there ever since—it is quite impossible that he will recover the sight of either eye, the entire orbit is gone, and there is no hope—his evidence was taken the next day, in the prisoner's presence—I examined a bonnet which was given to me, and found it stained with sulphuric acid—the man's clothes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are stained with the same acid.</p>

               <p>I came back on 12th July, and found she had removed to 7, Maze-pond, Bermondsey—my furniture was all safe there then—I went to work again, and on 26th July heard that my wife was in custody—that had nothing to do with this charge—I forced an entrance into the house to which she had removed, in Edward's-place, and missed most of my property—I found some duplicates in the drawers—I have seen some of the things at the pawnbroker's—they are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Ann-street, St. George's-in<lb></lb>the-East. On 12th or 14th July I saw Curtis and his wife at their house at Maze-pond—on the Monday afterwards I assisted his wife to move to Edward-place—I saw the five beds and bolsters, and some pillows, moved there, a watch, some spoons, and a tea-caddy—I went to the house next day, and could not get in—about ten o'clock at night I went again—Callan opened the door—I asked for Mrs. Curtis—she said she was gone to Yarmouth to her husband, and took the keys out of her pocket, and said she had charge of the house—(I heard no more of Mrs. Curtis till I saw her at the police-court)—she said Mrs. Curtis told her she was to remove the goods—I said she was not; I would write to Mr. Curtis, and let him know the circumstances his wife was in—he came to town, I took him to the house, and found all in confusion, and some of the things gone.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 8). On 28th July I took Mason, and told her she was charged with stealing some beds and other things—she said she had nothing to do with stealing them, she merely went to the house to shut the shutters—she afterwards admitted pledging two of the beds for her at Mr. Barrett's—we found them there—Callan was taken on the Friday week afterwards—she said Mrs. Curtis had given her the keys, and told her to pledge the articles, to get a solicitor to plead for her on her trial—I produce seventeen duplicates of articles pledged by Mason, and some in the name of Wood, which she goes by sometimes—they correspond with the tickets, and all refer to these articles.</p>

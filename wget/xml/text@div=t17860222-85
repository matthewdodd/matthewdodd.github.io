            ; I forced into the house, I run up stairs, and saw a window open that I had just before seen shut, I therefore concluded they had got out of that window; that window looks next the fields, the garden is enclosed with a wall, so that if he had got into the garden, he could not get away, I then went down stairs, and there was a hole in the floor in the closet, on the ground floor, and there I saw a stamping-press, a fly with dies fixed, and the halfpence about.</p>
               <p>Was this hole concealed at all? - No, we found a quantity of halfpence in hand-baskets, some were made up in five shilling papers, and one large paper parcel containing six five shilling papers, all tied up in strings; we then took the evidence, and brought the things away in a cart, the next day we went to Carolina-court, Saffron-hill, I went up stairs and opened the door which went with a spring lock, and the prisoner was in bed at nine o'clock; I told him he must get up, he said, he could not, I told him he must, says he, if I get up I cannot walk or stand, says I, then we will have a coach, for you must go with me; says he, what should I go with you for, I was not in the house; in his waistcoat pocket I found these halfpence.</p>
               <p>There was no appearance of any body having been at work that day? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe Parsons was a good deal frightened, was not he? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You told him he would be a fine? - No.</p>
               <p>You told him he would be sent to quod? - No; if you must have it, he was asked who the men were that was up stairs.</p>

               <p>Look at these dies, and that halfpenny; will those dies make a piece of coin like that? - Not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Can you say whether they were made by that? - It is impossible to do that, because two dies may be made as near as possible so that your eye cannot distinguish; these fit that die exactly.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner three months; I went to live at Haggerston, about three weeks before I was taken up, there was Bridges, Heron, a little girl, and my wife.</p>
               <p>What did you amuse yourselves at? - I am a painter, I used to go and see for work, and go of errands.</p>
               <p>What was done in doors? - Coining, your honor.</p>
               <p>How was this business carried on in this house? - A little girl put in the money, Bridges and myself pulled, and Heron worked the edges.</p>
               <p>How long had you carried on this business? - About three weeks, I believe.</p>
               <p>Who was in the house when the officers came? - Mr. Bridges, Mr. Heron, the little girl and my wife.</p>
               <p>What became of Mr. Bridges, and Heron? - They went out your honor, Heron went out into the yard, my wife and little girl went out at the street door.</p>
               <p>Which way did Bridges go out? - I think he went backwards apparently to me to go to the cellar.</p>
               <p>Do you know his handy works again, when you see them, were those the grand things you used to make, look at them? (Shews him the halfpence.) - They appear to me to be like them, there was about half a rush basket full, and some that were old out, I received no money only a bit of victuals, I was to receive nothing, only what my wife gave me, I could not work at the business to get money, I have lost one of my arms.</p>
               <p>Then you never worked at it? - No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Who pulled the fly? - Mr. Bridges, and a little girl put in.</p>

               <p>You swore just now, that Bridges and you pulled the fly, did you never pull the fly with Bridges? - About half an hour, he asked me to try to pull, to lend him a hand, but I never earned any thing at it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever lend him a hand? - Once, your honor.</p>
               <p>Who used to do it in common? - Bridges, and Heron assisted him</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Parsons, you was the only one of the covey that did not escape? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They frightened thee pretty much, did not they, they talked of transporting thee, did not they, do not I speak loud enough for you? - Yes, your honor.</p>
               <p>Did not they threaten you, they would transport thee? - I was affraid, your honor.</p>
               <p>Did not they tell you they would transport you, if you did not tell? - No, your honor, not that.</p>
               <p>What made you squeak then? - Because I did not know the consequences of it; they told me to speak every thing that I knew.</p>
               <p>You was a good deal frightened, cockey? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They have kept you in limbo ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had not been used to these sort of things? - No.</p>
               <p>Who may you have been formerly? - I have been a glazier and painter; I fell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220135"></xptr> out of a window, and cut my arm to pieces, and they cut it off in the hospital; me and my wife lived in this house constantly; Bridges was to come at Lady-day.</p>
               <p>How is your eye-sight? - Very indifferent.</p>
               <p>What light did you use to have when you was at work in the cellar? - I am rather deaf.</p>
               <p>What light had you to work by in the cellar? - Candle-light.</p>
               <p>How many candles? - One at the press, one at the smoothing-engine, and one for the putting-in girl.</p>
               <p>Did you never see Mr. Williams there? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never call Williams by the name of Bridges, and your wife has mentioned it to you? - Yes.</p>

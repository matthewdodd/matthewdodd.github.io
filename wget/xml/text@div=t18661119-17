                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old, and live at No. 9, Canter<lb></lb>bury Terrace, Maida Hill—I was at the corner of Church Street and George Place last Monday, about ten o'clock at night, and met the prisoner, who I did not know before—he asked me whether I would earn a penny by fetching a quarten of gin—I said, "Yes"—he told me to go across to the Nightingale, and gave me a florin—I had no other florin in my pocket, only 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went to the Nightingale, asked for the gin, and put down the florin—the barmaid served the gin out, and then said the florin was bad—she handed it to another lady behind the bar—the landlord spoke to me—he then went out at one door and I at the other—I crossed the road to where I had left the prisoner, but he was not there—I walked across the road, whistled two or three times, and he came up—I put my hand in my pocket and said, "The gin," but I had not got the bottle—he stooped down to take it from me and the landlord took hold of him.</p>

I keep the Nightingale public-house—on the 12th November I followed Davidson across the road to the corner of Church Street—he whistled once and the prisoner came up—the boy made an attempt as if to take a bottle out of his pocket till I came to him—I took him to my house and gave him in charge.</p>

I wanted a drop of gin to take into the Marylebone Theatre, and as there was a man there who I had quarrelled with, I sent the boy in. While he was gone a lady asked me the way to the Marylebone Road, and while I was pointing it out the boy whistled. I went to him, and the landlord took me. <hi rend="smallCaps">

I live at Worcester-cottage, Salisbury-crescent, Wal<lb></lb>worth, and am a soap maker—on Friday night, 21st July, at 9 o'clock, I fastened up my premises—from half-past 11 to 12, I was aroused by my lodger—I went down stairs, and found about 3 <hi rend="italic">cwt.</hi> of soap had been removed from the premises, taken out into the yard, and packed into boxes—half a cwt. of cocoa-nut oil had been taken from a hogshead inside, and put in a small cask—the shop window was broken and unfastened—any person could have unfastened the catch by putting their hand through, and then got inside—I fastened that window myself at 9 o'clock—I know Crud<lb></lb>gington—he has had some goods of me.</p>

I live with the prosecutor—on the night of 21st July, I got home rather late—about ten minutes past 11, I was bound to go to the rear of the premises, and I saw the two prisoners in the yard—I saw Wright by the padlock of the warehouse door, and saw Crudgington cross the yard, and try the sash—they then went over the wall—I went round and found the sash open—they came back over the wall—I went up to the back gates, and heard one of them say, "We will have it now before we go"—I then went up stairs, got my life preserver, and put my slippers on, went out at the front gate, and went round to the rear of the premises—I saw Wright standing at the corner outside our premises with a woman, and saw Crudgington and another man stooping close to our gateway as if they were being sick—they saw me, but did not know me—I then returned through the house to the back of the premises—there is a lamp in Salisbury-crescent, and I stood just outside the back door and had a good view of them—I saw Wright in the warehouse handing soap to Crudgington, who was just outside the window, and he was packing it in boxes—I let them go on for a little time, and then I walked up to Crudgington—he said, "Halloa, my Lord, we have been looking for you long enough; we have got you at last"—I said, "If you don't look out, you may very likely catch something else"—he said, "For God's sake, <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, don't say anything about it; I have done trouble, you know; you know me well enough; <hi rend="italic">I'm Ikey Crudgy</hi>"?—he then escaped over the wall—Wright was then coming out of the window, and fearing I should get a knock myself, I thought the best plan would be to take the first opportunity and give him one, which I did—I hit him with my life preserver, and then caught hold of him and tore his coat and waist<lb></lb>coat—he struggled with me and got away—I had a slight knowledge of him before I have not a doubt but that he is the man—I have known Crud<lb></lb>gington from the beginning of last winter—about half-past 2 the same morning I went with a policeman to North-street, Lock's-fields—Crudgington opened the door—he made no resistance.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, P</hi> 427). In consequence of information I received from the last witness, I went with Wheeler to Crudgington's house—I knocked at the door, Crudgington opened it in about five minutes, and on seeing me he ran to the parlour door—I said, "I shall take you for a burglary"—he said nothing—on 27th July, I was with Sergeant Ham, when we met Wright in York-street, Walworth-road—Ham said to him, "How did you come by that cut over your eye"—he said, "I did it in running"—he afterwards said, "I did it in a drunken frolic"—we told him he was charged with being concerned with another in committing a burglary—he said, "If you take me you will be very foolish; I known you are two detectives"—we were in plain clothes—we took him to the station—he was put with five or six others, two of whom had bandages over their heads, and Wheeler immediately identified Wright as the man.</p>

               <p>Mr. Lawrenceson desired me to come down stairs, and stay with my sister, when he went out. About eight o'clock there was a knock at the door. I went to the door; there was a man had brought a pot of beer to my sister; the prisoner was at the door. The prisoner asked if George was there, that is his master's son. I said he was, and he went down to him in the kitchen: as I was shutting the kitchen window I saw the watch hanging up in the kitchen. He said, whose watch is this? I said mine, not thinking any harm; he said again, whose watch is this? I said Mr. Lawrenceson's. He went out of the kitchen; when he was gone I missed the watch. I said he has got the watch; the apprentice said he would go after him; he came back, and said he could not find him. Presently the prisoner came in, and asked if we had found the watch.</p>
               <p>Has the watch ever been found? - No; it has not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I worked with this gentleman above a twelvemonth with my own tools; his tools and my tools I carried all in one in my apron sometimes to my apartment, and as we wanted them we fetched them. we used each other's tools, his tools were nothing to me, I did not want to sell them; he called me from the shop, and this gentleman took me; he said, he had found some tools in my room; he knew at the same time some must be in my apartment; I have done very imprudent, owing to his not lending me the one pound note.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

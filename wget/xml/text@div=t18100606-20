               <p>Q. What was she a girl of the town - A. Yes, I had known her for fourteen years. I am not a married man. I was speaking to her; the prisoner was unknown to me at that time. A person unknown to me came and knocked me down; the night was dark and rainy. The person that knocked me down came rather behind me; I did not see him; I was stunned immediately; I was cut on the nose; it disfigured me; I should think it was done with some instrument; I was stunned and fell. I did not recollect any thing afterwards till the next morning, I then saw my pockets were turned out. It was Christmas day, I was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was knocked down what became of you. - A. I was led to a house in Titchfield-street by persons more than one, as I was told the next morning, I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that you were robbed - A. I know from the loss of what I missed; before I spoke to this woman I had a one pound note and a gold ring in my pocket, and a silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. When you recovered yourself had you your clothes on or off - A. Off, and my clothes were in the room; it was not where I did lodge, but where I used to lodge. When I came to dress myself one of my breeches pockets was turned out, where I had these things they were all missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your nose badly cut - A. Very bad indeed, and both my eyes were very bad.</p>

               <p>Q. You know Mr. Dukes do you - A. Yes, I have known him fourteen years. On the 25th of December Mr. Dukes met me in the Haymarket, about half after eleven at night; I was in Tichbone-street with another young man. I met Mr. Dukes by a wine vaults; I do not recollect whether I asked him, or he me, to go in to have something to drink; the young man, me, and Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060016"></xptr>Dukes, went into the wine vaults; Mr. Dukes could not pay for the liquor, he had not got any thing less than a one pound note, he pulled the one pound note out; the young man paid for the liquor, it came to sixpence; we came out and stood talking a little while, then Mr. Dukes and me took a walk down to Coventry court together, and as we went down the Haymarket, at the corner of Coventry-court, I saw no person near but the prisoner; I have known the prisoner three or four years, he is a butcher by trade, and at the corner of Coventry-court the prisoner knocked Mr. Dukes down without saying a word; Mr. Dukes fell, I cannot tell what part he struck him his back was towards the prisoner; when he knocked him down I did not observe any thing in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Dukes was struck down did he continue on the ground - A. He fell on his face; immediately as he fell I went to assist him, and screamed out; I stooped to pick him up, there was some instrument came and cut me across my right eye, I fell with the cut; the watchman or patrole took me into No. 12, Coventry-court. I do not know nothing further from the loss of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you so stunned by receiving this cut, that you did not know what passed afterwards - A. Yes, this shawl that I have on was covered with blood; I cannot swear that the prisoner cut me, but I can swear that the prisoner knocked down Mr. Dukes, but I could not swear that he robbed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you brought any of the people at whose house you were carried in Coventry-court - A. No, I did not know there was any occasion, I thought if it was necessary, Mr. Bly would do it.</p>

The female servants and myself were at home on the 15th of January, and went to bed about ten o'clock, leaving the house all fast; I sleep on the first floor. After twelve o'clock, I heard a tapping, and then saw the glare of a candle pass my room door, which was not shut to - I rose up in bed and asked who was there, a man said,</p>
               <p>"Never you mind." I got out of bed, and two men met me at the door; one of them had a pistol; they induced me to lay down, and having no arms, I complied - they asked me where the plate was; I said my mistress had got it in town; they then went into my mistress's bed room on the same floor as mine, and broke open some locks; they then went out of that room into the best bed room. I heard them opening the locks there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did both the men leave your room - A. No; one of them remained with me, and the other went away; while he was with me, I heard some other person in the house; I heard two persons talking together - one of those who had been in the bed room said to the one who was with me,</p>
               <p>"Blow his brains out," this was after I said there was no plate, there was some in the room I heard them go into - I heard them breaking locks open, and while they were doing so, I heard one of them say,</p>
               <p>"D - n him, blow his brains out." The two went down stairs; the man still remained with me - one of them called out from the bottom of the stairs,</p>
               <p>"Riches," and then the man left me. The key of my room was inside the door when I went to bed; I found it afterwards outside - the man returned to me in about five minutes, he opened the door, looked in, and said,</p>
               <p>"Are you all right," I said I was there, he then went away, and my door was then fastened. I got out at the window in about ten minutes, and went to a neighbouring farm-house, and got assistance; I returned to the house and found the front gate open, which I had locked over night. I found the scullery door open, which was fastened the night before, and the glass of the window broken; there was room enough to admit a man through the casement - the scullery leads into the kitchen. I found property laying about, and in the best bed room there was a bundle of wearing apparel packed up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any opportunity of seeing them - A. I only got a glimpse of them; the candle was not brought into my room - I heard three speak in the room, and it was a different voice which called out Riches, it was not the same voice which said,</p>
               <p>"D - n him, shoot him;" I think there were four voices, I am certain there were three; one spoke in an Irish tone. Cochran had lived with my mistress - I cannot say whether either of the voices were like his. I am sure I made the house fast. One man was taller than the others.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Kelly. The gardener alarmed me when he came from the farm-house. I came down stairs, and found a door broken open in the best bed-room, where the plate and other valuable articles were kept; the plate was gone - I went into the cellar where there was a large box containing candles, which was locked and safe when we went to bed; it stood on a wine bin in the cellar - it was broken open, and a good many candles had been used from it. The matches are kept in a cupboard in the kitchen; I found they were burnt all over the lower part of the house, and we found a great deal of candle grease on the carpet by the best bed room door. I left the things in the same state until my mistress saw them.</p>

            . I am a widow. I was in town at the time of the robbery - I heard of it next morning went home immediately, and found things in great disorder, and my clothes laying on the bed room floor. I had left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200004"></xptr>some drawers unlocked, and from those drawers the things were taken - there was a very strong closet in the wall of the best bed room, it appeared like a door going into another room; I locked that closet myself when I went to town, and took the key with me. I left plate, and a variety of property there; I found it forced open and the things taken away - I had left a plate box with four dozen table spoons, two dozen silver forks, a silver vase and cover, a fish knife, two silver ink bottles of Bramah's construction, a gold pencil case, and snuff box, they were all gone. My dressing box was also broken open, and from that a gold curb watch-chain was taken, also the silver bottles, and some ribbons were taken. I had had the ribbons since 1809; I had them when I was shipwrecked off the East Indies, and they were valuable to me on that account - I kept them in my dressing box where I was in the habit of frequently seeing them. I think I saw them the day before I went to town - I know them by one being of a particular pattern, and they are stained with sea water. I had left a watch hanging over the chimney piece in my bed room - that was gone, it had a black ribbon, seal, and a key, attached to it - but when I saw it at Bow-street, it had the same seal, and key, and the curb chain attached to it, the ribbon was gone. Cochran lived seven months in my service, and left on the day of the Coronation. The candles were kept in a coal cellar next to the kitchen; the door was pannelled, so as to represent the wall, and when the kitchen door was open, three parts of it would be covered - I think when the kitchen door was open nobody could suppose a door was there. The candle box was on a bin in the cellar. When I was in the country, I kept my money in a chest of drawers in the dining room - when I went to town, I never left it there; I do not know whether Cochran was acquainted with that, he knew I kept it there when at home. The four dozen spoons were worth 24 l.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 21st of January, about twelve o'clock, I was going down Chandos-street, towards St. Martin's-lane, and saw Osborne, Cochran, and one Brown - I met Sayers, and we followed them into St. Martin's-lane, and saw Osborne and Cochran go up under the Golden Cross gateway - I laid hold of Osborne, and took him over the way to Mrs. Mountains, into the back parlour; when he got in, he shifted something from his pocket to the floor, he slipped it down inside his trowsers, his hand was in his pocket at the time; I observed him fumbling his hand about, and his watch came out at the bottom of his trowsers on the floor; he stamped his foot on it - I said it will do you no service, I shall take you to justice all the same; he got out of my hold, picked up the watch, and threw it against the fire place - I secured him; upon searching him, I found a gold repeater, a black ribbon, seal, and key, also a belcher silk handkerchief. I was with Sayers when he took the other man. Cochran gave the name of Morrison.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. This was five days after the robbery - A. Yes. I knew nothing of the robbery at the time. The gateway is a very public place. The watch glass was broken.</p>

I took Cochran into Mrs. Mountain's, and searched him; he gave me the name of Morrison - he attempted to escape from me with a great deal of force, while Osborne was being searched; I forced him into the parlour, he immediately jumped on the table, lifted up the window leading into the yard, rolled out, and fell down into the yard, about fifteen feet - I went down and took him again, he walked into the parlour; I searched him, and found a pocket handkerchief, and two keys on him.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I searched Clare's apartments at No. 3, Middlesex-court, Drury-lane, and found a pistol, not loaded, concealed in a cupboard behind a partition, at the head of the bed. I found the ribbon in a deal chest which was not locked; Clare claimed the ribbon at Bow-street - he said it was given him by a young woman, who was gone to America, three years ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Clare was not in custody when you found them - A. No; he was attending the examination of the prisoners, at the time I brought it to the office. Clare was then at the bar - the ribbon was not put in his hand, it laid on the table before the Magistrate; I believe he said he had used part of it to tie up his arm when he was bled.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Justice ask him,</p>
               <p>"Had you any ribbon in your box" - A. I believe it was to that effect, but it laid on the table before him, about four yards from him; he asked to see the ribbon at the last examination, but it was not there then - at the first examination, he said it was given to him. The pistol is rather fowl inside, and does not appear to have been recently used.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. When the ribbon was produced at the first examination, had he not a full opportunity of seeing it - A. He had. Both him and Osborne asked to see it at the second examination, but it was not there.</p>

            . I am solicitor to the prosecutrix. I attended the examination, and heard what Clare said, he was brought to the office, in the middle of the examination of the other prisoners, he was first brought close to the Magistrate's table - Sir R. Birnie produced the ribbon, and asked what account he had to give of those ribbons, which were found in his box, he was within a quarter of a yard of them - he said they were given to him three years ago by a young woman, who was gone to America; Sir R. Birnie then ordered him to be put to the bar with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200005"></xptr>other prisoners - I know this was not taken down in writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How often did you attend before this - A. Once; I believe Mr. Price attended, I cannot say he attended professionally for them, but at the next examination Osborne said he had an attorney at the two former examinations, but he had not said a word for them, and it was of no use to have him. I attended three examinations, but there had been others. Sir R. Birnie sent for Clare, and directly he came Sir Richard held the ribbons up, and asked how he came by them, and was told there were three pieces - he said there should be four, and they were given him three years ago, by a young woman who was gone to America, and that he had used one to bind his arm after being bled.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How many examinations were there - A. Clare was there first on the 7th of February, there had been three examinations before that; I had seen him at one of these examinations, Sir R. Birnie, sent for him, and put a few questions to him, as it was said Osborne lodged with him; but Mr. Birchs's foreman spoke in his favour, and he was suffered to go at large; he was at large several days before he was taken again. I understood Osborne to be some relation of his. Brown and one Woodley were also taken on this charge.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. When Clare was let at large the ribbon was not found - A. No. He was questioned on the 4th of February, and taken again on the 7th.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 4th of February, I went with Chapman to Middlesex-court, and found the ribbon which I produce. Clare was being questioned while we were searching his lodging, he was not in custody when we returned. I kept them till he was in custody. The prosecutrix saw them at the office on the 7th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who told you where the lodging was - A. I heard him tell the Magisstrate he lived there, and that Osborne lodged at the same place. The ribbon was at the bottom of his box. There was nothing but old worn out clothes there.</p>

            . I know the watch to be my mistress's; I saw it on the 15th, in the bed-room.</p>
               <p>COCHRAN'S Defence. One morning when Osborne was in a public-house, I saw him buy the watch of three men, but I did not know the watch then - they would not let me see it. When we came down St. Martin's-lane, I did not observe that Osborne was in custody - I went up the gateway, and saw the officer with him. The reason I escaped out of window was because I was afraid of being taken for a small debt which I owed.</p>
               <p>OSBORNE'S Defence. I was in the public-house this morning, and bought the watch of three young people who called me aside; Cochran came too, and they told me to take him away - I bought the watch for 25 s., and told them they had taken me in and sold me a metal chain for a gold one. I had no conversation with Cochran. I was in St. Martin's-lane, they took me, and as I came out of the gateway, I saw the man I bought it of running up the lane as hard as he could, and the officer collared me then, but not before.</p>
               <p>CLARE'S Defence. I have no knowledge of the ribbons, I have no deal box in my room. I went to the office two or three times before I was taken. Scott asked where I lived and worked; I told him, he took my direction down in his book - he left word with Osborne that I could find him when I choosed, at a public-house; I suppose he wanted me to give him money. The prisoner's attorney advised me to go out of the way till they were committed; I said I should not, but went to work as usual till Thursday, though they had searched my room on Monday. I said there were four pieces of ribbon, but there had been seven; I had used three when I was bled - I had not seen them for four months.</p>

             re-examined. I collared Osborne, and then Brown began to run, but not before, I am positive. I am sure they were all three talking together several times between Chandos-street, and St. Martin's-lane, Clare gave me his right name.

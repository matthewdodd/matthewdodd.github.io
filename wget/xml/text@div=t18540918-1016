                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, D</hi> 21). On Thursday morning, 7th Sept., I was on duty in Park—road, Regent's—park, about half past 2 o'clock, and saw the prisoners come out of the park through Hanover-gate; they turned into South—bank—Everest, another policeman who was with me, followed them—they went down Hanover—cottages—when I got to the top of Alfred—place, the prisoners passed me again—they kept straight along South—bank in company—I went after them, stopped them in St. Johns—wood, and asked them where they came from—Adams said they came from Portland—town; he had this stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand—I asked them where they got it; they said they picked it up—I asked them which way they had come from Portland—town; they said, "Straight down the road"—I said, "No, you came through the Park," and Ambrose said, "Yes, we did"—I said, "What have you got about you?" and took hold of Ambrose to search him—he said, "I will show you what I have got; put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out some money—one of the pieces fell, but I could not see what it was; he stopped to pick it up, and by stooping he got out of my hold, and got away; it had rolled behind Adams—I ran after him, and he was stopped by policeman, 168—I had not lost sight of him—I brought him back through Alfred—place; we met two other constables, and took the prisoners to the station—I there searched Ambrose, and found these eight patent keys, one of which I believe to be a skeleton key; a silver penny, a silver halfpenny, a card case, a medal, two silver foreign pieces, some matches, and a mask (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I searched Adams, and found on him a tobacco box, a glove, a thimble, and a piece of velvet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went with the other two constables into Alfred—place, where Ambrose ran through.</p>

On 7th Sept., about a quarter past 5 o'clock in the morning, I was going up Alfred—place; it was light—there is a wooden fence, between four and five feet high, separating the road from the gardens—I saw a piece of satin over the fence; I reached it with a stick, and found in it these sugar tongs, three spoons, bracelet, pair of pliers, brooch, two pairs of castors, pair of coat studs, and several beads (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I pointed out the place to the two sergeants.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Roger Fenton, of No. 2, Albert-terrace, Regent's—park. These silver articles and this card case are his; I saw them safe a week before they were stolen—this brooch is mine; it was safe in the kitchen at 8 o'clock, or half past, on this night—these sugar tongs were in the dining room; these spoons were kept in the kitchen—these buttons are my master's—on 7th Sept. I closed up the house, and went to bed about half past 10 o'clock; my master was from home, and there was no one in the house but me—all the windows and doors were fastened, except the landing window, and that was shut down when I went to bed—I heard a noise in the adjoining room about 2 o'clock, having first heard a noise on the staircase—(I slept in the front bedroom, on the first flight)—I got up about a quarter past 2 o'clock, and gave an alarm out of the window—a policeman came in about two minutes; he let himself in, as the front door was open—I had locked that door, and taken the key up stairs with me—I saw the policeman find this small screw driver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the dining room table—a small travelling chest had been broken open in the dining room, and they had found the key of the sideboard and unlocked it, but nothing was missing—the key was kept in a small box in the room—the entrance had been effected by the staircase window, I found it open—it opens by raising and is big enough for a man to get in at.</p>

Between the 1st and 22d of July, I lost fourteen yards and five-eighths of blue cloth, worth 15 l. I saw it in the cutting room on the 1st of July, which is at the bottom of my garden, and connected with the dwelling-house, it is all enclosed by one wall. On the 22d of July I accused the prisoner of moving some calico, he said he moved it to measure some ferret, this roused my suspicion. I measured my cloths over, and missed this; and went to his lodging, where I found him. Mr. Hall, said in my presence,</p>
               <p>"I am come to take you into custody, and where is Mr. Sadler's property;" the prisoner went to a table and delivered up five duplicates, three of them were for the property stolen; he said he was sorry for it, and hoped I would not prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you not tell him if he would go with you and finish a jacket he was about, you would give up the prosecution - A. No, not any thing the sort; I asked him to return and finish one which he was working on, with a view to get him apprehended, and he did return. I have known him a long time, and have been his friend all through life, and supplied him with money when starving, and introduced him to my friends - I did not lead him into expences. I have seen a person who passes as his wife, but cannot say whether he is married.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Barker, pawnbroker, Holborn. I have three lengths of cloth, pawned by the prisoner at three different times, at the beginning of July, for 6 l. 7 s., one pledge is for 3 l., we advance more than half the value of the article.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is very difficult to ascertain the identity of cloth without a mark - A. Certainly, there is no mark on it. I produced a wrong piece of cloth at the office, and the prosecutor swore that that was his by the list; that was pawned by the prisoner's father, who is a respectable master tailor; he belongs to a respectable family.</p>

            . His evidence at Marlborough-street was not as he now says. I produced the cloth, he took hold of it, examined it, and the clerk took down his deposition; and after he swore to the cloth, I said, by referring to my tickets, it was not the cloth, but some the prisoner's father had pawned; and at the second examination I brought the right cloth. The duplicates produced are what I gave for this cloth.</p>
               <p>MR. SADLER. There is a mark on this cloth which enables me to speak to it; they were in one piece when they came to my house, and here is the end on one piece. I can swear to it from the shade and list, there are as many different shades in black as blue. I lost cloth of the same sort as the others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. All black cloth has the same shade with what is dyed at the time - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Did the deceased return the d - n to the prisoner? - No, Sir, he did not; the prisoner said, d - n your blood I will pull your wheel off; so do, says the deceased; then the prisoner came on the inside of our dray, on the left hand; the prisoner brought his horses from behind the dray to the left till he got past the dray; he turned his horses head towards the middle of the road; he said nothing but run over the deceased's head.</p>
               <p>How did it happen? - Mr. Carpenter fell down, the wheel cut his shoe and broke his buckle, and threw him down; he fell down to the left and the wheel went over his head; I was on the off side of our dray and the prisoner was on the near side of his horses; he had three horses; I am a carter; I have been so above thirty years; I know the road well.</p>
               <p>In one cart passing another that is before it, which is the usual and proper side to pass on? - When we are following a carriage, and there is a stoppage, our place is to turn to the right hand.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Leaving the carriage you pass on the left hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This man passed to the left instead of the right? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he any room to spare? - No great quantity.</p>
               <p>When he had got past the cart he was then close to the left hand side of the road? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then was it not necessary for him to turn his horses to the right, to get into a proper part of the road again? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Do you think he saw where Carpenter was at the time he turned his horses to the right, from your judgment where you stood? - I do not know he did, nor I cannot say he did not.</p>
               <p>As well as you could observe at the time did it appear to you that he intended to drive against the horses, or his cart against the man? - No, Sir; I do not think so, I think that when he said d - n your blood I will pull your wheel off, I take it he intended to hit the wheel, but not the man; the prisoner did not look back, he went on, I followed him and brought him back; I said to him, do you see what you have done here, says I, you have done wilful murder; and he made me answer, it was an accident.</p>

               <p>When the dray stopped, whereabouts was the foremost of the three horses of the cart? - Close up at the back of the dray, as near as possible; the prisoner said d - n me what did you stop here for, get out of the way, and he said he would not; then he said if he did not get out of the way he would pull his wheel off; the man fell down about eighteen inches before the wheel, how he was thrown down I cannot tell, I did not see any thing hurt him.</p>

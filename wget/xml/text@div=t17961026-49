             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a waterman; I was on board the ship Burton on the 13th of October; the prisoner was a lumper, I saw him come out of the ship about six o'clock in the evening, which is the time the lumpers usually leave work; there was a lighter, named the Lucretia, between the ships, she was loaded with logwood; the lighter was discharging her cargo at the time; I saw the prisoner stand in the lighter and hand some of the logwood to the other lumpers, into a boat that was lying by, and then he came into the boat, and stood in the fore-part of the boat, along with the logwood. I then boarded the boat, I was in a boat of my own, I took hold of him, and found he had sugar concealed, and I desired Hill to take him into custody; Hill searched him, and took the bag of sugar from him in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of logwood was there in the boat? - A. Six pieces; these are the same; the prisoner was rather obstreperous, and got into their boat again, and one of the lumpers said, let us heave it over-board; I took the cutlass and struck him on the back with it, and made him go back in to our boat; he offered me a guinea to let him go.</p>

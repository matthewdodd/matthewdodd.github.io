               <p>I know this house of Mr. Hunt's in New-Ratcliffe-row; I was there the 12th of August, in the evening, about half after eight; I staid there till near ten; I observed two men lurking about from half eight till near ten; the prisoner is one of them; I told Mr. Hunt of this; the first of my seeing them, I was coming home from my work, from Mr. Adams's in St. Ann's-lane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What are you? - A buckle maker.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Ratcliffe-row; I saw these two men looking through Mr. Hunt's paling; one of them looked at a ditch, and said, I fancy it is something to let water out of the gardens; I did not take any notice of them; I went home to my wife and fetched her a pail of water, in going, I saw these two men again, and coming back, I saw them coming back; I fetched another pail, and saw the two men again; after supper I went out again, and heard something snap; I thought it was some bar of some window; I looked at the bars of Mr. Hunt's windows, and saw them safe; I came in again, and looked round the front of the house, and saw nothing misplaced; I could see the back of the house; I went into my own habitation, and saw no more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You know the prisoner lives just upon the spot? - I do not know it.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Redgrave? - No time at all; I have seen him several times, not to be acquainted with him; I may have known him for these twelve months as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>You have been a good deal with him since this matter? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Why you came with him to day? - I have been with him to day; he did not pay my reckoning; I have seen the other runner.</p>

               <p>(The towels produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You did not go to Taylor's house till the 20th? - No.</p>

               <p>You had the information on the 12th? - Yes, as to the snuffers, I think Taylor said, he had had them six months; it was the second time I found the picklock key.</p>

               <p>Mr. Hunt. These are my snuffers, and this is my tea-board; they were both in my house the day of the robbery; I cannot speak to the linen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What do you know the snuffers by? - By some particular spots of rust at the point, and on the box, and under the screw; I am positive these are my snuffers, and were in my house that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath had not you pawned these snuffers before your house was broke open; I had, and that very afternoon fetched them home; I am positive of that.</p>

               <p>Is she a servant of your's? - No, she was at work for my brother's wife; she was taken up on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Will you positively say, you had not pawned these snuffers, and that they were not in pawn the day your house was broke open? - I say, that positively they were pawned, and were fetched out that afternoon by a brother of mine who is here.</p>

               <p>When you saw that waiter the first time, did you venture to assert positively that it was your property? - I was clear it was my property; the prisoner asked me if I would swear to it; I said it was; but I should not swear to it; I did not say, that I did not know whether it was my property, but I could fetch those that were sure; my wife did not know it; she did not take it in her hand; I identified it before ever I came to the justices or the office.</p>
               <p>Did not you say you had doubts yourself, but would fetch those that did know it? - I did not say those words, I never had any doubt.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any doubt how? - None at all, it is a thing that we have had in our house these ten years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Brockney. You were present at the time this tea-board was found, did not Hunt say so? - Hunt never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>His wife, however, did not know the waiter? - I believe she might say so, I do not know whether she did look at it or not.</p>

               <p>Do you know these towels? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Whose property are they? - They are mine, they were in my house the night of the robbery, I am very sure of it; part of them has been dirtied since they were taken, but I will swear they are my towels; the snuffers are my property, the waiter is my property; the reason why I said otherwise was, I just cest my eye upon it and it was bent down; and here is another mark here which I will swear to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told them to search every where; they found this waiter; the magistrate held this waiter to Mrs. Hunt, she said it was not her property; then Mr. Hunt said, if you will not swear to it I will.</p>

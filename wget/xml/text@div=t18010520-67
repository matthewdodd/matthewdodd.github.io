               <p>Q. Have you ever found your box? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other witness? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Door-keeper. Here is another witness, my Lord. (The witness called in.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Cook.) Did you know this witness before? - A. Yes; he spoke to me yesterday; I was talking about this, and he said he would go with me for charity's sake.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other witness come into the house where you lived? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever speak to this witness before yesterday? - A. Yes; I know him by eye sight, but I never saw him, nor know whether he knows any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a friend or a stranger? - A. Quite a stranger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How many months after you had been robbed was it before you went to the Grand Jury to find a bill? - A. It was between two and three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me understand you correctly; might it have been more or less; was it four months? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. I see the bill is found in December, and I know that the Sessions were on the 3d of December; if you were robbed between two and three months before December Sessions, how can you swear that you were robbed on the 29th of October? - A. I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you know there is a 40l. reward if you and your helpmate can convict that honest man at the bar? - A. If I had had as much money as he, I dare say I should not have been asked so many cross questions.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know you shall have 40l. if you can convict that honest man? - A. I do not want any thing but justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know there will be a reward of 40l. if you can convict him? - A. No; I can get as good a character as any poor girl in England.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear that there was a reward of 40l.? - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is such a thing as an indictment for perjury, I suppose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that neither? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never, in the course of your life, heard that there is a reward of 40l. for convicting a man of a highway robbery? - A. To the best of my opinion I never did.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you not conscious that you have heard of such a thing as a reward of 40l.? - A. No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200053"></xptr>Q. Have you never said, that it was in the month of August that you were robbed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you lived in Spitalfields, in what month? - A. The same month that that happened.</p>
               <p>Q. What month was it you lived in Spitalfields, was it summer or winter? - A. Winter, the beginning of winter; I used to go backwards and forwards there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not I understand you to say, you lived servant to some milk people for three days? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in summer or winter? - A. Winter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live after that? - A. I went to lodge in Union-court, and then I went to live in Field-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live before you went to Spitalfields? - A. At that man's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that he was a publican, and kept the house in which you lodged? - A. His wife used to keep the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean, upon your oath, to swear, that you believe his wife kept the house? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that the man himself kept the house? - A. I cannot tell whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe it; did you see any body else act as the master of the house? - A. Yes, a great many; it was very seldom I saw him in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him take money for beer in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in his house drinking since you were robbed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never at his house since October last? - A. Yes; since the bill was found against him, I went inside the door, and out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been in and out repeatedly since the bill was found? - A. No, I have passed the house; I have never been in his house since the bill was found.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Yes, you have sworn just now, that you have been in the house - have you been in his house or not? - A. Not since the bill was found against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you swear you have not been in the house since the bill was found against him? - A. No, I never was, but only at the door to call a man out.</p>
               <p>Q. I will prove that you have been there more than once, twice, or thrice: now, upon your solemn oath, have you never been there but once to call the man out? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you think it worth while to go on, gentlemen?</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. Certainly not, my Lord.</p>

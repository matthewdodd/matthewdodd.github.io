               <p>Q. Did he lose two trusses of hay on the 31st of August last - A. I missed more than two, I only found two of them again, the hay was taken from the stack to a garden one hundred and fifty yards distance. The stack stands <placeName id="t18100919-76-crimeloc424">behind St. George's Hospital</placeName>

               <p>Q. Had any quantity of trusses been cut and bound up in bundles - A. Yes, eighteen, I saw them in the evening after the man left his work, his name is Wigan. In the morning, soon after sun rising, I went to the stack, I missed three, there remained fifteen. I had information at one o'clock that there were two in Porter's garden, I went there it was removed, there were the marks of hay having been there; I went to the prisoner's premises, where I saw two trusses of hay on the barrow, he lives in Michael-row, Brompton about a mile from our premises, he is a milkman, and keeps four or five cows. The officer asked the prisoner how he came by this hay, he said he bought it and paid for it.</p>

            . I am an officer; on the 31st of last month, Ching came to me, I went and apprehended the prisoner, I asked him how he came by that hay, he said he would not tell me where he got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Ching must have made a mistake, when he said the man said he had bought the hay, I was with Ching all the while, he never told me he bought it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought that hay, I gave five guineas for the half load, they took me when I was milking my cows, I had not an opportunity of sending for any body.</p>
               <p>The prisoner alled four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

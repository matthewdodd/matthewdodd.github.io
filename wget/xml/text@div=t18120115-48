On the 6th of January, between two and three in the afternoon, the prisoner came into Mr. Lamming's shop, she bought a small quantity of flannel and callico, altogether to the amount of seven shillings and a penny; she staid in the shop near ten minutes after she had paid me; at that time I was serving another customer; she came close to the counter and desired me to give her threepence to get a pint of beer; she smelled strong of liquor, but did not appear to be tipsey; I told her it was not our manner of doing business, neither would I give her any thing. I then had occasion to go to a different part of the shop, when leaving that place she had hold of a green print, she was still standing by the counter, and on my return the prisoner had left the shop, and the green piece of print was gone also.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons at the counter besides the prisoner - A. Probably there might be a dozen in the shop, and four or five at that counter. I went out in pursuit of the prisoner, I catched sight of her about forty yards from the door, on the same side of the way as Fleet Market; I stopped her and asked to look in her apron; in her apron I found three pieces of print.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the other pieces of print was there the green piece of print - A. There was. I charged her with having stolen them, she said she had got nothing but what she paid me for, and she would not go back with me; I insisted upon her going back, and then she went with me; I kept hold of her arm. When we had got halfway she tumbled one piece of print out of her apron, which I took up and carried in my hand. She then went quietly with me into the shop. I sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon examining these three pieces were you able to say they belonged to your master - A. I am; they are his property. There was nobody serving at that counter at the time but me. I had not sold them to her, nor did she ask for any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of yards did they contain - A. Near seventy yards; they cost my master, I suppose, between four and five pounds; they all contained the private mark.</p>

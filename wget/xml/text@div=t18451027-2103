                  </hi>. I keep the Queen's Head in Cambridge-road—on the afternoon of the 15th of Oct. the prisoner came with ten pieces of paper under his arm—there were two men in my house about ten minutes before—the prisoner told me that he had taken it over the way to Mr. Reed, the paper-hanger, that it was made for him, but he had not got the money to pay for it, and would I buy it—I said I did not want it—I took it to a builder at the back, and he told me to buy it—the prisoner said he was a manufacturer and worked for himself—he and the other two men were then together—the other men said it was cheap—I bought it of him for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave it up to the policeman the next day—this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Roper, the younger, a paper-stainer, at Shadwell—the prisoner was in his employ—I saw him on the premises on the 14th of Oct., between eleven and twelve</p>

               <p>o'clock in the day—this paper is the property of Mr. Roper—I tied it up—the prisoner had on one occasion purchased six pieces of paper at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece—he came to me on Monday morning the 13th, and said he wanted some paper for a job of his own—I told him there were ten pieces which he might have at 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece, referring to this lot—he refused them, saying they were too dear—on the morning of the 15th I saw Mr. Roper and Mr. Reed—I went to Mr. Glazier's and saw this paper there—I then went to the factory and set the prisoner to work—Mr. Glazier came and identified him as the man who sold him the paper, and I gave him in charge.</p>

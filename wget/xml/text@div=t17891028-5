               <p>I suppose you was not very sober? - I was so sober, I knew where I was; I was as sober as I am now; I did not like the place I was in, and I would not drink any thing.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing to you, at the time they were turning your pocket out? - Yes; they threatened me with words.</p>
               <p>What words? - Says they, we want your money; as soon as I found my money gone, I made away as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>What were the threatening words? - You rascal, and such audacious names; they told me they had my money, and wanted my clothes off my back; I never saw the man before in my life; I had no quarrel with him, nor no words; all the words I had with them, was because I would not go with them; I am perfectly sure they are the two women; I never saw them before to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The next day morning, he took me up, and asked me if I was frightened? I told him, no; I knew nothing about it; he came back again to the publick-house, and said, I believe you are frightened, here is two-pence to drink; then I saw no more of him till the night.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The next morning, she denied ever seeing me; I gave her two pence to buy her a glass of gin, in the street; I told the officer to let her go, because she said she was not the woman.</p>

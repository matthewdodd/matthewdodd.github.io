                  </hi>. I am landlord at the Bricklayer's Arms in South Milton-street—on Thursday, 17th January, between 11 and 12, the prisoner came and asked for half a quartern of gin, which came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served him; he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in payment—I examined it and immediately saw it was bad—I gave him the change, and he immediately left—I made a hole in my pocket and put it inside the lining—I had no other shilling in that pocket; it is a pocket I never keep money in, under any consideration—it remained there till Monday the 21st, and it was by itself all that time—I gave it to the policeman Peck—on Monday the 21st, about the same time, the prisoner</p>

               <p>came again—I recognised him—I was outside the bar—he asked me for half a quartern of gin, and I went round the bar and served him—he gave me in payment a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, which I saw was bad immediately he laid it on the counter—I bent it easily with my thumb and finger, and told him it was bad, and that he had passed a bad shilling on the previous Thursday to me—he said he was not aware that it was bad, and he never was in the house before—I called the waiter to send for a policeman—the prisoner left the house with a female—I went round by the other door and stopped him—he then offered me a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and offered to pay me the shilling—he took the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece from a small purse in his pocket—I refused to take it, and he put it in his purse again—a constable arrived—I charged the prisoner, and gave the coins to the constable—I went to the station, when the prisoner took from his pocket the purse containing the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and said to the sergeant on duty that that was the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece he presented to me—it was handed to me and I examined it; I can swear it is not the one that he gave me, because I bent it easily with my thumb and finger—I had handed that one to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher at 17, South Molton-street—on 21st January, I was at Mr. Penn's, and saw the prisoner there—I was there before the policeman came; he had a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece in his hand and was <hi rend="italic">jinking</hi> it on a cask, trying it, and the prisoner snatched it away out of the constable's hands, put it in his mouth and immediately swallowed it—the policeman caught hold of his throat and told him it was too far gone—the prisoner snapped his fingers and said, "There, you have not got it."</p>

On Monday, 21st January, about 12 o'clock, I was called to Mr. Penn's—the prisoner was given into my charge—I received a bad shilling and a bad florin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Mr. Penn—the florin was bent very much—I was sounding it on a cask that was standing there, and just as I was picking it up, the prisoner snatched it from my fingers and swallowed it—I seized him by the throat and felt it pass my thumb down his throat—the prisoner snapped his thumb and finger, and said, "Oh, you have not got it!"—I said, "You have swallowed it"—he said, "No, I have put it in my pocket"—I took him to to the station—Mr. Penn was there—I placed the prisoner in the dock; he instantly took out this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and took out a good 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, put it to his mouth, and said, "This is the good 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece that I offered to the landlord"—I can swear that it is not the same I sounded on the cask—I searched the prisoner and found one halfpenny on him—he gave me an address—I went there, but could not find any such person.</p>

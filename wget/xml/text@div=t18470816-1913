                  </hi> I am a schoolmaster, and live in Devonshire. On the 17th of Aug., between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was coming from the Strand with my brother, and at the gate I found a great crowd attracted by a fire; and in following my brother, who had passed through, I felt some one snatch my watch from my waistcoat pocket—the hand was caught in my guard—I immediately seized the guard and caught the person by the collar—it was the prisoner—I took the guard off his arm, and before I liberated him I gave him to the policeman—my watch was gone out.</p>

               <p>of my pocket in a moment—I went with the prisoner to the station and gave him in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There was a great crowd? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—my brother had forced his way through the gate—I could not get through—I am sure I kept the person whose hand I found in my guard—his hand was entangled in the guard—a few minutes before I approached the gate my brother had cautioned me, and I felt my watch safe—the snatch at my pocket was made by the same person whose hand was in my guard—I felt a dash at my pocket—I was not in the crowd above half a minute—I seized both the hand and the collar of the prisoner—I heard him say I was never more mistaken, and that he was not the person—I called the policeman—he came through the gate to me—I then went to Bow-street station-house—I was surrounded on all sides—there was a greater crowd before me than there was behind me—my watch was on a swivel—the swivel was not broken—the watch must have been broken off it.</p>

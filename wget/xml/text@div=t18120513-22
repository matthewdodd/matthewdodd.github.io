The prisoner came into my shop on Wednesday last, the 6th of May, about half past six. I am sure she is the same person. I had half a pound of sponge tied up in paper, lying on the counter, I went into the shop, almost up against the parlour door; I thought she might be a customer come to buy something. As I was not in the shop she turned herself about, as I thought to rest herself against the counter. I went out of the parlour to her; she turned herself from the place where the sponge lay, and went out of the door. I missed the sponge immediately, and I knew that she must have it; before she got out of the shop. When I came out of the parlour I looked on the counter, and saw the sponge. I let her go out into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you missed the sponge the prisoner was not gone out of the shop, why did not you seize the prisoner - A. I was a mind to see what she would do. I knew that she had got it. When she got out of the door she went down the street. I stood at my own door, and watched her. It is a short distance from my house to Ogle-street. She went up Ogle-street; I immediately ran after her and she went into a private house. That is the house where she lodged.</p>
               <p>Q. You guessed that she lodged there - A. Yes. I did not know it till afterwards. I stood a little time at some distance from the door waiting; I thought she might return back again. She came out again in the course of two minutes; she was coming the same road back to Foley-street. I came back, and stood in my own shop until she past the door, and when she came past I went out and laid hold of her. I asked her what she had done with the sponge that she had stolen out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130024"></xptr> of my shop. She told me to be careful what I said; she never was in my shop in her life. I kept her in the house until a gentleman came past; his name is Sims. I charged him with the woman. He is a constable. He took her to the watchhouse. I went with him. At the watchhouse she gave the constable a key, and said that she had stolen the sponge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her it would be better for her to confess - A. I told her I would forgive her if she would confess. I saw her give the constable a key.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse; she gave me a key to search her room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the room according to her directions - A. I did. I took Mr. Giles and another man along with me, and the landlady of the house. I opened the door of the room where she directed me; I found fifteen pieces of sponge under the bed. The prisoner said it laid under the bed.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is the sponge that lay upon my counter, that I made up in a parcel. That is the right number. I know the sponge well; I have trimmed it with shears. I am sure it is my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman said if I would confess he would give me a shilling, and I might go about my business. My lord, I leave myself entirely with you, and the gentlemen of the jury's mercy, and I pray for God's sake you will shew mercy.</p>

I had seen the Prisoner before, but did not know him by Name.</p>
               <p>Court. What was that Snuff-Box worth?</p>
               <p>Fisher. I believe it cost a Guinea. I valu'd it at 15 s. before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. And how came you to value it but at 6 d. now?</p>

               <p>Fisher. I did not know but it might be over-valu'd at 15 s.</p>

               <p>Fisher. He was admitted to be an Evidence last Sessions, and therefore I thought he could not be try'd; but hearing afterwards that he had not put this Robbery into his Information, I was told, that he might still be prosecuted for it.</p>

            ,* The Prisoner is my Brother. One Day since last Sessions, when my Brother went to get Bail, the Prosecutor and Lawyer Grimes call'd on me, and Lawyer Grimes said, If you would save your Brother's Life, you must come down to me. Come down, says I. for what? Why, says he, pointing to the Prosecutor, Here's a Man that will swear a Robbery against him. Well, says I, what is your demand? Why, says the Lawyer, you must pay me a Debt (I think it was about 3 l.) that your Brother owes me, and give me something for a pair of Gloves, and 2 Guineas to this Man, the Prosecutor. Says I to the Prosecutor, Do you know my Brother? Yes, says he, I have known him a long Time; and why did you not prosecute him before? says I. Why, says he, because I was out of Town (tho' now he pretends, that it was because my Brother was an Evidence) but says he, if you'll satisfy Lawyer Grimes, and give me 2 Guineas, I'll make it up. And but last Week, Lawyer Grimes got a Guinea of me, at the Vine Tavern to give the Prosecutor; and last Night I was drinking with the Prosecutor at the Ship, and he own'd, that he had that Guinea of the Lawyer; and then he went out and left me the Reckoning to pay.

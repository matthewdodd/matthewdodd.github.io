               <p>I am a pawnbroker; I live at No. 434, St. Martin's lane. On Monday night the 11th of this month, about half past eight or rather more, Heslip and Murray came to my shop; Murray came in and produced some plate which was cut in pieces, three large pieces and some small pieces besides; Murray said, we have brought you something worth your buying, I looked at it and I saw it was plate, as though it was quite blackened by the fire; on one piece I found a gentleman's coat of arms, I shewed it to them, they seemed not surprised, I asked them particular where they were working? they said, they were working by a fire by Oxford-road, and they found it in the ruins; I asked them what street? they could not inform me, they said, they did not know; I asked them who was their employer? they said, Mr. Goodwin, which was a master bricklayer; I asked them where he did live? they could not inform me, they said, they did not know; I asked them where he paid them? they said, at a public house; I asked them the sign? Murray said, he believed it was the One Tun, he said, near the buildings; I asked them where he hired them? he said, at Charing Cross, it may be about that very instant my lad went out of doors, and he found Kelly, and he brought him in, he came in with the lad, he had not hold of him, my lad said, he found him at the door; I asked Kelly the same questions as I had asked them, word for word; I believe he gave the same answer exactly; I asked how long they had been in London? they said, they had been in London a fortnight; I asked them if they heard how long the fire had happened before they went to work? they said, a few days; I could not find at what house this was; I asked them if they had heard of any accident that happened at it? they said, there was a young woman that sell out of a two pair of stairs window; from that I knew it was Lady Dover's; they did not seem to be any way intimidated or afraid; Kelly said, they would bring Mr. Goodwin, their employer, about the plate, that they lived all three together in Marigold-court, in the Strand; they gave a proper account; directly my lad and I went to this place where the fire was, I saw a gentleman's servant crossing the street, I enquired for the One Tun, I went into a public house and shewed them the plate, and I found out the steward about ten o'clock, and I shewed him the plate and he owned it directly, he said, that he and one of the executors would call at my house the next morning; Mr. Goodwin called, I told him I had not the pleasure to know him, but I would go with him to the steward.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated to us that the two which first came in, namely Heslip and Murray, gave you answers to every question you asked, just as you have told, and Kelly when he came in he repeated nearly the same, every thing exactly corresponded? - It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the directions they gave to their own lodgings right? - It was.</p>

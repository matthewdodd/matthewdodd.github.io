                  </hi>. I live with my mother, in Leather-lane. At half-past nine o'clock that day I saw the prisoner unhang the brushes from Mr. Green's shop, which is opposite—I went over and told one of the boys in the shop—the prisoner walked away with them before him—he was brought back—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

I was at the top of Brook-street, Holborn—I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I was standing about, and I ran with the rest of the people after the man—I could not swear that the prisoner was the man—the brushes were thrown away by the man—I picked them up—this was close by Beecham-street—I</p>

I was on duty at the corner of Brook-street on the 5th of November, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening—there was a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running—there was a great crowd—they were following him—to the best of my knowledge he was first, and turned the corner—the others were running in the same direction—I saw no short man near him—I stopped him at the corner—Mr. Green came up and said he had taken some brushes—this boy came up and brough the brushes, and he was taken—the prisoner said he was not the person, that he was an approved candidate for the Police, and had left the Superintendent of the A division, in Scotland-yard, at half-past seven o'clock—I took him from half-past nine to twenty minutes to ten o'clock.</p>

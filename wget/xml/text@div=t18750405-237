I assist my step-father in the post-office at 29, Great Russell Street—on 5th March, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and asked for a pound's worth of stamps—I gave him the stamps and he gave me a counterfeit sovereign in payment—I dis<lb></lb>covered it the moment he bad left—I kept it by itself—on 16th March about 12.30 in the day—I saw him again, I was then in the parlour—I recognised his voice, and looking up, I saw that it was the man that had given me the coin—I spoke to a witness who serves with me—he asked for a sovereign sheet of stamps, and then he asked for a sovereign's worth—she asked him for the money—he refused to show it, she asked him again for it, he said he had the money and it was all right—she asked him a third time—I moved round the counter to go the door and he ran off—he was brought back by my brother and a porter—I told him he had given me a counterfeit sovereign on the 5th—he denied it, and denied being in the shop, and said that on this occasion he had "only asked for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth—I gave the counterfeit sovereign to the constable.</p>

I assist at this post-office—on 16th March the prisoner came in—Miss Glenister said something to me—the prisoner asked for a sovereign sheet of penny stamps—I got the stamps out and looked at him expecting to see him put the money out—he did not do so, and I said "Where is the money," he said "I have it here all right"—I said "Give me the money"—Miss Glenister turned to go round the counter to stop him, he saw that we were suspicious of him and ran out of the shop—he was brought back and given into custody—I saw a coin in his hands when I was offering him the stamps, but I could not see what it was.</p>

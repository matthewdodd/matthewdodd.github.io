                  </hi>. I live at 4, Paddington Street, Clerkenwell, and am a groom—I was talking to some friends in the Edgware Road, and the prisoner came up and struck me a violent blow in my mouth with his fist, and seized my watch and chain—my watch was in my waistcoat pocket—I caught hold of him by the coat—he struck me two more violent blows, and I seized the chain from his hand—in the struggle we fell together, and a constable came up—he ran away towards Market Street, and I got up and followed him—Bennett stopped him and went up to him—I am sure he is the man—I never lost sight of him—when I went up to him I received two more violent blows from him in the face and forehead—I have suffered very much since—I have got a mark, and had a black eye—I lost hold of him, another witness tripped him up at the corner of Star Street, and I fell over him—a policeman came up and took him in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Hertford Street, Lisson Grove, and am single—I was talking to the prosecutor in the Edgware Road on this morning with another female, and saw the prisoner come up with another man—he said to the other female, "You have a husband at home; you ought to be in bed with him, and not with this man"—he then said to the prosecutor, "You go away," and struck him with his left hand and snatched his watch with his right—there was an Albert chain to it—the prosecutor seized hold of him, and the prisoner struck him two more blows in the face—they fell together, and I saw the prosecutor snatch his chain from the prisoner's hand—the prisoner then ran away—I ran after him, and called out, "Stop thief"—I caught hold of him, and he wrenched my arm and got away—a person was standing at the corner of Star Street, who tripped him up, and he fell—the prosecutor came up and fell on top of him—in the scuffle another man came up, who the prisoner passed the watch to—I believe he was the same man who was with the prisoner before I caught hold of him—the prisoner struck me a violent blow in the face, and I let go of him—a policeman came up, and the prisoner was given in custody—I am quire sure he is the man—I never lost sight of him.</p>

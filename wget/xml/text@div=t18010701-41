               <p>AMOS STEVENSON sworn. - On Sunday, the 7th of June, I was robbed, about a quarter before nine in the morning, at a public-house, in <placeName id="t18010701-41-crimeloc229">Tottenham-court-road</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. This man and another laid a wager of half-a-crown, and they put the two half-crowns into my hand for the wager; it was about which was the best workman. <rs id="t18010701-41-verdict230" type="verdictDescription">

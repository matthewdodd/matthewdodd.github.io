I have seen the prisoner twice at my stables - he had hired a cart on a former occasion, and I sent my man with him; I saw him again in about a fortnight or three weeks, before he hired the chaise. On Saturday, the 18th of February, about a quarter-past nine o'clock in the morning, he came alone, and said he wanted a horse and chaise to go to Carshalton; I asked if a light cart would not answer his purpose - he said No, he was going to take a female with him, and a chaise would be more respectable; I said as he wished a chaise he should have one - he wished it for five hours, and was to pay 18s. - I gave him the duty-ticket, and he went away with a chaise worth 20l., a gelding worth 20l., harness worth 3l., a horsecloth and whip - I delivered them to him; he was to return that afternoon - none of my servants went with him; I asked him for a deposit - he said he had no money till he went to Carshalton, where he should see his uncle, who resided there, and he should receive some money from him; I have never seen the chaise and horse since- I inquired on the following Monday, at the Marsh-gate, to see if he had delivered the ticket; I could learn nothing of the chaise or horse - I did not see him again till he was in the custody of Goddard, on the 22nd of March.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I believe I told you I was going to an aunt of mine at Carshalton? A. No, to an uncle; you only hired them for five hours - I was to have no more if he kept it that day; I said I would not mind an hour or two, if he would not distress the horse - I never let you a horse more than twice.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know where he lived? A. He gave his address at his mother's, in Alfred-street, Bedford-square; I believe she deals in ladies' wardrobes - I went there, and found he had not lived there for six months; the officer is not here, as no property was found on him - I have heard nothing of my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I surrendered myself to Goddard- I hired the horse and gig for a young man named Harrison, a veterinary surgeon, who lived in Brook-street, Regent's-park, who was going to see his aunt at Carshalton; I took the responsibility, and hired it as for myself - I left him in the Hampstead-road, to go to Carshalton; he met me in the evening, and said he had but half a sovereign, to pay the expences - I did not like to take it home with that money, and told him to take the horse and gig home to the prosecutor's, to pay the half-sovereign, and say I would make it up in a few days; he met me on Sunday, and promised to meet me on Monday, which he did - he appeared confused; I asked what was the matter, and he acknowledged he had not taken the horse and chaise home, but if I would meet him in the evening, he would fetch them and take them home with compensation for the time he had had it; I called at the Belvidere, Islington, at six o'clock, but he never came - I went out of town, and wrote to the prosecutor, proposing to pay by monthly instalments, but received no answer, and in about a fortnight surrendered to meet the charge; I told Goddard the particulars.</p>

            . I do not know how he came into custody; I have a letter, which I received some time after he got the gig - the post-mark is the 16th of March, and on the 22nd I found him in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish that letter read - (read.)</p>
               <p>Thursday evening, March 15th, 1832.</p>
               <p>SIR, - I have no doubt you feel much surprised you have not heard from me, respecting your horse and gig, before this time, but, under the circumstances, I know not which course it might he most prudent to adopt; when I borrowed the gig, I must admit, I said it was for myself - however, to speak the truth, I borrowed it for another young man, to whom I entrusted it to return to you, when he promised me he would do so, and adjust the difference incurred for its use, and he further promised to meet me the following day, Sunday, which he did, when he told me he had drove it into the Country, and, being pushed for money to pay his passage to Scotland, had parted with it there; to this I held out threats, when he promised me if I would meet him at nine o'clock the next morning, Monday, he would get it returned him, and deliver it to me, with 2l. for its use; I was at the appointed place, when a youth, waiting there by his desire, told me he could not get it back, and, therefore, had started for Edinburgh: under these circumances, I know not how to act, and, therefore, I wish to make the following proposition, which is all the remuneration it lays in my power to make- that is, by an agreement, signed and stamped, to pay 30s. per month - the first payment down, and the rest at the expiration of every month, until the value of the horse and gig be paid, which, considering how I am situated, ought to be set down at the lowest price - I must then endeavour to get into business, that I may be able to fulfil what I engage to do; and if you will so far oblige, as to let my mother know all particulars, and tell her the overture I make, I dare say she would favour me so far<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050009"></xptr>as to recieve any decisive answer you might make to what I have proposed; if she refuses this, I shall feel obliged for a note left for C.R.S.H., Post-office, Gerrard-street, Soho: should she have no objection, a person shall call for your reply in writing, when it will reach me the following day; and I trust, as a sincere favour, you will forward it as speedily as possible.</p>

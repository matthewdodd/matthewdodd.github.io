The prisoner came to lodge in my first floor, which was furnished-these things are not part of the furniture-the prisoner left my lodging about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon on the 24th of August, he only came to lodge with me the Friday week before, at 3s., a week, he neither paid any rent nor gave any notice - I did not expect him to go - I was ill and went to bed. I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth 6l., ten minutes after he was gone, out of the next room to the prisoner's, and I told Saunders. On the 4th of September, I saw the prisoner at Bow-street. The morning after he left I received a letter from him, inclosing the duplicates of the two watches and four spoons; I knew it to be his hand-writing, (read.)</p>
               <p>MR. HODGKISS. I hope you will forgive me for the depredations I have committed, distress was the cause - I have sent you the duplicates and will send you the money to take them out as soon as it is in my power - I hope you will not take any means to recover, as you have known me so long.</p>

               <p>Q. Who left the house last - A. I left it last, about twelve o'clock in the morning; I secured the doors and windows. I returned about one o'clock, I found the iron peg was out of the window. He got in at the window; the door was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. What property did you lose from there - A. Six shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of them - A. Five pound all but a shilling; they cost more; they were worth that at the time they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the shirts the last time before you left the house - A. I put them in a basket and covered them over with a cloth. I saw them a quarter of an hour before I left the house. I have never seen the shirts since.</p>

            . I am a green-grocer, I live in Hackney-road, about half a mile from Mrs. Webb. I went across the fields with a horse and cart, with my green-grocery, I met the prisoner with something in a cloth in his arms; I did not take particular notice of him. Mrs. Webb enquired if I saw a man; I told her yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. How far was this from the house of Mrs. Webb - A. About a dozen yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner - A. When I saw him I never saw him before that day; I think he is the man; he is very much altered; I cannot positively say.</p>

            . I was standing at my window, I saw the prisoner pass on the other side of the way. I live six or seven doors from the other witness. The prisoner had the shirts on his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many shirts there were - A - A. No; there were a good many very neatly pleated, as they came from the ironers; he was dressed in soldier's clothes; he had wings to his jacket, and a forage cap. I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. to Webb. How soon after was this man taken - A. The next morning. The serjeant told me when he came for the money for the beef, to stop him.</p>

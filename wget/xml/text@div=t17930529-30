               <p>My husband's name is Alexander. I was going into Covent-garden on Friday the 15th of April last, with Mr. Caldcleugh and his brother, between four and five in the afternoon, we were going in at the entrance in <placeName id="t17930529-30-crimeloc159">Bow-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Then the pocket book was missing the time you caught her hand in your pocket? - It was; it was a red morocco pocket book, and those articles in the indictment were in it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no reason to suppose it was taken at any other time? - I had felt but a minute before in my pocket, and found my watch and pocket book safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt it was at this moment you lost your pocket book? - I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A few shilling. She was searched, there was nothing found on her; she was taken to the house in Bow-street and searched immediately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was above an hour and a half in custody before ever the pocket book was found, or brought against me.</p>

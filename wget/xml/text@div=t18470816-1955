                  </hi> I am a surgeon, and live in Cheapside—the prisoner was my assistant. On the 19th of July, a bill of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. became due—the acceptor of the bill called on me that day, and I being out he wrote a note, which enclosed a check for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a sovereign, and begged I would get the difference to meet the bill, naming a gentleman who would lend it me—he left the note on my table, informing the prisoner or what he had done—the prisoner went out afterwards to pay the bill—I never saw the check—there was no other person there who could have taken the check—I received the note about half-past four o'clock—the check was then gone—it has been changed—the prisoner told me he had got it, and I sent him out to take the bill up with it—I have never seen the check since—it was on the London and Westminster Bank—I do not know the names of the parties, it is a com<lb></lb>pany—the prisoner had the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and the ten sovereigns of Mr. Richards, who is present—he is the person who I was to borrow the money of—the prisoner told me he had the check, and Mr. Richards was to give him the money, and he was to go and take the bill up—he did not do so—the bill has been dishonoured and returned—I am the drawer of it—this produced is it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a barrister—on the 19th of July I paid the prisoner a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, ten sovereigns, and a half-sovereign—I should say I paid it to the credit of both the parties—Mr. Clark had not authorized me to pay any—I was aware of the purport of the letter which Mr. King had written—I went in about three o'clock, and found Mr. King writing the letter—I ad<lb></lb>vised him to finish his letter, and let it go forward—I paid the money—I was sure that Mr. Clark would recognize it the next day—I was aware of the letter—I would have acted upon it.</p>

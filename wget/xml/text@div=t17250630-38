               <p>Alexander Ross thus deposed: I met the Prisoner in the Street, and invited her to take a Glass. She perceiving me to be a Foreigner, spoke to me in French; and we agreed to go to the <placeName id="t17250630-38-crimeloc199">Dog Tavern upon Ludgate-Hill</placeName>

While we were drinking there, she desired me to lend her some Money; I told her I had none to lend;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172506300005"></xptr> and putting my Hand in my Pocket, I took out Two Shillings. She told me that would not do; therefore I must give her more. I then took out Half a Crown, and with it a Silk Purse that I brought from Berlin; but I don't remember whether it was green or blue. She took the Half Crown, and pray'd me to let her look upon the Purse, for the very much admired it. I put it into her Hand, and she emptied it into her Lap. There were 7 Broad Pieces, 4 Guineas, and 4 Gold Rings set with Diamonds. She look'd them all over, and then put them into my Purse again, and return'd it to me, and I put it into my Pocket; but it was not long before I miss'd it; and (knowing that she had been a little busy about my Breeches) I ask'd her if she had not taken it in Jest? She told me she never saw it, and was for going away; but I stopt her. She call'd the Drawer; and when he came up, I bid him bring another Bottle; but when he saw her so unwilling to stay, he would not bring it. I told him what I had lost; and he bid me look well about the Room to see if I had not dropt it; but I was unwilling to take my Eye off of the Prisoner, that she might have no Opportunity of conveying the Purse away. The Drawer then told us, if we would not agree, and go away quietly, he'd fetch a Constable; and so he did I charged the Constable with her, and desired him to search her, but he excused himself; and she said she'd let any Woman search her, but no Man; and so she was not search'd at all; and the Constable carry'd me to Prison; but what he did with her, I cannot tell.

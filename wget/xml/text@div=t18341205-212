                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Whitecross-street. On the afternoon of Monday, the 24th of November, the prisoner came to my shop—he offered a tea-spoon to pawn—I asked where he got it—he told me it was his mother's, and she had sent him with it, and he was to ask half-a-crown</p>

               <p>for it—I said I very much doubted it—he said, "Give it me back"—I said, "No; where does your mother live?"—he said in Featherstone-street—I said I would go to her—he rather resisted my going, but I said I would, and in going we passed the station-house, and I took him in there—he had before told me his mother's name was Clark—he then said her name was Neehan, and he had found the spoon in a gutter, near Finsbury-square—I marked the spoon, and delivered it to the policeman.</p>

This spoon is mine—I have five more like it—they were my mother's—this is worth about half-a-crown—the prisoner was in my brother's employ at the time this happened—he had been there eight months—he had to pass the kitchen door in going to some men who were at work—he has been a good boy—he had no business in the kitchen.</p>

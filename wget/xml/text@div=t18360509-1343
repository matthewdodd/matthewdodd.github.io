                  </hi>. I am a china and glass-dealer, living at the corner of Richmond-street, Woolwich. These five tea-cups and other articles, produced by Butterfill, are all mine—I missed them on thee morn<lb></lb>ing of the 28th, when we were about to fill up the vacancies for goods sold on the preceding days—they are all mine—but this little mug I could not swear to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Strang. I noticed, on two days in April, two children, daughters of the prisoner, who are ten and twelve years old, were loitering about—my master had missed things before, and desired me to watch them—we found a mug on one off them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. Between eight and mine o'clock on the evening of the 28th of April, I went to Mr. Strang, find<lb></lb>ing he had two children in custody who had robbed him of different articles—he was not at home—I waited while Mrs. Strangg sent for him—he came with two other persons, and we thought proper to go to the residence of the prisoner, who occupies a room as a weekly tenant—there is a garden, but I do not know whether she claims it—it belongs to that house—I believe she has access to it, and goes through it—I told her I had her two children in custody, respecting the things that they had taken from Mr. Strang's—I named the candlestick and some cups and saucers—finding the children were detained, she stated that she had placed the things in the gar<lb></lb>den—she went with me into the garden, and pointed out the place, and there we found the things—she begged that I would have mercy on her—I told her it was out of my power to do any thing but take her to the station-house till the following day.</p>

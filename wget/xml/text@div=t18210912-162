I last lived with the Marquis Durantar, at Florence. I arrived here the day after the coronation. On Saturday night the 4th of August, I spent the evening with a friend in James Street, near Buckingham House. I passed through Buckingham Gate on my way to Park-lane, and went up <placeName id="t18210912-162-crimeloc947">Constitution-hill</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18210912-162-crimeloc947" type="placeName" value="Constitution-hill"></interp>

The other said, "No." I went past; I heard one say, "He will do as well" - this was the stout man (the prisoner). I suspected they had some ill intention, and turned round; I began to walk quicker, and as I looked round I saw one of them coming after me; the other said, "Shall I go with you?" He said, "No; I can do it myself." I walked about twenty yards further on, when he overtook me, and asked why I walked so fast; he walked up quite close to me: I said I was afraid the gate would be shut, "It is almost ten o'clock, dont you think it is?" While this was going on we were walking together He said, "No, it is of no consequence, you will not go through that gate to night." I said, "Why so - is it locked?" he immediately caught hold of my arm, and said, "The short and long of it is this; I am a poor man out of employ, and you are a gentleman, and unless you give me 2 l. immediately, d - n my eye, if I wont knock your brains out immediately." I said, "what do you mean, who are you that you get your living in this way." He immediately gave me a blow under the right ear with his fist, and I ran out to the carriage way. I run round and took my purse out of my pocket, and put it inside my neckhandkerchief, and pushed my hat up from my forehead; I ran round and gave him a blow and knocked him down; he immediately got up and came to me again, and I again knocked him down, and waited for him on the footpath.</p>
               <p>Q. You knocked him down twice, and waited for him to come up again? - A. Yes: he immediately got up, and came and struck at me several times, but I always guarded him off.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he did not hit you? - After that, we were fighting together for nearly a quarter of an hour, I believe; he beat me severely about the body, but always guarded my face. I fought at least for three quarters of an hour with one and the other (there were two of them -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120089"></xptr>one escaped); he then gave me a blow and nearly knocked me down; I ran furiously at him -</p>
               <p>Q. You ran up furiously to him, is this correct? - A. Yes: and knocked him down; when he fell, he cried out "Bill, d - n you, where are you, he is doing me." Bill came up with his fists prepared to hit me, and I knocked Bill down as soon as he came up; Bill immediately got up again, and I again knocked him down: the other remained down on the road, while Bill was knocked down twice on the footway: they were both down. Both of them immediately got up; I was much exhausted, and both of them ran to me at once and knocked me down. I dont know which got me down, they were both over me. I found the two hands of one, or both of them in my pantaloon pockets; they rifled my pockets; I lost all recollection of where my purse was, (being engaged with them so long;) they tore open my coat, and dragged open my bosom, and tore my shirt, which I have now; they searched all over my body; one said to the other "You know he had it, you have got it I am sure." The other said, "I am d - d if I have got it - it is a d - d lie, I have not got it, but you have, for you know he had it." While I was down, and before I was down, I was crying out murder and robbery all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What all the three quarters of an hour. - A. Yes. - not three quarters of an hour. It was when the second came at me, I did not cry till Bill came up - it was about a quarter to ten o'clock when it commenced.</p>
               <p>Q. What next happened. - A. I heard footsteps of a third person, and did not know but it was another ruffian coming to their assistance. As soon as he came within six yards of me they stopped, and Bill got off me, and gave me a blow with the heel of his shoe, stamping, which has rendered me lame ever since, and ran away. The third person came up and said, "For God's sake don't kill that person," and when I heard it was somebody for my protection it gave me fresh courage. I immediately caught hold of him by the cravat - he endeavoured to get loose, but I would not let him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the prisoner. - A. It was, my Lord. I held him fast, and with the person's assistance, dragged him to the gate, and found the porter at the lodge, and asked why he did not come to my assistance when he heard me cry so long - he said he had told the watchman of it, who refused going. I went up to the ruffian again, and he gave me a blow. I dragged him through the crowd. A hackney coachman came up, and said, "Stick to the ruffian, I know there are two of them there nightly." I said, "Don't be afraid, I'll take care of him." I dragged him through the turnpike, and met the watchman, who refused taking him in charge. I dragged him again through the crowd, and found an officer, who immediately took him to Mount-street watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You did not say where you lived. - A. At 26, Upper Titchfield-street, Cavendish-square. I lived there on the 4th of August. I was going to the washerwoman in Park-lane, to tell her to send my things home. I went to James-street at half-past six o'clock, and left a quarter to ten. I had been in Italy six years and a half. I first lived with the Marquis's father, and then with his son. Before I went to Italy I lived with Earls Bridgwater and Paulet.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you crying robbery and murder. - A. Above twenty-five minutes - it was as soon as Bill came up. I cried as loud as I could. I think I was not above fifty yards from Piccadilly gate. I could see the lamps in Piccadilly very well - people who passed the rails must have heard my cries. I don't think I could be heard in the Mall. I believe it was after ten o'clock when I began hallooing, for the first was engaged with me nearly half an hour. I did not halloo while the first man only was with me, as I could manage him very well. I have a witness here, his name is John something - he is a boy about sixteen or seventeen.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you seen him since this affair? A. At Bow-street, and here, nowhere else. I saw him one day at the porter's lodge in Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him nowhere else. - I really am not quite positive. I never went to his lodging - I don't know where they are, nor has he called on me. I have sent to him this evening to come here. He has called at my lodgings for me to attend at Hicks's Hall - the officer desired him to call - he only called once to my recollection. I have only seen him there once - I never gave him any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. During all this fighting and scuffling was your coat buttoned. - A. No: I stripped it open, while fighting, to give me more air. He tore my waistcoat and shirt - my coat, pantaloons, and waistcoat were covered with blood. I was wounded in the nose, and the blood spirted from my mouth. Nobody saw me slip my purse into my cravat. One of them said to the other, "You know he had it."</p>
               <p>Q. How could either of them know you had a purse. - A. I don't know. I was setting in a liquor shop with my friend, and changed a sovereign; they might be there and see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was at a liquor shop that you and your friend were at: what was the sign. - A.George Arms, kept by

             - I don't say they were there. When I got to the gate, my face and handkerchief were covered with blood. I put up my hand, and felt my purse in my handkerchief, and gave it to a respectable man to take care of. I have got it now. I have brought my cravat here, it is a black silk one. I told the park gate-keeper to come here - he said it was no business of his. He said that sixteen carriages had stopped to ask the reason why nobody went to my assistance. I have not subpoened him, or the watchman, or hackney coachman - I did not know his number, and have not seen him since. I had spent my evening with Raikes and his family - several people were there who I had no acquaintance with.</p>

            . I am servant to Captain Seymour, Elm-place, Chelsea. I was out of service on the 4th of August, and was passing the park in Piccadilly about half past ten o'clock, and heard the cry of robbery proceed from Constitution-hill. I took no notice till I heard the cry of murder. I stopt, and heard it again. I got over the rails, and two young men got over also - they said they were afraid to go down to the place, and I said I would go by myself. I run till I got within six yards of the spot, that was about one third of the way from the gate to the palace, it might be about 200 yards from Piccadilly. Just as I got there I perceived a man run away, and run among the trees towards the Queen's garden, where I lost him. I came up and found the prosecutor laying underneath, and the prisoner laying on his g-ts at the top of him - he had hold of the prosecutor by each arm across the breast - the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner's neck; he had his hand inside his neckcloth. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"You have got it about you, and if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120090"></xptr>you dont give me it I will knock your brains out." This passed while he was laying upon him; but when I came up I found the prisoner's breeches all undone about his heels; how they came so I dont know - they were down to his knees as low as they could be. I said, "Halloo here, what are you at?" The prosecutor called out to me to assist him. I seized the prisoner's collar, and said, "Halloo, this wont do, get off, are you killing the gentleman or murdering him." I could not get him up for some time, the prosecutor would not let him go. He said, "Wont you let me go?" He said "No, you must go with me to the watch-house." Both their hats were off, and laid about four yards from them. After they got up the prisoner said, "I am d - d if I dont give charge of you, you s - d - e and son of a b - , and you shall see if I cant get some recompence for this." Then the prosecutor held him while I picked up their hats. I gave them each their hats. The prosecutor said he should go to the watch-house - and the prisoner said he should go to the watch-house with him. They each came along very gently till they came to the gate. They each said they should go to the watch-house - the prisoner charged him with being a ***, and the other said he was a highway robber - they still kept hold of each other coming up, though they came quietly. The two lads met us about fifty yards down the walk. When we came to the gate the prosecutor let go of him, and the prisoner gave him a knock in the face, and said, "There you d - d s - son of a ***, do you want any more of me?" The prosecutor then let go of him, and went to the gate and inquired the reason that no one came to his assistance. Somebody said they called the watchman, but he would not come. The prosecutor then came back again to the prisoner; he stood still in the place where he left him; and he said, "You must go with me to the watch-house;" and when the prisoner found the people came round, he said, He would be d - d if he did not give charge of him too. - When we came to the watchman he would not take charge, for they were both so bloody he did not know what to do. The prosecutor would not let the prisoner be taken in charge unless he had hold of one of his arms himself. Jeffreys came up and said,</p>
               <p>"You take one, and I'll take care of the other." Cross-examined. Q. Where did you live at this time? A. I lodged at No. 7, George-street, St. Giles's. I live now with the Captain, I have been five weeks in his service. Before that I lived pot-boy at the Plaisterer's Arms, Marybone-street. When I lived in George-street I sold laces and different things, and part of the time I was haymaking; I was there nearly six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many people in Piccadilly when you got over the gate? - A. Not many near the gate; there were some by the coach stand - they must have heard the cries.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prosecutor speaks to you does he call you by your name? - A. I never associate with him; he called me by the name of Asberry at Bow-street and Hick's Hall, and here. I have seen him at several places. I have seen him at his house, No. 26, Titchfield-street, four or five times; I called for him of a morning; may have seen him about three times at his house, and sat in his room while he dressed, and we both came out together - he was not at home at other times; we went to Hicks's Hall and Bow-street together; he always called me Asberry; he sometimes called me John. I was present from the time I came up with them in the park till they got to the watch-house. I have told all that passed. Some man patted the prosecutor behind and told him to stick to him. One day last week the park gate-keeper told me to tell the prosecutor he wished to see him, and I told him when I saw him here - he went to the lodge with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever give you any thing? - A. He gave me eightpence on the night of the scuffle, and gave me an old hat once - nothing else except a pint of beer or so.</p>

            . I was at my duty at Hyde Park corner. A little before eleven o'clock I heard a noise coming from the park. An inspector told me not to interfere, for he thought it was a drunken row, and we were obliged to abide by orders. I saw a good lot of people go down towards St. George's Hospital; they all came back together. I followed and asked what was the matter. When we came to the corner of Park-lane, I said, "I will take one and you take the other" - I told a watchman so. As we went to the watch-house together I found them both all over blood; the prosecutor's shirt and waistcoat were torn. I asked who he was? he said a butler, and that he came from abroad. I said unless he gave me security I should not let him go. The prisoner sent me to Westminster where I found his discharge from the guards, and found he now belongs to the West Middlesex militia.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time do you go on duty? - A. About eight o'clock. We were all talking together; but I think if there had been a cry of robbery and murder for twenty-five minutes I must have heard it. I always pay attention to the park. I believe the gate is locked at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence stated that the prosecutor forced his conversation on him, and detailed several indecent acts which the prisoner stated that he resisted with force, and the prosecutor then charged him with attempting to rob him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 28th of March I was in Broad-street, Bloomsbury—I saw the prisoner and a gentleman walking in the street—the prisoner put his hand into the gentleman's pocket, took this handkerchief out, and ran down Plumtree-street—I ran and took him, and asked him where the handkerchief was—he said he had no handkerchief—I put my hand into his pocket and took out this—the gentleman had gone on—I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was passing along Broad-street and met a person who was distressed; she asked me to purchase a duplicate of a handkerchief—I did so, and sent a person to get it out—I had the same handkerchief in wear on Sun<lb></lb>day and Monday, and part of Tuesday—I went to the same pawnbroker to leave it there, but Mr. Howard, where I took it, being very busy, I was going to another shop, and carried it in my hand as far as Plumtree-street—I then put it into my pocket; and when I had got partly down the street, the policeman came to me and asked where the handkerchief was—I refused to give it to him, as it was my own—he said that he saw me take it from a gentleman's pocket—I have sent for the woman I bought the duplicate of, but she is gone into the country.</p>

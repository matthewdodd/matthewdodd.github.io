                  </hi>. I am a constable in the Eastern Counties Railway Company's service. On Friday morning, 5th April, about a quarter-past four o'clock, in consequence of instructions I watched the prisoners—I watched the arrival of the fish train at the Shored itch station, and saw the two prisoners get into a sheep-truck which contained a box of eels—there were two barrels of herrings on the box—they rolled them out, and began taking the eels out—I saw Foster take soles out of the pads, and put them in the top of the truck where they were afterwards found—at that moment they were alarmed, and I jumped on to the platform and arrested Boxall with fish on him—Foster had then gone away with a basket of fish on his back towards the van, end when he came back another constable took him—I found seven pairs of soles and 1 1/2lb. eels removed.</p>

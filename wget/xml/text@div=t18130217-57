The prisoner and the servant were contending together. I returned out of the kitchen. I did not hear what it was about. He came out of the kitchen. I saw him go down the yard. I never interfered at all. I returned to my employment. In the course of ten minutes after I had to go into Leadenhall-street. I saw the prisoner standing at the bottom of the gateway. As soon as he saw me he drew a sharp instrument, saying, d - n your eyes you b - r, I will murder you. I run towards the kitchen door for assistance. He made after me, and on my opening the kitchen door, he stabbed me on the left arm. He threw me down on the kitchen floor, and bruised my body. He might have cut me again; he did not He had the power of doing it. The boy that was putting on a pair of wheels in the yard, he came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the boy came up he might have done it, might he not - A. Yes, he might. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said anything to him - A. Not a word. I never saw the man in my life before. There were two in the kitchen, with whom he was quarrelling. I was there a minute. I returned momentary, without speaking a word.</p>
               <p>Q. What injury did this do to you - A. He stabbed me in my left arm. I was taken to Mr. Hopkins, and from thence I was taken to St. Thomas's hospital. Mr. Hopkins is a surgeon; he lives at the corner of the gateway, in Leaden-hall street.</p>

            . I was chamber-maid at the King's Arms. The prisoner came about eleven o'clock in the day, on the 6th of January; he asked me if he could have a bed. I asked, who recommended him. He said, the coachman he came by, recommended him; but I forget the name of the coach. I shewed him up into a room, and told him his bed was eighteen pence. He paid me in the room for his lodging. He left his bundle in the room. He asked me if he could have any thing to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170037"></xptr>eat. I told him, yes; he could have either cold beef or a beef stake. The waiter was busy, and I laid a cloth for him in the kitchen. He had cold beef, and a pint of porter, and while I went up stairs he had a glass of rum and water, that came to a shilling. He would not pay the girl that served him with the victuals that he ate; he would insist upon my coming down, to pay me for it. When I came into the kitchen I told him it was eighteen pence. He said, he had paid me. He had not paid me. He had only paid me for the bed. He said, he had paid me; he should not pay any more. I went to the kitchen, and I went out for about twenty minutes, and when I returned I met the cook coming to me to shew him to bed. This was eleven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he represent that he had been travelling all night - A. Not to me. I understood so. I was to shew him his room, and during that time he had another glass of rum and water, which was another shilling. I asked him to pay the half-crown before he went up stairs. He refused. He said, he would not pay any more. He desired me to fetch the bundles down from the bed-room, which I did. As soon as I came into the kitchen, he run and met me by the door. He pushed me up by the side of the fire place. He bent his fist, and swore he would murder me if I did not give him the bundles. Two young men saw him; they pulled him back. They saw him going to strike me; they pulled him backwards. He asked me what was in the bundles. I asked him, if he thought I had robbed him. He said, he did not know. I told him, I would shew him the contrary. I untied his bundles in the kitchen, and told his things out one by one on the floor, to convince him that I had taken nothing, and this instrument fell out of the bundle. The constable has got the instrument, and a sheath of razors. The razors he picked up instantly, and put into his pocket. The sharp instrument, he said it belonged to nobody but him. He tied up his bundles, and bid me defiance to touch them. He said, any body touch them if they dare. Then he went to endeavour to get to the bar, and my mistress had been ill for some time, she came down that day for the first time, and I held the door, and the porter held him to prevent him from getting in. I said to the porter, now, if you do not mind, he'll go away without paying. I was in the kitchen all the while. I was going to take the bundle again until he had paid his reckoning. He was going to strike me. The porter interfered, and would not let him strike me. In the scuffle the prisoner fell down. The prisoner holloaed out, murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the porter strike him - A. No, he did not. The porter put him out of the kitchen door into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other men in the kitchen that assisted in turning him out - A. No; there was only the porter, none of the other men touched him. This was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon when this happened. The prisoner run down to the gateway, and I saw him stand there about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take his bundle with him - A. No; that was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he his hat with him - A. No. I believe that fell in consequence of the scuffle; during that time I went into the bar, and the next thing I heard the cook say, was knife or knives. That was about five minutes after I saw him at the bottom of the gateway. The next thing that I saw was Joseph Eades standing by the tap door, bleeding in his arm. I saw two men take

            . I am porter at the King's Arms. The first I saw of this business was, when I saw the prisoner holding the girl up against the mantle-piece. He appeared to be using her rough at the time. I did not interfere in it then. My young master and the bookkeeper they pulled him back; then he went up to the table. He said he wished the chamber-maid to bring the bundle down. She fetched it down, and counted them on the floor before him, one by one, and as she counted them this instrument fell out. He said that belonged to him, and nobody else. He put it into his pocket. What it was I do not know. I saw it after he had stabbed the man. After he tied up his bundle he held his bundle in one hand, and bid defiance to any body touching it, and the chamber-maid made to get hold of his bundle, because he had not paid his reckoning. He strove against it. He began, as I thought, to ill use the girl. I interfered to take the bundle from him to assist her. I took the bundle from him with her assistance. We told him he should have his bundle if he would pay his reckoning. Then he strove to get to the bar. My mistress was in the bar, and the chamber-maid held the door. He appeared very violent in his manner. It was the first day my mistress had come down from her illness. I held the prisoner to prevent him from getting to the bar. I only held him; I did not ill use him at all, because I thought he was in liquor. In the scuffle he fell down. There were no blows from me. He fell down in the struggle, and as we were struggling, some person at the door said, porter, the best thing you can do is take him into the yard. I took him into the yard, and left him there. As the prisoner was down he got hold of my legs, so I walked out into the yard. When I got him into the yard he ran to the bottom of the gate into Leadenhall-street. I followed him down the yard, and went to St. Mary Axe. I said nothing to him, and in the mean while I was gone to St. Mary Axe he stabbed this man. When I returned,

            , I am a surgeon. I live at 123, Leadenhall-street. On my return home the prisoner was brought into my house by the Woodford coachman. I found he had received a punctured wound about three inches from the top of his shoulder. The wound bled freely; but upon examining it, I did not see any of the arteries were wounded. I believe the man was under the influence of fear and alarm. He was bleeding when he was brought to me. While he was with me he might have lost four or five ounces of blood. I first of all brought the edges of this wound together; it appeared to me to be done by an angular instrument. It was very likely this instrument had four sides or four edges. I stopped the bleeding, and dressed the wound. I recommended the man to go to the hospital. He said he had no one to take care of him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been over to my own country to settle some private business of my own, and I had sold all my tools that I had, and this instrument is a chissel that I made to fit up some brass work, and the springs were made to fit up some brass work. I turned the brass, and was bringing it with me in order to give it to my serjeant-major. I brought it and my shirts and things with me, and came to London. I put up at the sign of the Grapes, in Ratcliffe Highway. I had two one-pound bank notes. I had a bed there, and was very well accommodated. I asked the landlord what I had to pay. He said, a shilling for my bed. I had one pint of beer made warm, with a little purl in it. I desired the landlord to give me change. This woman said I was at their house at eleven o'clock. I do not know whether their clocks might he right; it was dinner time when I was at the Bunch of Grapes, Ratcliffe Highway. I paid a shilling to an hackney coachman to draw me up to the India house. The coachman said it was about half past twelve. I attempted to go my journey. A man asked me if I was a Lancashire man. I told him, no; I had worked in that country a long while. I told him, I never had been over since July. He asked me to go and drink with him. I do not know the sign; he pointed to the entry, saying, go into the house, and in a few minutes I will come in. I had not been long in this house before a man came in, and asked me if I would go for a sailor. I had two glasses of rum, I asked the girl if I could have a bed. She took me up stairs and shewed me the bed. She charged me eighteen pence. I came down to my liquor. I had not been long there before this young man asked me if I would be a sailor, I thought I was in a wrong place. We hear of kidnapping in the country. I insisted upon my clothes. She fetched them, and said I had not paid my reckoning. I asked for the landlord. She said he was not in. I asked for the landlady. She said she was in the bar. I immediately attempted to go to the bar door. They tore my coat right down my back, and the young man struck me in the face. I received a violent punch on my private parts; I cannot tell by whom. The surgeon knows, ever since I have been in prison it has been a great injury to my health. The man tore my bundle open, and took out a pair of pepper and salt stockings, a sermon book, and a Ready Reckoner. These have never been returned to me. The charge she lies against me is two shillings and sixpence. I sent a friend for them, this gentleman. The officer brought me them. I had my breeches pocket tore, and I lost a one-pound note. I am quite a stranger. There never was one of the name before a bench of justices in the world.</p>

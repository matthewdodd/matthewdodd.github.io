I sat on one side of the box, and he on the other. I drank once out of the pint of beer; all of a sudden I went to sleep. When I awoke I said, Mr. Robins, where is Ward, he has robbed me. The prisoner had left the house. The moment I awoke I fell my thigh cold, and then I found my pocket cut off. Mr. Robins said, for God's sake, Sturgess, give information a Bow-street office immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that purse contain - A. One five-pound note, on the back of it was I. G. Nicholson; and four one pound-notes, and two pound ten shillings in silver. I applied at Bow-street; Limbric came down to the house. I know nothing more about it. There was not one man in the box with me but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner - A. A year, or more, I suppose the pocket was cut by a pair of scissars. The purse had the money in it; the purse was in the pocket, and that cut off.</p>

             I am a constable. I had information that Sturgess was robbed on the Saturday. I know the prisoner well, he is a soldier in the third regiment of foot guards I met him on Sunday morning, the 22nd of May, in Tothil-street, Westminster, as soon as I met him, he and I went into the Checquer public-house; we had some gin and milk together. I sent a person off to Sturgess. I kept the prisoner until Sturgess came and identified him; he said, that is the man that robbed me. I then took the prisoner from that public-house, into the parlour of another public-house; where I searched him; he and his wife were together, and on the prisoner I found a pair of scissars, a knife, sixpence, and some halfpence; after that, I searched his wife; upon her I found three three-shilling tokens, two eighteen-penny tokens, and three sixpences in silver.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Robins's: the Bull's Head, Hungerford-market. I saw Mr. Sturgess come in; he had something to drink; after which, he sat down; he paid my master ten shillings; he pulled out his money to pay the ten shillings. I saw some notes and silver. Afterwards he put his money into his purse, and put the purse into his left hand pocket again; then he came into the tap-room. Ward said, set down; make yourself comfortable; you have got money in that hand for a pint of porter; put that farthing into your pocket. After which he sat opposite of Sturgess. Ward afterwards moved round; and sat close by the side of Sturgess. He sat there a good bit. I went to the bat to serve some porter. The prisoner was looking round to see if any body was in the house. After that I went out with some beer, and returned in again. Ward was gone when I came in. Sturgess awoke; he said to my master, Robins, where is Ward; master said he was gone. He then said, he has robbed me. I know nothing more. He sat with his right hand towards the prosecutor's left side when he came round to him.</p>

             thirty-six shillings. I am a tailor, and work for the regiment. At twelve o'clock I was dismissed, and coming down the Strand I met Mr. Sturgess; he laid hold of me, and would insist on me going with him to the Bull's Head, Hungerford-market. I told him I did not wish to go with him, because he was in liquor. He would insist upon me going; to pacify him, I went with him. We had twopenny worth of rum each. Mr. Sturgess paid the landlord at the bar some money at the bar After that, we went to the door, and stood there together three or four minutes. Mr. Sturgess said he had got three pence left, he would go into the tap, and have a pint of beer. The landlord would not serve him unless he would promise to go when he had drank the beer, seeing him in liquor. We sat down together in one box; a woman was ironing in the next box; she wanted to get by me. I got up and went and sat by the side of Mr. Sturgess, and while we were drinking this beer Sturgess laid his head on the table, and appeared to be asleep. I said to him, it is of no use my being with you, I wish to go home. I went home, and saw no more of Mr. Sturgess till the next morning. When I went home, finding my wife not at home, I went to a public-house and got two or three pints of beer, and in Union-street I had four-penny worth of meat. This said dog of mine came in; I gave him a bit of bread. Then, I went into the Marquis of Granby; the dog came in there. I sent for Mr. Macklin; he is a master I have worked for many years. I was in liquor. I treated Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060046"></xptr>Macklin with what money I had out of good nature and friendship. I got quite intoxicated. The next morning I went into a public-house in Tothill-street, Mills, the constable, was there. I had a halfpenny-worth of milk, and a glass of gin. Mr. Sturgess came in. I was searched; I had a sixpence and ten or eleven pennyworth of halfpence. My wife was when searched, and what money she had she had earned. Mr. Sturgess then said he did not know any part of the money, and on the Thursday he swore to a three-shilling piece. I am as innocent of the charge as God is true in Heaven.</p>

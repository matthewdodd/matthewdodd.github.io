                  </hi>. I am head-waiter at the George Hotel, Aldermanbury—on 24th July I saw the prisoner there—he called for a glass of ale, and sat near the fire-place—after I left the room he got up and moved nearer the door, and I watched him through the glass—some time after he called for a sheet of note-paper, and wrote a letter—after that he went to the corner and took an umbrella—it is a place partitioned off, where the plate is generally kept, and where no one has any business to go—the visitors' umbrellas are not kept there; they are kept in an umbrella-stand outside—I saw the prisoner leave with his own umbrella in his possession, and one belonging to me—I caught him in Three Nuns-court, leading into Basing<lb></lb>hall-street—I said, "I must take you back for taking an umbrella belonging to me"—he said, "Oh, don't take me back, I will give you half a sovereign and both the umbrellas—I took him back to the hotel and sent out for a policeman—these are the umbrellas.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Peabody Buildings, Islington—my husband is John Carmody—the prisoner was married to my husband's niece, Bridget, nine years ago come November—they resided in Russell Street, Brighton, and the prisoner was carrying on the business of a working tailor—they had four children; the youngest died in June last—the deceased was very much distressed at the loss of it—she came up from Brighton towards the end of July, and came to me about 2.30 with two children—I had had the oldest girl with me since Whitsuntide—she stayed with me till the Friday evening, when her uncle came, and he and she went to look after her husband—she came buck and stopped with me that night—on Monday, 30th July, I went</p>

               <p>out with her for a walk, and when we returned we found the prisoner lying on the bed—my husband was then at home—that was about 5.20—the deceased went into the room where he was lying—the eldest child, who was staying at my place, went in with her—she did not remain there very long—the child came running out and said "Dadda is beating mamma"—my husband sent her back again—she ran out a second time, and my husband then went out and brought in a policeman—while my husband was out I went into the room, and the prisoner got up and struck his wife in my presence, at the side of the head—he then lay on the bed again—the deceased was crying, and she was in a great passion, because his father had beat her in the street—she went towards the prisoner as if to hit him, and he made a kick at her as he lay on his back on the bed—my husband came back with the policeman and he put the prisoner out of my place—while the constable was there the prisoner sat on a box putting on his boots; the deceased went over to speak to him and he—went to hit her, but the constable warded off the blow—when they went out the constable wanted to know if my husband would give him in charge—he said no, he only wanted him out of the place—in about ten minutes the prisoner came back—he came to the door and demanded her to go with him—she came out on the mat of my door to speak to him, and her uncle with her—she said she would not go with him till he had a home to go to, and with that he struck at my husband and my husband struck at him—he then went away—the deceased did not remain with us that night; ire had to send her away, the superintendent would not allow us to keep her—she went to Mrs. Prentice's, a widow, in Commercial Street—she afterwards came to me on the Thursday evening and stayed with me till Friday—on the Friday evening she went to meet my daughter coming from work, and they returned together—she was then crying very much, and her lip was cut and her mouth bleeding—her handkerchief was full of blood—she stayed with me that Friday night—on Saturday morning she went out about 10 o'clock—she came back about 2.30—she did not sleep at my place that night, she slept with a friend in South Street, a Mrs. Prentice—on Sunday the 5th she came to my place about 9 o'clock in the morning, and remained there during the day—about 5.30 in the afternoon a child came in with a message, and the deceased put on her things and went out—I went with her at her request—we went to the corner of Green Man Street, where we met the prisoner and the three of us walked to<lb></lb>gether through Essex Road and down River Street to Marquess Road—during all that time we had been on the best of terms, no words were spoken in anger—at the comer of Marquess Road the prisoner asked us to come and have something, and we went with him into the public-house at the corner, the Myddleton, I think it is—he called for a quartern of Irish whiskey and some lemonade—I and Bridget sat on a seat outside the bar and he stood at the bar—I drank out of one glass and he drank out of the other with bis wife; he paid for it—we were there about ten minutes—we then went down the Canonbury Road—on the way Bridget turned to him and said "Is there anybody waiting for you?"—he said "Only Martin and <hi rend="italic">Patsy;</hi> those are his two brothers, Martin and Patrick Lynch—I said "I won't go where they are, Bridget, I don't want to meet those Lynches again after their behaviour in my house"—the prisoner turned to me and said "Now, Mrs. Carmody, you must not be disagreeable, I warrant you there will not be a word of quarrelling, or a word of anger"—he whistled, and his brothers came up and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170089"></xptr>
               <p>joined us—Martin said "We will go on back again to the public-house and have another treat"—so we all went back to the same public-house again and one of the brothers called for some whiskey and a pot of stout; some of us par<lb></lb>took of one, and some of the other—we remained there about twenty minutes—<hi rend="italic">Patsy</hi> said he was glad to see them together again—the prisoner said he had so many shops to work at that week that he had to give his brother Martin a quantity of it—after leaving the public-house we went down Canon<lb></lb>bury Road again, and they then proposed to go into the Two Brewers at the top of King Street, we did so, and they called for some more drink there—we then came out and stood talking in the Essex Road about the three brothers going home together in a cab—I told the prisoner there was a cab rank in Rotherfield Street—they saw a Hansom coming, Patrick whistled to the driver, and he and Martin got in—the prisoner was waiting—I said to him "Come on, John, there's a good fellow, you get in, and I promise you she shall be up at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning;"' that was to meet him up at the West End, where the brothers lived—when <hi rend="italic">Patsy</hi> had got into the cab Bridget turned round to me and said "Aunt, what do you think, <hi rend="italic">Patsy</hi> says <hi rend="italic">Johnny</hi> has a razor"—I can't say whether the prisoner heard that, he was only a little way off, he made no remark—I went up to the cab door and spoke <hi rend="italic">to Patsy</hi>—I can't tell whether the prisoner heard what I said, he was about 2 or 3 yards off, he stood with his back to the kerb—I said <hi rend="italic">"Patsy</hi>, you never would be so wicked as to say your brother has a razor"—he made some reply, and Martin jumped out of the cab and said to his brother Patrick "You b——so-and-so, now I shan't go with you"—Bridget then turned to the prisoner and said "<hi rend="italic">Johnny</hi>, surely you never have got a razor about you, what should you want that for?"—he made no reply that I heard; she said "Let me try your pocket, <hi rend="italic">Johnny</hi>, I have often tried your pockets, it is no harm "—I was quite close to her when she said those words—he wore his coat open—she went to put her hand in his left coat pocket, and as she did that I saw his right hand raised up—she was facing him—I thought he was going to catch her by the neck, and she then said to me "Aunt, I am killed"—I did not see what he did—she said those words at the moment, as soon as his hand was raised; she then wheeled round and ran like one wild, across the road, and when she got on the other side she dropped—I followed her quickly, I saw the blood pouring, and 1 could not go near her; she sat or fell on the kerb—I saw her head falling down as I went over—up to the moment when she said those words to him about the razor they, appeared to be on friendly terms, he was quite satisfied to let her come home with me and meet her on the Monday morning; there was not a word of anger, except between themselves; she had not quarrelled, or shown any violence, or temper—I turned into the road and cried "Murder!" and "Police!" and asked the people to fetch a doctor—I afterwards saw the prisoner in the custody of a policeman, by the side of the body; she was dead in a moment—I said to him "Oh, you villain, you have done it, you have killed her, you villain"—he said "Yes, and it is all your fault"—my niece was twenty-four years old on 19th August.</p>

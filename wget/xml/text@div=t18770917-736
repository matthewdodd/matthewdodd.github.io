                  </hi>. I am single, and am now living as wet nurse with Mrs. Barales, at Sydney Cottage, Walthamstow—I was confined in the Isling<lb></lb>ton Workhouse, on 27th March of a male child, which I suckled for three months and a fortnight up to 16th July, when I—made an-arrangement with Mrs. Barales, who arranged with the prisoner to take my child at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and keep it—my sister, Mrs. Smith, was to send clothes, and the prisoner was to give it the necessaries of life—she said she would do a mother's part to it—my sister introduced the prisoner.; mine was a fine healthy child—I paid the money regularly to the prisoner by post-office order every week, which I sent to my sister for her—a fortnight, afterwards I heard that my child had diarrhoea, but I afterwards heard from my sister that it was better—I then heard no more—I got anxious about the child and informed my mistress, who went to see it—on 3rd September, I received a letter from the workhouse saying that it was dead—four days afterwards I saw it and identified it at the inquest—I could not recognise it at first, but the second time I went to see it—I recognised its toes—two of the toes on each foot were joined together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Barales, an independent gen<lb></lb>tleman, of Sydney Cottage, Walthamstow—on 16th July I engaged Eliza Onslow, at Islington Workhouse, as wet nurse of my baby—I saw her child; it was a very beautiful child, four months old and very healthy—there was a suggestion that her sister should take care of her baby, and I went with her to her sister, Mrs. Smith, who sent for the prisoner and introduced her—she engaged to take the baby and was asked her terms</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170212"></xptr>
               <p>she said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, for which she would act a mother's part, and the sister promised to provide it with clothes—the mother was to pay the money—the prisoner took the child there and then a fortnight afterwards I heard of it having diarrhoea, then that it was better; but hearing no more I bad a conversation with Onslow about it, and on 27th August, went to Mrs. Smith's house at Dover Street, Islington, and went with her to the prison<lb></lb>er's house a few doors off—a little girl was standing at the door and Mrs. Payne told me to go upstairs—I did so, and found the child lying on the bed in a very deplorable condition—I recognised it chiefly by its dark eyes—it was moaning and crying with its mouth wide open—it was very dirty, its frock and pinafore were miserable—I only saw its clothes then—it was a perfect skeleton, and nothing like the child I had seen six weeks before—I went home and spoke to my husband, and next day, about 2.30 in the afternoon, he went with me to the prisoner's house—we went unexpectedly—the prisoner was out, we saw the little girl—we went upstairs and found the child in the same state, worse, if anything—its body was very dirty—it was covered over with an old black shaw l—it was making no noise that day; it was very quiet—I sent for something for it—its mouth was very sore—I asked for the baby's bottle, which was given to me in a very dirty state in<lb></lb>deed—I sent it down to Mrs. Payne to wash it, and asked for some warm water—I then gave the baby the milk from the bottle, which it took very ravenously—it had no diapers on, and its clothes were very much soiled—its flesh was very much wrinkled—we then went to the Islington Work-house and saw the matron and afterwards the relieving officer, who went with us back to the prisoner's house—we found her there—I had told the little girl that we should go for a policeman—the baby had then been changed into clean clothes and the prisoner was feeding it with brandy and egg—I told her I was very shocked to find the child in that way, and it was very unkind of her to treat it so badly and in that dirty neglected state—she said that she had not neglected it—she had left it with her little girl to look after it—the relieving officer went with me and we took it to the union and left it with the night nurse—I had never seen a child in such a state before—it was very scantily clothed—I touched it, it was cold; it had no socks on and nothing to keep it warm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My husband was an earthenware dealer—I have seven children and have considerable experience in the care of young children—when I took the child to the prisoner I did not say that it was for six weeks—I said that it had no socks, and that its feet were cold, but its feet were covered over—I am not in the habit of paying visits to very poor people this was the 26th of August—it was remarkably fine weather—I should load clothes on a sick child at that time of year—I have had a child of mine suffering from diarrhoea, and I lost one nine months old—I do not think it was ill twenty-four hours—when I left on the second occasion to go to the workhouse, I did not tell the prisoner when I should return—I had given no suggestion or directions and yet I found her when I returned feeding it with egg and brandy—the girl was fifteen years old—there is nothing remarkable in a girl of that age attending to a baby—when the child was first left with the prisoner I paid for some milk and for a bottle, out of my own pocket.</p>

               <p>she has been taking in children to nurse on and off all that time—some were left there by the day, some by the hour for a few hours together, and some altogether—I remember the child Onslow coming there—I saw it; it was a very nice baby—the prisoner was sometimes out all day, and some<lb></lb>times she was in and out—at times I hardly know whether she was in or out—a little girl of 10 or 11 used to have charge of the child, but she does not look so old—she sometimes minded the children, but she was downstairs the best part of the time when her mother was out—I never saw the baby out but twice, and that was when the prisoner took it to a doctor—I used to hear it cry nearly all day—I have had it downstairs two or three times, and I washed it once, but I only went upstairs to see it when the lady asked me to wash the bottle—it was very dirty indeed when I washed it—I fed it on two occasions, and it took the food as if it would choke itself—after it had been there some weeks it looked as if it was dying—I gave it nursery biscuits, which I bought for my own children—one evening, when I went to bolt the back door, I heard the prisoner say "Put a little drop of water in the bottle and a bit of sugar, and that will do for Willie to-night"—I do not know who she spoke to—Willie was the baby which is dead—the children used to call him Willie—I have never seen any food provided for the child; no milk was taken in at the door—the children used to fetch a pennyworth, and that was all I ever saw—Mrs. Johnson had five children and this baby made six, and a pennyworth of milk was all they had during the day—the children passed through the passage and my children were at the door, and they used to say "Who is that milk for? and the answer was "Willie"—I told the prisoner the baby looked bad, and said "Are you going to take it to the doctor's?"—she said "I have taken it to the doctor, and it is getting all right"—I said "It does look a deplorable little crea<lb></lb>ture"—I have said to her that it was a shame to go away and leave the child crying like that, and she went upstairs—when Mrs. Barales came she sent for some water to wash the bottle, and of course I took it up and saw the child—it was lying on the bed with another child belonging to Mrs. Langridge—the gentleman gave the child the bottle, and it took it as if it was going down a sink almost—I used to hear the child all the week it was there, night and day—it used to make my heart ache to hear it cry, being the mother of eight children—I heard crying and moaning too—when I went up into the room I saw that it was in a neglected state—it was afterwards taken to the workhouse, and the lady and her husband came back again about 5 or 6 o'clock—I did not think the child would live till it got to the workhouse—the gentleman offered me a sovereign to take it there and then—the prisoner has no husband; she goes out nursing people, and did so during the time the child was there—she would never let any<lb></lb>body know her business—she has sometimes had three or four children there—she got her living, as far as I know, by going out nursing and taking in children.</p>

               <p>the prisoner's house and saw a child in an upstairs room in a very weak and low condition—I gave orders for its removal to the workhouse and it was taken away in a cab.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a nurse at the Islington Workhouse—the deceased child was brought there on the 16th of July—to all appearances it was a very healthy child—it was brought to the workhouse again on 28th August, and I think I saw it on the 29th—I could not recognise it then, it was in a dying condition and was sent to the infirmary—I did not attend it afterwards—I only had charge of it as wet nurse—it had been in my care from the 14th of May to the 16th of July, when the mother went out as wet nurse.</p>

I am superintendent night nurse at Islington Workhouse—I saw the deceased on 28th August; it was so weak that it could not take the breast, but after carefully feeding it for two hours it was able to do so, but very feebly—I fed it with beef tea and arrowroot and milk for two hours and warmed it, and then it was able to take the breast—it went on pretty well to the Friday and then began to sink, and it died on Satur<lb></lb>day morning the 2nd of September—I never heard it cry, it was too feeble—it was very thin and emaciated—it had no diarrhoea then.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I am resident medical officer for the Islington Workhouse—I attended Eliza Onslow in her confinement, and on 28th August the child was brought to me by Mrs. Barales in a very emaciated condition—I ordered it to be taken up to a suckling woman, and also to have some beef tea and arrowroot—I did not expect it would recover, it had the ordinary signs of emaciation; wrinkled skin, prominent cheek bones, and sunken eyes—there was no apparent disease—it was then clean and there were no signs in the flexes of the thighs and such parts as though it had been neglected—there were no sores from non-washing and drying, but there was a little external redness of the anus, which indicated that there had been diarrhcea—I was told by the day-nurse that it had had diarrhoea for two days after its admission; that nurse is not here—I spoke to Eliza Judge about it; nothing was said about diarrhcea—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there were no marks of violence externally; the whole of the organs were healthy, except two, although they were deficient in blood—the brain was healthy, but between the skull and the dura mater—there were 3 ounces of serum; the mesenteric glands were somewbat degenerated—the middle part of the intestine was empty, the large intestine contained fair-looking fcecal matter; I say fair, in a healthy sense—the other organs were all healthy—the enlargement and degenera<lb></lb>tion of the mesenteric glauds is sometimes constitutional, and is pro<lb></lb>duced by bringing children up by hand—the state of the mesenteric glands was not sufficient to account for death—the cause of death was mesenteric disease and emaciation, and the question is how that emaciation was produced—there was serum in the brain, but there was no disease to account for that; that is a symptom when the current of blood from some debilitating cause becomes more slow, and the capilaries give out serum—that is common in exhausting maladies, in children especially—that is common whenever the condition is debilitated, from whatever cause—the condition of the mesenteric glands and of the brain, was not sufficient to account for death—there was no disease of the brain to account for death—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170217"></xptr>
               <p>I have heard the whole of the evidence—the emaciation might be produced from neglect or from diarrhoea—diarrboea would produce almost the same symptoms as neglect—the emaciation is almost in appearance the same as it would be from severe diarrhoea—there was nothing on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination which enables me to say whether the emaciation was caused by the one or the other.</p>

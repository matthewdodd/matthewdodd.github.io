Upon that Indictment he hath been arraigned, and thereupon hath pleaded Not guilty; And for his Tryal hath put himself upon God and his Countrey, which Countrey you are.

But first let us begin with the occasion of this Misfortune; You must note, the Prisoner and the Deceased were of kin, and not only so, but very conversant together; Mr. Dodd had a Horse to sell, that the Prisoner had a mind to, so Mr. Dodd gave him leave to ride him; and if he liked the Horse, the price was to be 20 Guineas; having given the Groom a Guinea in earnest for the Horse. When he had so tried the Horse he complained to Mr. Dodd that the Horse stumbled; why, says Mr. Dodd, If it be so, Cousin Reppington, and you don't like him, I'll take him again; No, says the Prisoner, it may be the fault may be in the shoeing of him; I'll take him to my Farrier, and he shall look upon his Feet; Nay, repl'd Mr. Dodd, I wont agree to that; if you will be off of the Horse, let it be this Evening, or else tomorrow I shall expect you shall stand fast to the Bargain; to which Mr. Reppington seemed to yield; but after this he comes to the Groom, Mr. Dodd not being at home, and told him that the Horse, was not for his turn, and refused to pay Mr. Dodd for the Horse, upon which Mr. Dodd arrested him for the 20 Guineas, this relished so ill with the Prisoner, that he grew very angry, came to the Groom again at Mr Dodds House on the Friday before the Fact was done, and bid him tell his Master, That he was injured, and would have satisfaction, and that the Point of the Sword should decide the matter; and that he should be glad to meet him behind Montague House; and that he wore a Sword as well as he, &amp;c.</p>

This was positively sworn by the groom and Footman, and by Mr. Goodchild.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner cross-examined the witness against him, and did all that in him lay to evade the proof; and called a poor Woman, who, he alledged, saw the whole matter; She declared, that she was accidentally going that way, and being weary, sat down upon the Bench at the Inn-Gate to rest her self, and turning her head into the Inn, she saw the Ingagement, and that Mr. Dodd gave the first Pass at Mr. Reppington, and drew his Sword first; But this was contradicted by Mr. Godchild, and the Footman and Groom; who further deposed, that they saw no such Woman there, and were very confident that there was no Woman at all there at that Juncture of time; The Prisoner, after he had been very much indulged, and very patiently heard by the Court, made his defence, declaring that the Deceased was his beloved Friend, and that he had no malice propense against him, Lamenting the loss, of so precious a Friend; then he called abundance of Witnesses, and those Persons of no mean Quality, to give a testimony of him, in the general, as to his Conversation heretofore, who all agreed in their declaration concerning him; how that he was a person of a very quiet, composed behaviour, and that they never saw any thing come from him, but what was like a Gentleman; and if he had at any time injured any person, he always begged their pardon, and made ample satisfaction. That they never found him to be quarrelsome. He pleaded very strenuously for himself, took up a great deal of time (viz.) the space of 6 or 7 hours; the Court very patiently hearing him all that he had to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16940830006"></xptr> Then the Court summ'd up the Evidence on both sides to the Gentlemen of the Jury very distinctly, with all tenderness on behalf of the Prisoner, and told them (first) that it was certain that Mr. Dodd was kill'd by Mr. Reppington: But then the question was, what it would amount to in point of Law? Whether to Murther or Manslaughter, according to Evidence that had been given against Mr. Reppington? And that the Court were of the opinion, That if Mr. Reppington out of any precedent disgust or malice that he had against Mr. Dodd, did design to fight him, and in pursuance thereof draw'd his Sword with which he kill'd him, it was murther. But however, they were to be Judges of the Fact; So that if so be that they found that the Prisoner was guilty of the murther of Mr. Dodd, they would find a Verdict accordingly; but if not satisfied in their Consciences, that he did do it with any disgust or premeditated malice, then they should acquit him of the murther, and find him guilty only of Manslaughter.</p>
               <p>Then the Gentlemen of the Jury having considered of the matter for about two hours time, they returned this Verdict, That Mr. Reppington was <rs id="t16940830-51-verdict225" type="verdictDescription">

            </rs> of wilful Murther upon this Indictment, as also upon the Coroner's Inquest. Then the Prisoner was remanded to Newgate.</p>

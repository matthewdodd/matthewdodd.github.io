                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, of 3, Broadway, Lud<lb></lb>gate-hill. I have been a draper at Bristol and Bath, but was unfortunate—I have been in the habit of selling drapery goods for Swan, at my rooms—I first began to sell them about twelve months before the bankruptcy—sometimes I received an account with them, and sometimes not; it would be kept till entered in a printed catalogue and made waste paper—as soon as the sale was settled I rendered an account of the amount they fetched, and the expenses to him, and paid him over the balance—the year before his bankruptcy I sold for him, I should think, to the amount of 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid him the money—I sold goods for him in March, 1849, I think about three times, the 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, 8th, and 24th, to the amount of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think the three together came to a little under 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I furnished him an account with each, the proceeds, the expenses, and the balance—I sell for what they fetch, not with a reserve price—I keep no account or particulars of the goods after a sale is over.</p>

                  </hi>. I sent the goods to Swan in March last—here is the day-book—they were the goods mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JAMES</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that the indictment could not be sustained, inasmuch as it was framed upon</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> 6 <hi rend="italic">Vic, c.</hi> 122, <hi rend="italic">which was repealed by</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> 13 <hi rend="italic">Vic, c.</hi> 92, <hi rend="italic">that the offence in question could not come within the latter Act, as it was not in force at the period the offence was alleged to have been committed, and that the extent of the repeal applied to the whole of the former statute, with certain exceptions, which were pointed out in the schedule, which schedule did not mention the offence in question.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">also urged that the</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> 6 <hi rend="italic">Vic. was entirely repealed, without any reservation as to this or any criminal offence, except as to the recovery of certain penalties incurred before the Act came into operation; the word "penalty" so used, could not apply to punishment for any criminal offence, but only to fines in civil matters</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. C'LARKSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">contended that the</hi> 12 &amp; 13 <hi rend="italic">Vic. must be taken to keep alive the punishment awarded by</hi> 5 &amp; 6 <hi rend="italic">Vic, otherwise there would be impunity to wrong doers in the interval between the llth Oct., when the former Act was repealed; and </hi>1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">also contended that the use of the word "fiat" in the introduction of the repealing Statute which abolished fiats altogether, rendered it clear that the offences included in the 5 &amp; 6 Vic were intended to be preserved, and that the word "penalty" meant punishment was clear, from the</hi> 254 <hi rend="italic">sec. of 12 &amp;</hi> 13 <hi rend="italic">Vic, where it was expressly stated that a person giving false evidence should be liable to the penalties of perjury</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JAMES</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">in reply, did not mean to suggest that the Legislature had an object in providing any impunity for this offence, but the question was whether or not it was a casus omissus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE COLERIDGE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was clearly rf opinion that the indictment could not be sustained; if it was to be sustained at all, it must be on 5 &amp;6 Vic, because the offence charged was committed prior to the passing of</hi> 12 &amp; 13 <hi rend="italic">Vic, and there were no retrospective words in the penal clauses of that Statute, The question then was, whether the 5 &amp; 6 Vic, was so entirely repealed as not to enable recourse to he had to it? The first section stated, that from and after the commencement of the Act, the several acts set forth in the schedule were repealed: and then in the schedule the prior act was slated to be wholly repealed with certain exceptions, which it was admitted did not bear upon the present question. Therefore, if it stood simply on the words in the schedule, the ques<lb></lb>tion was at an end; but it was said, that there were other parts of the Act which had a saving effect; those parts, in his opinion, referred to proceedings in bankruptcy and not to criminal offences—the inference attempted to be drawn from the</hi> 254<hi rend="italic">th section, as to the word "penalty," entirely failed. It was said further, that the</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">th and</hi> 253<hi rend="italic">rd sections showed that there was an intention to keep alive proceedings of this nature, Now, supposing the Court were satisfied, as it was, that the Legislature never intended that which must result from this omission, yet the Court could not create or punish crimes except upon the clear legal words of the Legislature; but they were not driven to that argument, because it seemed to him that the inferences, attempted to be drawn from the last-named sections could not stand: it could not he said that a criminal proceeding, such as this, was a remedy for a party injured by a bank<lb></lb>rupt and as to the words of the</hi> 153<hi rend="italic">rd section, they might reasonably apply to the case of a fiat, which had issued immediately before the Act's coming into operation.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">entirely concurred in this opinion; it was a perfectly acknowledged rule of law that when a Statute was repealed, you could not proceed against a party for anything done under that Statute; and in the numerous Acts passed on Her Majesty's accession, repealing a vast number of former Acts, an exception was made as to offences committed in the interval, which offences were to be dealt with and punished as if the Statute had not passed, At the passing of</hi> 6 <hi rend="italic">George IV the then Bankrupt Act, exactly the same thing happened as that which now occurred; there the former Acts were repealed without any reservation, and the same argument was used, that the Legislature could not have meant to make a sort of hiatus; the answer was, if they did not, it was a misfortune that they did not provide for it, but they very positively repealed everything that had passed before. It was safer to know nothing of what the Legislature intended, except from what they said; they certainly had not said that any of these provisions should be retained, and therefore they were no longer in force.

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Electric Telegraph Company, and am employed at the Fleet-street branch of the Company—the prisoner has been employed there as a clerk for six or seven weeks—in consequence of something which occurred, I marked 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on 9th Aug., and placed them in the till—the prisoner was in the inner office adjoining where the till was—I requested him to take a message from a customer, he would have to receive the money and pay it into the till—when I went to the till again, about ten minutes afterwards, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were missing, one of which was a marked one—nobody else had taken any mes<lb></lb>sage; that was the only message token, and he was the only person who had been at the till—on the 10th, I missed another marked shilling, and communicated with the officer Green, who came in the afternoon, but no<lb></lb>thing further occurred—he came the next morning, about half-past 10 o'clock, and saw me mark 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and two half-crowns, which I placed in the till as before—I left no unmarked money in the till—the officer re<lb></lb>mained outside; a customer came in, and I went into the inner office and requested the prisoner to take the message and receive the money—he would have occasion to go to the till—(about two minutes before requesting him to take the message, I looked into the till and saw the money safe)—I waited about a minute or a minute and a half) then went to the till, found that an extra half-crown had been taken for the message, and missed a marked shilling—that was about three or four minutes after I had seen them all safe—no one else had gone to the till—I called in the policeman, and gave the prisoner in custody; he said he had not taken anything from the till—he produced 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the officer, and I saw the officer take a marked shilling from the prisoner's pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many clerks are there in the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three, with the prisoner—he had been six or seven weeks at the office in Fleet-street, but he had been in the service of the Company about three months, I think; it was not a year—I should think that the Company would not take any person into their service without an irre<lb></lb>proachable character—I was obliged to give them references before they took me—the other clerks were in the inner office when the money was marked in the policeman's presence—I think there was another customer, but some time before—when I go to the office in the morning the till is empty, and it is-my habit to put money in—on this morning I put in the marked coins, when the first customer came in—I served that customer—that money was not included in the 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I marked, it was taken out directly</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185408140060"></xptr>
               <p>I put the marked money in—I had suspected the prisoner, and had marked money on previous days, which was missed—he said, when he was given into custody, "I never took anything of the Company's; what has hap<lb></lb>pened is through carelessness or neglect," or something of that sort—I am not positive on which side the shillings were marked, but I can swear to the mark; it was a scratch.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MERCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just point out the mark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Here it is, a little cross on the woman side—no customer came in on the 11th, from the time I saw the money safe till I missed the shilling, excepting the one the pri<lb></lb>soner served, and no one went to the till, for I watched to prevent it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long after the customer had gone was it that you went to the till? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five or ten minutes, or less than that; it was a very short time—I gave him into custody about a quarter of an hour afterwards, as soon as I could find a constable.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 376). On 10th Aug. I was consulted by Mr. Jewitt, and on the morning of the 11th I attended at the office, and saw two half crowns and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., marked and placed in the till, about a quarter to 11 o'clock—I was called in about half an hour after, sent for the prisoner, and told him he was suspected of robbing the till, and that I was a police officer, and asked him if he had taken any money from the till that morning—he said he had not—I said I must search him, and requested him to turn his pockets out—he produced this 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a knife—I asked him where he got the shilling—he said he thought he took it in change the day before—it is one of the shillings which I had seen marked half an hour pre<lb></lb>viously, and put into the till.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You had nothing to do with marking it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it was marked on the tail side, but I noticed marks on the other side when I brought it in—the prisoner said, in a very earnest manner, that he never robbed the Company of anything since he had been in the employment.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Rodney Arms New King-street, Dept<lb></lb>ford. I did not know the deceased Allen before Sunday, the 8th of October, when he came to my house, about twenty minutes before seven o'clock in the evening, with a soldier and a girl—the girl went away, and Allen and the soldier went into the tap-room—Allen was very much intox<lb></lb>icated, and the soldier a little in liquor—there were about seven persons in the tap-room—the soldier and Allen were in the same box with the pri<lb></lb>soner, who is a sawyer—in a short time the prisoner and Allen quarreled—I heard them making a noise, and ran into the tap-room—I thought they were quarrelling, because the deceased said, "Never mind, I am determined to fight this man," and he pulled his coat off to fight—I said I would have no fighting there—I took Evans out of the house, and told him to go home—I then went to the deceased, and made him put on his coat, and asked him to sit down for a few minutes, to govern his passion, which he did; in about five minutes he went out of the house, and put his back against the partition as he went out, and said, "I wish I could meet with that man, I would have a fight with him to-night"—he bid me good night, and went out, and in about two minutes, I saw him lying on the ground, about eight feet from my door—the prisoner was intoxicated as well as the other.</p>

                  </hi> I am a private in the 1st Battalion of the Rifle Bri<lb></lb>gade at Woolwich. I went with William Allen to the public-house in question—he was no relation of mine—I have heard him called by the name of William Allen—he was not sober when he entered the house—I was sober enough to know what passed—the prisoner sat in the same box with us—they tossed for a pot of beer, and Allen charged the prisoner with cheating him—that brought on a quarrel—the prisoner was not sober—he went out by the direction of the landlord—I and Allen came out after<lb></lb>wards, and found the prisoner at the door, and he took and knocked Allen down, directly he got his foot on the step to go out—Allen did not say any thing about fighting the prisoner before he received the blow—I have heard what Barlow has said—it is not true—he did not express any wish to fight the prisoner—he did not say so in the public-house—I did not see him take his coat off—I was in the same box with him—Allen fell to the ground from the blow—I helped to pick him up—the prisoner's son came out of the public-house, and knocked me down—I have since seen the body of William Allen dead—I did not hear Allen express any wish to fight—I do not think he could have taken his coat off unobserved by me—no blow bad been given in the tap-room—the prisoner gave no notice to the deceased before he struck him, nor say any thing to put him on his guard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live near the Dockyard-gate, in New King-street. I was standing in front of the Rodney Arms on the evening in question, when some people were running to the house—I ran over, and saw the prisoner strike Allen in the face—I cannot say in what part—he fell with the blow, and hit his head against the curb-stone—I did not notice whether the prisoner remained or went away—I was looking at the deceased—I heard a voice before they went up, but could not distin<lb></lb>guish from whom it proceeded.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to one of the surgeons of Guy's Hospital. I saw the deceased when he was brought there on the morning of the 9th of October, about ten o'clock—he appeared in a state of stupor—that might arise from drunkenness, or the joint effect of a blow and drunkenness—I afterwards observed a slight external bruise on his left eye—he recovered</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183710230237"></xptr>
               <p>from his stupefaction partially—he became much worse afterwards, and then insensible, and was so up to the time of his death, which took place on the 25th of October—I have examined the body since death—the vessels of the brain had burst, both those between the skull and the brain, and also those in the brain itself—between the skull and brain there might be a tea-poonful of blood, and in the substance of the brain a large clot of blood, which would half fill a common tea-cup, and there was a fracture about an inch and a half long on the right side—the immediate cause of death was the extravasated blood, which arose from the rupture of the vessels—if he had received a blow and fell on the curb-stone, that would account for the state in which I found the head—all the parts of the brain were in a healthy state except those in contact with the blood—it was a recent disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having heard that he was in a state of considerable intoxication when he received the blow and fell on the curb, and seeing the state of stupe<lb></lb>faction in which you found him, are those causes together sufficient to have caused death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the appearances were not those of ordinary apo<lb></lb>plexy arising from drunkenness—there must have been external violence to produce the appearances I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Death was occasioned evidently by pressure of blood on the brain from a ruptured vessel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—excitement or drunkenness may rupture vessels—it does so in apoplexy, if the coat of a vessel happens to be thin and defective—his partially recovering and getting vorse again did not indicate a second rupture of the brain—the first state of insensibility was not caused by the pressure, but by the shock or blow—if the vessel had burst in consequence of drunkenness, he would not have recovered in the way he did—I think the spoonful of blood and the half tea-cup full, were caused by a rupture at the same time—it is not at all uncommon for persons receiving a blow to remain in a state of stupor for twenty-four hours, from the effect of the blow alone, without any pressure of blood being thrown out—I attribute the first symptoms to the direct shock of the nervous system.</p>

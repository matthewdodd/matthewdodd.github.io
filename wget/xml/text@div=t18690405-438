                  </hi>. I am acting corporal of the 2nd Company of Royal Marines, at Woolwich—on 16th March, between 10 and 11 o'clock at night, I was going home from the steamboat pier, and when I got to the Black Eagle, the prisoner walked up to me and knocked me down, without saving a word—I believe he had something in his hand, for I felt some<lb></lb>thing like a lump of lead—he then kicked me in the ribs, and I felt a touch at my watch chain—I was in uniform—my watch was inside my jacket, he could not get it out; but the chain was hanging outside, and they strained the swivel—I sung out "Police!" and "Robbery!"—I got up, and was knocked down again by a sweep, who is not in custody—I missed my chain—I followed them into the Black Eagle, where the pri<lb></lb>soner struck me again, in the bar—I followed him to Warwick Street, and then went down to the Dockyard gate, and a constable went with</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Princes Gardens, Princes Gate—about January last the prisoner applied to me for a situation as butler—he referred me to Mrs. Kingswell, near Newport, Isle of Wight, as having kept a large establish<lb></lb>ment, and said that he had had two other men under him; that she had a family of consideration when he was there, and that she would give him a very good character on application—upon that I wrote to Mrs. Kings<lb></lb>well, and received this reply. (<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that Montrose was a very good servant, strictly honest, sober, good-tempered, and obliging' attended church regularly; salary commenced at 451., but owing to his kind<lb></lb>ness and attention during sickness, it was increased considerably, and he was only parted with in consequence of the reduced establishment</hi>.) On the faith of that letter I employed the prisoner as butler—he stated he was a Catholic, and for further protection I wrote to the Catholic priest at Newport, and on receiving his reply I said to the. prisoner "I find you are unknown to the pastor of your church where you represent to have been for four years, which in a small mission of that description is incredible, and I also find</p>

It was not because you were a Freemason that I discharged you, but because of your false representation and false character—you said the reason you did not know the priest was that you were a Freemason, but that did not weigh with me at all.</p>

I am a bootmaker, living at 14, Crowndale Road, Camden Town—I have known the prisoner two and a half or three years—I have known Mrs. Kingswell a few months longer—she is the wife of a draper and sister to the prisoner—in January last she was living with her husband's parents in the Isle of Wight—her husband had been a draper in Yorkshire—I know Mrs. Kingswell's writing—I have seen her write—the letter produced is her writing—I never knew that she kept any establishment.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This stated taht A. Buckley lived in her sevice four years, was strictly sober, honest, most obliging, and enjoyed very good health; good waiter at table, thoroughly understood his duties, and was very clean in person and habits</hi>)—upon that I engaged him—I am not sure whether he left of his own accord, but I had no cause of complaint except that: he had his meals with the other servants.</p>

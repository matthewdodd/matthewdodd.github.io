                  </hi>. I am cashier to William Dunnage and others, who are successors to Messrs. Cubitt. On 29th Aug. we had some works going on at Hatchford-house—it was necessary to remit 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for wages to Mr. Lane, our foreman there—I put 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, into a small parcel, and an advice-note, stating the contents—it was marked Hatchford; but the parcel being too small to have a clear direction, I wrapped it in some shavings, making the parcel larger, and it was directed, "To Mr. Lane, W. Cubitt and Co.'s foreman, to be left at the Weybridge station till called for, Waterloo station, half-past nine train"—I wrapped it round with string, and sealed the ends of the string with a seal, having on it "W. Cubitt and Co., Gray's-inn-road"—on the advice-note I had written, "Dear sir, herewith you will receive 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. gold, and silver 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; total, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Yours truly, W. Harrison"—the parcel remained with me from about 3 o'clock in the afternoon till about 7 in the evening—I then ascertained that one of our carts was going to Hatchford, and I put my pen in a zigzag manner through so much of the direction as directed it to be left at the Weighbridge station—I delivered the parcel to the yard-foreman, Loughborough, and gave him direction about it—these two piece of brown paper(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)</p>
               <p>and Co., to be sent by half-past nine train, and to be left," at some place which is now obliterated—here is a portion of the inner wrapper, in which the advice-note was enclosed—on the outside of it here is written, "Hatchford."</p>

            , the Porter to the Ship behind the Exchange Sudlow pick'd up a Six-pence, and said to the other Porter, Look here, I have found Six-pence. Some Irishmen, of whom the Prisoner was one, coming behind them, and hearing what Sudlow said, they ask'd if he had found Six-pence? He said yes. Why then, says one of them, 'tis mine. How do you know, says Sudlow, has it any Mark? Damn you, says the other, 'tis mine, and I'll have it. Well then, says Sudlow, you shall have it, if you'll give me a Pint of Beer. No, damn you, says the Irishman, I'll have it without, or I'll have as much out of your Bones. Sudlow, at last, gave him the Six-pence, and as soon as he had got it he knock'd Sudlow down with a Stick, though there was no Provocation given; and then the rest of the Irishmen fell upon him too: Some of them had Sticks, but I can't say the Prisoner had any; so they all fell to fighting: Sudlow was very much abus'd, and cut in the Head. He went into the House, and got his Head dress'd, and then coming out again, they fell upon him afresh. The Deceased was then standing at the Tavern Door in his Waistcoat. He was a <rs id="t17330912-6-viclabel33" type="occupation">Soldier</rs>

Upon which the Prisoner step'd up to him, and said, Damn you, you Rascal, do you Chatter? At this the Deceas'd began to strip; but, before he could get his Clothes off, and while his Arms were pinion'd behind him, being part out and part in the Sleeves, the Prisoner fell upon him, and knock'd him down against the Bench with his Fist, by which Blow the Deceas'd's Lip was cut thro', and then, holding the Deceas'd up against the Bench with his Knee, beat him in a violent Manner, and afterwards kick'd him on the Belly, so that his Belly was broke.</p>

The Porter told them it was true he had found a Six-pence, but ask'd them, how he should be sure it was theirs, except they could tell what Marks it had? They swore they would not stand for Marks; but Mark, or no Mark they would have it; and one of them held up a Stick, and offer'd to strike the Porter, and he, rather than be beat, gave the Six-pence to one of them, who, notwithstanding this, as soon as he had got it, knock'd the Porter down, and beat him unmercifully. The Deceas'd being just come to the Tavern Door, bid them not murder the poor Man, and told them, it was very barbarous to abuse him in that Manner; upon which the Prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173309120005"></xptr> came up to him, and said, Damn you, what Business have you to chatter? and with that, the Deceas'd open'd his Waistcoat, and was going to pull it off; but while his Arms were pinn'd behind him, as he was pulling them out of his Waistcoat Sleeves, the Prisoner fell upon him, knock'd him backwards, and gave him at least a dozen Blows, tho' the Deceas'd made no Defence, for he was not able to do it, because his Arms were confin'd.</p>

               <p>Court. Did no Body endeavour to prevent the Prisoner from abusing the Deceas'd in such a Manner?</p>
               <p>Andrews. No Body dar'd to take the Prisoner off. for he and his Companions were all so desperate, that they knock'd down all that came in their way.</p>

There was a Braise six Inches long in the Groin a little above the O Pubs, and upon opening the Abdoman, I found the Intestines were forced into the Scrotum. They were turned black, and the Stench was very offensive This Rupture was the cause of his Death; it was impossible he should have liv'd in that condition, for it hinder'd all the Operations of Nature, so that he could neither make Urine nor go to Stool, but whatever he took in could have no Passage taro' him, but must have been discharged again at his Mouth, and he must have lain in violent Torment.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>How long have you known her? - She came to my house in April; I cannot say the day of the month.</p>
               <p>To lodge at your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where do you live, madam? - At Tottenham-high-cross.</p>
               <p>What have you to say respecting the death of this child? - I can say very little about it, any further than she was taken bad the 29th of April, about three in the morning.</p>
               <p>She had appeared to be with child before that? - Yes, I taxed her with it in the night I slept with her; she left the room the 29th of April, between four and five.</p>
               <p>How long did she stay out of the room? - I really cannot say; I was heavy to sleep; I had knowledge that she was out of the room; she awaked me with getting up; but while she was gone I dropt asleep again.</p>
               <p>What passed on her return? - I accused her with being in labour, or else delivered.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100087"></xptr>Why did you do so? - By the situation that she appeared in.</p>
               <p>What was that situation; do you mean from her look, or complaint, or what? - No, from the appearance of her linen; I taxed her with being delivered or having miscarried.</p>
               <p>What did she say to that? - She denied it; and I told her, I was sure there was something had happened to her more than common; I got up directly; and I was led to the necessary; and by the situation I found the necessary in, I thought some such thing must have happened; and I called my sister; she came directly with me.</p>
               <p>Did she live in the same house with you? - No, just across the road, at a little distance from the house.</p>
               <p>How far from the house is the necessary? - A few paces; not a great way; my sister went up to her, and talked to her; and I shewed my sister her gown; my sister and I searched the necessary; my sister found the infant; I was present when she found it, but I did not look down.</p>
               <p>What time might it be when you found the infant? - I think, to the best of my remembrance, they said, it was ten minutes after five.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner? - In bed, up stairs.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the child? - No.</p>
               <p>You told us the necessary was a few paces from the house; suppose she had called out? - Not any body in our house could have been at her assistance; it was out of hearing of our house.</p>
               <p>What was the infant? - A girl, a female.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether it was full grown? - At the full growth, the doctor said; I do not know myself; I did not examine the infant.</p>
               <p>Were there any marks of violence upon it? - None at all, no marks of violence.</p>
               <p>Was she so big with child that it was visible to every body? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not possible to be concealed? - No, not possible to be concealed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I believe before this poor woman got up, you had mentioned to her, that she was very restless several times? - I asked her, and she said, she was disordered, she thought, by eating rice-milk for supper.</p>
               <p>Did she say, she had something of the cholic? - To the best of my remembrance she did.</p>
               <p>Was there appearances at the necessary, as if the delivery had been there? - Yes, I am sure she could not have been delivered in the room; when she came up, she had nothing on but a gown, a handkerchief, and shoes.</p>
               <p>Was you the person that found the baby-linen? - No, but I saw it yesterday.</p>
               <p>Supposing her complaint to have been what she represented to you, there was no opportunity for her to be relieved in the room without going down; no night-chair? - No, there was none.</p>
               <p>When she returned, do you remember asking her again how she was? - Yes, she told me she was better than when she went out, though but very poorly.</p>

               <p>Where did you find her? - In bed.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass between you? - I asked her how she did; she said, very well, I thank you, my dear, as well as ever I was in my life; I told her, my sister said, she was very bad; says she, your sister says, I have been in labour; do not you think I have had a very good time; and I said, yes, if it is over; with that my sister shewed me her gown.</p>
               <p>Did you know before this, that she was with child? - I always thought she was, and I told her so.</p>
               <p>Was she big with child? - Yes, very big; when my sister shewed me the gown, I was convinced it was over; I immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100088"></xptr>took the candle, and went to the necessary.</p>
               <p>What did you observe there? - The first thing I saw, was the after birth.</p>
               <p>Where did you see that? - Down the necessary; I said, to my sister, here is one thing; here is the child; but I could not find the child at first; it was covered with a kind of dirt and rubbish.</p>
               <p>Did that rubbish appear to you to have been rubbish that was previously in the necessary, or rubbish just thrown in, in order to cover it? - It was what she said, she had taken to wipe the floor.</p>
               <p>What was this rubbish? - A kind of hay and straw; I went back directly to my father's house, and fetched a stick; and in pushing the soil one way, I came directly to it; I could not get it out; and I went over the way, and fetched my husband; I saw it after it was taken out.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you to be full grown? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you a mother yourself? - I have had one child.</p>
               <p>Were there any marks of violence upon it? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mrs. Sutton, you have had but one child? - No.</p>
               <p>Did that happen to be a lively strong child? - No, sir, I had so bad a time it was not saved.</p>
               <p>This child that was found in the necessary was a very strong child? - Yes, sir, larger than mine.</p>
               <p>Most likely to force a birth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you came to the place, there still were the appearances of the accident that had taken place? - Oh, yes! from the up-stairs room to the necessary.</p>
               <p>It was clear that the accident happened at the necessary? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It could not have happened before she left the bed? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see the baby-linen? - Mrs. Richards shewed it to me directly.</p>
               <p>That was immediately after? - Immediately; it was up stairs in the bed-room.</p>

               <p>JOHN HENRY SCHNEIDER. I am the son of the last witness. I saw the billiard-room on the 10th of August, between ten and eleven, before I went to bed, it was shut up, and secured, as it always had been; the windows had no fastenings to it. On the morning of the 3rd, I found one of the windows broken, and the things gone. I shall know the articles when they are produced.</p>

            . I am butler to Mr. Schneider. I saw the billiard room on the night of the 2nd of 
               <persName id="t18140914-79-person785">August. On</persName>
             the morning of the 3rd I saw the billiard-room again; it appeared to have been entered, and the property gone. The prisoner came to me on the 8th of august, he asked if Mr Schnieder was at home. I told him no. He then said, that he wanted to see him, as he had found the chairs that were lost. I asked him where; he said, in the wood. He told me he was going home betwixt nine and ten o'clock on sunday night, that was the 7th, he saw a man before him in the wood, he walked on; something catched his toe, and throwed him down; as he fell, he saw a man in the wood, he fired a pistol at him. The prisoner got up, and said he had two more and he should have the contents of them; he went up a little farther he saw something under a tree, he went to see what it was, he saw, this chair; he took it home he asked me what he had better do; I told him to consult Mr. Walker, his master. The prisoner is Mr. Walker's bailiff, I believe he lived in Mr. Walker's lodge. He went away from me between twelve and one; he brought the chair in a cart; it is a sort of a merlin chair; I did not observe there was any injury done to the chair. I am confident it is the billiard chair, that I had seen in Mr. Schnieder's billiard, room.</p>

            . I lodged with the prisoner, in Mr. Walker's lodge, the lodge is near the road, about three hundred yards from Mr. Schneider's ground. The prisoner was Mr. Walker's bailiff, he had the care of the barn, and the yard. I did not hear of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming home any time of a night - A. on the 7th of august, sunday night, between nine and ten o'clock, he came home with this chair; he said he found the chair in the road, as he came along he saw a man stand on the road, on the left hand side; he went up to the man; the man told him to keep off; he said to the man to fire away, he had got two loaded pistols; he stumbled against the stump of a tree; the contents of the pistol went over his head; he supposed it was providential. he went up the wood, he found the chair, he brought it home on his back.</p>
               <p>COURT. There is nothing to bring it home to the prisoner.</p>

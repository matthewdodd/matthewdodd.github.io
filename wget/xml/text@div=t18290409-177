            . My shop is in Chapel-street, Oxford-street, in the parish of St. Ann's, Soho. This is the half-crown and shilling - I marked both with the snuffers; I know them both.</p>
               <p>MRS. BAILEY. I know this to be the crown-piece she paid me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The lady is very wrong in saying I gave her the shilling; I asked for the potatoes, but nothing else - I never was in the shop before in my life; she said I had a shawl on when I went before - I had not a shilling in my possession, and have not worn a shawl since the beginning of December, when I pawned it for 14s.; she certainly is mistaken in saying I am the person who came the first time; when I gave him the half-crown, he said, "I am very glad I have got you; you have been on the town a long time, and if it is possible to hang you I will;" this is truth, as I am here alive; I never was in the shop before; I said nothing about the potatoes being the same as I had had before.</p>

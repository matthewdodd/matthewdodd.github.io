In consequence of this information, I went to No. 7, West-street, Seven-dials, and I there saw the property which is stated in the indictment, and which is my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say you have lost these from your premises? - A. I have no doubt of it, because there are few in the trade, and each in the trade have their own patterns, and the person who makes the patterns is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - A. He has lived with me six years; he is a servant of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What wages did you give him? - A. He could earn in six days 3 l. 9 s. his wife was an apprentice to me, and is a most deserving woman; she is in the habit of earning about a guinea a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. These are of a particular sort: Do not you know Mr. Newton; does he not use the same patterns? - A. There are one or two patterns that he may use, but I have no doubt of the whole of it being my property.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS sworn. - My husband is a brass-founder, No 7, West-street, Seven-dials. On the 15th of August last, about ten in the morning, the prisoner at the bar brought some brass to sell as old brass, I weighed the brass, it weighed eighteen pounds and a half, it came to one pound and a half-penny: I called Mr. Saunders from the work-shop to give me a one-pound note, and he gave me a two-pound note; I went out to get change, and Mr. Saunders saw the brass laying in the shop, and he supposed it to be stolen; when I came in, I gave the prisoner a one-pound note; Mr. Saunders asked the prisoner to let him indorse it, and directly Mr. Davis came in. This is the brass, and I am sure the prisoner is the man that brought it.</p>

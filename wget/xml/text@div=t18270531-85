             was serving her - she left her twice, went to the top of the shop, and I saw the prisoner draw a piece of silk from the division where they are generally kept - she stood it down by the counter, and hid it with her dress - I told Tokely of it - she watched her for a minute - she then moved herself to conceal it under her shawl - she was going out of the shop when Tokely detained her, and charged her with it - she immediately gave it from under her shawl, saying she was only going to look at it at the door - she had bought something, and was leaving the shop with her basket; she had not got out of the shop - I am sure it is the parcel which I saw her take.</p>
               <p>FRANCES TOKELY. I am shopwoman to Mr. Orme. On the 31st of May the prisoner came into the shop, and asked if we sold white Persian - she bought a quarter of a yard, and gave me half-a-crown - I had to go the top of the shop for change,leaving her alone - when I returned Arith gave me information - she asked for something else - I placed myself behind her, and she appeared much confused - she was tying up her change, and I heard the end of the roll knock against the counter - she had gone about a yard and a half from the counter - I said, "You have a piece of silk under your shawl;" she produced it from under her shawl, and said she was going to look at it - I had seen it safe at twelve o'clock, wrapped in paper, and it had not been unfolded at all - she was given in charge, and I delivered the silk to Mr. Orme.</p>

            . I am a haberdasher and silk mercer, and live in Russel-street, in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields - the shop in part of my dwelling-house. On Thursday, the 31st of May, about half-past one o'clock, I was called into the shop, and informed by Tokely that the prisoner had stolen a piece of silk - she said nothing, and I had her taken into custody - this silk is mine; it measures fifty yards, and cost 4s. a yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg for mercy.</p>

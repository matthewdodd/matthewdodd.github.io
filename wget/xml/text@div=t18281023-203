At one o'clock in the morning I felt my watch drawn out of my pocket by Chalon, who made off with it - I saw both him and Wild close to me at the time - they were standing together; Wild stopped fast at the place - I do not know whether he saw what was done, or whether he knew it was going to be done; he did not resist my going after the other - he merely stood before me; I gave him a shove, and ran after the other; I have never seen my watch since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR, CLARKSON, Q. Were any other person taken to the watchouse? A. I did not give Wild in charge; we went altogether - he could not be in custody; there was not a person named Norcutt there -Wild went to the watch-house; he did not say any thing - he attended before the Magistrate; he was called in as a witness - I was asked if he was the other; I said he was - I did not say he was one of the persons who robbed me; I said he was there, my knowing him was the cause of his being taken into custody - there were three or four men on the spot; I do not know Norcutt - I was quite sober; I am a carpenter, and was out on a little business for a sick man - Norcutt was not charged by me at the watch-house, as being one; I did not see either of them searched - I was called to sign my name in the book; I still say I was sober.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of Sunday week I saw the prisoners, and Norcutt was not far from them - the prisoner Chalon first called me to send the prosecutor one way, and he would go the other; he did not give any reason for it, not I did not ask him, but in a moment the prosecutor told me to take charge of him, for robbing him - I took him, and he went very quietly; he wanted to go to the watch-house; I do not remember what they said at the watch-house, but Todd complained to me that Chalon had stolen his watch - the watch has not been found; it was in Church-street he showed him to me, and in George-street he said he had been robbed at the corner of Vigo-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Chalon call you to take the prosecutor, who had been using abusive language to him? A. Yes, neither Wild nor Norcutt said so; we went to the watch-house, and they were searched by the beadle - I do not know whether the prosecutor said that there were several persons there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were there many persons about, at the time you were called? A. No, only the four - I had not heard a cry of Stop thief! nor heard Todd call out that somebody had robbed him; he gave charge of Chalon the moment he saw me.</p>

            . Q. How long had you been out of employ? A. I had not been out of employ; I was in the employ of Mr. Harris as a journeyman - I did not tell the Magistrate that I had been out of work three weeks, or that I had pawned my clothes; I said I had been ten months in the hospital, and had made away with the best part of my clothes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said in your examination "Wild and the other man went to the watch-house, but were permitted to leave it; on Monday morning last, upon my coming to this office, the prisoner Wild appeared as a witness for Chalon, but upon my identifying him as one of the men who had been concerned in stealing the watch, he was ordered to be taken into custody;" Did you identify him as one? A. The question put to me was did I know that man? I said I knew him - he was with the other; Chalon was never charging me with insulting and abusing him - when I ran after Chalon, it was a very dirty place, and I did no go far up the place; I turned back, and there were three persons there, who urged me to go to the watchman - when I went to him, Chalon came up and urged him to make me go one way, and he would go another; I then gave charge of him - when I lost my watch, there were three or four women, and one of them caught hold of my arm.</p>

            . I remember the time the prosecutor said he lost his watch - it was a few minutes after one o'clock; I was with Chalon and Wild - I was about thirty feet ahead, and heard Chalon sing out "James, here is a man charges me with stealing his watch;" I turned my head, and saw the prosecutor and the watchman, but Chalon had not been out of my sight - he could not have taken a watch and disposed of it, without my knowing it; I did not hear Chalon charge the prosecutor with having assaulted him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were there any women? A. I did not see any - I saw Chalon and the prosecutor together.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you go before the Magistrate? A. Yes, and so did Wild; the prosecutor saw me at the watch-house, and he said he had never seen me, and did not know me - the night-constable searched us all, and no watch was found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a perfumer in the Strand—I first saw the prisoner about the latter end of 1867—he applied to me for a situation, being in distress—he said he had been in business, and would be very happy to nil any sort of post—engaged him as clerk, although I did net want anybody, at a guinea a week—I had been carrying on a correspondence with Mr. Elzinger, of Regent Street, for months before, in reference to a proposed French hospital: it ranged over 1866 and 1867—many of the letters were addressed to my son and myself in Paris—the letters were in a bureau containing various letters relating to the hospital, and I wished the prisoner to classify the papers and sort them out, and show them to me when he had done it—I did not give him any permission to take them—I was honorary secretary to the hospital at the time, and I recommended the prisoner to the committee as paid secretary, and he entered on that office about the middle of February, and left my service—some time in March I received a communication from two members of the committee, and my attention was called by them to a paragraph in the Standard news<lb></lb>paper, reproduced from the <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi>—I saw the prisoner, and asked him if he had any namesake, or relation of the same name as himself, who had committed a robbery in Paris—he said, "No" and seemed surprised—I then gave him the <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi> to read—he road the article through, but did not</p>

I threw them hastily in the bureau—I did not know they were there when I gave the letters to him to classify: they Were among a heap of papers in the bureau—they were mostly from Mr. Elzinger—they were merely from members of the committee.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch and chronometer manufacturer, of 211, Regent Street—I wrote a great number of letters to Mr. Rimmed during 1866 and 1867—most of these-produced are mine, they nearly all relate to the management of the hospital—I saw the prisoner while be was in Mr. Rimmel's service, when I called there—I never had any conversation of any importance with him—I received these two letters (<hi rend="italic">Translated and read</hi>: "Monday. Sir, since the article in the <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi>; I do not know whether it is Elzinger or L——, if he will find himself on Tuesday morning at the Nelson Column, Waterloo Place, to make some communication to him, which may largely interest him. Signed C H.

Von Kranthausen")—after that I made a communi<lb></lb>cation to one of my clerks, Mr. Hubel—after that the prisoner called on me on Thursday, 16th or 17th April, about 5 o'clock—he said he had seen the article in the <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi> paper, and that he was much annoyed by it; and that these matters being published would prevent him getting his living in England, and he would be obliged to leave and go to America—then he said he had some letters of mine written to Mr. Rimmel, that he wanted money for them, he wanted a sum of money to go to America—I told him I should not give him a penny for my letters, as they were Mr. Rimmel's letters, not mine, perhaps he would give him something for them—I asked what he wanted to go to America—he said he left that to me (<hi rend="italic">this was in French</hi>)—I said I did not know what the expense might be—he said be had his wife to take with him—I said "Do you want 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he made a motion as if that was not enough, and I said "20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then"—he said "I will give it you for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said he did not like to ask for money—he was excited in hit manner—he said he knew it was not well what he was doing, but he had no means—I refused, and said I have merely to report what you say to Mr. Rimmel, as these letters are his and not mine—I shall write to Mr. Rimmel, you may ask 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if you like, but I don't think he will give you anything—he said if I did not give him the money he would publish the letters, and would send them to some persons who would annoy me—he handed me two of the letters to show that he had them—I think these are the two (<hi rend="italic">marked C. D</hi>.) one is written on my business paper—I carry on business in London, under the name of Leroy—I think I wrote these while I was in Paris—he put these into my hand and said "There is two of the letters"—he had only these two that I saw—he said if I or Rimmel did not give him the money he would publish the letters—that terminated the interview—I did not see him again till he was in custody—my clerk was within hearing of this interview.</p>

I was in plain clothes—I spoke German, I said lama police officer, and I shall take you in custody for stealing a number of letters, the property of Mr. Rimmel"—he was very excited and said "You cannot take me in custody without a warrant, and on a Sunday"—I said, I apprehend you for stealing, and for that charge I want no warrant, and as for Sunday it makes no difference; I caution you, you need not say anything, but what you do say I shall use in evidence against you"—he then sat down and began to cry—he said "If you let me go, you have the letters now, I'll do anything for you, I will chop wood, or do anything else to recompense you"—I told him I could not let him go, I only had a duty to perform, and that was to secure him—I took him to Mr. Elzinger, and they had some conversation in French which I understand imperfectly, but he implored for mercy.</p>

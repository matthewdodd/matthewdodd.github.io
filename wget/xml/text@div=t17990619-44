             came up first, she laid hold of my handkerchief, and said, this is the w-e that called me a drunkard, now I will drink at her cost, and she took a black silk handkerchief from my neck, and the other listed up her fist only, and gave me a blow on the head; I told the watchman of it, and they were both taken that night within an hour; we knew one another, we had lodged in the same house together; here is a woman that saw her take the handkerchief away.</p>

             M'CARTY sworn. - I am a watchman, I apprehended the prisoners, and searched them in the watch-house, but found nothing; Bridget Casey ran away from me, and whether she threw the handkerchief away then, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Casey's defence. I am a poor widow distressed; Mary Clemstone lived in the next room to me; she had a quarrel with me at eleven o'clock at night, and these two women, Clemstone and Kirton, brought in two men, and they were drinking all night; she said, she would do what she liked in her own apartment. On the 5th of June I went with this woman to see the King and Queen go to the play, and we met with Clemstone, and she said, she would have my life-time out, or be towards it; then she charged the watch with us.</p>
               <p>Richmond's defence. This woman charged us with the watch; we know nothing at all about it.</p>

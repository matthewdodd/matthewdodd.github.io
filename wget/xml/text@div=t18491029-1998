We have lost brandy and port wine—we sent for a policeman on 9th of Oct.—I had seen these bottles in the cellar a day or two before—the prisoners were in the place the greater part of the day—they could get from the tap-room to the cellar—these bottles were found in the tap-room—they are my father's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Mahoney.</hi> I was there with four or five men; it is a night-house; there were several girls there drinking; I never was near the cellar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Masterman, of Black Boy-lane, Poplar. On 9th Oct. I saw the prisoners in the long room at the Harrow—I had a quarrel with Mahoney, and he struck me—I went outside and he followed me—he said, "Why do you turn so <hi rend="italic">crabby</hi>: come in and have something to drink"—I said I did not want any—he told me to go and ask Allen for something to drink out of that <hi rend="italic">plant</hi>—I went, and a man handed a pint of wine to Allen; he drank and gave it me, and told me to drink some, and to drink heartily—Mahoney told me to go and get bottles to put the gin and wine in—Allen said, "It is not down stairs now, it is up<lb></lb>stairs;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184910290147"></xptr>

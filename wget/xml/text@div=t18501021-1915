                  </hi>. I live at 6, Bridge-row, Lambeth. On 22nd March, I carried on business at Richmond-place, Walworth, on which day there was a firkin of butter safe at my door at eight o'clock in the evening worth about 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about nine I missed it, and afterwards on the same night, saw it at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Acton-place, Walworth. One day last March, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was passing Johnston's shop—I had come out of the Rising Sun, which is on the same side of the way, about ten yards off—when I went in I saw the prisoner with a shorter man walking together—I came out, and saw the shorter one take up the firkin of butter—when they got opposite the public-house he dropped it, and the pri<lb></lb>soner took it up—the other said "We must carry it off quick, or we shall get <hi rend="italic">lagged,"</hi> and they turned down Sun-street—I was in <hi rend="italic">the place</hi> at the time, I could see Mr. Johnston's door, and where the prisoner and the other man went—I saw a boy come out of Mr. Johnston's door, and two men were taken in custody, but they were in the public-house drinking at the bar at the same time I was, I swore to them, they were acquitted on that ground—I have known the prisoner four or five years by the name of <hi rend="italic">Froggy,</hi> and the other one I used to go to school with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The place he was in is just like a watchman's box; three gen<lb></lb>tlemen said I was nothing like the man; I was set by myself, and you were brought in, and said, "This is the man." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I went to the station, knew him, and pointed him out directly—they did not point him out to me—they said nothing, whether he was a prisoner or anything of the sort—the shorter one's name is Baker; I believe he is now in Brixton gaol for picking pockets—the butter was found concealed under some hay, down the same turning I had seen them go.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, P</hi> 1). I took the prisoner on 24th March, and told him the charge—he said, "I was at Smithfield at the time"—I left him at the station, went to fetch Mr. Johnston, and before I returned he had escaped—I found him again on 17th Oct. in custody at Bow-street, and told him of the charge—he made no reply.</p>

I had two fifty-pound bank notes in my dwelling-house, they were in my bedroom, in this old pocket-book, and the pocket-book in this little box, and the little box was in this cannister, and the cannister was in the cupboard locked. I occupy the whole house; I rent it myself; I have got the lease of it; my house is in the parish of St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see the notes - A. About a fortnight before I discharged the prisoner, that was on the 16th of March. The prisoner was my servant about two months; I discharged her on the 16th of March. About a fortnight before that, I took eight pounds out of the cupboard; I saw the two fifty pound notes in the pocket-book.</p>

            How long had you had the notes - A. I believe on the 16th of February; I had them of Simpson and Company's banking-house, No. 2, Batholomew-lane. I never took notice of the numbers</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them - A. On the 5th of April. When I found that I had lost two fifty-pound notes, I sent a friend to the bankers to find out the numbers; I had suspicion of the prisoner. I had the prisoner taken up the very day that I missed the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to know that she knew where you put the notes - A Yes. When I took the eight one-pound notes out of the cupboard she was present at the time, at the cupboard; she was present when I asked my wife for the money. I said, I was short of money to go to market. She heard me ask my wife for money, and heard where the money was. My wife asked my son to go up stairs and unlock the cupboard, and let me have some money. The cupboard door I never could unlock or lock it; my wife and son could; my wife always kept the key. My son went up, and I went with him; he unlocked the cupboard; I took eight pounds out; she did not see that. I put the money in again myself; the two fifty-pound notes were in the pocket-book at that time, I put them in myself, and a two-pound note with them. She left the two-pound note behind, and took the two fifty-pound notes.</p>

            . I keep a clothes-shop, No. 50, Rosemary-lane. On the 18th of March, the prisoner came into my shop, and a man with her; she told me that she wanted to buy a pelisse. a handkerchief, and a pair of shoes for herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that man was - A. Yes; his name was Reorden. She said, she wanted for Reorden, a coat, waistcoat, breeches, shirt, hat, stockings, handkerchief, drawers, and shoes; the shoes I had none to give him; I gave him eight shillings to buy them. She told me that she had a fifty-pound note to change; I considered about the size of the note. I asked her where she got the note; she told me she got it as prize money from her brother on board the Corvas. I told her I was not in the habit of taking these large notes without going to the Bank to know whether they were right or not. She and the man told me to go to the Bank; I asked her name; she told me

            . I went to the Bank; I endorsed the note with mine and her name upon the note. I got change instantly. I came home; there were three or four people in my shop; I took her and the man up stairs. She said she wished to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200033"></xptr>leave some of the money in my hands, she did not want all the change.

On Friday evening the man called for the goods, and took them away at different times, and the 5th of March, that is the day she was taken in custody, I gave her whatever money she called for; on that day particular I gave her five-pounds in money.</p>
               <p>Q. How much has she received in the whole - A. Forty-three pounds four shillings and ten-pence; the balance I deposited in the hands of the magistrate. I did not see any other note in her possession. My agreement was with the woman; she gave me the note. I acted by her directions; she agreed with me for every thing.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the house of Messrs. Simpson and Company. I paid the two fifty-pound bank notes to Brookery, the numbers of the notes I gave him one fifty-pound 8606, another fifty-pound note 7083.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I took the note I thought it was a one-pound note, and when I came out the two notes stuck together. I said, I would give the notes back to my mistress, when I took some money of my brother, and when I came to this shop. I saw it was a high note. I said, I am glad it is stopped, my mistress shall have it again. I came down Rosemary-lane; I met Reorden; I told him I found a note. I said, what is it; he said, let us go in here, and change it. He whispered something to the gentleman. He told me to say I had some prize money. The gentleman went to the Bank, and got the note changed. Reorden said I had better not have the change for fear it should be found about me. The clothes I had of the gentleman were old clothes, not worth the money he charged.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 25, Wellesley-street, Stepney, and am a cigar maker—on 15th November, about 12 at night, I was in the Commercial road, going home, and saw the prisoner standing against the door of Phillip's Music Hall—she asked me how I was—I said, "First rate"—I then looked at a seaman who was intoxicated, and then turning round I saw the prisoner speaking to a man—I made my way across the road—she followed me, and I told her to leave me—I saw her whispering to the man, and I crossed the road again, and told her to leave me, and go to her male companion—she caught me by my cape, and with a loud cry called out, "Give me my money"—that took me off my guard for a moment, and she caught at my watch—she kept me by my cape—two gentlemen were passing, and would have nothing to do with it—I called out "Police," and she called out with a loud voice "Jem"—Jem made his appearance—he was about thirty yards from me—I saw him speak to her, but an officer came up—the prisoner then said, "The gentleman has had connection with me"—that is not true.</p>

On the night of 15th November, I heard cries of "Police" in the Commercial-road—I went up, and found the prisoner struggling with the prosecutor—I went to lay hold of her—she ran across the road—I ran after her, stopped her, and said, "What are you about?"—she said, "I want my money"—I said, "What for?"—she said, "He has had connection with me down the street"—the prosecutor said, "Do protect me, do"—he was very much excited, and his face was scratched—I saw two persons near, but they went on—I saw no man, but there was plenty of opportunity for one to get away—it was about 12 at night—there were not many people about—I took the prisoner in custody.</p>

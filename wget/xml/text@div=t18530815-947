                  </hi>. I live at No. 22, Bedford-row, Guild ford-street, Borough. I knew the deceased Mrs. Bishop as a neighbour, she lived at No. 21, Russell-place, opposite me—from something I heard on Sunday afternoon, 3rd July, about 3 o'clock I went over to the deceased, and found her lying on the bedstead with a chemise and counterpane thrown over her, she appeared to me as if she was in a fit, she was not able to speak to me—the prisoner was sitting on the edge of the bed—I remained with her up to 9 o'clock at night with a very slight interval, just crossing the road—on my suggestion, Mr. Nash the surgeon was then called in—I did not remain with her all night, I left at 9 o'clock—I was called at 20 minutes past 2 o'clock in the morning, I then remained with her up to within ten minutes of her death—she died from about half past 11 to 12 o'clock—after her death I examined her person—I saw two small bruises on the left side of her head, a small cut bruise on the right side of the head, about the length of my nail, which appeared to have been done about four or five days; a bruise on the back</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185308150133"></xptr>
               <p>part of the right arm, and one, a very large, one quite at the bottom of the hack—the two bruises on the head seemed quite fresh—I asked the prisoner how the bruises came there; he said he did not know—I asked if he had bad any words with her—he said he had had words on the Saturday night, but no blows had passed between them—he said he had found her, between half past 5 and 6 o'clock on the Sunday morning, on the floor at the bottom of the bedstead, and she then appeared to be in a fit, in the same state as I had found her—I had not known them long, they had not lived a great while in that neighbourhood—she had five children.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Lambert, a dairy<lb></lb>man, and live at 22, Russell-place, Bedford-row—I knew the deceased—I saw her on the Saturday before her death, between 3 and 4 o'clock—she was then quite well and quite sober—after 6 o'clock I heard her and the prisoner quarrelling—my house is divided from theirs at the back only by three boards—there was great swearing between them and quarrelling—I did not exactly understand what it consisted of—I heard him call her some name, and I heard her say "Pray don't hit me, for I have not been out"—I did not see any blow given, But I saw her fall back—I saw her back; I could not see the whole of her person, because she was inside the door; I saw her project out from the door, backwards—I heard the noise of crockery being broken—after the fall, I heard a moaning—I did not see her after that till about 11 o'clock on Sunday morning—she was then lying on the bed, insensible—the prisoner was by the side of the bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am eleven years old, and am the prisoner's son. I recollect the Saturday before my mother died—she dined with me that day, and also my father, my brother, and sister—my father left borne after dinner, about a quarter to 2 o'clock—my mother had been in the house the greater part of the day before dinner—after my father left she went out; she returned about half past 4 o'clock, very tipsy—she sat down—we had tea about 5 o'clock—my father returned about 6 o'clock—he said my mother was tipsy; she said she was not—he said she was; she said if he said she was tipsy she would dash his brains out with the basin, and she took a basin from the table and threw it at him and hit him across the forehead—my father then went to wash and shave himself, and my mother went and sat on the stairs—she said she was very tired, and she would go up and lie down, and when she was going up she fell backwards down three steps; that was by the back door—my father was then in the front room, shaving himself—my mother lay there about five minutes; she then rose up and said she was very tired, and she ran up stairs and laid down—she did not cry out at all when she fell down—I was in the back room at the time; I had the baby—my little brother and sister were there, they are younger than me—neither of us went to my mother—she did not come down again that night</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185308150134"></xptr>
               <p>—it was about twenty minutes past 6 o'clock when she went up stairs—my father went out about half past 6 o'clock, and came home about 11 o'clock—my mother remained in bed all that time—my father went up stairs to see if she would come down, and she said "Oh, let me alone"—he then took the baby from her; it is about twelve months old—he slept with us that night—I did not see any blow struck that night, except what I have mentioned—my mother only had one fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I am afraid you had seen your poor mother tipsy before, had you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, several times—she was more tipsy than usual that day—she went out immediately after my father, and remained out till tea time, and then came home very tipsy—when she threw the basin at my father he was very irritated, and he swept the tea things off the table—he did not strike her—the tea things were broken, it made a great noise—I minded the baby while my mother was out—I used to go to school on other days, but this was a holiday, and I was at home—my father went for Mr. Nash, the surgeon, on Sunday morning—I heard my mother moaning in the morning about 6 o'clock, and my father immediately went for Mr. Nash—I was not in the room when he came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Bridge-street, Southwark. On Sunday, 3rd July, about 10 o'clock at night, I was called in to see the deceased—she was then in a sinking state—I could do nothing for her—I saw she was dying; it was quite a hopeless case—I gave her some stimulants—afterwards, in consequence of an order from the Coroner, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the state of the stomach and liver indicated a habit of drinking—there was a great deal of disease in the chest; both lungs were diseased—that did not contribute to her death—death was caused by extravasation of blood on the brain, which I detected on opening the skull—I found an injury corresponding to that extravasation, behind and above the right ear, and there were also contusions on the left side of the head—I should say the injury had been inflicted three or four days—I made the examination on the Tuesday—there was no injury of so recent a date as Saturday evening" except the bruise on the right shoulder—all the injuries on the body were of an older date—the injury on the head had the appearance of having been inflicted three or four days before death—I think the extra<lb></lb>vasation of blood must have taken place on the Saturday evening—the wound which corresponded with the extravasation I should say had been inflicted at least a couple of days previous—I think the injuries behind the ear so injured the vessel without exactly tearing it across, that subsequent excitement or the fall had divided it—that which the witness described as a bruise at the lower part of the back was not a bruise—it was merely caused by pressure, such as might be produced from a person lying in bed—the extra<lb></lb>vasation of blood would account for the sinking state in which I found her on the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know that a Mr. Tibbitt's had been called in before you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have not seen him here—the prisoner appeared desirous of doing everything he could for his wife—I gave general directions to bathe her temples, and so on—there were a great many women present, and I think they did that—he appeared grieved, I saw him crying—that was after her death—I think it most likely that the immediate cause of the extravasation was a fall coupled with excitement.</p>

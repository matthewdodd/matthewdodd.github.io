I believe he is the man, there was another man with him, they passed me, I followed them directly and overtook the prisoner with this box upon his back, and some meat; I asked him where he was going, he said, he was carrying it for his brother; I told him he could not go that way; and the other man said, Jack, I told you we could not go that way; then the prisoner came behind me, and just as we got to Mr. Drummond's door, he put the box down, and a quarter of lamb and some beef upon it, and away he ran; this box was locked, I then took the property to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you such an opportunity of seeing him as, to be able to say the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes, I am positive of it; I took it to the watch-house, and found it belonged to Mr. Brookes, there was some halfpence and books in it; while I was looking over the things, the prisoner was brought in by another watchman, I knew the man again directly.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the prisoner say any thing? - He said, he knew nothing of me, nor I of him.</p>

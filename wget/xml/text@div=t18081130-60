            . I live with Mr. Harley, a publican in Parker street; I took some liquor into Mr. How's yard; the prisoner gave me half a crown to pay for it; I was sent somewhere else with some more liquor, and turning back I saw a man come out of the yard with a wheel.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the prisoner did not you - A. Yes, I saw him fall down with the wheel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk - A. Yes, apparently; I helped to pick him up. I went into the yard with the change. I found the man was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not know that was the man that bought the gin - A. No, I was not certain that was the man that wanted the change; there were other workmen in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the yard where they could see him take the wheel - A. I did not see any; I went in with the change, they told me the man was gone and the wheel was missing; I directed them where he was gone, and they went immediately after him; when he came back he asked me for the change; I gave it to him.</p>

            . I work at Mr. How's; as soon as Mr. Watson missed the fore wheel from Mr. How's back premises, he went in search after the thief; I likewise ran into Gate street Lincoln's Inn fields, I saw a man carrying a wheel across Gate street; I ran as fast as I could and collared the man, upon which the wheel dropped; I asked him where he got that wheel, and where he was going with it; he said he had no wheel, nor had not seen a wheel all that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he carrying the wheel - A. He was carrying the wheel on his arm; I am sure the prisoner is the man that had the wheel; I knew him as soon as I collared him; I kept him in custody till I got a watchman, and the wheel was brought back to the premises where it was taken from. It is Mr. How's wheel, it is not completely finished.</p>
               <p>Q. to Watson. Do you know whose wheel it is - A. It is quite a new wheel, it belongs to Mr.

               <p>Q. Do you call a thing a wheel till it is quite finished - A. Undoubtedly it is.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he quite sober or a little drunk - A. A drunken man could not have managed that wheel.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that a sober man would carry a wheel in that manner, do not you think that a sober man would not have trundled it along rather than carry two hundred weight - A. I saw him carrying it on his right arm.</p>

               <p>Q. Could not he have got on much faster if he had trundled it along - A. Yes, he could, but it would have made an alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath was not he quite drunk - A. He was the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he very drunk - A. He could not be very drunk else he could not have carried the wheel along.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a shopmate along with me, he was discharged; he asked me to go to that shop to ask for employment; I went to Mr. How's, Mr. Fletcher was not at home; the horse keeper said let us have some gin; I gave the girl half a crown to get three half quarterns of gin; I went away and did not take the change. I forgot myself and went back for the change; I did not take any thing.</p>

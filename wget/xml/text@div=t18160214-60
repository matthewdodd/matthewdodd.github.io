At about half past six I saw the prisoner pass my master's door with a carcase of a sheep on his shoulder. I saw that he came in a direction from Mr. Rutter's, and the carcase of the sheep had the head on, which is not customary in those which are sold. I had some suspicion, and followed the prisoner into Ivy-lane. I then stepped up to him, and asked him where he was going? and he said he was going to a butcher of the name of Hill, who was a salesman in the market. I told him he was going out of his way, and immediately brought him back into the market. I knew perfectly well, by the marks on the sheep, to whom it belonged. All carcase butchers score their sheep differently, so that we can know them. When I brought the prisoner into the market, he threw the sheep off his shoulder. I caught the sheep, and he ran away. I pursued him, crying, Stop thief! and he was stopped in about five minutes.</p>

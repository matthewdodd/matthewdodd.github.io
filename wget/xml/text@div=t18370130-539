               <p>I am the wife of John Samuel Hittinger. We keep wine vaults in the Broadway, Westminster—the prisoner lived with me seven months, to nurse the children—I only had her for a time—I paid her weekly, and boarded her—I kept this property in a drawer, in my own bed-room, in a box, which was always locked—I gave her my keys to give to her master, when I was going out; and when I came back she said she had not given them to her master, as he was busy—this key was on the bunch with others; and that it when I think she took the things—she left me on the 29th of November—I missed the property on the 7th of December—this ring and necklace were brought to rat by a witness—they are mine—the prisoner's brother brought her to me with Mrs. Plumbley—the prisoner denied taking them; and desired Mrs. Plumbley to go and fetch them to me—I accused Mrs. Plumbley of en<lb></lb>couraging her; and she said all she had seen were the necklace and ring.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married. I have known the prisoner four years—she lost her mother, and I took her in out of charity, when she left her place—I went to look at her box for her dirty things, and saw this neck<lb></lb>lace laying there—when she came in I said, "What do you do with these beads?"—she said, "The housekeeper in Frith-street gave me them"—she brought me this ring—I laid them on the shelf, and said I would throw them behind the fire, because they were not proper for a young girl like her to wear.</p>

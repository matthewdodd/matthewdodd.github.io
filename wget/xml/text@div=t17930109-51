On Monday the 31st of December I was going across Castle-street, I heard the cry of stop thief! the prisoner came past me, and I immediately pursued him, and I saw the constable stop him; I kept in sight all the way, and the woman came up immediately, he ran much faster than she; she said, she had lost a hat; we went back to look for it, but could not find it, it was not found at all; I don't recollect the prisoner said any thing only that he had not got it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer of Bishopsgate ward; I heard the call of stop thief! and I assisted in stopping the prisoner; I saw him taken, the hat has never been found, the woman said at first she could not swear to the man, she was so much frightened she could not tell me; I searched him and found nothing at all upon him; I carried him to the watch-house, and they were about ten minutes there together; I found another hat there on him which was not this person's property; I kept him on the charge of Mr. Twydell.</p>
               <p>Q. I would wish to know whether this man was taken to the compter on the charge of this woman or any other charge? - I took him rather on the charge of Mr. Twydell, because he saw him run with the hat in his hand.</p>
               <p>Twydell. He had something in his hand when he passed me; I cannot swear it to be that hat.</p>
               <p>Court to Whitehead. The woman seemed very much frightened, and not positive to the man; I ask you this at the time that this man was taken up was he taken to the Compter for the charge of this woman, or for the other hat? - For the hat which the woman had lost; she said, she would not be positive, but she believed him to be the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing at all about it; I never was in trouble before in my life; I was coming home from my work; I had been and earned a shilling and fetched that hat out of pawn which the gentleman took away from me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. How happens it you was more positive the next day than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090080"></xptr>the day before? - I could not give charge; I said at the watch-house that the prisoner was the man, but I would not give charge.</p>
               <p>Court to Satwell. Your evidence was that she would not swear to the man? - I asked her in the watch-house if she knew the man; she said, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she swear to the man? - Not till the next day, I don't recollect that she did that evening.</p>

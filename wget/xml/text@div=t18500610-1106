                  </hi>. I am a wine-porter, of 44, Lambeth-street, Whitechapel—I lived with the prisoner eight or nine years—I separated from her a month before this took place, seven weeks ago. On 21st May, about half-past nine o'clock, I heard a knock at the door—I went, followed by my son, and found the prisoner there—she asked me for a teaboard, and before I had time to answer she said, "Take that," and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> some burning liquid over me out of a jug in her hand—it went into my eyes—I felt a burning sensation all over my face, and was in great pain—the prisoner went away—I went to a surgeon, and afterwards to the London Hospital, and was there a fortnight—the sight of one eye is entirely gone—my face is well, but discoloured.</p>

On 21st May, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and asked for two pennyworth of vitriol, and produced a small jug like this(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave her about a quarter of a pint in it—I did not measure it—it was three-parts full.</p>

On the evening of 21st May I saw the prisoner throw this jug into the road—I picked it up—there was a small quantity of spirit in it—it was like water—it smelt like vitriol, which I believe it to be—I took it to Mr. Argent.</p>

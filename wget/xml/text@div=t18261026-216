            . I am a waterman. On the 30th of September I had brought a lady from a ship, with a quantity of luggage - she was landing at <placeName id="t18261026-216-crimeloc1194">Blackwall-stairs</placeName>

            . I am a surgeon. I was fetched to the deceased, and found him dying - after his death I opened his body, and found five or six pints of extravasated blood in the belly; there were several external bruises, and one corresponding with the rupture of the spleen - he died from the extravasation of blood occasioned by that rupture - the spine had been diseased before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Would his fighting occasion it? A. Not without receiving a blow.</p>

            . I saw this man after his death - the surgeon saw the same person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you present when he examined it? A. No; he was carried to the King's Arms public-house, and laid on the table; there was no other dead man there - I did not search the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I called out to know if the lady wanted a porter to carry the things on shore; Daniel Baker also plied her; she nodded, and on the boat reaching the shore the waterman called to me, to pull her in, which I did. I then took hold of the hammock, which the deceased perceiving, attempted to take from me; and in so doing, he pushed me into the water. I got out of the water, and, in the irritation of the moment, struck him, which was returned, and we fought four or five rounds. He being older than myself, I rather endeavoured to keep him off, than to strike him; but in the last round he unfortunately fell on the nose of the boat, which hurt the spine and caused his death. I had no animosity whatever towards the deceased: indeed I hardly knew him.</p>

            . I am a brick-maker. I was a constable about five weeks ago - my time is now out. On the 10th of June I was in Newport-street, and saw the prisoners together at the bottom of that street. I had an umbrella over my head; they passed me and walked on; I crossed over - they walked side by side; I saw Grant with two or three accomplices at Mr. Byrne's pocket; he took a handkerchief from the pocket, and gave it to M'Carthy; I went up and laid hold of M'Carthy - he threw the handkerchief down, and while I was stooping to take it up, he hit me - I called Mr. Byrne, who claimed it. - Bradbury, who was with me, took Grant. I am sure of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. They do not employ you as a constable now - A. No; I did not try for it, as I expect a better situation shortly. They could not see me, because I had an umbrella up. I never bought any silk handkerchiefs.</p>

            . I was with Keys; we saw the prisoners behind the prosecutor. I had seen Grant before with two or three companions at the pocket at the corner of the street - he took the handkerchief out of Mr. Byrne's pocket, and gave it to the other; I pursued and took him in Monmouth-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you on first seeing them - A. On the left hand, under Keys's umbrella - we were within twelve yards of them.</p>

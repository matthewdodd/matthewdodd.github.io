               <p>I attend at Sir John Fielding's office; Mr. Bond and I went in pursuit of the prisoner, on the 21st of January; I enquired at several inns to see if I could trace his going off into the country; I had a description of his person; at about ten at night, on Wednesday the 21st, I heard at the Bull and Mouth-Inn, that such a man had gone on the outside of the Worcester coach on the night before (Tuesday night.) Mr. Bond and I set off at about eleven o'clock that night; we got to Oxford at about six in the morning; we waited for the book-keeper getting up, and then enquired whether he had gone any further; the book-keeper told us such a person was gone into Worcester; we went into Worcester; we got there at about six o'clock on Thursday night; we staid there till about four o'clock on Friday; when we found that the prisoner had hired a horse to go to Ludlow, we traced him from Worcester to Ludlow, from Ludlow to Bishop's-Castle, and from thence to Montgomery, where he had changed his horse; at about seven in the morning I found him at his mother's house at Kellhull; on Saturday morning at about seven o'clock I rode up to the door, got off my horse, and ran into the house; I met his mother; I asked where her son Tom was? she said he was in bed; I went into the room where he was, and said Tom, you must get up; he said,</p>
               <p>"O Lord! O Lord! have mercy upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180049"></xptr> me;" he got out of bed directly; I asked him where the things were that he had stole?</p>
               <p>From the Jury. Did he make that exclamation before you accused him? - Yes; I had been informed, that he had a saddle-bag; I asked where it was? he said it was not there; in searching about the room, I found a little closet under the stairs; there I found the saddle-bags; I opened them, and found that some of the things in the bags tallied with those that were described to me as lost; I then told him he might as well tell me where the money was, for that there was evidence enough against him, or I would not ask him to take any advantage of him in any shape, and it was no use to keep it from the poor man; he asked me whether the man would have it again, if I found it? I told him he would; the prisoner then told me it was in a purse in the cupboard in the other room; I found there thirty-six guineas; I never saw a prisoner behave so well as he did in my life; I brought him to London with the things I found there; I believe there is every thing that was lost, except twelve guineas; this shirt (producing it) he had on, and the laced hat hung upon a nail in the room; he put it on to come to London.</p>
               <p>[The things were produced in Court, and deposed to by Foubister.]</p>

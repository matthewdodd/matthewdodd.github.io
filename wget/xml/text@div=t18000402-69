               <p>Q. Are you quite sure he must have come into the shop? - A. I am quite sure of it; the prisoner told me that a gentleman had given it him to carry, at my door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At the time this ticking was taken out of your shop you were in the kitchen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nobody in the shop when you came up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up the man had run away, and you ran after him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What opportunity had you then of seeing his face? - A. He turned, repeatedly, to see if I was coming after him, and when he got to the pales, I almost caught hold of his hand.</p>

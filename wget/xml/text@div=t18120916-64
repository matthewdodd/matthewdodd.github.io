               <p>Q. Were you present at the Court in Clerkenwell, in December, 1809 - A. I was. She was tried for uttering had money, and convicted, along with a person of the name of Allison. They were sentenced to be imprisoned in the House of Correction, for one year, and to find sureties for two years to come.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Allison's Christian name - A. I think, Thomas, but I am not sure. We had only one Allison in custody at that time.</p>

               <p>LION EARLE GIRLING. I keep the White Bear public-house, Newport-street, Leicester-fields. On the 20th of August the prisoner and another woman came to my house. The prisoner ordered two glasses of gin. The gin came to five pence. The prisoner offered me a bad shilling. I returned it to her, and told her, it was bad. She said, she had just taken it of a butcher in Newport-market. She said, she had no more money, and asked the other woman if she had any money to pay for it. She said, she had not enough, only a one-pound note. The prisoner then said, she would go and change the shilling at the bu. They both went out for that purpose. I knew the prisoner, Rogers, before; that gave me suspicion. I followed her. She went to the window of Mr. Cole, a linen-draper, in the same street. They stood some time at the window. They went in. I went and got Creswell, the constable. I returned to see if they were there. I saw them there. I left the constable there. I told the constable what to do. I went home. I returned to the shop window of Mr. Cole. I saw some money fly against the window in the shop. There was something fell on the glass in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160038"></xptr> linen-draper's shop window. I went to the watch-house with the prisoner.</p>

I opened her hand, and got the shilling from her, not knowing that she had any more; but finding her right hand clenched, I insisted upon opening that. She wanted to get towards the door, which I prevented. In the struggle she threw a parcel of money in the window. I saw her do it. I believe the money was done up in a bit of paper. I distinctly saw her throw it. The shillings she threw in the window were picked up by Smith, Mr. Cole's shopman. He gave them to me. They have been in my possession ever since. I produce them.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Cole. On Thursday the prisoner and another woman came into Mr. Cole's shop. I shewed them a large medallion, with a border round it. The prisoner said, she had one like that at the door, but it had not a border. She should like to have a border. I shewed her a remnant, and I agreed to take eightpence for it, for which she gave me a shilling. I told her, I thought it was a bad one. They wished to persuade me that it was good, which gave me suspicion. I took my scissars, and marked it before them. I then threw it back, and told them, I was positive it was bad. The prisoner took it up. She offered me no other. I saw some halfpence as her hand. I asked her if she would leave that in part of payment, and call again in the morning. She refused; and while I was discoursing with her Creswell came in, and as she was leaving the shop Cresswell seized hold of her hand, and told her he wished to see what she had in her possession. A struggle ensued. He had hard work to search her. He took a shilling from her hand. She threw from her other hand a number of other shillings, among the goods in the window. After she was secured I got into the window. I picked up all I found. I think, eight shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Had there been any shillings in the window before she throwed them - A. None; that I am positive there was not. The shillings that I took out of the window I gave to Cresswell. I gave him eight that time, and two I found the next morning. I gave him them also.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the shilling that was taken from her hand - A. That was the one I marked with an S. I saw it again directly; Cresswell took it out of her hand. I know the shilling. This is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to John Wills, a hosier, at the corner of Berwick-street, Ox ford-street. These handkerchiefs are his—the shop ticket is now on them—on the evening of the 15th of August a lad, about fifteen, came and bought a pair of braces-as I went to tbeend of the shop to get the braces, I suppose, he did something—he came a second time to change them, and a third time to buy another pair, which we re<lb></lb>fused him-in a short time a mob came to the door, and I saw Jeffery in the hands of a policeman, and these handkerchiefs were produced—I had not seen either of the prisoners at the door.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 106.) I was coming dawn Oxford-street, and saw three persons near the prosecutor's shop, about the corner of Berwick-street—I suspected from what I had seen previously that they had been stealing a basket, and I got the assistance of another officer-in a short time Row, the other, left the two prisoners—they had been talking together—I then went with He slop, the other constable—he went on one side, and I the other—I saw one of the prisoners make a motion <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the other that the police were there-Jeffery took this basket and put it under his coat—I laid hold of him by the collar, and took Bailey by the arm—I called the other officer-Row had made his escape-had not seen Row go into the shop—I was struggling with Bailey-his hat fell off, and I heard something fall-in going to the station-house I looked into the basket, and found these handkerchiefs in it—this was about nine o'clock-Row was shorter than Bailey, and had a cap and jacket on—I went back, and found some glass broken.</p>

I have heard what pasied—it is true—I took Bailey to the station, and found upon him five duplicates, a key, and a hook-nothing else-twopairs of braces were found on Jeffery—he was asked where he got them—he said he purchased them at a shop in Oxford-street—these are them—he was then asked whether he purchased the handkerchiefs likewise—he said, "Yes," but he did not know where, and he turned to Bailey.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a public house, in Mile-end-road. On 10th Jan., a little girl came for half a quartern of gin—I served her, and she gave me a counterfeit sixpence—I asked her where she came from, and sent my boy with her—he returned with the child, and a woman—while the woman and the child were at the bar, the prisoner came in—she had half a pint of beer, and she gave part of it to the woman who came back with the girl—the prisoner then left the house—the other woman and the child then went away—I kept the sixpence separate, and gave it to the officer.</p>

On 10th Jan., a little girl came to the public house—I went out with her—I saw the prisoner, and another woman together—the other woman joined the child—I left the prisoner in the street, and went for an officer—I then saw the prisoner stopping in a gateway.</p>

The last witness pointed out the prisoner, who was behind a pair of gates stooping down, and putting her left hand towards the ground—the prisoner then came out, and I called her—she asked what I wanted her for—I told her I wanted to know what she was doing inside the gates—she said, she was tying up her stocking—I went to the place and found this black bag with twelve bad sixpences, and three bad shillings in it—that was about three feet from the place where she had been stooping—the money was wrapped in different pieces of paper—I said to the prisoner, "I see what you have been doing"—she said, she knew nothing about it—I received this other sixpence from Mrs. Lawrence.</p>

               <p>I came at two o'clock to water the road on the 15th of July, and I saw a drover turning some sheep into Brook-street, and he said what are those people doing there on the leads, and I looked across the way to Staples-inn; and at a side window I saw a couple of men on the leads, I turned towards them, and they jumped off, and two stood below, I kept my sight as well as I could on one of them, that did not run, the other three run.</p>
               <p>Did they jump off into Staples-inn or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140007"></xptr> into Holborn? - Into Holborn, the leads are over some shops, the one that I kept in my eye was the prisoner Munday; Griffiths I believe was the other, but I will not be positive of any other but Munday, as I was flurried; I took Munday in Brook-street, I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Munday. My Lord, I was drinking at the pump when he took me.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the windows opposite to those leads when you observed the men, were they open or shut? - The glass of the casement was broke, and the casement was open, I charged them with a constable, and I told the porter that I saw another in the window half in and half out, but I could not tell who it was; Munday was let go out of the watch-house, there being nothing found on him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles Counsel for the Prisoner Munday. You do not come to water the streets, I suppose, till day-light? - It was not very light.</p>
               <p>You could have seen the face of any of your companions that were passing by that way? - Yes, and it was as much as I could do.</p>
               <p>Where was Munday when you came up to him? - He was stopping at the pump to drink.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say, or do you know that that was the way to his mother's house? - Yes, he said so.</p>

               <p>And you have found it out to be so since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you call to him to stop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He returned to you voluntarily? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came he to be discharged? - The constable asked me if they charged him, and I said no; I only was in the room at the chambers at that time.</p>
               <p>Was not this man examined several times before the justice? - Only once when I was there.</p>

               <p>Do not you know he has been examined twice before you appeared? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before you went to the justice you knew he was taken up? - I was told so.</p>
               <p>Then did not you think it your duty to appear when you first heard he was taken up? - I am a stranger to these things, I went when I was asked to come.</p>
               <p>Who asked you to come? - Jackson, the runner.</p>
               <p>Is Jackson here? - I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Now, I suppose, he did not tell you it would be worth your while to come? - He told me I must come.</p>
               <p>Did not he give you some hint that you might get a little money for coming? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What was to fall to your share? - He never promised me any thing, nor never spoke to me about the money.</p>
               <p>Who was that man that did promise you any part of the reward? - I have had no talk with any of them for the reward.</p>
               <p>You knew though I suppose that you was to have at least a share of forty pounds? - There were some people of my kind that told me here and there, that I should have it.</p>
               <p>Yes, I thought so, now if you could have strained yourself a little further, you would have a share of four times forty pounds? - I would not wish it.</p>
               <p>No, I suppose not! that is well done; your employment is a waterman? - I have done it several seasons.</p>
               <p>How much may you get a-day by it? - Fourteen shillings a-week, sometimes more and sometimes less.</p>
               <p>Jury. I think you said that Munday was one of the two that jumped off the leads? - Sir, I did say that he was one of them, as I believe.</p>
               <p>Are you satisfied that is the man that you saw jump? - I believe so, Sir, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you keep him in sight from the time he jumped off till he was taken? - I think I did.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Rooke. Are these your buckles? - I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to them? - There are other buckles, I suppose, of the same pattern, but I can swear that the buckles I lost were exactly of this pattern and size.</p>
               <p>Court to Duncan. Did these leads communicate with Mr. Rooke's chambers? - Yes, they did, I had no other reason for suspecting my son, but his being out of his lodgings at an improper time of night.</p>
               <p>Jackson. After the buckles were taken out of Duncan's pocket, he was brought to the bar, and Sir Sampson asked him, whether he had any other person that was with him or not.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not tell any thing that Duncan said that tends to charge any body but himself; was any thing said by him importing a denial of his being concerned, or a confession that he had been concerned? - He owned that he had been concerned with four or five more, and mentioned their names.</p>
               <p>What was he charged with before the Justice? - With breaking and entering Mr. Rooke's chambers, and stealing the property we have here, and he told his father in the Brown-bear, he had hid some property belonging to Mr. Rooke, and I went and found it; I went to No. 11, Mr. Townsend's chambers, and in the cellar I found three silver spoons, a pair of silk stockings, a pair of thread stockings, and a neckcloth.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These spoons I believe to be mine, they are marked B. R. M. N. the neckcloth is mine, I know it by the mark; the stockings have no mark, but I believe them to be mine, having lost a pair of silk and a pair of thread, and the silk of the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. At what examination was it, that this waterman attended? - It was the second examination.</p>

               <p>They fetched me to Bow-street, and they bound me over to prosecute, we kept a public house eleven weeks in Bell court, Gray's-Inn-lane; I know nothing further, only that a parcel of men came in the night of this robbery, I believe it was, Griffiths and Munday and Duncan were in company with some others.</p>
               <p>How late did they stay at your house? - It might be about eleven.</p>
               <p>Was Arnett there? - I do not know that I ever saw him, they had three pots of beer, and two papers of tobacco, and behaved very decent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Griffiths. Were we in company? - You were all in company together, there might be eight or nine for what I know.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Duncan lived clerk to my father about six months, he came on or about the 29th of October, and left him about April, 1785.</p>
               <p>Court. What is your father? - An attorney, No. 3, Staples-Inn, during that time we could not impeach his character in the least, the only reason that I understood, my father parted with him for was, he neglected coming early one morning, he did not come till ten o'clock, and was to have come at eight, during that time he was with us he received money, and paid money, we never missed a pin's point; my father is at Nottingham, or else he would have come himself.</p>

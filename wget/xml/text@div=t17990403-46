               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober? - A. Not quite.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether it was between one and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030030"></xptr>two, or between two and three? - A. I cannot say, I was left in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking so much that you cannot safely say what the time was? - A. Yes, within three quarters after twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. How much liquor had you been drinking that day? - A. I cannot justly say; I had been drinking porter and gin.</p>
               <p>Q. A pretty good quantity of both, perhaps? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you sup that night? - A. I do not know that I supped any where; I very seldom sup any.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been drinking? - A. The last time that I drank was at the Running-horse, in Davies-street, and that was pretty near twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How many public-houses had you been in that evening? - A. I cannot pretend to say, for I frequently go into public-houses to hear of a place; I go into more than I drink in.</p>
               <p>Q. But how many did you drink in that evening? - A. I do not recollect any other public-house but that I had had a glass of gin at.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean to say you are a drunkard, but not being used to liquor you had had rather more than you could bear that evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell us how many public-houses you had been in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor how many pots of beer you drank? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor how many quarterns of gin? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have gone with them if you had not been in liquor? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor, if you had not been very much in liquor you would not have gone with them, I suppose? - A. I was not so very much in liquor but I was sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. How many women did you speak to as you were going from public-house to public-house? - A. I do not recollect talking to any but these two; the last public-house that I was at was the Running-horse, in Davies-street; and the woman gave it me out at the window, because the house was shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you wake in the morning? - A. Between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And where was your companion? - A. Gone; I looked at my breeches, and missed my notes and my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you had the notes when you went into the house? - A. I know it by giving the woman two shillings, out of the canvas bag that the notes were in, to sleep with her.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the women? - A. Yes, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw them before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your property again? - A. No; but they gave information to one of the runners where the watch and one five pound note was; that a person that goes by the name of Big Suke had them.</p>
               <p>- LOVIDGE sworn. - I belong to Marlborough-street; I apprehended the prisoners between Orchard-street and Duke-street; when we met the prisoners, I asked the prosecutor if he thought they were the two women; and he was not perfect which was the woman that laid with him; he stopped Smith, and asked her if she did not know any thing of him; she said, no; while he was talking to her, the other prisoner went on twenty or thirty yards, and I went after her, and overtook her; then I took them to Marlborough-street, and found two new bonnets, two new petticoats, a shift, and two pair of stockings upon them; he said to me, himself, that he was so much in liquor that he hardly knew which was the woman; he said, if he saw her again he thought he should know her; she passed him and he did not stop her, he only stopped Mrs. Smith; I found eight shillings and two-pence three farthings upon Smith, and three shillings upon Hands.</p>

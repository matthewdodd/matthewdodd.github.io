               <p>Q. How long had she been in your house? - About two months before this happened. I stayed out rather latish one night about ten o'clock, and my wife was along with me, and she took it off the bed, when I went home my little child cried, and said Kit had taken the blanket away from the bed, and gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left her in the house? - My wife did, I had been out all day.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you return? - Ten o'clock at night, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge whether any blanket was missing on the bed? - Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you more than one blanket on it? - No, only one.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner? - I sent out after her directly, and I heard by the watchman that she was gone down the road with the bundle under her arm; I set out after her between ten and eleven, I did not overtake her at all, I heard at Islington that they had taken her on suspicion, and had got her into the cage, and there I found her, the constable of the night had got the blanket, I saw it there at the watch-house.</p>

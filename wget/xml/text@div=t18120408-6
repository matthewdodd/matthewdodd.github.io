On Tuesday morning the 31st of March, about a quarter before three, I was going home to No. 8, Little Russell-street, Bloomsbury, I had been out on Easter Monday with my brother and a friend, I had stopped later than I expected.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when any thing happened to you - A. I was in <placeName id="t18120408-6-crimeloc29">Bow-street, Bloomsbury</placeName>

I was walking in Bow-street, I saw no person, and all at once I was knocked down by a blow on my eye; I saw no person at the time the blow was given.</p>
               <p>Q. All at once you received a violent blow you say - A. Yes, upon my right eye, that knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. You suppose that was given you by some person behind - A. Yes, because I did not see any person, I could not say whether it was done with the fist or not. When I was down upon the ground, it was raining, and I had my umbrella up, it rolled out of my hand, and my hat rolled off; and when my hat was off, and my umbrella out of my hand, I was pressed down by a man, he pressed me down by his left hand and was trying to take my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your watch - A. In my fob when I felt my watch going, I struggled for the space of two minutes, as near as I could guess, then I exerted myself as much as I possibly could to take care of myself and my watch, then while I was trying to protect myself after a little struggling he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. He got up and ran away - A. Yes, and on his running away I got up and ran after him, calling out stop thief, as much as I possibly could; I never lost sight of him, when I got up until he was taken by the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he ran before he was taken by the watchman - A. About a furlong he went down a dark street, and turned on the right hand into Thornaugh-street, there he was taken</p>
               <p>Q. In the dark street I suppose you lost sight of him - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Now who was this man that made this assault upon you - A. That was the man.</p>
               <p>(Pointing to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080008"></xptr> prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a light was it - A. It was dusk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark - A. About dusk.</p>
               <p>Q. At two o'clock in the morning - A. Yes; the lamps gave a light, they were burning.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he did not get your watch from you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were able to protect that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be after the time that you beat him off that he was taken - A. It might be two minutes as near as I could guess; I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have known him again if he had not been then taken - A. Yes, positively I should. When I got up I never lost sight of him until he was taken.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty in Thornaugh-street, it was about a quarter before three, I heard the cry of stop thief, when I heard that I put the light under my coat; I ran up Thornaugh-street the prisoner was coming from Duke-street, Bloomsbury, on the foot pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that communicate with Duke-street, Bloomsbury - A. No, it is very near it. He was running very fast, and the prosecutor was very close after him. He did not see me until I was close to him I told him to stop; he fell down, and I fell down on the top of him he got away from me, he ran and I ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Eden all this time - A. He was after us all the time; I came behind him, and struck him with the stick; he fell again, and I took fast hold of him; Eaden when he came up he was bleeding from his nose; I sprang my rattle for assistance, and then when he was going down to the watchhouse he wanted to get away.</p>
               <p>Q. to Eaden. I understood you to say that you never lost your watch - A. No, it was not taken from my fob.</p>

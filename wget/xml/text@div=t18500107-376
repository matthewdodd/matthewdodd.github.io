                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Borer, a grocer, of the Black-friars-road. The prisoner was in his employ; it was part of his duty to receive money over the counter, which he should deposit in the till—I watched him receive 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for goods; he gave a halfpenny change, took up the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and kept it in his hand—he ought to have put it into the till—he commenced serving another customer—I went up, and said, "What is that you have in your hand?"—he answered, "Nothing"—I said, "You have something in your hand, what is it?"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "You have received money from a customer, which you have not put into the till"—he said, "Here it is," and thrust it into my hand—I called my master—the pri<lb></lb>soner appeared very much confused, and begged Mr. Borer to look over it, as it was the first thing he had attempted of the kind, and he did not know what possessed him then—I went for a policeman, who searched the prisoner's box, and I saw this parcel of tea found—he had been sifting tea that morn<lb></lb>ing; this tea corresponds with it; the paper and string are the same that I use.</p>

On the 11th of July, going from my own Cellar, I met the Prisoner within 3 Yards of the Door: I look'd full in his Face by the Light of the Lamps: he pass'd me; but return'd and knock'd me down: as I was getting up, I found his Hand in my right Side Pocket: the Mob gather'd about me, and the Watch was called, but before they came, he knock'd me down again, and ran away: the Watchmen ran after him; I could not run so fast as they, but I heard him say, for I was within 30 Yards of him, the first Man that comes after me, I'll mow him down like Grass. I can swear to the Man, and that he knock'd me down 3 Yards from my own Cellar-Door.</p>

            , Watchman. Between 10 and a 11 at Night, I was going (according to Custom) for my Half-penny worth of Tobacco, I saw the Prisoner knock Chinnick down; Watch was call'd, and away he ran: they ran after him to the End of Russel-street, and would go no farther; I heard him say, the first Man that came after him, he would mow down like Grass.</p>
               <p>Q. This was done very quick: the Watch, and Company came about you, yet your Money was snap'd out of your Pocket, and you was knock'd down again you say; would it not have been natural for a Man to have said he was robb'd then?</p>
               <p>Chinnick. I don't swear the Man had my Money: I lost so much Money, and I felt his Hand in my Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the Prisoner taken?</p>
               <p>Chinnick. About 7 Weeks after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he was before Justice Midford for a Warrant, he swore only to an Assault: I don't deny I had a squabble with him.</p>
               <p>Chinnick. I swore I was knock'd down, and that I lost 2 s. and a Half-penny.</p>
               <p>A Woman. I was going by when the Quarrel happen'd: I saw Chinnick strike the Prisoner, and throw him down; he got up again and they fell to Blows; after that the Prisoner went away, there was no Watch call'd at all, as I heard.</p>
               <p>Several Persons giving the Prisoner a good Character, the Jury <rs id="t17360908-14-verdict75" type="verdictDescription">

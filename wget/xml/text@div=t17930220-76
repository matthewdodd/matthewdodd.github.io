A customer that was in the shop called me, and told me, the prisoner had taken some shawls; I went up to her again, and asked her if any thing more was wanting? she bought a yard of muslin, she paid for it, and went out, and I told Mr. Gooch of it; as soon as she was gone I immediately went after her and brought her back; she came and she leaned over the counter, and pulled the shawl out from under her muff; the other shawl was in a bit of paper. I don't know what she did with it, I put that and the yard of muslin together.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker in Greek-street, Soho. On Monday evening, the 12th of December, the prisoner came into my shop, he offered two pair of stockings to pledge, he was some time fumbling in the box, he came in at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110005"></xptr>the private door; I heard him fumbling in the box, I discovered he had a bag. He said, he wanted to pledge some stockings; then I fastened him in the box; he offered me two pair to pledge; he had a bag. I questioned him how he came by them; I told him I thought he had robbed some manufactory or warehouse; he said he had not, they were his son's stockings. I said, let me see what you have got in your bag, I opened the bag; I pulled out one parcel, and found stockings. I told him I should send for a constable; he said, he hoped I would not hurt him; I told him I would not. I told him, he had better tell the truth; he told me if I would let him go, I should have the two pair of stockings, he would say no more about it. I kept him in custody until the officer came; I told him he condemned himself; the two pair of stockings he offered me I gave to the constable.</p>

            . I am a Marlborough-street officer. The prisoner was brought to our office, I searched him; I found three pair of stockings, and one pair of gloves; I afterwards searched his lodgings, and then I brought him back to his master, and then I searched his person again, I found a pocket-book on him, containing two five-pound notes and four one-pound notes. On the next day, I went again to his lodgings, and made a fuller search; I found thirteen pair of drawers, three waistcoats, eight pair of stockings, and an odd stocking, three night-caps, and eight pair of gloves.</p>

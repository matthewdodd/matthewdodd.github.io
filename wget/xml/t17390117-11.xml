            , Surgeon. On the 11th of November, Mr. Walgrave sent the Child to me by the Prisoner. I found a Bubo on one Side of the Groin, and an Inflamation on the other, &amp;c. &amp;c. She was very much ulcerated and lacerated, &amp;c. &amp;c. I asked the Prisoner how long the Infant had complained? He said, - a great while, he could not tell how long. I knew her Ailment, so I sent for her Father, and assured him, his Child had the Foul Distemper. I had Doctor Bartlet's Opinion too, and he concurr'd with me. This Witness confirmed Mr. Walgrave's Testimony with relation to the Confession of the Prisoner, and said further, that there were several large Ulcers on the and that the Child was now under the Care of Mr. Dansie in the Hospital.</p>

I am a money-changer, of 58, Old Broad Street—on 27th July, 1876, Henry Eldon, the managing clerk to Mr. Chapman, a solicitor, brought me this card of Mr. Chapman's (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and a piece of paper, on which was written "Chicago Bonds"—he after<lb></lb>wards called and introduced the prisoner, and two bonds were produced (<hi rend="italic">Numbered</hi> 2275 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 2493)—I gave the prisoner a crossed cheque for 326<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for one of the bonds—he gave his name F. A. Randolph—he left this sold note with me, "Sold by F. A. Randolph, of 19, Claydon's Terrace, Clapham"—I sold the bond to W. H. Bishop, who gave me a cheque for the amount, and some days afterwards the bond was returned to me marked "Counterfeit"—I have had to pay Mr. Bishop the money and the expenses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 1, Gresham Buildings, Basing<lb></lb>hall Street—this card of mine is an old one—I became acquainted with the prisoner a short time anterior to March, 1876—I knew him by the name of F. A. Randolph, of 19, Clayland Road, Clapham—I became ac<lb></lb>quainted with him by his calling on me and saying that a client named Field had recommended him to me—he did not give Mr. Field's Christian name or address, and I never knew what Mr. Field it was; it was a hurried interview, and it was never discussed afterwards—he said that his name was Randolph, and I understood him to say from America—I issued a writ for him in the Common Pleas, and later on he said that he had some valuable securities which he wanted to realise, or had got to realise—that was about 6th or 7th July, when I had asked him for some<lb></lb>thing on account of the action pending—I sent my clerk to introduce him to a stockbroker, but I did not know to whom he was going—I never saw the securities, nor did he say what they were—on the same evening he brought me this cheque for 326<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was post-dated, and asked me to cash it for him—I agreed, and paid it in to my private account at Woolwich, where I have a local office; and on the morning of the 28th I sent Mr. Smith, my manager, to get a draft on Glyn's for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he brought me in notes, and I gave them to the prisoner, who, I believe, was waiting—I kept back 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as there was about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to me for costs—I feel sure that I took a receipt, but I cannot find it—I saw the prisoner a day or two afterwards, when he said "How is my action going on?"—I cannot fix the date—I set the action down for trial, but had to drop it, as he never came back—he had not told me that he did not intend to come again—I do not know when he left Clapham—I did not receive a farthing for the introduction to Mr. Chick—I did not know that my clerk had introduced him to Mr. Rossett, or I should not have allowed it—I am not acting as his solicitor now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. When he first came to me he had purchased some furniture and paid the major part of the money, and the person who had lent it to him went one day and took a portion of it away—as far as my information goes it was a perfectly legal claim—the only name known to me was Randolph—at this time in July Eldon was my clerk; he had not then been convicted, nor did I look upon him as a person who would be likely to commit himself—he was my head clerk—he did not say to me in the interval between introducing the prisoner to Mr. Chick and turning the cheque into cash "Mr. Randolph says they cannot <hi rend="italic">squeak</hi> for 10 or 15 days;" there was never a whisper of it—I never heard it suggested that the prisoner had used that expression till Eldon was in the witness-box—I subsequently discovered that the prisoner is most highly connected, that he is the son of a Canon of St. Paul's and the Vicar of Ruislip, but had no notion of that when he was my client—I never saw Webster, who took the bonds to Mr. Kingwell.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">In custody</hi>). I am a prisoner in the House of Detention undergoing a sentence of six months for stealing—in July, 1876, I was Mr. Chapman's clerk, and had been so since February—I knew the prisoner, but only as Randolph; I thought he was an independent gentle<lb></lb>man—I was spoken to about realising some bonds, and made inquiries of Mr. Chick, and afterwards went with the prisoner to Mr. Chick—that was, to the best of my belief, on 26th July—I introduced the prisoner to Mr. Chick and gave him Mr. Chapman's card—I had never seen Mr. Chick before—the prisoner said "I want you to go to a place, you will see the name of Chick on the blind"—I told Mr. Chick that I was Mr. Chapman's clerk, and was present when the prisoner gave him two bonds and received a cheque—it was just 4 o'clock, and Mr. Chick said that the cheque would be of no service then, but the prisoner said that he could make use of it, and Mr. Chick gave it to him; it was dated the 27th—on the same day, 26th, we were at a public-house, and I said "Is there any<lb></lb>thing funny about the bond?"—he said "No, why?" and he said "They cannot squeak for 13 days"—he said, as to the action, that he should have to go—I said "What, show the white feather"—he said "Well, I shall be away, and the principal witness is a lady, and it won't be con<lb></lb>venient to have her called," and that he had given Mr. Chapman 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was very exorbitant—I saw him again on the 27th and following day—Mr. Chick gave me a half-sovereign, and the prisoner gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note about the 28th or 29th—I proposed to give him change for the note, but he said "Oh, no," and I took the whole note—two or three days alter I introduced him to Mr. Chick I saw him at Mr. Chapman's office—he gave no address, and I did not know where he went to—the action was dropped—I next saw him at Guildhall in custody.</p>

               <p>30th May, 1876, the prisoner brought me this card, "J.

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Allen and Wiley, stock-brokers, of 2, Copthall Court—in February, 1875, I was carrying on business on Cornhill—on that day Mr. Payne, a member of the Stock Exchange, introduced the prisoner to me outside the door of the Stock Exchange as Mr. Pack, who was distantly connected with him—the prisoner then asked me to sell some American bonds for him and showed me five bonds of the Chicago and North-Western Railway, Nos. 2389. 2426, 2586, 2727, and 2749, and told me he wished to sell them—I made some inquiries about them on the Stock Exchange of dealers in American securities and found they were not negotiable there; not on the official list—I told the prisoner that I should have to send the bonds to America, and would do so if he wished it—he said that he wanted some money immediately, and gave me the name and address of a gentle<lb></lb>man who he said was his father—I wrote this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from what he told me—from his introduction I believed him to be a thoroughly respect<lb></lb>able person, with whom I was justified in doing business, and went with him to Mr. Cross's office in Cornhill to inquire the value of the securi<lb></lb>ties—he said that he wanted 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. immediately, and instead of selling them I agreed to lend him 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them—he said that his father had Turkish bonds to sell, and so engaged me in conversation—I then wrote these two cheques produced.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. If the securities had been London and North-Western stock I should still have required an introduction—we have books and circulars to tell us the interest paid on the bonds, and I could see that there were such things as these 1,000 dollar Chicago bonds, and I believe I should see who was the secretary and the president, and as to the redemp<lb></lb>tion in 1885 in gold—dealing with thousands of bonds with coupons attached I never test their genuineness in any way—it is not true that some American companies have repudiated bonds of their former com<lb></lb>pany and marked them as not genuine, but if they have not the money they do not pay.</p>

               <p>Lane—in February, 1875, a person I had never seen before, but who gave the name of Webster, came and said that he had a friend who wanted to buy a carriage—he called three times alone, and once with a another gentleman—when he called alone he gave me a cheque for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Allen and Wylie, and said that if his friend bought the carriage he should want me to cash the cheque so that he might pay for it—he endorsed it in my presence, and I told him I would pay it into my bank, and get the cash—I paid it into my account at the National Bank, Char<lb></lb>ing Cross, on March 1, with another cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and found next day that it was duly credited to my account—I then drew a cheque for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., cashed it over the counter in five 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and some tens and fives, took them to my premises, and within a minute or two Webster came with his friend, who I had never seen before—I understood him to he the son of the Dean of Windsor—he handed me a card with "Francis Pack" on it, which he wrote on one of my cards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have no recollection of having this card when I gave him the notes—I use this sort of violet ink, and it is the same ink as the endorsement on the cheque—the card was most likely written in my presence, but I do not remem<lb></lb>ber it—the prisoner does not look to me to be the same person—he looked a brighter, sharper man—I only saw him ten minutes—the carriage was not purchased—he said that he was going abroad that afternoon, and would call again when he returned—I had given the notes to Webster in the other man's presence—I never saw him afterwards—about a fortnight afterwards a detective from the Old Jewry came, and I suppose I handed him the card—I do not know who Webster was, but he said that he lived at Windsor—on the second occasion he told me that the gentleman's father was the Dean of Windsor, I understood, and lived there—I had one of the Queen's carriages in my place, and he said "Be particular, this carriage is going to your own people; the address is, 'The Cloisters'"—Pack did not buy the carriage, but he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my trouble in passing the cheque through my bankers, and cashing it—I saw some reports in the papers, and went to Guildhall to see if it was Webster.</p>

I found that it was not—I did business with Webster, the other was a different man altogether—Detective Moss, if he was clean shaved, I should have stopped in the street as Webster—most of the talking was with Webster, until he came for the notes he never had anybody with him—I asked Webster why his friend did not open a bank<lb></lb>ing account—he said that he was travelling a good deal, and it was not convenient—he said "I don't require the money till you have got it from your bankers"—I made my cheque payable to Webster or bearer, that was only to mark the transaction—I handed over the notes exactly as I took them.</p>

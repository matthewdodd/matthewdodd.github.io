                  </hi>. I am a clock and watch manufacturer, and live in Tottenham Court-road. Last Monday evening the prisoner came to me and said, "Mr. Kyezor, I want to sell this," handing me this gold chain and seal and key—I have known him three years—I said, "Where did you get this?"—he said he had brought them from Bombay with him—he said he wanted 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I said, "Have you not a watch?"—he said, "No, I sold that five years ago, and the chain has been in pawn several times, and I have taken it out to-day"—he said they had lent him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I was going to weigh it, and he said it weighed two ounces and a half, which I found it did—I said, "The pawnbroker has given you the full value for it"—he said, "If I pawn it again, will you give me to-morrow 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the ticket?"—I said, "No"—he came to me the next day, and said he would take 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I said I would go to the pawnbroker with him, and if they would now lend him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it I would buy it—he then hesitated, and I said to him, "Now, I am convinced you stole it, and if you don't tell me the truth, I will give you in charge"—he then said, "I will tell you the truth, it belongs to Judge Cracroft"—I said if he did not go and fetch him I would give him in charge.</p>

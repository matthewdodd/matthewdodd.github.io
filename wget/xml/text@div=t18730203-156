                  </hi>. I am a dealer in woollen cloth, in Bond Court, Walbrook—I buy lots of cloth to sell again—this 1170 yards of cloth was bought by me through the prisoner of a Mr. Brayshaw, a manufacturer of Leeds—it is what is called waterproof cloth, which is more in demand at one season of the year—I bought it at the end of the season at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard nett—the prisoner was not paid anything by me on that occasion—what Mr. Brayshaw gave him I don't know—Mr. Brayshaw came himself, and I paid him the money at the time—time (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the invoice settled by him—the cloth was in thirty pieces when I bought it on 15th November—about the 25th November the prisoner called and said if I wanted to sell it he knew a person who wanted it for shipping, who would give a good price for it—I said I would give him 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard commission, and that would be about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the lot; that was in the presence of Mr. Walters, my clerk—the prisoner took a pattern of the cloth to show—he called each day after<lb></lb>wards, and on the 27th he came and said that a man named Davis had agreed to give him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with 25 per cent, off—that would bring it to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. nett—he did not give me Davis's address then—I wrote to him on the 28th to tell him to let me have an answer—on the 29th he came and said that Davis had agreed to take it at that price, and he then wrote on this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) the name "J. Davis"—I then proceeded to make out an invoice—I did not put any name at the head of the invoice—I sent my clerk to Perry's to make inquiries as to the reputation of Davis; they were quite satisfactory—the quantity sold to Davis was 1170 yards, contained in twenty-four pieces out of the thirty—the cloth was at my packers', Turner &amp; Co., in Barge Yard, Bucklersbury—Mr. Boutland carries on the business under that name—the prisoner told me they were to go to Pewtress, another packer's, in Bush Lane, for Davis—he said that Davis would have</p>

               <p>them sent there, and would call over and pay for them at Pewtress's, when he had looked over them—I sent the pieces on to Pewtress's, and as I did not know anything about Davis I followed the cart on, and the prisoner came after me—I said to him "I am sending these over to Pewtress's, and I have got the note here; they are to be held to ray order at Pewtress's, not to be given up until they are paid for"—he immediately said "I have been and seen Davis, and he won't take them; he says they are too good for him"—the cloth did not go on to Pewtress's, it went nearly there; but when the prisoner said that, I told them to take the cloth back to Boutland, and it was taken back—I left the invoice I had made out, which had no name on it, on my desk—I only put the date and twenty-four pieces of cloth, 1174 yards—the prisoner came back with me to the office after going with the cart—I left the invoice on the desk when I went out, and when the prisoner went away it was gone—I did not give it to the prisoner—I did not make out an invoice to him in his own name—I never thought of such a thing—he has no place of business—this invoice was produced to me at the Police Court—it is the invoice that was taken away without my authority from my counting-house—it never had my name upon it—I am quite positive about that—on 3rd December the prisoner called again and brought me this card of Mr. Hillyer, and said he had sold the cloth to Hillyer at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. nett—I said I would inquire at Perry's about Hillyer, if he was trustworthy, and if I found it all right I would send them down the day after—the prisoner came again on the morning of the 3rd—Graves, Mr. Boutland's manager, was there—I told Graves in the prisoner's presence that I had sold these goods to Hillyer, and he must take them down to Hillyer's, and I gave him a note with the partioulars on it, with the amouut he had to receive, and strict orders, three or four times over, not to leave the goods without the money—I also told him if Hillyer wanted a yard a piece allowed, he was to allow it as the custom of the trade—I put that in writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "R. Hillyer, 29 and 31, Hare Street, Bethnal Green, received for me 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 d, at Messrs. Turner &amp; Co.'s, packers, entered twenty-four pieces of cloth, 1170 yards"—the prisoner stood by while the pieces were put into the cart from Boutland's—I was there, and Graves and Mr. Boutland both helped to put the pieces into the cart, and the prisoner went away with Graves to deliver them at Hillyer's, and I never saw him again until he was in custody—I found that a person named Rosenberg had been given into custody by Bennett, Mr. Boutland's man—I don't remember the date, it was on the Saturday that I went to Worship Street, in the same week—I there saw sixteen out of the twenty-four pieces of cloth—I knew nothing of Rosenberg—I never heard anything of him—I believe these two papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be in the prisoner's writing, but I can't say because I don't know his writing—I saw Him write a note, just the name, but I can't say that I know his writing; I think this is his writing, but I could not swear it—I never authorised him to make out an invoice for the cloth in his own name, or to give a receipt in his own name—he had nothing to do with either selling the goods or receiving the money—the price I have named would allow 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was to give him 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard off that.</p>

               <p>could purchase, and he thought might make a considerable profit out of the transaction by finding the cash—he never mentioned anything of the kind—he came several times in November, but it was on the 15th that I agreed to buy these goods—I did buy them, and they were deposited in my warehouse—I have part of Boutland's warehouse in Barge Yard—I first heard that he had got a purchaser for the goods when he came to tell me that Davis had bought them—he did not mention the name at first, he said a party would buy; that was on the 27th November—that was the first time anything was mentioned about his selling the goods—he first mentioned the name on the 29th, when the goods were said to be sold—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter I wrote to him, dated the 28th—I said at the Police Court that I had never written such a letter; I had forgotten it—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Merchant Traders' Discount Office, November, 28th.—Mr. Richardson.—Sir,—I will not take less than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard for the goods; and, as they are under offer, I must know at once.")—2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is mentioned there, but 25 per cent. off would make it 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that was the price he said, and he was to have 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard commission on the nett amount—the price was the same, both to Davis and Hillyer—when he came on the 29th he had nobody with him; he never had any one with him—my clerk, Mr. Walters, was with me—he was in several times when the prisoner came—I discount a good many bills for traders in the City—I don't keep a regular warehouse—I buy a lot of cloths at the end of the season, and keep them over till the next season—I have a warehouse and an office—I had not many goods at this particular time, because it was just at the end of the season, when I should buy various lots—persons come to offer goods for sale who you have never known before; that is a common things in the City—I looked to Brayshaw—I knew Brayshaw, of Leeds and Aldermanbury—I sent to Perry's to inquire both about Davis and Hillyer—I found they were respectable persons; I would trust either of them—I should never send goods sold for cash unless I knew they were likely to be paid for; I would never send them, except to a respectable man, because very often tricks may be played—if you deliver goods you don't always get your money—this is the invoice that I began to make out, and which I left on my desk for Davis, and which disappeared—that was on 29th November—that was the day after I wrote the letter stating that I had an offer from another person—that was a man in the Fulham Road, named Jones, and I sold him some of them afterwards—I never heard of Bernard or Searle—no one came with the prisoner to my office on the 29th, or on any occasion, except Mr. Brayshaw, when the goods were bought on the 15th—no person came with the prisoner on the 29th—there was a person who he said had come to look at the goods on 2nd December, a shopman of Hillyer's; he did not bring that person into me—I told him to take him across, and show him the goods at Turner's place; that is all I know about any other person—I never saw any other person with him—that was not on the 29th November, but on the 2nd December—it was at the prisoner's suggestion that the goods were taken to Pewtress's; he ordered them to be taken to Pewtress's for Davis, and Davis was to pay for them there.</p>

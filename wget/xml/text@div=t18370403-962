                  </hi>. I keep the White House public-house, Brooks Mews, Davis-street, St. George, Hanover-square. I took possession of the house on the 27th of January—I found the prisoner employed there as charwoman, and I continued her in my employ—on Saturday the 25th of March, I put 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper into a desk—I afterwards went into the tap-room, and said to the prisoner, "Jane, you have been robbing my desk"—she said she had not—I said, "I will believe the boy before I believe you; he says you have, and if you have done it, put the money out of your pocket, go up and get your bonnet, and leave the house"—she still denied it—I sent for a policeman, who took her—I missed fourteen pence from the desk—I asked her if she had got any money, and she said she had not a farthing in the world.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-boy at the house. On the 25th of March I saw the prisoner go into the bar, put her hand into the writing desk, take some halfpence out, and put her hand into her pocket—the desk was not locked, it was in the bar—I saw the halfpence in her hand—I did not speak to her then—she had some knives in her hand at the time, which she put into the knife-box—master was sitting in the bar-parlour with some gentlemen—she looked into the parlour at the time, and then came into the tap-room, where I was cleaning the window—I said, "Jane, you know what you hare been about"—she said, "What have I been about?"—I said, "You know I saw you put your hand into the desk, and take some halfpence out"—she said, "Your are a d—d liar"—I said, "I saw it, and took notice of it"—she said, "You are a d—d fool"—she then went out of the tap-room, and I went and called muter.</p>

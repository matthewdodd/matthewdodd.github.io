On the 7th of August I left my chambers, to go into the country; and the day before I deposited in a cupboard under the window, a gold watch, with a gold seal fastened to it by a ring. I had deposited other property in a cupboard under the book-case some time before, but might not have seen it for three weeks before I left town - both cupboards were locked when I left town, and the key of that under the book-case was put in where the gold watch was. I took the key of that cupboard with me; I returned late on the evening of the 11th of August, and on the 13th or 14th, I missed the gold watch, seals, and key, and having heard of the prisoner's apprehension, I examined the other cupboard on the 16th, and missed several mourning rings and a gold musical seal. I do not recollect whether one of the rings had the name of Judd on it, as they came into my possession as executor; the watch was worth 7 l. I have known Cockerill several years, he is related to my clerk, and had leave to come to my chambers whenever he pleased. I have a private door which shuts my chambers in from any other, there is one common stair case.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Ship-yard, Temple-bar. Cockerill brought a desk and box to my house, and desired me to take care of them. This was about a fortnight before I carried them over Blackfriars-bridge. He came to them several times. Thomas generally came with him. Thomas once came alone, and unlocked the desk, and locked it again, but what he did with it I cannot say. The prisoner Moore has often come to my house with Cockerill. I believe she was there on the Sunday before I carried the things. I know she was there on the Friday or Saturday before. Moore brought me a note from Cockerill, which I have destroyed, and, in consequence of that note, I took the box and desk over Blackfriars-bridge. Moore, and another young woman, went with me. I delivered them to Cockerill at the foot of the bridge, and received 1 s. for my trouble. This was on a Tuesday, I believe.</p>

               <p>MR. BOOTH. The first seal produced has my arms on it; the other is mine, and was appended to the watch, which is worth 7 l., and the appendages, 4 l. I believe the musical seal to be mine, and that the rings were in my possession.</p>

            . I am patrol of Christ Church parish. I saw Cockerill, Thomas, Moore, and another woman, at a liquor-shop over Blackfriars-bridge; they attracted my attention. I left the house, and saw them again in a quarter of an hour; it was then half-past four o'clock. Thomas was not with them then. They passed down by the side of the church, and by the watch-house. I took them; searched a box which Cockerill had on his back, and found four keys in it, one of which opens the writing-desk; they had no desk then. They appeared to be looking for somebody. I saw Thomas again at half-past ten o'clock at night, fifty or sixty yards from the watch-house, where the others were in custody, and took him. He was standing in the street with another man, whom I also took.</p>

            . I am a butcher. On Tuesday, the 12th of August, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, Thomas came to my shop, with another person. I was fetched to my shop; found them there, and took him into custody. He did not ask for anything in my presence; but I found a desk in the shop, which I produce. I had seen the whole party at the liquor-shop before; they had nothing then.</p>

               <p>COCKERILL'S Defence. All I have to say is, that the young woman is innocent.</p>
               <p>MOORE put in a written defence, stating that Cockerill gave her the property to pawn in her own name, and said it belonged to him.</p>

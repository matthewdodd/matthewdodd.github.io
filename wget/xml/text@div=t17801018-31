Hitchons and Wood, in Chandos-street; I endorsed those that were endorsible; I gave a frank directed to Messrs. Hitchons and Wood, London, to my clerk, and desired him to enclose the bills; there were sixteen of them, the amount of the whole was 181 l. 8 s.</p>
               <p>Look at that bill (the draft for 30 l.) and inform the Court and Jury whether that is one of the bills you gave to your clerk to be so forwarded? - It is; it is drawn by a Mr. Toper, payable to me.</p>

               <p>Look over these sixteen bills, and see how many you can identify? - (Inspects them) Here are eleven I am certain to; the other four I believe to be the bills, but I cannot swear to them; they answer the descriptions in our bill-book.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you found those bills had not arrived at your correspondent's in London? - It might be three weeks, or longer, before I received the letter.</p>
               <p>You received no intelligence of it till three weeks or more; was not that an uncommon circumstance that you received no advice of them? - At that time I owed them a considerable sum of money, and I desired my clerk, when he sent those bills, to wr ite a letter to them, and enclose it under cover, desiring them not to give me advice of those bills till they received something further; and that was the reason why I did not expect advice by the regular course of the post.</p>

               <p>I understand there are two cellars in the house? - Yes, there are.</p>

               <p>Do you happen to know whether the other cellar you did not occupy was kept locked or not? - There was a lock on it, I cannot tell whether it was locked , I never had the curiosity to try; sometimes I have seen it open.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I searched the prisoner's lodgings, at No. 1, Jerusalem-court; I found a key in a coat pocket which Mrs. Bishop said belonged to Mr. Bishop. She said it was the key of the cellar. She struck a light and went down with us into the cellar. The door had a padlock on it. I unlocked it with that key; she went into the cellar with a candle in her hand. Carpmeal took the candle from her; he found a box, which he broke open. He found a packet, containing a seal and two impressions in it , and a letter.</p>
               <p>Among other things did you find any bills of Exchange? - Several.</p>
               <p>Did you mark them at the time you found them? - I kept them in my custody till I arrived at the office , in Bow-street. Mr. Bond sealed them up directly before Justice Addington. They were sealed with my seal, and Mr. Hull's, and Mr. Addington's, I believe.</p>
               <p>Did you see it afterwards opened? - Yes, a few days afterwards.</p>
               <p>When you saw it opened did you find that your seal had not been broken before? - I did. I then marked them.</p>
               <p>Are those the same you thus found? - Yes, they are; I marked them with my name; they are all the same.</p>
               <p>Are these the bills you found in the box? - They were not found in the box, they were found between two boards which hung up with a rope at each end; it was a large board at the bottom and a small one at the top, and between those two boards these notes were found rolled up in a piece of blue paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hull was above stairs waiting for you in the parlour? - He was. I went up and shewed them to him.</p>
               <p>(The bill read, which together with the endorsement , was exactly as set forth in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Hull. When they came up to you in the parlour they brought these bills? - They did. I looked them over and delivered them again to the constable; he produced them at Bow-street that night. Mr. Addington did not care to let me nor Mr. Todd have the bills; he said he thought it proper they should be sealed up, and delivered to some banker. There was no banker's open then, therefore it was that they were sealed with M'Manus's , Mr. Todd's, and Mr. Addington's seals; I put Mr. Todd's seal to it. The next morning they were shewn to Mr. Addington; he saw they had not been opened. The next morning Mr. Wright said he saw no objection to my having the bills; they were delivered to me and I marked them immediately (inspects them). These are the sixteen bills I marked.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What induced you to make enquiry concerning this cellar? - Finding the key in the coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Who told you that key was the key of the cellar? - Mrs. Bishop.</p>
               <p>She pointed out the cellar to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And lighted a candle to light you down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you had found these bills was there no intermediate time, in which you quitted the possession of the bills before they were sealed up? - I never quitted the possession of them. Mr. Hull looked them over in the parlour before my face.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the robbery yourself. - A. I took it from him. When I came in I found the prisoner looking over some waistcoats, they told me that he had been in the shop about three quarters of an hour, they could not sell him any thing, nor would he go away, and they thought he had got something under his great coat, they were afraid to attack him. I then went from my own side of the counter to the side he was on, I told him I wanted to look under his great coat, he refused letting me, but with some trouble I got his coat of one side; I found a waistcoat and a pair of new shoes under his great coat, the waistcoat belonged to me, the shoes did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you mean that he refused you. - A. I went to pull his coat of one side, he said to me, what you want; he spoke English to me tolerably well then.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the waistcoat that you have got in your hand. - A. Yes, it is mine, it has my writing on the lining.</p>
               <p>Q. Is any of your people here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they might have sold it for what you know. - A. It did not appear so.</p>

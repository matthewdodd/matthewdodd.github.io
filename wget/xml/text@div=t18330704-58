               <p>SARAH HICKIN. I met the prisoner in December - I don't remember the day, but it was just by Hoxton-square; I had been to Mr. Shepherd's and Mr. Tisley's that day - the prisoner took Mr. Shepherd's shirt from me - I did not give it him; he asked me to go down Hackney-road a little way with him, and he took it to Mr. Harris's shop and pawned it, I stood outside - he took the shirt from me by force - I did not call out; I don't know why I went with him and stood at the pawnbroker's door - I did not tell my mother of it, she found it out on the last day of May; the prisoner had asked me if my mother had missed the shirt; I told him no; when she did find it out, I told her a woman took it from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the magistrate "He asked me if I had any shirts or cravats in the bundle, and I said yes; he said, you can give me one out, your mother will not miss it - I said, she will; and he said, she will not; and I gave him a shirt." Witness. A. No Sir; I did not - they must have mistaken the word.</p>
               <p>HANNAH HICKIN. When I missed the shirts, she told me they were lost, but not in what manner - I thought she had dropt them out of the bundle.</p>

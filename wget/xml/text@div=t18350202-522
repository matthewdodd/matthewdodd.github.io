                  </hi>. I live at the corner of Red Lion-street, Spitalfields, and am a gold-beater. The prisoner was my journeyman—he worked in my house on Thursday, the 2nd of October—I delivered him 2 ozs. 4 dwts. and 3 grs. of gold to manufacture into leaf, which would have taken him about four days, and he worked on it until the Saturday—I then gave him some money on account—I missed him from the shop during the week after—on the Saturday, I went into the shop to see about his work—I found it in an unfinished state, and part of it was gone—what I missed was worth 52<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I heard no more of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprenticed to the prosecutor. The prisoner was not at work on the Monday or Tuesday in that week—on the Wednesday he came and worked for about half-an-hour—he then took the gold out of the box, wrapped it in some paper, and put it into his pocket—I told him he had better not take it out of the shop for fear of losing it—he made no an<lb></lb>swer, but went out—I did not see him again till the 16th of January.</p>

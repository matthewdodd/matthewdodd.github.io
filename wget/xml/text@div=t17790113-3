I saw the prisoner in St. Sepulchre's watch-house, about a quarter after six, sitting on a stool by the fire, and the lamb was in the watch-house.

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Hall. I was called up on Tuesday morning at two o'clock to go to Smithfield to my master to take care of his lambs as some had been stolen. I went down to the Bear and Ragged-Staff-yard, and saw two men in the yard I had a suspicion of, and watched them; I lost fight of them for about half an hour, in which time a lamb was missed. I saw them come down the yard again and stand by the pen this lamb was in. I concealed myself behind a cart wheel and watched them. I saw the prisoner go into the pen, lift up the lamb, and put it in a bag which the other man had.</p>
               <p>There were more rams there? - Yes. I saw the prisoner put the sheep in the sack; he was in the pen, and the other man on the outside; upon that I came directly out of the yard and saw them coming after me. I was about thirty yards before them.</p>
               <p>Who carried the sack with the lamb in it? - The prisoner; that very man; I could swear to him among a thousand. The bag was twisted, and he had it across his left shoulder. I walked before them to the end of Long-lane; there I stopped, and they came up to me; then I stopped the prisoner; the other man made off. I took hold of the sack, he struggled and wanted to get away; I gave him a fall and secured him, and took him to the Rose in Smithfield, and sent for Mr. Hall. I found the ram lamb in the bag with a handkerchief put in its mouth as you would put a bit in a horse's mouth, and tied round the horns to keep it from bleating. I found a knife in his pocket.</p>
               <p>(The handkerchief and knife were produced in court.)</p>

I went to draw it, and when I came up again the Prisoner was gone. I look'd in my Cup-board on the Stairs, and mist my Tankard. I enquired of some People at the Door if they saw such a Man, and I was told that he ran down the Street - I had put the Tankard in that Cup-board my self, but a quarter of an Hour before I mist it, and no body had within that time been in the House but the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How do ye know who came in when you were in the Cellar? How long had I been in your House?</p>
               <p>M. Lilly. About half an Hour.</p>
               <p>Richard Lilly. I went out about three, and left Omsby in the House. When I returned there was an Oration about the Tankard being lost, and my Girl said that the People said that the Prisoner went down the Street stradling as if he had got the Pox - I advertised the Tankard, and heard of it from a Pawnbroker - I am a Taylor by Trade, and the Tankard stood by me on the Shop-board till near three o'Clock, and I left it there when I went out - Omsby had been at my House six or seven times before, and I knew no harm of him till this happened.</p>

On the twentieth of June between nine and ten at night, she brought this Tankard to my Shop in Eagle Street in Holbourn to pledge for four Guineas, I asked her who it belonged to. She said to an Ale-house-keeper at The Fountain in Tothill Street Westminster. I told her I would send my Servant thither with the Money. You need not do that, says she, for the Man is at the Door; and so she called in the Prisoner Omsby. I took him aside, and while I was talking with him, she took up the Tankard and carried it out to a Man who run away with it. I cryed stop Thief, and followed him into Little Queen Street where he was taken. This was the Prisoner Branan. I enquired for the Tankard, and heard that he had thrown it against a Barber's Door in the Street as he ran along, and that the Woman of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173507020011"></xptr> Barber's Shop had pick'd it up.

               <p>Omsby. Did not I come in to pawn a pair of Silver Buttons?</p>

            . I have known Omsby about three Years, he brought this Tankard to me that Evening, and told me that he kept The Fountain Alehouse, but wanted to make up some Money for his Brewer. I had not seen him for two Years before, but believing him to be an honest Man, I carried the Tankard to pledge at a House where I was known. The Pawn-broker asking several Questions about it, Omsby said to me, Since he makes such a rent about it, bring me the Tankard again, for I can pawn it any where. So in a hurry, I catch'd up the Tankard, and gave it to a Man at the Door.</p>

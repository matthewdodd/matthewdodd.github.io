               <p>JAMES CALLOW, JUN. I am the son of James Callow - I am nine years of age. On the night of the 30th of January, I was in <placeName id="t18250217-51-crimeloc315">Strutton-ground</placeName>

I told my father he was the boy; but I did not then know his name. I saw him again on the day afterwards; I went home and told my father, but he was at work, and could not go; I told my father again the next day, and he went and took him.</p>
               <p>JAMES CALLOW. I live in Strutton-place, Strutton-ground. My boy lost his hat on the 30th of January; he said he knew the boys well, and next day he told me he saw one of them in Pye-street, but my master was there, and I could not go. Next day he came to me again, and said the boy was in Strutton-ground; I went, saw the prisoner, and took him. I told him if he would give me the hat he might go about his business; he cried, but denied all knowledge about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can bring witnesses to prove I was not out of my mother's house till half-past eight o'clock on Sunday evening.</p>
               <p>SARAH DOWLING. I live at No. 7, Union-court, Orchard-street, Westminster. The prisoner was in my house the whole of that evening, with my husband; he had no shoes on. My husband went out about six o'clock, and staid till half-past eight - the prisoner then wished me good night, and went into his father's room, which is next to mine.</p>

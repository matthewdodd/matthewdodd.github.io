                  </hi>. I am an engine-driver, at 14, Hendon-street, Pimlico—about 12, on the morning of the 2d December, I had a pint of ale in a public-house in St. Giles; I then left—I had had a drop to drink, but I knew what I was doing; I think I saw the prisoner in the public-house; I could not swear to him—when I got up the street a short distance, he came up to me, collared me, threw me on my back, got my watch in one hand, and had me by the throat with the other—he fell on top of me; I held him tight; he could not get away—I saw my watch in his hand, and the guard was broken into two or three pieces—I called "Police" directly, and a constable came—the prisoner was then in the act of putting the watch in my pocket again—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I was on duty this night in the Seven-dials, and heard a cry of "Police"—I went to the spot, and found the 1 prosecutor on his back, and the prisoner on top of him—the prosecutor said, "He has got my watch, "which I saw in his right hand—he had hold of the prosecutor by the throat with his left hand—I seized the prisoner, and pulled him off; we had a struggle; I got some assistance, and took him to the station—I found the watch afterwards in the prosecutor's pocket, put back again—his guard was hanging down.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Giles'. On the 10th of December, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner running very hard, and the prosecutor pursuing her; when he got near her, he called Stop thief! I followed, and against a house, which she passed, I heard something strike - I saw the prosecutor was likely to take her, and turned to that spot, and found this watch on the pavement; the prosecutor secured her in two or three seconds; there was nobody within fifty or sixty yards of the place.</p>
               <p>CHARLES FOX. This is my watch. On the night in question I was with the prisoner - I had been to a house with her, and as we came out, I missed my watch - I was not quite sober - I said to a companion, "I have lost my watch;" the prisoner directly ran away - I had left all safe in the house, and had not undressed - I followed her, saw the patrol in High-street, and called Stop thief! she then threw something away - I heard it fall, and took her about thirty yards further; there was nobody in the room with us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg for mercy.</p>

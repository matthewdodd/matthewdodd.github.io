               <p>Q. Do you remember the two prisoners at the bar coming to your house? - Yes, on Monday, the 30th of April, Biddy Cane, about half an hour after four in the afternoon. She asked for half a quartern of gin, which I served her directly.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the price? - Three halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q.What did she tender you to change? - Sixpence marked with a letter G. on it, a very bad one. I had taken many such, which made me immediately know it. A little girl of a neighbour came in and says, that woman passes bad money, I knew her, and I immediately ordered her into custody. She was going to give me another out of her mouth, but the girl making that reply, she did not, she stopped. The little girl said, she passed it for her goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband in the way? - No, I sent for him; when he came she wanted to give a girl four sixpences, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200174"></xptr>she would not take them, and she dropped them on the ground, and my husband picked them up. I believe she was immediately searched by the constable, she went into my back room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was found? - Four shillings bad, and about three penny worth of halfpence to the best of my knowledge, the four shillings were in a box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the halfpence good or bad? - Very good, as halfpence goes now, such as pass.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see the other prisoner Conway? - At the door; my husband brought her in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Conway come in with her at first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She was brought in immediately after the other woman dropped the sixpence? - Yes, immediately after. I see her with her left hand take a sixpence out of her mouth, and let it fall on the left side of her, that I see.</p>
               <p>Q. Who picked up that sixpence? - Myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it good or bad? - Very bad. I gave it all I had to the constable.</p>

               <p>Q. You keep the King's Head, opposite Cripplegate-church? - Yes. I was sent for from a Smith's shop, that I keep up the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Conway there? - No; at that time I got up to my door she had left my door, and I got up as far as Mr. East's, in Whitecross-street; when I went into the house, I told the people to detain Cane, while I went for the other. Accordingly, I went out and told her, good woman, those is a dispute, and I will be glad if you will come back to settle it, I brought her back with the child in her arms. She was walking up Whitecross-street, from my house; accordingly I brought her back with me, and set her on the first bench, and I said, it was proper to send for an officer and have these women searched. Accordingly there was a neighbour came in, a milk woman that lives over the way, and she says, how do you do Mrs. Conway? and accordingly Biddy Cane put her hand to her mouth and took out some bad silver to give it her, and it dropped on the ground. A constable came in, and I told the costable it was proper to take her back to search her, and I took her, with the constable, into the back room, and found a Christmas box with four bad shillings in it.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you find on her? - About three or four penny worth of halfpence; middling to pass, so as to pay for what she called for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing on Conway? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you deliver the money you found? - To the constable; four sixpences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Oliver. I gave two separate ones.</p>
               <p>Q. There was one that she tendered to you? - That I delivered first to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any mark on it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him another, did you tell him which was which? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury to Oliver. What reason had you to suppose that Conway was concerned in this business? - By a person that lived right opposite, who told me they were both concerned together.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Cane. I keep a house and have lodgers in it, and I had this money given me by one that had lodged with me, and had been to sea; I met him accidently in the street, he owed me twelve shillings, and he paid me six out of the twelve.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Conway. I took the sixpence for spinning of some hemo, not knowing whether it was good or bad. I ran away with the fright. My husband is serving his king and country, and I had no other way of getting my living but by spinning of hemp. I had some witnesses last session, but I have none this.</p>

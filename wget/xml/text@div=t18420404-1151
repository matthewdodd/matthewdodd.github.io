                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Ward. I was staying with my brother George Ellis, at Clay-hill, during my confinement. The prisoner was engaged to attend on me, by my brother—she left on the 27th or 28th of February—I was too ill to look after my things at that time—I have since missed a brooch, five yards of ribbon, some lace, and some</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Wednesday, the 28rd of March, I went to the prisoner's sister's house, in Enfield-lane—I found the prisoner there, and told her she was suspected of having stolen some property belonging to Mrs. Ward, and asked if she had any thing belong<lb></lb>ing to herself at her sister's—she said, "No"—I asked where her box was, she said at her mother's, in Parker-street, Enfield, and there was nothing in it but what belonged to herself—I went there—the mother produced the box, and the prisoner the key—it was searched in the pre<lb></lb>tence of Mr. Ellis's sister, and these articles found in it—the prisoner said it was all she had taken and all she had got—I am not certain which. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The things belong to me.</p>

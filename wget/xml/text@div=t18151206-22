Among the furniture in the room, were blankets, sheets and a rug; he only staid with me a week, and on the last evening, he told me he would pay me in the morning, but in the morning he took up the things and went away.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was coming up Hounsditch, and I met my brother officer, who had the prisoner in custody, and was accompanied by the prosecutrix. We took him to where his wife was, and there was nothing in the room but the property of the prosecutrix, and his wife was just about to lie in. There was neither stove nor fire, and they appeared to be in the greatest misery and distress. He is a jew, and has been deserted by his friends, on account of his marrying a christian.</p>

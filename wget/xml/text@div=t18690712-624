                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bowden, a carpenter, of 49, Charles Street, Drury Lane—on the night of 27th June, about 12 o'clock, I was, with my husband, turning the corner of Charles Street—my husband walked on before me, he went to take a pot of beer up stairs for supper, while I was going to pay the landlady—when he had gone Sullivan came up to me and struck me a violent blow in the face—a man was with her, who I believe to be the prisoner George—after Sullivan struck me Burns struck me—I had a purse in my pocket containing 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., also a gold brooch, a jet chain and cross—I lost them all—I was knocked about so dreadfully I could not prevent them—my husband came up afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was it - A. Two o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he took them - A. I am well aware that he took them, because he and the other person run; I pursued him, and by the assistance of a guardian of the night he was taken to the watchhouse. The shoes were taken from him by the beadle of the watchhouse. I pursued him directly the goods were gone; I saw him run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them taken away - A. Yes; I did not exactly see them taken away, but seeing the man run I came out and pursued him. They snatched the goods, and away they run. I cannot say exactly whether the prisoner stole the shoes or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. At the watchhouse did you see the shoes drop from the prisoner - A. Yes. They were new shoes. I think it was the other man in the smock frock that stole the shoes, but the prisoner was in his company.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel; called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

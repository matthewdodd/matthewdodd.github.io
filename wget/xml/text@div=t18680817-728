                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that the two first Counts, charging the prisoner with stealing this</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">note, the property of Henry Allen, must fail, at it never was or could have been his property or in hit possession; it was, in fact, obtained by the wife's forgery; neither could it be said, at charged in the other Counts, to be a stealing from the bank, or a receiving; it might have been charged at a receiving of the note obtained by forgery or false pretences, but the bank had clearly parted both with the property and the possession of the money, and therefore it could not be laid in them. Even supposing it was the property of Allen, the wife could not steal the property of her husband, nor could the prisoner receive it knowing it to have been so stolen</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">contended that the property had not passed out of the corporate body of the London and Westminster Bank These notes were their property; the cashier, at their servant, had authority only to pay the money to the depositor, or some person authorized by him, and even if by fraud the servant was induced to part with the property, he not having authority to do so, did not, in law pass it</hi>.

It was for the Jury to say whether, when the prisoner received the note from the wife, under the circumstances of the case, he must not have known that she had obtained it dishonestly.

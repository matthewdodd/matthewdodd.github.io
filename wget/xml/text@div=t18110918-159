               <p>Q. Beyond him does a person live of the name of Andrews - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 31st of July were you the last person in your house that went to bed - A. Yes, and it was always my custom to rake the fire out myself, and see that every thing was safe. I went to bed about half past ten or later, it was not eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. What does your family consist of - A.Myself, my wife, and one child, my maid servant and shopman; the shopman sleeped in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife was far advanced in pregnancy - A. Yes, she has since been brought to bed. The prisoner's family consisted of himself, his wife, and two children, the oldest about six or seven years old.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 31st of July, between twelve and one o'clock, were you awoke - A. I was, by a smoke or smother of fire. I sleep in the back room, up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cohen, look at that plan, and tell me whether that plan correctly describes Mr. Phillips's house, and yours - A. Yes, that is as near as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that you awoke with a great smell of fire - A. Yes, I came out of bed, I found the room all of a smoke; I went down stairs, I found the flames coming through a crevise from between the lath and plaster that came into my passage from a partition between my house and Mr. Phillips's, there is no brick wall to these houses, there is nothing but lath and plaster on my side, and waistcoat on Mr. Phillips's side.</p>
               <p>Q. And the flames were coming through the lath and plaster in your house - A. Yes, between the skirting board and the floor. When I found the flames coming at the foot of the stairs I called the servant first, because she had a child in the two pair, and my wife I called all to come down stairs; I had nothing on but my shirt. I went to the street door, I called the boy, he was sleeping under the counter. I opened the street door, there was a watchman there, I gave the alarm there was a fire; the watchman sprang his rattle, then there were some more watchmen came up. The watchman that I called first, he went in doors with me, his name is Street; he then asked me if I could get any water; I told him I would give him what I had; I believe it was three or four pails; I gave him all I had.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had throwed some water and damped the fire did he break in the plaster - A. Yes, with his cutlass, and with his foot he kicked it away; he threw more water in, and I went out, and made further alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had used what water you had what further did you do - A. I went into the yard. We have only one yard to the two houses, the back of his house is in my yard.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you could get at the back door of Phillips's house - A. Yes. I knocked as loud as I could, I could not get any answer; I then went to the prisoner's street door, there were several people knocking there before I came out, and then as I was not answered; I tried to save what property I had; I was still in my shirt; I kept moving my things, and therefore did not attend to what was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180061"></xptr>going on in the street; the watchman still continued knocking with their sticks at Phillip's door full five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you in the street when Phillips came to the window - A. Yes, I was crossing the road, he opened the sash and stood at the window; I saw him with a silk handkerchief round his neck, and something like a dark or black waistcoat, and lower I could not see.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had he his coat - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was that the room that he and his wife slept in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. His chamber is over the shop door where they were making this noise - A. Yes. When he appeared at the window he asked what was the matter, some of the people cried out, come down stairs, your house is a fire. He said, I cannot come down for the smoke, get me a ladder. There was a great many people about the door, they said break the door open. I heard many people say if he could not get down for the smoke he must know that the house was on fire without asking that question The people upon that cried out, break open the door; some of them broke open the pannel of the door before the engine came, then with a crow the door was broken open. I then got to the house, I looked in and saw Mr. Phillips in the shop; in a minute after the door was broken open. I saw him first, and his wife about a minute afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he with respect to his dress - A. He was completely dressed and all his clothes on exactly as I saw him the day before, and his wife was completely dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. The door that was broken open by the mob was the shop door in the street - A. Yes, the private door was not broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. The fire was I believe put put out in a short time - A. Yes, I suppose it was not above ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. After the fire was put out do you remember any person asking the prisoner whether he was insured - A. Yes, he said he was insured some years at the Phoenix; he did not say to what amount Some gentlemen there asked him how his skirting-board, came to be off, he said the rats had knawed it off, and it had been so some time. I remember his being asked how the fire began. He said it must be in the next house, meaning mine. He made use of abusive language to me, and said that I had lighted coals and shavings in my coal-hole.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact that was not true - A. No, I had no lighted shavings in my coal-hole</p>
               <p>Q. In a short time afterwards did your servant shew you some turpentine chips - A. Yes. I gave them to Mr. Harmer.</p>
               <p>

            . Q. Did you receive these chips of the witness - A. I did, I have kept them ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cohen. I received them of my servant girl, I was standing at the door, I asked Mr. Phillips how the turpentine chips came there meaning where the fire was; he said, you must have put it there; I had not; I never had a bit of that sort of stuff in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the watchman cut that plastering away to extinguish the fire had you any place to put them in there - A. There was not a hole to put my finger in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the firemen shewed the prisoner some rags - A. I was. They called me in and asked me if they were mine; they asked Phillips, he said they were not his; the fireman came and asked me, I told them I had no such thing in the house. Mr. Phillips then said if they are not yours I suppose they must be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the sole occupier of the house you live in - A. I am. I hold the lease under Mr. Thomas Lane, I pay my rent to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are a salesman - you deal in shoes and old clothes - A. I seldom deal in old clothes, but if I buy them I sell them again.</p>
               <p>Q. You deal in new and old clothes - you need not be ashamed of it - A. I am not ashamed of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have lived two or three years next door to the defendant - A. About two years.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a passage between your house and the defendant's - A. I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. There is a private entery into your house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Your man slept in the shop - A. He did, he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. When you discovered the smoke you said you ran down stairs and alarmed your own family - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very natural you should, and after that you went and alarmed your neighbour - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was after that about four or five minutes that you saw him at the window - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You of course were a great deal agitated, you cannot say correctly to the time - A. No. It was long enough to wake him if he was asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. That depends upon how a man might sleep - When the watchman came you and he forced your way into the passage and endeavoured to force down the lath and plaster in order to extinguish the fire - A. I did not touch it; the watchman did it. I was there at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said there was lath and plaster on your side, and wainscot of his side, was not the inside of his place covered over with paper - A. The bottom part of his parlour is wainscot, it comes up as high as the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Above that was there any thing but paper, and under that canvas - A. I did not see any canvas.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning you went to the police office - A. I never went to any police office before Mr. Harmer took me, that was a week after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any examination until the week after - A. No. there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner attended, did not he - A. He was fetched by an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You said he was fetched by an officer, you would have us infer from that that he was brought against his consent - A. I know an officer fetched him. I do not know whether he came against his consent.</p>
               <p>Q. He remained in his own house a week, so that he might have run away if he had been so disposed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was a week at home before he went to the office - A. It was some days; I cannot say it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180062"></xptr>a week.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was any part of your house burned - A. There was the joists began to be burned in my one pair of stairs back room; the boards were beginning to burn, and that was just under the head of my bed.</p>

            . I was awoke as well as my husband by the smell of this fire; we both awoke together; the room was in a great smoke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband get out of bed and go down stairs - A. He did; I went out of the room door and perceived the flames. I could see them from my staircase.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these flames proceed from the partition of your house and Mr. Phillips's - A. It proceeded through the skirting board, it was breaking through at that place. I ran up stairs and called the servant to bring the child down, she came down directly. Afterwards I ran down stairs and stood at the street door. I did not stop to dress myself. I desired the servant to carry the child to a place of safety, and to come back to help us to save our property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to save what property you could. I did not move any property, I stood at the street door to see that no person should take any thing away.</p>
               <p>Q. After you came down stairs was there any knocking at Mr. Phillips's door - A. Yes, there was a great knocking.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did that knocking last before Mr. Phillips opened the window - A. I should imagine near five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the noise considerable - A. The noise was very great, there were people from two dozen houses off they had carelessly put on their clothes and come there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the noise in your judgement loud enough to wake the soundest sleeper before Mr. Phillips came - A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you yourself any knowledge whatever by what means the fire took place - A. I could partly guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it have taken place at your house - A. No, it could have not.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL NATHAN. Q. You are in the service of Mr. Cohen - A. I was then, I slept underneath the counter in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master awake you - A. Yes; I opened the door, and went into the street. Mr. Cohen and me went out together; Mr. Cohen gave the alarm to the watchmen; the watchman came in and endeavoured to put the fire out; I saw Mr. Cohen go first to Mr. Phillips's back door and call Mr. Phillips, he had no answer, he went to the front door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did other people join in making a noise at the front door - A. Yes. The rattle sprang first.</p>
               <p>Q. At last did Phillips speak at the window - A. Yes, he opened the window and put his head out, he had no coat on, he had something dark about his body like a waistcoat, and a handkerchief round his neck, he asked what was the matter; some of the men made answer, come down, your house is a fire; he directly replied he could not come down for the smoke without going back to look, I went in doors.</p>
               <p>Q. After that the people broke the door open and got in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the people got in did you see Mr. Phillips in his shop - A. I did not. I was taking some things out of my master's house, I afterwards saw Mrs. Phillips bring a large bundle over to Mrs. Hamert's, I looked inside of it, it did not look like things gathered together in a hurry; they were wrapped up quite smooth as far as I could see.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the fire take place in your master's house - A. No, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What time did you go to to bed - A. Between ten and eleven; I am sure it was before eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a candle to go to bed - A. Yes, but Mr. Cohen always fetched it down himself. There was nothing of Mr. Cohen's moved until we were alarmed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The fire was in the back part of the house - A. Yes.</p>

I ran in and found the fire in Mr. Cohen's passage, coming out of Mr. Phillips's place, underneath the skirting board; I told him to fetch me some water, I throwed it along the skirting board to damp the fire; I made a hole with my cutlass, told him to fetch me another; I kicked it with my foot, and got more water, I threw three or four pales into the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you made that hole was there any hole - A. None that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Cohen go out and alarm Mr. Phillips's house - A. He went out to get more water; I did not take notice, I kept in Mr. Cohen's house entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the noise made in calling to the prisoner - A. I did not. I minded my business,</p>

            . I am a watchman, my beat is a short distance from the prisoner's house, I heard a rattle spring, and the alarm of fire. I ran to the engine house and got the engine. The engine house in one hundred yards or better from the prisoner's house. I assisted in bringing the engine.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came with the engine was the prisoners house open - A. It was not. There was about five or six people assembled; the first person that I saw was the officer of the night, he and I rapped at the door, he with his staff, and I with my large stick that I carry every night, we got no answer. I called to Thomas to give me the crow out of the engine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the knocking loud enough to wake any person - A. Yes, except by reason of the smoke a person might sleep sounder.</p>
               <p>Q. If any person was dressing they must have heard you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you used a crow did any body break a pannel in - A. Yes, some person, but who it was I cannot tell. With the crow that I had in my hand I broke open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had got in the shop did you see the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180063"></xptr>prisoner - A. I did not: It was two or three minutes after I was in the house, I went to the fire; the first thing when I got into the shop I could see it; the fire was in the back parlour, it seemed to me as if it was burning from the skirting board all the way up to the ceiling; with the crow I strove to knock part of it down, and after I found two butts of water in Mr. Phillips's cellar. I went up stairs to get assistance to get the water up. I went then to get the other engine up. I was not in the house again after the fire was extinguished.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been in the house two or three minutes you saw the prisoner - A. I did, I saw him dressed; I asked him if his family were in the house; he said they were; I said for God's sake, Mr. Phillips get them out as soon as possible.

             asked him why he did not come sooner; he said he could not get down sooner, there was so much smoke.</p>
               <p>JOHN BATTERSBY. I am an oil and colourman, my house is directly opposite of the prisoners. The moment I heard the alarm of fire I came down in my shirt, and the first person that I saw in the street was Mr. Cohen in his shirt. I took some things of his to save.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time were there any people in the street - A. I do not think there were, except the watchmen, they were knocking at the prisoner's door, and the rattles were springing in the street,</p>
               <p>Q. You I believe returned to your wife to make her hear - A. I did; the knocking continued till I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the knocking continue - A. From five to ten minutes. I could not say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you from the noise that was made, and the calling and the springing of the rattles was it possible that they must be awake - A. I think they must; I was awake before that by the noise, at last he opened the one pair of stairs window; his first words were, what was the matter; the people said, come down, your house is a fire; he said I cannot for the smoke, he gave that answer directly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did the smoke issue out of the window - A. There was smoke in the room, it was not so much smoke as that. The watchmen were endeavouring to get the door open, a crow was obtained, and the door was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the door had been opened and the watchmen entered did you see the prisoner - A. A short time, I stood near; it could not exceed three minutes the outside; he was dressed completely; I saw nothing wanting. I was present when Mr. Cohen asked him who put the turpentine chips where the fire had been; he replied, you must have put them there, you know you have lighted coals and shavings in your coal-hole. I directly got a candle and went and searched the coal-hole. I found nothing of the kind.</p>

            . I am a fireman of the Phoenix fire-office.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you come to this fire - A. About half an hour after it. About two hours afterwards I searched, and found a piece of a towel among the rubbish between the skirting boards, it appeared to have been a towel, because it had a piece of tape to it; I asked Mr. Phillips if it belonged to him; he told me no. I then said, Mr. Cohen does this towel belong to you; he said, let me look; I gave it into his hand, he said it is canvas, I do not keep any canvas towels in my house. I found it within the skirting board that was loose when I came there, and the hole open. It burnt all the way up on Phillips's side. I did not go into the other house. It was all open when I went in; the edges of the rafters had been on fire right up.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me whether the fire had come out of the floor of that room - A. Yes, I dare say a foot or ten inches. This is the skirting board. This is the inside of it.</p>
               <p>Q. I observed the inside is all burnt and charred - A. It is so.</p>
               <p>Q. If the skirting board had remained in its place could the floor have been burnt without that being burnt through - A. I do not think it could, it must have been pulled out at this end.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have been out at least a foot at the time of the fire, or else it must have burnt the board through - A. I should think so.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Harmer. I believe you attended the examination of the prisoner - A. I saw him before the examination at his house; he admitted that the towel that had been found was his, that it had been hanging on a chair, or a table in the parlour.</p>

            . I live nearly opposite to the prisoner. A little after twelve o'clock I was awoke by hearing a great noise in the neighbourhood, I immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180064"></xptr>leaped out of bed and ran to the window; I saw a few people collected at Mr. Phillips's house nearly opposite of me, I called out to know what was the matter, the watchman answered me the house was on fire; I told the watchman to go down the street to spring his rattle and alarm the neighbourhood. I went over as soon as I had dressed myself in a hurry, I went over, the door had been broken open, the engine had arrived; the first person I saw was Mr. Fletcher in the shop, and within half a minute I saw the prisoner, he and his wife appeared to be dressed, the fire was burning rather smartly.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it extinguished - A. Perhaps in ten minutes, and after the fire was extinguished by the exertions of Mr. Fletcher, myself and others that assisted, it certainly struck me that it was not an accident I thought so then, I think so now, I expressed myself so then. The prisoner was a dealer in potatoes.</p>

My wife awoke first, she awoke me, I opened the back window on the ground floor, I smelled fire, it was then near one o'clock; my bed being backwards is against the private passage in the prisoner's house, I heard Mr. Phillips's voice, he was walking on the same floor, that is the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any other person walking besides himself - A. I did not pay any attention, I heard him, I am quite sure of that, he appeared to me to be in the parlour behind the shop; I heard him about three minutes after I was alarmed.</p>

            . Q. Did you go on the morning of the fire to the prisoner's house - A. I did, I asked him if he could give any account how the fire happened; he told me no; I asked him what he did upon the alarm of fire, he said upon being alarmed he went down stairs in his shirt, that he ran into the parlour where the fire was, and from the smoke where the fire was he could not get out, he then said he returned up stairs, and dressed himself, and his wife and children.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>

            . I am headborough of the Parish. At the alarm of fire I went and broke open the pannel of the prisoner's door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the house did you see the prisoner - A. I saw him before I went in the house, I saw Mr. Cohen's people carrying goods over at that time, both parties were strangers to me; I ran to the first man on the opposite side of the way; I asked him what he was about, he said the next house was on fire. I said it was a surprizing thing to me, that his house should be on fire and your goods almost out. As I went over the prisoner opened the window, and said, for God's sake save my life and my wife and children, I am almost choaked with smoke; he was in his shirt. I could not see any more than his arms, head and shoulders.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many people there at that time - A. No more than Cohen's people, and a sailor that I could observe.</p>
               <p>COURT. Why the watchman was there, was not he - A. No. I said my friend, there is no ladder to be got now, if there is any thing that you have in the house that is not on fire. I mentioned beds, blankets; I said there were two of us, and by the help of God I would save their children, I waited for a minute or two, but seeing nothing throwed out of the window I broke the pannel of the door, in about ten or eleven minutes the engine came; Bland called for the crow, forced the door in. Bland, Clew, the beadle and the sailor went in, and after I had taken the door away I ran for the water, I saw the prisoner after the fire was over, he had his clothes on then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Then the prisoner threw up the window, and called for you to assist, ten minutes before the engine came up - A. Yes, or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be a quarter of an hour before the engine came - A. I cannot be sure, it might be minute over or under.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the engine there before you broke open the door - A. The engine was not there two minutes before the door was thrown in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as long as a quarter of an hour before the engine came, the prisoner knew the house was on fire A. Most undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BROWN. I am a labourer in the rope ground, I arrived between twelve and one at the fire, I saw the door broken open, Mr. Phillips looked out of the window, with a white shirt on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did not the engine come directly after he spoke to you - A. Yes.</p>

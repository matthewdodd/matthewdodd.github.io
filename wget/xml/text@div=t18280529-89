On the evening of the 3d of May, about seven o'clock, the prisoner came and asked for some bonnet-ribbon; a shop-woman showed her some; I then went and undertook to serve her, as I thought she wanted to steal - she came in with two other women, and said to one of them, "Will this ribbon suit?" she said No; the other two then asked the price of some ribbon in the window, and while I was telling them, the prisoner put one ribbon into her basket, which she took from the counter - I believe one of the others had removed it from the box; the prisoner then went down the shop, and asked a female for some prints - she called me to cut it, which I did; she paid 3s. 6d. for it, and put it into her basket - she went to the door, and I saw her put her hand in and take up the ribbon; I had not sold the other women any ribbon; I took the box off the counter, and said I could not serve them, as they had been in the day before and bought nothing; I went after the prisoner and brought her back, and in her basket was found this ribbon and this handkerchief, which I believe is master's - I can swear to the ribbon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say she was ever in your shop before? A. Yes, on the Saturday before; I took her about ten yards from the house - I followed her as soon as I could get from some ladies I was serving; I thought she might return the ribbon to the drawer; I had seen her at the shop before - I believe she has been there a dozen times; she remained in the shop about five minutes after she took the ribbon.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did not you at once charge her with it? A. Because I was nearly confident that she had returned it to the box again.</p>

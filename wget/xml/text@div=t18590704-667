I am landlord of the Railway-hotel at Ealing—the prisoner came to my house about half-past 10 o'clock on 3d June—he asked for half-a-pint of beer—I served him; the price of it was a penny—he gave me in payment a half-crown—I examined it, and found it to be bad—I asked him what he got his living by, and in the meantime sent for a constable—the prisoner said he got his living by selling slippers—the constable came; I gave him the half-crown, and gave the prisoner in custody—he was sober when he first came in—he appeared to be drunk afterwards—he had no slippers with him.</p>

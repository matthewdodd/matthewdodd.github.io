                  </hi>. I am the wife of Austin <hi rend="smallCaps">MCMANUS</hi>, and live in Dean-street, Westminster. On the evening of the 26th of December, between seven and eight o'clock, I went to the Angel, in Tothill-street, to fetch my husband and son, who 1 heard were there—I found them there—the prisoner was also in the same room—I have known him from his infancy</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701020102"></xptr>
               <p>—my husband asked me for shilling—I put my hand into my pocket, and gave it him—I did not take more money out of my pocket—I staid there but three or four minutes, and went home, leaving my husband and son there—before I went, the prisoner got very close to me, and began to rub me down—I told him to keep away from me, if he pleased—when I came out, I came along To thill-street, and waited for a cab and coach to pass—I then crossed the road, and went up three steps which lead to Iron-bar-passage—just as I got to the last step, somebody seized me by the mouth with their hand, and struggled a long time to get my pocket off, and I struggled with him—he was behind me—he struggled some time, and then knocked me down, and tore my pocket from my side—the string was very strong and hurt my side, and he broke it—I had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a little black purse, and a bunch of keys—he struggled a long time to get the pocket—his hat fell off in the struggle, and I saw him—I am certain it was the prisoner—there was plenty of light—I could see to pick up a pin—he picked up his hat, put it on, and ran down the Broadway as fast as he could drive I came out of the court and hallooed, "Stop thief," but nobody came to my assistance—I went back to the public-house and told my husband—I have never seen the purse or its contents since.</p>

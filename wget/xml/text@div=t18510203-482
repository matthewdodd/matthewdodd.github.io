I had two baskets in the gateway of No. 15, where I lire—I was called from the cellar by Jones, and missed one basket—I went up the lane to Star-alley, and saw the prisoner in custody, and the basket at his feet with two dozen of bottles in it—the basket was worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it belonged to Mr. Martin, and the bottles be<lb></lb>longed to Mr. Polhill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to a wine-merchant, at 12, Mark-lane. On 16th Jan., in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner go up the gateway of 15, Mark-lane, three or four different times—I crossed the road, and stood opposite the gateway that I might see what he did—I saw him take the empty bottles out of the prickle and put them into the basket—he then came out of the gateway—he went back again, and brought the basket and bottles out under his arm, and turned up Mark-lane, towards Fencburch-street—I went to tell the cellarman—I then ran up Mark-lane, and overtook the prisoner near Star-alley with the basket and bottles—I tapped him on the shoulder, and asked where he was going—he said, "It is all right, they are my bottles and my basket"—I said, "You are quite wrong, Mr. Martin's name is on the basket"—I laid hold of him—he put the basket down, resisted, and ran across the road—I called to another man, who seized him, and I went over and seized him again—he has been in custody ever since.</p>

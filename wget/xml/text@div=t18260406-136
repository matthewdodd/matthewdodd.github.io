About a quarter before six o'clock on the 14th of March, I was told that a boy had taken a dressing-glass and case - I ran down to Queen-street, and saw the prisoner with it under his arm - I gave an alarm - he turned and darted towards the pavement, when he set the glass down, and ran away - I never lost sight of him, but pursued him till he was taken - he said "Let me go, I have given her the glass."</p>

            . I saw the prisoner coming through an alley with this glass; just as he had passed my window, I saw a suffle between him and the prosecutrix; I went to the door - he had then put down the glass, and got up the street - I lost sight of him then, but he was brought back in two or three minutes, in custody - a cart came between us in the road, but I am sure he is the lad.</p>

            . On the 14th of March I was going up Queen-street - I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw several people running - I went up and the prosecutrix had hold of the prisoner by his coat - he was praying her to let him go, as he had given up the glass, which was on the pavement.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I was entrusted to take care of the property for a person, and had not the slightest idea but it actually belonged to him.</p>
               <p>SARAH ALGAR re-examined. I had dusted the glass about a quarter of an hour before - I looked round, and and missed it after the alarm.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character, one of whom engaged to employ him.</p>

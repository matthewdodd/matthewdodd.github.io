                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 387). About half-past seven o'clock in the evening, on 14th Feb., I was in the Green-lanes, Stoke Newington, about sixteen yards from the gate leading to Mr. Webb's brick-field; it was dusk, but not very dark; there was a gas-lamp at the gateway—I observed a omit about 100 yards from the gateway—the prisoner Jones was in it—I knew him before—a few minutes afterwards I saw Melliship standing by the gate, and in a short time I saw Nash, who is Mr. Webb's carter, and Hewitson—I know Hewitson; he is a coal-merchant—they came up the read, in a direction from Mr. Webb's stable—Hewitson had this sack about three parts full—he came</p>

               <p>to the gateway, and went just inside—(when I first saw him he was twenty or thirty yards from the gate)—he had a word or two with Melliship, and then Melliship went towards the cart—Jones came back driving the horse, and Melliship walked at the side—Hewitson was still inside the gate—when the cart came opposite the gateway, Hewitson put the bag over the rails on the ground—Melliship took it up, threw it into the cart, and immediately jumped in, and went on with it—Hewitson came out of the gate, passed under the lamp, walked for twenty or thirty yards the same way as the cart was going, and then jumped up into the cart himself—the cart was then going slowly, when he got in, it went off at a smartish trot—I ran after it—when it got within a few yards of Hewitson's house, in King Henry street, in the Back-road, Hewitson jumped out; at the same time Melliship jumped out, and ran into Hewitson's stable-door, which is between where the cart stopped and Hewitson's house—Melliship threw open the folding-door—Jones drove the cart on, and as the horse's nose was going into the stable I caught the horse's head, and in the cart I saw the sack with the corn in it—I took Jones, and my brother officer took Melliship—I told Jones I should take him to the station—he said, "Well, why should I go? fetch my master, I he knows all about it; he brought the cart down the lane; I have only just got into it"—we put Melliship into the cart, and all went to the station-Melliship said he had only just got up, and he bad been cleaning a horse is the stable—I found Hewitson's name on the cart—as we passed by Hewitson's door, we stopped, and Hewitson came out—he had then got his jacket and cap off, and he had a towel in his hand, as though he were washing himself; that was about seven or eight minutes after I saw him jump out of the cart—he wanted to know what was the matter—I said, "You had stolen property in your cart"—he said he did not know that his horse and cart was out of the place—my brother officer said, "You had stolen property in your cart, and you know all about it"—he made no answer—we took the others to the station, and then came back and took Hewitson.</p>

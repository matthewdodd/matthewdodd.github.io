                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the Victoria Docks. On 1st Oct., about 9 o'clock in the evening, I was at the Red Lion beer shop, West Ham, and saw the prisoner and another person—we had two or three pints of beer together, and some words took place about some women who had been quarrelling there in the morning—his wife came and asked him to go home; he refused, and pulled off his jacket, pulled out a knife, and ran to the bar, and struck me with his fist—I struck him again, and then I staggered outside the door, and fell on my back, and when I was down I found him on the top of me with an open knife—he stabbed me on the left breast, and three times on the arm, and drew the knife across my face—I bled a great deal—I have only done six days work since—his wife took the knife from him—I had had no quarrel with him; I never spoke above half a dozen words to him in my life before that evening.</p>

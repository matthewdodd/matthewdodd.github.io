                  </hi>. I am a slaughterman, and live in Bear and Staff-yard, Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell. On Tuesday, the 12th of Sept., I went with James Furze into Mrs. Murray's cook-shop in Turnmill-street, about twenty minutes past twelve, and sat down with him—the prisoners were there, sitting down at the same table—Belgee was sitting near Furze, and Cummins was sitting opposite him, by my left hand side—we had some soap first, and then some meat—when it was brought, Cummins asked met to give her some—I would not—she was going to take some—I told her if she took my victuals I would knock her down—she took up a knife and stabbed at me—I caught hold of her, and pushed her down—Furze went to take the knife from her, when Belgee took up a knife and made another attempt at me—Furze put his hand between us to push it away, and it cut his arm—Cummins came and cut at me again, and cut me just on the mouth—Furse ran out and fetched another butcher, who laid hold of one of the prisoners with her arms behind her—the prisoners were not sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a cook's shop in Turnmill-street. On the 12th of Sept. the prisoners were in my house, a quarter of an hour before the young men—when the butchers sat down to their dinner, the prisoners placed themselves by their side—they were quite drunk—the butchers were quite sober—Cummins took Leech's food out of his plate—he said he was very tired and hungry, and did not wish to be annoyed by her—she continued doing so—he said, if she did not leave off, he would knock her down, or something to that purport—Cummins then made use of a very bad expres<lb></lb>sion, and gave Leech a blow on his side—she sat by his side—whether she stabbed him I do not know, but she had the knife in her hand—Belgee got up, and took another knife off the table, and Furze ran out of the shop—he came in again—there was a dreadful scuffle in getting the knives from them—as fast as they got them out of their hands they got others off the table, and when Belgee was making a blow at Leech, by some means Furze knocked the blow off, and I think it cut his arm.</p>

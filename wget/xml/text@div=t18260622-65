I gave the money to Jennings, as I thought the prisoner might know me; I searched the prisoner the next morning, and found on him a key of his box; I opened the box, and found a pound's worth of silver, and among the rest these two half-crowns and this shilling - he said his father gave it to him; I sorted out the two half-crowns and the shilling, and said, "How did you get these?" he said from his father. I knew them to be what I had marked.</p>

            . Q. When he took money on your account where was he to put it? A. In a case, as we do not reside in the house - he should account for it the first thing the next morning; I asked what he had taken in the morning - he gave me half-a-crown for some goods he had sold that morning; I asked if he had taken any more - he said, "No, nothing else." The cards are worth 8s. 2 1/2d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I charged him 6s. 8 1/2d. for them- I then found I had made a mistake, and took it up stairs to make it right when my master came; I had put it into my pocket, and quite forgot it.</p>

I do not believe they do; the patterns correspond; I counted them over in the rum puncheon, and I found a gross and an half missing, but I found in the prisoner's room only half a gross: we got a warrant and took the prisoner up, at a public-house where he used; I took him over to our house, and upon being accused with it, he did acknowledge he had taken the web, but that it was the first fact; we have two shops; he acknowledged he took it out of that shop where we missed it from; I asked him his reasons for taking it; he said, he had a use for it; I took him before Alderman Cokayne, he there acknowledged he took it; he was committed, and after that bailed out, and now he comes upon a surrender: (the web produced, about 72 yards of it.)</p>

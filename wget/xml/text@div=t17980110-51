             sworn. - John Wheeler is my brother, and I know Thomas Hall, I was with them at the Little King's-Arms, at Brentford, eight or nine weeks ago; we left the house about half an hour after nine o'clock at night, or near ten; we walked about till half past twelve, or one; and then we went to the Star and Garter, at Kew-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100073"></xptr>bridge, with a rasp and a soldering-iron, to get the shutters down with.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took them down? - A.Thomas Hall, and I, and John Wheeler stood by; Hall broke one of the squares of glass, and took out a rump of beef, a loin of mutton, and a neck of mutton, and a piece of beef that was drest, and almost a whole cheese; a sugar-loaf, two apple-pies, a carving-knife, a brass weight, two counterpanes, one bed-gown, I believe flannel, a petticoat, and a tablecloth; then we came away, and took the things to Mr. Skilsby's, that was about half past one in the morning; we knocked him up, somebody came to the door, but I cannot say who it was; I was standing by the corner of the house, just by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a man or a woman? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not see the person at all? - A. No; John Wheeler and Thomas Hall took the things, I staid outside; it was about a quarter of an hour before they came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them come out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come to the door with them? - A. I did not see any body with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, from the time you went to the door, till the time they came out, you did not see any body? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they wait before they got in? - A. About ten minutes; they went in directly as the door was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see these things in the house of Skilsby? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, except from what the others told you, you do not know whether Skilsby had them or not? -</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this evidence certainly does not go far enough to bring it home to the prisoner, and he must be acquitted.</p>

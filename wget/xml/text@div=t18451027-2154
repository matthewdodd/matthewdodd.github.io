PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did your mother take out any summons that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She did not tell me—she went to Kingsgate-street and took a summons out, but she went to High-street for a warrant—she did not tell me whether she got one or not—she told me she had been talking to Mr. Whip, but she did not tell me any more—I was with her—I did not hear her ask the Magistrate for any warrant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been giving evidence here in marriage cases before, have you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know which was the last time—it was a charge of bigamy—I was a witness, and gave evidence of a marriage of my mother to a man on the Easter Monday in 1844, I think—the man set up a story that he was not the man, but that my mother had married some<lb></lb>body else in his name, but she was married to him, for I saw her—I was present at the church—there was another witness, a woman—I have known my mother married once, and I believe she was married the second time—I have heard of a man named Sheehan, but I do not know him—I cannot say whether I have seen him or not—I do not recollect ever seeing him—no man of that name ever lived along with my mother—she was married to M'Cann on Easter Monday, 1844—I believe she married again after that.</p>

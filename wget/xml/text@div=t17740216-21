            , on suspicion of receiving the goods, and was admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald. They carried them there; I followed them unknown to them; he said he would only buy the plate of them two; I went to the Sun, and they came to me, and Warren said he had given them twelve pounds all but a half guinea; I did not see the money paid, and they said he was to give us a leg of mutton and a crown bowl of punch the next day, and then we were to have the half guinea.</p>

               <p>Q. What goods had this man?</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald. All the things I thought, without they took any thing out a going along. I looked through the door and there was a man in Fise's room, talking Dutch; I heard him saw the stones must be knocked out of some of the buckles ; I saw them go into his room with them . I followed them for fear they should run away with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go with them?</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald. He would not buy them of more than two; Warren gave me and the other two prisoners a guinea each, and Hartman had a guinea for letting him see what we had got. These buckles and buttons we took from Mr. Boddington. We kept a pair of silver buckles a-piece, and Warren came back and fetched them, and said Fise was to have them all; I gave them all back but these buckles; there was a hole in my pocket, and they got down into the lining; I did not know I had them.</p>
               <p>Warren. Fitzgerald was committed to be tried here last sessions for picking pockets, but ran away with the hand-cuffs as he was coming to Newgate. I never saw him before he was taken up.</p>

About seven or eight o'clock Fitzgerald came in, and asked me to give him the key of my door; I gave it him; he went up stairs; he staid a little, then I went up; I saw a good deal of silver upon the table; I desired him to take it away for fear I should come into trouble about it. There were silver and stone buckles and silver things of different sorts; Fitzgerald put them into a bag and took them away. Hartman came up in the mean time, and saw the silver things upon the table; he put them in a bag.</p>

               <p>Bigg. No, it was mine; I boiled a pudding in it; he took it, because he said they would tear a silk handkerchief. I lodged in the same house with Hartman; Fitzgerald said he would go and sell it; they were in a public house.</p>

Yes; they were drinking together at a public house, and they all went out together; they said they would make me a present of a pair of silver buckles; Fitzgerald gave me a pair; they bid me pick out which pair I would have; one of them took them away again, and said they would have no property to be produced against them; I cannot say which that was. The thief-catchers asked me if I had found any more of the property; I told them they were in a bird cage; they took them out.</p>

             . I am an officer; I apprehended them; Hartman told me the shew glass was in the Mulberry Gardens, and said the prisoners had a handkerchief with silver buttons and buckles, rings, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. He named the prisoners to you, did he?</p>
               <p>Mayland. Yes; I took them and carried them before Justice Sherwood and Digby, at the Rotation Office. I found a pair of silver buckles, two pair of stone buttons, and a stone breast buckle on Fitzgerald. I took Clark and Fitzgerald in one room; there was a pair of solid silver buttons and some seals, which I believe Hartman's girl (Bigg) had.</p>

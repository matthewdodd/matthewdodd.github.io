               <p>Vere Street—the prisoner has been employed there some yearn—his duty was to examine the letters for the suburban towns—on the evening of 16th December he commenced examining letters at 5 o'clock—the fixed time for the bag to leave the office was 5.20, and it left at 5.24—after the bag was made up, I saw him leave the table with some letters in his hand—he went to the other end of the office, and dropped two into the dead-letter box, and put a third into his pocket—a letter, addressed to Leatherhead, should be put into the bag for the General Post Office, leaving at 5.20—the prisoner had examined the letters, and tied up the bundle for that bag—he then went to another sorting-table, and commenced sorting the letters for ex<lb></lb>delivery—he had been there two or three minutes, when I called him aside, and said "Mawe, you have just put a letter into your pocket, which is a very improper thing for you to do in the office, even if the letter is your own"—he muttered something—I understood him to say "I have"—he seemed very much confused—I said "Show it to me"—he took it from his pocket and gave it to me—it was this letter for Leatherhead, which should have been dispatched at 5.20—I said "You must go with me to the post<lb></lb>master's room"—it is addressed "Miss C. Grays, H. Barclay, Esq., East<lb></lb>wich Park, Leatherhead"—it was unopened, and bore the stamp of that day—it contained 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., wrapped in wool—the prisoner went with me to the post<lb></lb>master's room, and I reported the circumstances to the postmaster, who gave the prisoner in charge—he admitted putting it into his pocket, but said it was with no dishonest intention—if the prisoner had discovered that it contained coin, his duty was to give it to me, or to one of the assistants, or to have emptied it into one of the coin letter-boxes, that it might be registered; if he did not do that he should have sent it by the dispatch which had then been gone ten minutes—the prisoner went up to the coin letter-box, but did not put a letter in—he stopped close to it to speak to a letter-carrier, with this letter in his hand—he might have touched it—it was after that that he went to the dead-letter box—it was his duty to put letters in there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He put the letter into his outside breast-pocket—he wore a uniform coat, with an open pocket—there is no flap to it—he ought to have dropped it into the coin letter-box—nearly 100 people were in the office—he was eight or nine yards from me when he put the letter into his pocket—after that he came back, and commenced sorting at another table, for the next delivery—I made the same statement to the solicitor, word for word, which I made to the Magistrate—the prisoner has been in the employment about five years—I was not aware that he was under medical treatment—he had been under Dr. Harris, the post-office doctor, just before this—I do not know that he had had leave of absence; but there are so many of us I cannot tell.</p>

I found this bacon, cheese, and soap - the officer said she must be searched; she then opened her gown, and in her bosom we found this other pinafore; they are blue pinafores with a white speck - and under her feet we found this pair of pockets, which I had worn on the Sunday; I am sure it was not there before she came in, for I had been sitting there all the evening - she was very much intoxicated, and was taken to the watch-house; I found her in tea and sugar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What time did she go out? A. About eleven o'clock in the morning; when she returned she went up stairs to pull her bonnet off, and then came down again; I found the pockets in front of the chair where I had been sitting - there is nothing particular in this cheese or bacon - there might be more like it; I allowed her about 2lbs. of soap for washing, and if she wanted more she had it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you ever give her the bacon for the use of the house? A.Whatever she wanted for the house she always had; there is no mark on the pinafores; my children made them; I had a dozen of them.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q.Had not the prisoner the care of the dirty linen? A. She washed her own things with mine - they might have been mixed in the drying; when we found these things, she said she meant to give them to a poor creature.</p>

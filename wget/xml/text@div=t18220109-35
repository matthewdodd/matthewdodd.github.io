I was coming down the road from John-street, towards Tyburn-turnpike, about half-past nine o'clock, and passed by a gig, which was alongside of the curb-stone on the left; the horse's head was towards Tyburn-gate. A gentleman was standing alongside his horses on the left hand on the near side. I passed by about twenty yards, and heard the smacking of a whip behind, and instantly heard a crash; I turned round, and went to the spot. I saw a coach lying on its side, four or five doors from Queen-street, in the Edgware-road; the horses laid down on their sides. I held my lantern while a gentleman was dragged from under the fore part of the coach; the chaise-horse was running away, and the chaise tumbling to pieces. A woman was picked up, who I knew by seeing her frequently on my beat. The coachman called for help, and turned the coach on the wheels, got his horses up, and led them; it was a dark night. I cannot say who the coachman was. The road was lighted by oil on the side the gig stood, and it was just by a lamp.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The road was only lit on one side - A. No; the gig almost touched the curb; I suppose the coach occasioned the crash. I found it two yards from where I saw the gig; it laid more over in the road on the right. I did not see the coach before the accident happened.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the man who led the horses take any notice of Mr. Slade - A. No; he led his horses away, and took no notice.</p>

            , ESQ. I live at Portland-place. I was in the Edgware-road; there were two women looking at some jewellery in a shop; a person inside came to the door; the women ran from the shop towards Paddington; they were hailed by a coachman on his box, who asked them to come up, using very coarse language at the time. He handed one up on the box, the other got on the roof behind the box; the coachman drove off rather rapidly till he came close to the turnpike, and having cleared the gate, he drove off very rapidly; I heard screams almost immediately after he cleared the gate. I returned to the spot, and saw the woman who had got on the box, fainting on the ground; she was supported by some person. On my asking what had happened, a boy held up the wing of a gig; I then saw a gentleman leaning against the rails, two doors beyond where the women were - he was in great agony, and could scarcely speak. I advised his being taken in doors, and he was taken in. I then saw the body of the gig nearly opposite, at the top of George-street; it was shattered to pieces. The gig-horse was brought back. Just as I was leaving the pavement to ascertain the name on the coach, the coachman drove off full gallop. I do not know him; I think he saw me, and whipped his horses. I could discern the words Notting-hill, on the front pannel, on the near side of the road, coming from Paddington. It was a fine night for the time of the years. If I had been driving to town, I could certainly see any other vehicle on the road with great ease.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The gig was on the proper side, and the coach going in the direction it did, was on the right side also - A. Yes; he only trotted to the turnpike. I guess that he went faster afterwards by hearing of the chain of the coach, but I did not see it. It may be that the coach came suddenly on the gig, and could not turn, but had it gone at a proper pace, there was space enough to turn, and he might have pulled up - the remains of the gig were two hundred yards from the turnpike. I am certain that he quickened his pace on getting through the turnpike.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in the Edgware-road. On the 29th of November, about nine o'clock in the evening, I heard a sudden crash opposite my door. I went out, and saw a person standing on the flag, in great agitation; he appeared very much hurt. I picked up a female who was laying on the ground, and in the interval, Mr. Slade was taken into my room. Some persons were lifting the coach on its wheels, but I cannot identify the coachman. I did not see what coach it was; it was not a dark night.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in the Edgware-road. I remember this accident, the first thing I saw was the deceased sitting on a chair; the person hurt was brought into the house in which I live - I ascertained that it was Mr. Slade, of Tottenham Court-road; Mr. Bryan, the surgeon's young man came - I saw a coach in the road, I knew it to be the Bayswater, by the colour of the body; Paddington was written on it; I did not look for the word Bayswater, as I only knew one coach of that colour. Mr. Slade left my house in a coach with one of Mr. Bryan's young men. When I saw the coach, it stood between two lamps, about seven yards from each. I do not know who drove.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then how did he lead the horses - A. He just straightened them, they were fastened to the coach. I saw him drive that coach the day before, and at other times. After he straightened the horses he came up, and said,</p>

            . I recollect the accident. I know the prisoner, he is a coachman - I was an outside passenger from the Star and Garter, public-house, to Bayswater, he drove the coach - I was on the roof. When he got through the turnpike he stopped the coach to put down a passenger, or to do something to the coach; I did not see any one get out; he got off the coach and gave me the reins to hold, as he was getting up again, I had the reins in my hand, the horses moved, and I dropped them; he got up, and tried to recover the reins but could not - he was on the box when the accident happened; I was so frightened that I held on the coach, and cannot say whether he had the reins or not, he stooped down towards the horses' backs to get them, but whether he did or not, I cannot say; I was thrown off, and fainted away, and saw part of the chaise, after I recovered; the coach was going fast. I was going to Bayswater.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom were you going there - A. To no one in particular; it was about nine o'clock. I live in Lisson-street, Paddington.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Had he hold of the reins when the horses first set off in a gallop - A. No; I dropped the reins before he got up, as he was getting up.</p>

I conceived him to be in danger from the first moment I saw him; I saw death approaching on the Monday, he died on Wednesday. He felt convinced he should not recover from the first, he said from the beginning, and also on the Monday before his death, that he was sure he should die; he always expressed himself as having no hope of recovery.</p>

We encouraged him to hope, and said it was possible and propable that he might recover; this excited his hopes a little, but he never expressed satisfied that he should live; his spirits were not so much depressed; after we gave him hopes, he was certainly not under the apprehension of immediate death.</p>

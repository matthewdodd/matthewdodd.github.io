               <p>Q. What sat was it? - The fat from the inside of a bullock. I asked him whose sat it was? - he said it was Mr. Wright's in Ratclisse-highway; I gave him to understand that I would send to Mr. Wright's, he then said he found it, I sent for an officer and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever shew it to the prosecutor, Mr. Williams? - I gave charge of him to Dunbar, the officer, and in the course of the day it went to Mr. Staples, and it was kept there till it was enquired about.</p>

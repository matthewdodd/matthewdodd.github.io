                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Joseph Allworth Pash; he keeps a shoe warehouse, in Old Kent-road, and has a shoe warehouse in Greenwich, where I am employed. On the 9th of Dec., I went up stairs, between 3 and 4 o'clock, leaving Duffield, the assistant, in the shop—when I came down I saw the prisoner standing in the shop, and Duffield was serving a lady—I went to the prisoner, and asked him if he wanted a pair of boots—he said "Yes"—I saw he had a basket in his hand—I was called by Duffield to take a parcel, and on turning round rather quickly I saw the prisoner put a pair of leather boots in his basket—I then went to the pri<lb></lb>soner, and showed him several pairs of leather boots—I saw he was not inclined to buy; one pair was too large, and the other too small—I rang the foreman down—when he came I told him what had happened, and I left the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed in Mr. Pash's premises, at Greenwich, as foreman. About 4 o'clock on Friday afternoon, I was rung down—I found the prisoner in the shop, he was looking at several pairs of boots—the last witness told me something—the prisoner offered me a price for a pair of boots which I refused to take—he ultimately agreed to pur<lb></lb>chase a pair provided I would put some nails in the soles of them, which I agreed to do—I gave them to a person in the shop to do so—that person left the shop to get a hammer to drive the nails in—the prisoner asked me how long it would take to do it; I told him about ten minutes—he said he would go into the neighbouring public house, and return again for them—he walked to the door, and I stopped him and asked him what he had in his basket—he said he would pay for the other pair when he returned—I asked him what else he had in his basket—he told me a pair of shoes that had been mended, he had been to fetch them from a shoemaker—I laid hold of his basket, and took from it a pair of cloth button boots—before I took</p>

               <p>them the prisoner had taken out a pair of leather boots—there were two old pairs remaining in the basket after I took the second pair out—the pri<lb></lb>soner told me the pair of cloth boots were not my property, they did not belong to me, he had brought them from a shop at Deptford—I have not the slightest doubt that they were my master's property, and the leather ones also—I know them by their general appearance; I have no mark of my own on them—we have a warehouseman at our manufactory—here is 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on them, the selling price—the warehouseman's writing.</p>

On the afternoon of 9th Dec, I was sent for to Mr. Pash's shop—I found the prisoner and the two witnesses—the prisoner had this basket in his band, he was given into my charge—the last witness had these two pair of new boots in his hand, which he charged the prisoner with stealing—I took him and the boots to the station, and Duffield, who is not here, went to charge him—I searched the basket, and found one pair of women's, and one pair of child's boots in it—both very old—the prisoner said he had fetched them from a shoemaker—I found on him 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, and two tobacco boxes—before I took him, he said in the shop, I will pay for them—the last witness said, I can't allow that; that won't do"—at the station the prisoner kept talking about going to the shop and waiting for the boots, and that he was coming in again, I cannot recollect what.</p>

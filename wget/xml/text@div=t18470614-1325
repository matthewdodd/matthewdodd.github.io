                  </hi>. I am single. I recollect losing some money on the 31st of Aug. last—I charged Philip Magnus with stealing it—on the 1st of Sept. I went before a Magistrate at Guildhall, gave evidence against him, and he was committed for trial—I was bound over to attend and give evidence on the 21st of Sept.—I was in Guildhall-yard before the examination took place, and Hannah Decastro made an offer to me—Maria Allen; was with me—I and Allen went to the house of Sampson Israel—I cannot say whether it was the 9th of Sept.—his house is No. 7, Constitution-row, Gray's Inn-road—I went by Phœbe Israel's solicitation, and phœbe and Sampson Israel were there—we took tea there—Sampson Israel offered me a sovereign—he said if I liked to take it, I was quite welcome, as I must want money, being ill and out of place—he assured me he was a respectable man, that he knew the bail I was under was of no consequence whatever, but if I liked to take a sovereign, I was welcome—I was under bail to appear at the Old Bailey—he said several times, with respect to Philip Magnus, he did not care a rush for him, it was for the sake of his wife and family—nothing else was offered to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the 14th, did you again go to Sampson Israel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was to have gone on the 14th, but was so poorly, I could not, and Maria Allen went—Phœbe Israel came back with her, and she was rather saucy to me for not going—she came to my house, No. 10, Milman-street—on the 15th, I and Allen went to the Grotto Tavern, Southampton-buildings, Holborn—we met Elizabeth Magnus at Mr. Israel's shop, in Chancery-lane—we stopped some time at the Grotto, and Mr. Israel brought her sister, Elizabeth Magnus, to the Grotto, and all four took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and went to the pier at Blackfriars'-bridge, and went to Woolwich, we left our boxes at the waiting-room at the pier, and took apartments at Mr. Dawson's, No. 2, Bath-place, Wellington-street, Woolwich—Mr. Israel took them—Elizabeth Magnus, I, and Allen, re<lb></lb>mained at the lodgings—Mr. Israel returned that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you go to Woolwich? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because Mr. Israel told me, and they all told me it was of no consequence—they all told me so repeatedly, but I would not believe anybody till I went to Mr. Wooller, the lawyer, and he told me to go down to Woolwich—he said it was of no consequence if it was left in his hands, and Mr. Lazarus (who is not in custody) said it should be left in his hands—we remained at Woolwich from the 15th till the Friday week, the 25th, when the Sessions were over—Elizabeth Magnus remained with us all that time—on the 24th, Sampson Israel and James Magnus came down to Woolwich—Elizabeth Magnus was present—they sent Allen out of the room—she went to get the tea.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything said about the trial on the Friday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were talking among themselves a good deal—I did not hear Sampson Israel, James Magnus, or Elizabeth Magnus, say anything about the trial—when we came to London, we parted—I have not seen any of them since, only Mr. Israel—my boxes were left at Mr. Israel's house, in Chancery-lane—he has a shop there as well as in Constitution-row—on the 8th of Oct. I will ill, and taken to the hospital, I remained there for four months—I came out in June, and have been very ill since—none of the defendants were with Mr. Israel when I spoke to her—I was boarded and lodged at Woolwich ten days—I paid nothing—Mr. Israel, I believe, paid, but Elizabeth Magnus gave the money to Allen, who fetched in everything that was wanted—I saw the money given several times—Eliza<lb></lb>beth Magnus did not use many things the same as us, because they are Jews.</p>

               <p>they were all three in the room at the time—Lazarus suggested Wooller's name—Mr. Israel said, if the trial were to come on it was time to prepare for it—they had hinted at my going away before that—they had mentioned to me several times to go away, and Mr. Israel offered me money—she came to my lodging several times—she never exactly said, "I will give you so much money if you will not appear," but she offered me money, saying," You must be in want of money"—Elizabeth Magnus would not let us go out—she was afraid somebody would see us that knew us—I did not go out more than three or four times, she always accompanied me—she did not object to Allen going out when she went for anything, but told her always to be quick back—if she was not quick back she seemed uneasy; and if we went down stairs to the garden, or anything, she always followed us down—we all three slept in the same bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single. In Sept:, 1846, I was living in the same house with Ann Davis—I recollect her having some money stolen from her—after the examination at Guildhall, I accompanied her to the house of Sampson Israel, in Constitution-row, Gray's Inn-road—I cannot say the day of the month—I saw Sampson and Phœbe Israel there—Mr. Israel said, if his friend, or his wife's friend, who was the same as his, had taken any money from her, she should have it again—he said he would give her some money if she required it; that he thought she would require it until she got into a situation—on the 15th of Sept. I accompanied Ann Davis to Woolwich—I went there because we went to Mr. Wooller, and he said she would not be in any danger in going—he told us to leave the case in his hands, he would take it all into his hands, and she would be in no danger; and was she to be in danger, to let him know where she was, and he would immediately write to her—it was Abraham Lazarus who took her to Mr. Wooller—phœbe Israel and Elizabeth Magnus went with us to Woolwich—Mr. Israel took the apartments—we went on a Tuesday, and came back on the Friday week—Elizabeth Magnus paid for the lodgings on the day we came away, and she gave the money for what was wanted there, I believe I purchased everything, I received the money from her—we went to Woolwich because Davis should not prosecute Elizabeth Magnus's brother.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who said that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Elizabeth Magnus, Mr. Israel, Mr. Israel, and all of them—I saw Sampson Israel the day we went to Woolwich, we were four of us in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I had no conversation with him about the trial of Philip Magnus while we were there. I went there to accompany Davis—I was before the Magistrate at Guildhall, but only as her friend.</p>

Yes, on a Wednesday or Thursday, he and Sampson Israel came together—there was no conversation about money then, that I heard—I remained in the room part of the time with Ann Davis, Sampson Israel, and James Magnus—nothing passed about money when I was there—I do not remember that anything was said about the trial—we returned to town on the Friday afternoon—Abraham Lazarus and James Magnus came to fetch us—I had never seen any of the parties before this transaction.</p>

               <p>the whole time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—James Magnus came down either on Wednesday or Thursday—he left, I think, about half-past ten o'clock at night—I do not know how long Davis was left alone with him, I have no idea; I cannot say whether it was an hour—I remember all of us walking out that evening—I left Elizabeth Magnus, and James Magnus, an hour, nearly, together when I came home—I do not know what became of them—I asked Davis why she did not come in with us, I supposed she had been with James Magnus. I left her with him—I asked, why she did not come in with us—I went out, and did not come in till they went away—I wished her to come in with me; I cannot tell how long she remained out after me—I believe James Magnus went away by the last omnibus—I do not know that James Magnus and Davis were down a lane together—I do not remember the street I left them together in, it was coming up towards the pier, they were arm in arm—she had one arm and I the other—I let go of his arm and came away—Mr. Israel and Elizabeth Magnus were walking before us, they went in after me—I do not know how long after that it was that the other two came in, it might not be more than five minutes—I do not know whether it was an hour, I do not know how long it was—I did not see them come in—I said to Davis "Why did not you come in?"—I do not think she made any answer—that was the only time I accused her of being alone with him.</p>

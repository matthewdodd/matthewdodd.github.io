                  </hi>. I am foreman to Henry Samuel Crane and Son, Chemists, at Stratford—the prisoner was in their service. On the morning of the 12th of July I received information about oxalic acid—about six o'clock the bell rung, and the prisoner was going home—he was stopped at the counting-house door, and I asked if he had any objection to being searched, he said, "Not in the least"—I took him in the counting-house, and saw some oxalic acid in his hat and some in his pocket—I suppose about 3 1/2 lbs—we had</p>

                  </hi>. I am partner with my father, Henry Samuel Crane. The prisoner was going out—I was in the yard, and called him back—I believe all had gone out but the prisoner—he said he should like to have a proper person to search him—I said I was there, and the foreman, I thought that was sufficient, and then he submitted tolerably well—he took off his hat, and part of the oxalic acid was in it tied in his handkerchief—I said we would get a proper person to search him and take him, in the mean time the foreman got some more out of his pocket—I was at that time just outside the door—I have not a doubt that it was our property—we discovered that some had been taken by certain marks on a small parcel—I compared what was found on him with the bulk.</p>

Q.</hi> It is all alike, is it not-? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not always—I could swear to oxalic acid under some circumstances—this was rather a bad colour—it was not quite finished—when he took it from his hat he said he only took it for an old woman's bonnet—he said I should find nothing about him—he has worked with us several years—he has a wife.</p>

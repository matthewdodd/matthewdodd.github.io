            . I drive the Towcester waggon, which goes through St. Alban's. On the 28th of July, I left London, between six and seven o'clock at night - I remember a little brown paper parcel tied to this spade, which was given to me at the Queen's Head, in St. John-street - I tucked it in between the flats in the waggon - it was so secure it could not get out itself, and if any person took one they must take the other - they were to go to Stoney Stratford - I had no other such parcel in the waggon - I left St. John-street about half-past six o'clock - the prisoner got up at the Queen's Head, where I took up the parcel - she agreed to go St. Alban's, and paid me a shilling - she got into the waggon close against where this little spade and parcel were - I arrived about a mile on this side <placeName id="t18341016-180-crimeloc976">St. Alban's</placeName>

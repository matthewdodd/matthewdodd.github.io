               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any distinct recollection whatever of having sent the prisoner himself to the Gazette-office? A. Yes, Sir, I gave it him, but did not see him go - I never ordered him to hand the cash and advertisements to other clerks, to my recollection - it never was the custom in the office; I am sure I never told the prisoner to do it myself - there was a clerk named Jones; I do not know that I ever, in his presence, told the prisoner to hand the cash and advertisements to other clerks, or that Mr. Jones was the person sent on any occasion - I never knew the prisoner to hand over the cash to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270037"></xptr>Mr. Walter, or Henderson, or Murray, Jun.; the prisoner has never settled these accounts with other persons in my presence - nor general money accounts; the cash given the prisoner was on account of Messrs. Adlington, Gregory, and Faulkner, and to be paid at the Gazette-office; he has not been often absent from indisposition, since I have been there - I have no idea of what is disbursed in a day in that office; I have been there about four months - I cannot tell what has been the custom of the office so well as the elder clerks.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. On the 2nd and 22nd of March were you the person from whom the prisoner received these sums of money? A. Yes, and he ought to have accounted to me for them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was that your department? A. Yes; I do not know whether he had the disbursement of any other money! except for advertisements - the 3l. he had from me was for the purpose of paying for the advertisements; he stated he paid 1l. 0s. 6d. for that, 18s. for the insertion in the Times, 2s. 9d. for a copy of the Gazette, and 7d. for the Times newspaper - I have no doubt but he brought me the difference.</p>

            . I was clerk to the prosecutors. On the 25th of March I gave the prisoner an advertisement to take to the London Gazette; I do not know what money I gave him, but he generally told me about what he thought it would come to; it was the custom of our office to give a clerk the money before we sent him - I know he accounted to me that day, because it was the custom; I made the entry at the time from what he told me - this is it; (reads)"Advertisement 1l. 4s., Gazette 2s. 9d.;" Mr. Gregory asked the prisoner how it was that a common advertisement of that kind was so high a charge - the prisoner said if there was one word more than usual, or even an alteration, 10s. was added.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you made any memorandum in your book of whom you gave the money? A. No; the prisoner was often absent three or four days from ill health - he was not absent on the 6th of February, or on the 25th of March; we omitted the charge on the 6th of February, but the one of the 25th of March is in this indictment - I am not aware that it ever happened that the advertisement and money has been left on the desk for the first clerk who was at liberty to take it; it was never done, to the best of my recollection - I cannot say that I have ever done it; I do not recollect it; I do not recollect one instance - there was a clerk named Jones in the office, and one named Sands - I may have left advertisements and money for insertion in the Gazette or Times with instructions that they should be forwarded by the first clerk that should be disengaged, but I do not recollect it - I think I have not done it often; I have heard that the prisoner has handed the money and advertisement to other clerks, but if I gave him the money I took the account from him; I cannot tell whether he has been charged by other clerks, the money he has charged me - to the best of my recollection I never gave Mr. Sands money and advertisements to be taken down by the first clerk; I think I should have recollected it if I had.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you ever see him hand over any money? A. No, I am sure that on the 25th of March was before March - I do not know how long I was there the prisoner was the person I gave it to - here is his writing on the advertisement.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You charged him on the 6th of February? A. Yes, at Hatton-garden; but that is not now persisted in, because we considered these charged strong enough -I do not think there was any mistake made about it.</p>

On the 2nd of March there was paid for Matthews' assignment 10s. 6d.; there was nothing that day for which 1l. 0s. 6d. was paid - on the 22nd of March there were six advertisements for Adlington and Gregory, for one of which 1l. 0s. 6d. was paid - there was no payment of 2l. 0s. 6d. that day; on the 25th of March there were two advertisements from them - one is of "Leach and Leach," for which 14s. was paid; there is not any entry of 1l. 4s. paid that day - it is not the custom at our office to give receipts, they are scarcely ever asked for; I cannot recollect whether the prisoner brought these advertisements.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not the habit for other clerks to come with these advertisements? A. Yes, pretty often, and there may be clerks I am not acquainted with - other clerks might have brought these.</p>

            . I was a clerk of the prosecutor's.

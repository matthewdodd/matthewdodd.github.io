                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Richard Pratt, a car-man, contractor, and pavior, in Gray's-inn-lane. He has a place where his horse provender is kept—the prisoners were in his employ—it was their duty to take the teams where they are ordered—on the 13th of January I told them to go to Fetter-lane, to work for Mr. Rook, of Bethnal-green—they were to cart gravel from Fetter-lane to Bethnal-green—they started a few minutes before nine o'clock—I saw them be<lb></lb>fore they started—Barnard had two horses to his team, and Kennett had two to his—each had to mind his own team—before they left the premises they went to the place where the provender is—I saw Kennett nil their note-bags with provender, and Barnard had two—they took the nose-bags out of the stable into the yard—they were allowed to take out what they did for the use of the horses—that would be a proper quantity for the four horses during the day—they then started, and in going out of the yard there were some grains in a truck, which had been brought in the night before—there was no objection to their taking the grains if they gave it to the horses—they had no business out of the road between Fetter-lane and Bethnal-green—their right road Was down Holborn, and through Smithfield—they had no business in Gray's-inn-road.</p>

               <p>Camden-town. On the 13th of Jan. I saw two carts belonging to Mr. Pratt in Gray's-inn-lane, opposite Fifteen-foot-lane, between ten and eleven o'clock—they were before me, going in the same direction as I was—the two prisoners were with them—I passed them—when I was at Britannia-street, which is some distance from Fifteen-foot-lane, I was about taking a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—on turning round I saw the two prisoners in conversation together—after a short time I saw Barnard go round the cart, and take two nose-bags—they appeared full—he went down Fifteen-foot-lane, along Paradise-street, and into Britannia-street where I was at that time—I saw Mr. Griffiths coming along Britannia-street—I saw Barnard go into a shop in Britannia-street—I pointed that shop out to Mr. Griffiths—when he went in he had two nose-bags, and when he came out he appeared to have but one, and that was empty—he crossed Bri<lb></lb>tannia-street, and went further along at the back of Chad's-row, and into Pindar-passage—I did not see him come out of Pindar-passage—Kennett was with the carts while Barnard went with the nose-bags—he drove the carts along the Gray's-inn-road till he came to Pindar-passage—the two front horses were brown, and one of the others was grey.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Britannia-street on the 13th of Jan. last, about twenty minutes to eleven o'clock—Weaver pointed out a house to me—I saw no person go into that house, but I saw Barnard come out with the nose-bag on his back—it appeared empty, but the mouth of it was stuffed with straw—the house he came out of was 62, or 63, Britannia-street, which is one door beyond Paradise-street—he crossed Britannia-street, and went up George-street—I followed him—he ran away from me up Pindar-passage, which leads into Gray's-inn-road—I followed him, and he joined the team in the road, at the top of Pindar-passage, opposite Cromer-street—Kennett was with the team—I cannot say whether he spoke to Kennett when he joined him—I after<lb></lb>wards went with Archer to the house out of which I had seen Barnard come, and behind some coke sacks we found some corn, chaff, and grains—it was given to Archer, who took it away with him.</p>

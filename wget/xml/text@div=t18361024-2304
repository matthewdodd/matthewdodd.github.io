                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Mackmain, a ladies' shoe-maker, we live in Foley-street, St. Marylebone. On the 5th of October, about twenty minutes to eight o'clock, I was sitting down in the kitchen, and heard a noise in the passage—I looked round, and saw the parlour door was fastened, and the key hanging up—we have a private drop<lb></lb>bolt to the parlour door, which we pull up by a wire—I saw that was down. and felt satisfied all was right, but in about three minutes more, I head a dreadful noise up stairs in the passage—I took the candle off the table, and ran up stairs, and I saw the prisoner go from between the parlour door and the street door as I got to the top of the kitchen stairs—the parlour door was open—the prisoner ran into the street and shut the door in my face—I opened it and ran after him—I was not above a yard or so behind him when he shut it—I followed him, calling out, "Stop thief," and he was pursued by Wood, a policeman, and stopped—before I heard the noise Henry Hendley came to the street door, and brought me home three pinafores—when he went away the door was shut—before I could get out of the kitchen to open the door to Hendley I heard somebody go out and shut the door after them—I did not say any thing to Hendley—I took the pinafores and went down stairs again, and directly afterwards heard this noise—the parlour door was shut when I was up stairs to Hendley, for I put my hand against it—I had no light—it was locked with a key, and an inside, drop-bolt—a wire leads from that bolt into the kitchen—by pulling the wire up, if the bolt is down, you can get into the parlour—the street door opens by a latch-key—when I followed the prisoner he turned the corner of Foley-street into great Ogle-street, and then turned the corner of Marylebone-street—I there lost sight of him—he was brought back by the constable in about ten minutes—I had never seen him before to my knowledge—I knew him to be the same man I saw got out of the street door—I went into the parlour—it had been opened—I did not miss any thing from there—the bolt was broken off the door—there were eleven impressions of a crow-bar on the door and post—I am sure I latched the street door after I took the pinafores from Hendley—I was the last person who had been in the parlour before that—I am sure I locked it—a skeleton key was pro<lb></lb>duced by the policeman, which I tried to the parlour door, by the Magis<lb></lb>trate's order, and it opened it—it would not open the street door—I lost nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am twelve years old, and live in Foley-street, with my father who is a painter. On the 5th of October, about twenty minutes to eight o'clock, I took some clothes home to the prosecutrix, which my mother had mangled—I knocked at the door, and a man came out with an apron on—he said they would he down directly—I did not know him before—I am not quite sure of him—it was a short man—the prisoner is like him—he went away, and Mrs. Mackmain came up—I gave her the pinafores, and she went away directly—I went away as soon as I gave them to her—she shut the door close—it was a man just the prison<lb></lb>er's size, but I am not sure of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable. On the night of the 5th, I was coming along Upper Marylebone-street, at about twenty minutes to eight o'clock, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running down Ogle-street, from Mr. Mackmain's house—I followed him, crying "Stop thief"—he ran along Marylebone-street, into Little Ogle-street, and ran into a shop—he ran out again directly, and I caught him in my arms—he asked me what he had done, and said he had done nothing—I asked him what he ran for—he said because other people ran—I took him back to the prosecutrix's house, and he dropped this skeleton key at the door—I went in, and found this bolt had been forced off the door, and the door forced open—I tried the key, and it both locked and unlocked the door—the prosecutrix came up to me directly I stopped him—there were eleven impressions on the door and door-post of either a small crow<lb></lb>bar or chisel—they appeared to be freshly done—it was dark at the time.</p>

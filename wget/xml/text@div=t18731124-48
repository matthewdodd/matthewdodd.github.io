                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Richmond Post-office, engaged entirely on postal duties—the office is kept by Mrs. Brooks—the prisoner was one of the rural messengers employed between Richmond, Petersham, and Ham—he was on duty on 30th September, making two deliveries, one in the morning, and one shortly after 1 o'clock—the two brothers Wilmot sort the letters to the different districts—they were at work on that day<lb></lb>letters insufficiently paid would be delivered by me to each letter carrier, and the other letters not marked would be sorted by the letter carriers—on 30th September I delivered one letter to the prisoner as insufficiently paid 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the second delivery, but there were more insufficiently paid in the morning delivery—I find his signature and mine for the penny on this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also find the penny entered as paid over to me, and my signature to it—nothing is said about any shilling letters—if these two letters had borne on the face of them "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to be paid extra, "I should have included them in this bill—that would have been 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I delivered to other letter carriers other letters on which charges were to be made—these two letters were not delivered by pie in this state to the prisoner, and if they did not arrive from London in this state, neither I or anyone in the office had a right to charge them—this "Is insufficiently paid "is not my writing—I heard next morning of an inquiry being made by young Mr. Brooks, and the prisoner and the other men were called in to state what they had received—Mr. Wilmot said "Men, I want you to recollect what charges you had yesterday"—the prisoner answered "A penny"—I at that time remembered that I had received a penny from him—he said nothing about receiving two shillings—on 17th October a gentleman came from the Post<lb></lb>office—I was sent for, and Mr. Forest said, in the prisoner's presence, "Burden, Mr. Griffiths wishes to settle this two shillings on you"—I said "He can't do that, for several reasons"—I explained that if the charge was made in London the amount would have been stamped on the face of the letter and not on the back—these letters are stamped on the back—I should not write "Insufficiently paid"—it would be stamped—and the reason I gave was that if there had been two shillings charged, I should have put the two shillings on the bill, and I produced the bill to Mr. Forest with my writing and his writing on it—that was the only mode for the prisoner to discharge himself—that was the first day on which I heard any suggestion that the prisoner had paid me the money—he did not pay me the two shillings—he had no right to mark the letters himself or to charge them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been there a week, and he has been there over three years—I had no disputes with the prisoner during that week, but I believe there was a dispute two or three days before with regard to a penny charge which they said they had paid me—the elder Wilmot occupied a position above the prisoner, and the prisoner was above the younger Wilmot</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187311240064"></xptr>
               <p>—I delivered letters in the morning to the two Wilmots, to be sorted, andthey delivered them to the letter carriers—there are ten letter carriers andrural postmen—in some cases money is received from the postmen beforethey go out, on letters that are undercharged, out of their own pockets—letters prepaid by the postmen would be entered on the way bill; I didstate the contrary, but I did not understand; I believe it was not so previousto my going there, which was on 23rd September—there was a slate in theoffice for entering charges which were not paid by the town letter carriers, but that was not used by the rural deliverers—I believe the prisoner hassaid that he gave me a half-crown for the two letters, and that I gave himback a sixpence—I am prepared to swear positively that he did not do so—I swore before that I did not remember his doing so—my knowledge isderived in a great measure from the bill, but not entirely—I have a greatdeal of business to attend to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There are a number of town carriers in Richmond withwhom the practice is different—this bill is made out chiefly to check thehour of arriving at and leaving the walk—I did not receive any money onthat day from the prisoner in respect of overcharge but the penny I havementioned—if my attention had been called to it next day I should havebeen able to tell accurately what coins he had given me, but he never saidtill 17th October that he had paid the money to me—if he had paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. either before he went out or after his return, he would have required me toenter it for his own protection—if I had received a half-crown from him Ishould have paid him back not 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had been in the post-office at Leeds for two years, after which I went abroad for my health—if the prisonerhad pre-paid the money it would have been entered on the bill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head letter-carrier at the Richmond Post-office—it is my duty, with my brother, to sort the paid letters into thedifferent districts—those on which charges have to be made go to Mr. Burden, and as a rule they come in a special parcel—Mr. Burden woulddeliver them to the different letter carriers—I sorted the letters on 30th September, and delivered some to the prisoner's walk—if they were endorsedin this way I should not have given them to the prisoner; I should havehanded them to Mr. Burden, supposing they had got among the other letters—next day, 1st October, the men were in the office, and I asked them whatmoney they had received the previous day for extra postage—the prisonersaid "A penny"—this was about 1. 15 or 1. 20—I am quite sure it was after 8 a.m.—the prisoner said nothing about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him "Both deliveries 11—he said "Yes"—Mr. Burden was present—on 17th October Mr. Forestcame down and said "Mr. Griffiths, what is this about Mrs. Leatham's letters;</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> From 1st to the 17th October, when his attention wascalled to it, there had been no discussion about it to my knowledge. Burdensaid that he could not have paid it for several reasons, but he never saidpoint blank that he did not—the prisoner said it to Burden's face, and Ibelieve Burden said "I can't remember receiving the half-crown; I receivedthree or four sums that day for excesses"—there have been disputes beforewith regard to mistakes on excesses—I don't remember any dispute withmy brother on the Tuesday, or with any letter carrier; it is some timesince there has been any dispute to my knowledge—the money paid by thetown letter carriers previous to going their rounds, would be entered on aslate and wiped off when they paid the money—the payments are some-times made before they go out, and sometimes not; if they have the moneythey pay—if they do not pay before they-go out it is put down on the slateand they pay it when they return—the penny would be money unpaidbefore the prisoner went out, no matter who it was—if a postman paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before he went out and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when he returned, he would say "Half-a-crown"</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My question was "How much money have you men re-ceived? and the prisoner's answer was "A Penny"—with the rural lettercarriers this plan is adopted instead of a slate, they carry this bill withthem and when they come back they sign their names on it, and Mr. Bur-den signs a receipt for the money; that concludes the transaction—mybrother John was not in a lower position than the prisoner—I assisted ingetting the prisoner into his present position.</p>

            ; I looked towards this young man that was loading his cart; I thought, by his proceedings, that he was doing that which was not right; I saw him in the middle of the cart and the bags of coffee were on each side, and another cart that was along-side of it was empty; there were three men in the empty cart, and they swore at him and told him to have done, there was somebody looking at him; he stooped down towards the middle of the cart, seemingly to take hold of the nose-bag (the corn-bag for the horses); he stood up again, and they swore to him to be easy, he stooped and took up the bag and put it into the basket;

             the bagman, belonging to the East India Company, directly got up the near side of the cart upon the load of coffee; he looked about to see where the place was cut or tore, and he looked at Wesley in the face; the prisoner then took the bag and the basket and dragged it in his left hand round the top of the load of coffee; he came towards the centre of the cart, then he was going to take the nose-bag out of the basket; Mr. Dixon took hold of it as he was going to drop it in the place from whence he took it; then he went forward and jumped upon the horse's back and from thence on the ground and ran away.</p>

            Therefore you know he was the person that was with the cart? - A. Yes, he was the person and no other; he was loading most of the goods towards the tail of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the usual way of loading? - A. No, because it was the way to make the horse hang up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the bag afterwards? - A. There was a piece of work on the quay; I got up from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300044"></xptr>where I sat; I went to the gentleman and gave information.</p>
               <p>Q. You communicated it to Mr. Brookes, did you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What was your employ at that time? - A. I was looking after Mr. Cleaver's carts, he has sixteen or seventeen.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say that you saw him take any thing out of any bag, but that you saw him stooping? - A. That I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner was loading the cart and no other person - did you see his person where you were either sitting or standing at the steps; were you looking at him the whole time of the cart being loaded? - A. I was not always looking at him; I kept my eye on him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Are you one of the Custom-house officers? - A. Yes; I am a cart follower.</p>

               <p>Q. Your duty is to follow the cart after it is loaded to the place where it is consigned to? - A. Yes, to see that it is not robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 4th of October were you at Ralph-quay? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the quay belonging to the East India Company? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a cart of Mr. Clarke's loading that day? - A. Yes, I was in the care of it; the East India hoy was there; the prisoner at the bar was loading the cart, there was only him with it; I cannot say whether he was the driver of it; I saw him take the nose-bag out of the body of the cart and put it into a basket; immediately I had a suspicion that some of the bags had been cut; I enquired for the bag-mender, Davies, I told him to go up into the cart and see whether the bags had not been cut; immediately Mr. Dixon got up into the cart, the prisoner moved the hay-basket from one side to the other, I having told Davies to look in the basket; Mr. Dixon got hold of the basket and he gave me the nose-bag out of it, and I carried it to the land-waiter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what that nose-bag contained? - A. Yes, we weighed it; it contained seventeen pounds of coffee, bag and all.</p>
               <p>- DIXON sworn. - Q. You are the bag-mender belonging to the East India Company - were you employed at the quay next to Ralph-quay on the 4th of October? - A. Yes; I was sent for the purpose; I got on the top of the cart; I observed the prisoner at the bar move the basket to the further side of the cart, then when I got up he moved it again; I then could see the coffee in the bag that was in the basket; I went and took it out of the basket; the prisoner wished me to leave it in the cart; I said, it could not be done in that manner, it must go to the land-waiter; the prisoner then jumped out of the cart and ran away. That cart was unloaded, and the coffee loaded in another cart, and then I found that the corner of a bag had been cut, and the hole stopped with hay; I sewed up the hole, and the King's number was taken, and that bale was marked and put by in the East India Company's warehouse.</p>
               <p>- BROOKES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a clerk in the service of the East India Company at Ralph-quay; having received information, I went to Ralph quay, there I found the cart loaded but no driver; I called the driver several times but no driver appeared; I ordered another cart and directed the men to send that cart to the Green-yard, by doing which I knew I should find who was the driver. On unloading the cart I saw a bag that had been cut, and the hole was stuffed with hay; I directed it should be re-weighed; the nose-bag full of coffee was then in possession of the constable; I saw it and had it weighed; it was the same sort of coffee as was in the bag where he had took it from; the quantity of coffee found in the bag was seventeen pounds, bag and all, the weight of the bag that was cut was 300 lbs. and a half, making a deficiency of seventeen pounds; the nose-bag made it up; there had also been a bag in the former load of the same description.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What time of the day was this? - A. About one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner came to the wharf to you and afterwards he went to the Mansion-house without being in custody? - A. No; there was an officer ready; he came with his master about one o'clock.</p>

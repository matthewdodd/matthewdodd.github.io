            . I am a watch case joint finisher. Last Sunday fortnight, about half past ten o'clock at night, I was tying up the seat of a child's chaise in <placeName id="t18080914-34-crimeloc192">Golden lane</placeName>

When<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140021"></xptr>we got to my door he asked me what o'clock it was; I pulled out my watch, I told him about twenty minutes to eleven; he said I do not think it is so late as that, hold the watch up, I will look; I did; he made a snatch at the watch, took it, and ran away and I after him; I called out stop thief, and he was taken.</p>

               <p>I live in Everard's-place, Church-lane, Whitechapel; I was going to remove from Union-street, Bishopsgate, to Church-lane; I applied to Mr. Taylor for a cart, and he sent one, of which the prisoner was <rs id="t17890909-45-deflabel230" type="occupation">driver</rs>

               <p>I am a porter; I was employed by Mr. Hart to move his goods; I packed up some hats, about one dozen and a half between the leaves of a table; I delivered the hats into the prisoner's charge, into the cart; I went up stairs to fetch some more things down, and when I came back, I saw him with a hat in his hand; and the hay-basket in the cart; I saw him cover one of the hats over with some hay; I asked him what business he had with the basket in the cart? he told me he would move it out immediately and accordingly he did; and I informed my master that he had a hat in the basket; and he went and found it in the basket afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The hats have been in my possession till the beginning of the sessions; when I left them with a friend, thinking it inconvenient to carry them about; I can swear to the hats, one of them was made for a clergyman; the lining was not finished; I know it by that.</p>

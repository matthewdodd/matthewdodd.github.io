                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, T</hi> 7). On the night of 31st October, in consequence of some information, I went to the kitchen of the Maryle<lb></lb>bone Schools, at Southall, which belong to the guardians of the Marylebone parish—while I was watching there, I saw the prisoner Cook come to the window outside—Strong, another constable, was with me—I said to him, "There is somebody looking in"—I took off my boots, and went to a door further back in the room, thinking to meet Cook—as I opened the door, I saw him run into the pump-room—I followed, and in that room I saw a trap door open, and an old pair of shoes by it—I said, "Whoever it is, has gone down this trap door"—I got down, and after crawling about ten or twelve yards under the floor, between the surface of the ground and the flooring of the school, I found the two prisoners—I told them to come out, and I heard one of them say, "Throw the keys away," I could not say which—Strong got to Connor and took him out—I had to go ten or a dozen yards further after Cook—I said to him, "You may as well come out, you can't get out that way"—he looked round one of the small pillars, and said, "Is that you?" and then he came to me, and said, "The things are all right there," pointing to them—I pulled these things out (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are two money boxes, one of the locks which had been taken off a door, and a key which had been filed to make it fit—the superintendent has the proper key—I also found these books there—they could not see to read without a light, but they had several candles and matches there, and there were places where they had stuck the candles up, the boards were burnt—there were also seven children's frocks, an old blanket which was made into a bed for them, two tin cans, two tin mugs, and a poker—going to the station, Cook said they took the poker down to get one of the boards up in the office—he was formerly an office-boy in that school—the office was just above where they had been sleeping, at the further end—by taking up one of those boards, they could have got into the office—they said they had been there a week, they only went there for a living, and they had got that after the school had been shut up of a night by pushing up the window of the servants' hall, where they have their meals.</p>

               <p>—this blue book belongs to the library there—I distinctly recognise it—the children in the school have similar boxes to these—I recognise this lock as one of a set belonging to the guardians, and the key of it is in my pocket—this lock came from one of the outer doors of the girls' schoolroom—I saw it safe on Sunday morning, 30th October, about 8 o'clock—I missed it about 6 in the evening—the plate that covers the lock had been replaced, so that it would be impossible to miss it until you looked very minutely into it—it is a lock that goes into the door—it was only by putting the key into the hole that I missed it—the lock was gone—they must have had tools of some sort to have unscrewed it—if they had opened that lock they would have been able to have opened all the store-rooms in the house—I have no doubt these frocks belong to the school—there is nothing by which I can swear to them—I know Cook as having been previously connected with the schools, and leaving there eighteen months ago—neither of them had any right there at this time—Cook said in my hearing, "We had those on Saturday night, out of the girls' class-room," alluding to the boxes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cook.</hi> We did not get through the class-room window, the doors were open; we took the lock off at half-past 3 on Sunday morning, and he says he missed it at 6 in the evening.</p>

I am the industrial teacher at this school—on 30th October, my attention was called to some marks on the window—it was mould, and what might have been brought in by the feet—the top of a cupboard forms the window ledge—it is a very broad one—they had come across that—there was an ordinary fastening on the window—it was in its proper condition when I saw it the night before—the window is on the ground floor, In the girls' yard—the room had the appearance of having been broken into, the cupboards were very disorderly, some bread and cheese had been missing—I did not miss anything—my attention was drawn to it after it had been missed—I had seen these boxes about the school.</p>

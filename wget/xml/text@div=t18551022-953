                  </hi>. I am a baker, of No. 2, Anchor-and-Hope-alley, St. George's. On 20th Aug., about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was disturbed—the noise came from the front room—I awoke my wife, and then the dog barked—my wife was going into the room, but I called her back, and the prisoner came out of the room—as he was going downstairs I said, "That is that thief Moore, catch him!"—he had lived with me two years and a half—when I got up in the morning, I examined the front room—the drawer was wrenched open, and there were marks on the drawers, as if a chisel had been in them, and the lock was wrenched—the bolt of it was out of the socket—I missed three keys and a few cigars—I went to the back of the premises, and found a ladder leaning against the yard—when I went to bed, the premises were left on the latch—anybody lifting the latch could get in—the men used to go in and out to get flour—I never locked the door except on Saturday nights—the prisoner would know that.</p>

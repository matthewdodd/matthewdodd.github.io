            ? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. About seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the defendant? - A. I do not believe he is any thing; he told me he was a captain in full pay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever apply to you to lend him a sum of money? - A. Yes, for the payment of twenty-five men he was recruiting for; he had got twenty-one of Captain Reynolds, and he had only four to raise; for this purpose, he wanted to borrow a little money.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he want to borrow of you? - A. We had not agreed on the sum; he told me he was to pay thirteen guineas a man, and I never intended to lend him more than to pay for these men; I sold out stock, and received 600 l. of Mr. Thompson, the stock-broker.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did you receive it of Mr. Thompson? - A. Part in cash and part in checks; he sent the checks to Messrs. Fullers, and got cash for the same; I received altogether 613 l. after I received it, I went home; it was dinner time; the prisoner came between five and six o'clock; when he came I had my sister with me; when my sister went we walked part of the way with her and returned; when I got up stairs, it was beginning to be dusk; I then took the Bank notes from my pocket, and sat down at the table, and put them on the table, and holding my hand on them at the same time, I was beginning to discourse with him what I meant to do; I told him I expected I had lost money by selling out stock; he said he must be answerable for that, but as part was only for him, I meant to distinguish that part that was left for myself, and the part for him; I concluded that he was prepared with security, but I did not tell him so; we sat down at the table for the purpose of discussing this point, and then there came a knock at the door; he just cast his eye on them; they were laying before him; he started up and opened the sash; we were up one pair of stairs, and Mr. Meene, who was on the outside of the door, said, here is Reynolds and some other person, waiting for you, whose name I do not recollect; he said he must come down directly; Foley said, I will be with you in five minutes; the prisoner seemed agitated, and took up one of the notes and surveyed it, and I believe did not see what it was, for he held it wrong end upwards; he was about to speak; he stopped short, and hustled them all up together, and went out of the room, and down stairs; he ran out very fast, and shut the street-door after him, and joined Meene, the man that knocked, and they walked off arm in arm together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out? - A. No; my consternation was so great, I did not know how to act.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consent to his taking away all these Bank notes? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever promised to lend him so large a sum as 613 l.? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that one of the letters you received from him - (a paper shewn to the witness) - after you had received that letter, had you any conversation with him, so as to know that it came from him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know his hand writing - have you ever seen him write? - A. I have seen him write; I have heard people say that it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that it is? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever acknowledge to you that this letter was sent from him to you? - A. Oh yes. - (The letter read.)</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he made an offer to you; how long has your husband been dead? - A. Twenty years; I have known Mr. Foley about seven months; I had a very good opinion of him; I knew where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a great regard for him? - A. I never professed any regard to him; you may be able to prove it, but I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know your own hand-writing? - A. I do; I acknowledge that I had friendship for him, and would serve him in this affair.</p>
               <p>Q. You wrote to him very frequently? - A. No; it occurs to me that I wrote to him once to refuse him the money; and I wrote a note to him once or twice, but I cannot even recollect the purport of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was it your intimacy first began? - A. At Mr. Gardner's, at Chelsea; I boarded there.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner has been there with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said before that you did not know what he was? - A. I have heard that he was an ensign; I never heard it disputed but that he was an officer in the army.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you have known him at the lodging-house before he visited you at your apartments? - A. Sometimes he spent his hours with the family, and sometimes with me alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not made a promise to him; and that you should wish to alter your condition? - A. No; quite the reverse.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Miss Dance and Mrs. Moiney? - A. She is one of the conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Q. She is a wife of one of the captains in the army? - A. It is said so, but I do not know it; I dined once at his house with them; he told me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040055"></xptr>and they confirmed him, that his father is a man of 700 l. a year, and that he could not leave it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never conversed on the subject of intimacy and attachment to the person of the prisoner at the bar? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is this; have you never talked with Miss Dance and Mrs. Moiney upon the subject of your attachment to the person of the prisoner? - A. What made me say never, I never spoke to them together; I never spoke to Mrs. Dance, only as a person that he lodged with; he always considered them as good kind of people, but I never considered them as acquaintances.</p>
               <p>Q. He went away quite in a hurry? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Somebody knocked at the door, and he went away in a hurry; you begged him to sit down; and did you not say, my dear Foley, I have done so and so for you, and I hope to make you a happy man? - A. I did not expect to be treated so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, on the same evening, or on the next day, tell Mrs. Moiney in these words, I have made my dear Foley happy; I have lent him this 600 l. - A. By heavens, I never said so in my life; you alarm me.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the Miss Dalsiers? - A. These are people he lives with.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you, either on the evening of that day, or the next day, or any time, in which the defendant got your money, and was taken up, say that you had lent him that money? - A. I told the transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is not whether you told the transaction, but whether you told any person that you had lent him the 600 l.? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know Captain 
               <persName id="t18040704-48-person496">Fitzgerald</persName>
            ? - A. I am sorry I do; I have heard a bad character of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Meene was before the Magistrate, and was examined as a witness? - A. He was; his name was on the warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. Meene was discharged, and was at liberty; and has been at liberty ever since? - A. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear it said, and do you not believe it, that that man was to be a principal witness on behalf of that gentleman to-day? - A. I supposed he would if he could, because I knew there was a conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you this question solemnly upon the oath you have taken, was he or was he not indicted in order to be kept from giving his testimony today; I desire a plain answer? - A. I cannot tell; I am not a lawyer; I represented him as a person that was an accomplice in carrying on a swindling scheme to defraud me of my money.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not represent him to us as a swindler; you represent him to us as a thief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did not you swear before the Grand Jury so as to induce them to find the bill? - A. I did; I am not used to be examined, therefore I may be too quick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not direct your attorney or the clerk of the indictments to put Mr. Meene in the indictment? - A. I consented.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whether you did not desire the attorney or the clerk of the indictments to insert Mr. Meene in the indictment? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Upon your oath, did not you know by so doing I could not have him as a witness to-day? - A. I did know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did not you desire him to be indicted for the express purpose of preventing him? - A. I did, because I knew he was a dangerous person and an enemy.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the principal adviser to take this gentleman up? - A. The attorney I employed, considering my loss was so great.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you were not directed by another person? - A. It was my own inclination, it was my own act.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Captain Kenner? - A. Yes; I never heard him called Captain Kenner, but Mr. Kenner; I saw him and several other people, and Mr. Fitzgerald, at the Sessions-house yesterday; Mr. Kenner gave me information that the money was lodged in Gooch's Bank; I went early on Monday, this transaction was on Friday, and I did not hear before Sunday of its being lodged there.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give him permission to take the money away; that you are positive of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you were to advance 13 guineas for 25 men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is just 325 guineas; you had a good deal of other property, and though you had many annuities you were only to lend the gentleman at the bar the sum I have stated that was necessary? - A. I wanted to change my stock.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. To fell off all the money you had in that stock? - A. Yes; there were 150 l. in the 3 per cent. I wanted to put it in the 4 per cent. when I got my money in four days.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did not you say before the Magistrate that you wanted some of it for your own private use? - A. So I did; I did not say I should keep every shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. You have now said; that you wished to transfer it to another stock; how do you reconcile that? - A. I had a quantity of stock to sell, and if I wanted pocket-money, should I not be a great fool not to keep it out of so large a sum as 600 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any agreement with Mr. Foley, before you sold out any stock, that he should return it at any given time? - A. He told me he would return it in four days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day after the money was taken seeing Mr. Meene at your lodgings with excuses for Mr. Foley, that he was gone to London?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040056"></xptr>- A. Mr. Meene called the next day, and the day after, on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that Mr. Meene called to know whether you wished to have a bond or a note for your money, and you refused having a bond or a note; and that you would rely on the honour of Mr. Foley? - A. He did mention the note or bond, but I did not want to make a debt of it; what could I think when I heard the money was in Gooch's Bank, and he had told me it was to raise 25 men, but that it was in the hands of swindlers?</p>
               <p>Q. It was late on Friday when this happened; had you taken any steps before they offered a bond or a note? - A. None at all; I certainly should have given him a day's time for security.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You were afraid, if you made a debt of it, you would lose your money? - A. Yes, because I knew he had been false; he got the money fraudulently to give the men, and there were no men.</p>
               <p>- BROUGHTON sworn. - The prisoner brought notes to the amount of 610 l. he had 10 l. and in consequence left 600 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any of the notes here? - A. No; Bankers generally, when they receive notes, pay them away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. We admit the notes belong to herself.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a very dishonourable thing; it is not a felony; it may be a trick; they are her notes, and it is right she should have them.</p>

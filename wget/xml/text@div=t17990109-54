I went to fetch it out of the stable backwards, and I carried one cask away on my shoulder, and when I went to fetch the second cask, I observed something leak at the bung-hole, as I was rolling it along, and I tasted it and found it was water; then, when I came back, I thought, how the dence could there he brandy there; I turned the head of the cask up, and found a great deal of sand and dirt, as if it had been lying in grease; when I came to clean the top, I found it was a shave to match with the grain of the wood, fixed in like a bung, and a bladder was fixed into the shave, and that went to the head of the cask, and if you tapped that end it was brandy, and if you tapped the other end it was water.</p>
               <p>Q. How much brandy and rum did you find? - A. About half a pint of each in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. How much water was there in each cask? - A. I did not measure it; they delivered them to me as twelve gallon casks; if that was so, there were eleven gallons, seven pints and a half, of water.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any brandy or rum in the same sized casks in the house before? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This is not the first time that you and I have had the pleasure to meet in Courts of Justice before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you live at what was called Ashley's Punch-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't mean to say any thing harsh to you - but I believe you have not a licence for that house at this time? - A. No; I believe you well know it; I wish I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore rum and brandy to be sold in your house would be contrary to law? - A.Certainly.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, upon your oath, at this time, had you no rum or brandy in your house? - A. I might; but not of any such sized casks; I might have a bottle or two, or three; I have a right to keep brandy and rum in the house as well as any other gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, it never happened that either for your own private use, or for sale, you had casks of brandy or rum in your house? - A. Not lately, not these six months I am sure; I perhaps may have had two gallons in a bottle; but I have had none since.</p>
               <p>Q. But I ask you as to casks? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before that time have you had casks of brandy or rum? - A. I believe I had a cask, or I might have casks, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, that all the casks of rum and brandy that you have had before, you paid the King's duty for? - A. I never did before this, buy a drop of smuggled goods in the many hundreds and thousands of gallons that I have sold.</p>
               <p>Q. And so for the first time, never before having bought any, you buy it of two soldiers? - A. I should not then if I had had a licence.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the first time, after having kept houses for the sale of punch and brandy, and those sort of things - how many years? - A.Twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you never bought any brandy, rum, or gin, without paying the duty? - A. That I can safely swear; and if I had, I conceive I am not bound to criminate myself; but I tell you fairly, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are perfectly right, you are a very good lawyer, you understand, perhaps, the term conspiracy, let us try it a little. - When you first saw Trinfield he was alone? - A. He and Mr. Wightman.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Wightman is the gentleman that had the Punch-house before you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not at home when the goods were delivered? - A. No; but I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house might they be deposited? - A. In the chaise-house, behind the house.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a very snug retreat for goods that have not paid the duty? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say they were not covered over? - A. Trinfield and Thompson had covered them over with straw, and shewed them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been often examined in Courts of Justice, I don't say in what character, because that has no business here; but do you mean to say upon your oath, that these were exactly the things put there by the prisoners, you not being present when they were put there? - A.They shewed me that those were the two casks that they had put there; they said, they were the same as the sample, and they were in a hurry, for they had got a great many more to deliver.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a communication from your back premises into Fleet-market? - A. No, that door is nailed up; Mr. Littlemore has those premises to keep fruit in, and he has the key.</p>
               <p>Q. And you never saw these articles from the Friday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090053"></xptr>till the Sunday? - A. I did not remove them till the Sunday, I had seen them very safe under the straw.</p>
               <p>Q. What time on the Sunday did you look at them? - A.Between five and six in the morning; I took care to get up early, because I did not wish any servant or any body else to know it.</p>
               <p>Q. It was as snug and comfortable as could be? - A. If it had been such brandy as the sample was, it would make any body comfortable, for I could not get such fine coniac brandy if I was to give 24s. a gallon for it.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a great many people come to your house? - A. I dine thirty and forty of a day sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. And are obliged to send out for all the liquor that you want? - A. Yes, I send to the Bell-Savage tap for every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. This note you speak of was dated as long ago as March, and made payable to yourself? - A. Yes, I had four of them out, at two, four, six and eight months; those men paid it to the cooper who made the casks for them, and I thought I was not bound to pay the note;I was arrested for it, and it is now to be tried.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever buy brandy so cheap in your life before? - A. Yes, I have bought brandy of Mr. Willey, of Basinghall-street, at ten shillings a gallon.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of such brandy at that time? - A. I should suppose I had it about five shillings a gallon under the price.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that is about six pounds saved? - A. Yes, somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you have no licence, and dine so many people every day, you hold the situation of Serjeant at Mace of the City of London? - A. I certainly hold that place, but I give no securities, and have not done for a long time; I purchased the place, and therefore I have a right to hold it.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you are pretty well acquainted with the laws of your country? - A. I think I am.(Mr. Knapp then addressed the Jury at considerable length on the part of the prisoners). Both <rs id="t17990109-54-verdict310" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. On the 2nd of July, I went into the service of Miss Brodie, in Somerset-street, as ladies'-maid—I was called down to supper that evening—I had two purses in one bag—one was a green purse, containing ten sovereigns—I put it on the dresser as I sat at supper—the prisoner was the housemaid—I went up stairs, leaving her and the cook at the table, and my purse behind—the cook brought my bag up in the evening, and on looking at it, I missed my green purse—I found the pri<lb></lb>soner in the cook's room, and the cook asked her, had she opened the bag—she said, "No; I saw the bag, I did not open it"—I spoke to the ser<lb></lb>vants, that if they had done it out of a joke, and would give it to me, I would say nothing about it—they all denied it—I afterwards told Mr. Brodie, and he got two policemen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the police on the Croydon-railway. I saw the prisoner there on Friday, the 8th of July—she asked for a ticket to go by the rail-road, and paid for it with half-a-sovereign—she afterwards came into the room where I was, and sat down for a few minutes—she then got up, and said she could stand it no longer, she must give herself up to justice—I looked at her—she said, she and her fellow-servant had been implicated in a robbery, that her fellow-servant had broken open a desk, and taken a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and given her half, that be had also taken a green purse from the lady's-maid's bag, which contained ten sovereigns, that he had given her a part of it to take care of, and then burnt the purse—she also said that she had had connexion with him, and likewise that he had had connexion with the cook—she spoke so quick, that, from her manner, I rather suspected she was insane, and, from her persisting in this robbery, I took down two or three of her words, such as the address of Miss Brodie, "19, Somerset-street"—also the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and the ten sovereigns—I told her to wait a little while, intending to put on my coat to hand her over to the police—she then resisted very much, and persisted in not going—I got a fly, and took her to the station—she was exceedingly excited and violent—she said she had been in the family way by her fellow-servant, that he had given her pennyroyal to destroy the child, and the phial would be found in the water-closet.</p>

She repeatedly asked me to go for five sove<lb></lb>reigns that she had left on the top of a Dutch clock, at a turning near the Angel at Islington—I said, "What five sovereigns are you talking of? I don't know what you mean"—she said, "Have I not told you? I thought I had; if I have not told you, I have told somebody else"—I said, "You have not told me"—she said there was five sovereigns where the had slept the night before, that it was part of ten which George, the footman, had stolen—she also said he had stolen a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and there was a "BH" at the corner of it; that he bought a jacket and trowsers with that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, that he pawned the jacket and trowsers, and afterwards gave her 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of it, that made 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and was part of the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she said that some suspicion fell on her, and she was discharged, that she went to reside with George's wife, afterwards, that they used her very badly, add she was determined to implicate him, if she got transported—she was repeatedly talking during the afternoon, and indeed was a state of madness—a man was tent off to town to ascertain if there had been a robbery—I was sent to the house the prisoner mentioned, next day, by the Magistrate, with another constable—the people were out—I left the constable behind—the prisoner went with us—she gave a wrong direction of the house at first, but afterwards went and showed us the house—nothing was found on the prisoner but two penny-pieces.</p>

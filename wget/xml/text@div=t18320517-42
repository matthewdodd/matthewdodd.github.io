The prisoner was lately in my service; I considered him honest; I got him a situation, and from what I heard from the gentleman he went to, I found out this; I had seen this property safe in my window, and missed two or three pairs of spurs from there on the 16th of April; I do not know whether the prisoner came to London on that day; but I found I was robbed, and during his absence I had the stable searched, but found nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you obtain from him information of what he had taken, in consequence of your offering to forgive him? A. I made the proposition to him, but he would not tell me of any - I found a great number of things; I knew I was robbed, and I had some of my men searched; I considered the prisoner rather as a check upon them - I have no doubt but that he is reclaimable.</p>
               <p>JAMES GRIFFITHS. I am a constable. I took the prisoner on the 16th of April, and found on him this pair of spurs and a comb; I found one pair of spurs in the stable, between the tiles and the sky-light.</p>
               <p>GEORGE JAY. The prisoner came to live with me from the prosecutor, who gave him a most excellent character; I detained one pair of spurs of his, which I have here.</p>

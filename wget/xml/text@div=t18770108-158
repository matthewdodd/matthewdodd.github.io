He contended that the fad of its being an affidavit used in the course of legal proceedings was an important element of objection, as it would not admit of contradiction or cross-examination at the time it was used, and it was therefore deprived of the protection which would be accorded to a mere statement; he had never before heard a matter of this kind contended for, and he submitted that it was not evidence.

"I really cannot distinguish this from an ordinary case of a letter which is brought to the knowledge of a person who has read and considered it, and who deals with particular parts of it. As to those particular parts, it is quite clear they could not be excluded, and I do not see how one part can be excluded and the other part admitted.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 5, Jermyn Street, St. James's—Mr. James Passmore, chemist, of 82, King's Road, Chelsea, is a client of mine—on 26th November he came to me about purchasings business—he came a second time with a letter—on 27th November Budget and Brown called together at my office; they had previously made an appointment—Brown produced the lease of the premises—47, Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square, also an assignment on parchment of one Griffith to Appleby—they are not here, they were either left at the police-court or they are at my office; if they are there I can fetch them—Brown did not produce a memorandum of deposit of the bill of sale; he told me that he had a memorandum of deposit; I did not ask him to produce it then, but I did ask him to produce the bill of sale; he said he had it not with him; I asked him why, and he handed me some document which showed me that an interpleader was going on; it was a receipt for money paid into Court—on looking at that I said if there was no difficulty about it, Appleby and Brown could make a title together, but I should want Appleby present—Budgett replied that he would not attend—I said "Then you need not go any further; you need not put my client to any further expense"—I said to Brown if he had a legal mortgage we could have done without Appleby—they then left and I did not expect to see them again that day, because I insisted on Appleby being present to execute any deed that might be wanted—I don't think Brown said anything</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187701080013"></xptr>
               <p>when I said if he had a legal mortgage we could have done without Appleby—Budget assured me, in Brown's presence, that there was no chance of Appleby being bankrupt, and it was that which brought up my remark that in that case we could take a title from Brown without Appleby—I asked how much was owing; I don't recollect what Brown said, but it was at least 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than Passmore was to have given—later in the day, about 3 o'clock, Brown and Budgett came—to my office, quite contrary to my expectation, and brought the bill of sale—Passmore was with me in my private office, and I went to them in the clerks' office, where Brown handed me this bill of sale, dated 2nd July, 1874, that was the date outside, I did not look within—I took it into my private office and was proceeding to make some extracts when my clerk brought in a message that Brown wanted to see me—I then went into the clerks' office to Brown and he said he could not wait any longer, and he did not intend me to make extracts from it; I said "Then if you will not allow me to do it, you must send me an abstract in the usual way," and I gave him the bill of sale back—he said he was trying to oblige me—I said I supposed he was wanting to sell the place; he said he did not care about it; I said if it went on he must send me the abstract in the usual way—at that time no other document than the bill of sale was produced—on 4th December Budget left the bill of sale in my absence, and on 5th December Brown called alone, he then said that he had a legal mortgage—I said I should proceed no further with the business until I had a copy of both legal and equitable mortgages—he did not say anything to that, he went away, he did not say whether or not he would send them—on 8th December I received a copy of the legal mortgage with two equitable mortgages—these are them, they were either left at the police-court or are at my office—I don't know how they came to me; I know that they did come to my office by the entry in my diary—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the documents, copies of which were sent to me. (<hi rend="italic">These three documents were put in and read, the first was dated</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">and was a memorandum of deposit by Appleby to Brown of the lease of</hi> 47, <hi rend="italic">Mortimer Street, as security, witnessed by Budget; the second was a legal mortgage, dated November</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1874; <hi rend="italic">and the third dated</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st December</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">was a mortgage from Appleby to Brown.</hi>) On 5th December I first heard of the legal mortgage—I had never heard of the other two documents—I saw Budget on or about 10th December, and after Borne conversation with him Brown called again; he then inquired how the matter stood; I replied that I had heard of bankruptcy proceedings being taken against Appleby, and that I could not go on any further with it until they were got rid of, that if they were got rid of my client would resume negotiations at some future time if he had not already met with some other business—I don't think I saw him again before 21st December; he then called and told me that Appleby had been adjudicated bankrupt and asked for the copies that he had sent me, which I then returned, having previously had copies made of them—after the bankruptcy I acted for Mr. Passmore in purchasing the business from the trustee—I don't recollect what was given for it; if I have to fetch the other documents I can bring the deed with me—my experience of stamps is not that the document of 6th November is the only paper on which the stamp was impressed on the paper before it was written on that—the documents of 27th April and 1st December had their stamps impressed on them after being written; we know that you may buy impressed stamps,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187701080014"></xptr>
               <p>in fact stationers generally keep them in stock, impressed as this is, unless there has been any recent alteration—it does not follow that this was stamped before it was executed—when I was examined before I thought the red stamp was put on after the paper was written, but I have found since that I am continually sending documents to be stamped, and I find that these pink stamps are put on them before they are executed—up to a certain amount they stamp the documents while the persons wait, and they have a pink stamp similar to this—the date is put on whether the stamp is put on before or after execution, showing the day they are stamped.</p>

I have an old stamp," or an old bill stamp, or something to that effect, to Mr. Brown, that was after I had offered to let them have the old stamp I had if it was of any service, as it was no use to me—all I know is that I heard a something about their being got out, and the only way they could be got out was by an old stamp or something; I can't say who said that, whether it was Brown or Brain—Brown said that he had made 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of one old stamp, that was when I offered my old stamp—Brown thanked me, and said he had got some, and had sold one for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I heard Appleby's name mentioned, and something about the brokers, I really can't tell you what it was; it was a broken conversation—it was a very long room—I was sitting near the door, and Brown and Brain were at the other end of the room, and since I had a cold, I have been a little deaf—I heard a portion of the con<lb></lb>versation; I heard the brokers or sheriff mentioned—I heard nothing else particular that I remember—I don't know that I heard anything more—<hi rend="italic">I.</hi> won't pledge myself to it; it does not strike me just at present; if you will ask me anything I will try and remember—I was examined before the Magistrate.</p>

I am a surgeon, and live at 46, Great Marlborough Street—in consequence of an advertisement in the "Telegraph "I sent a letter in October, 1874, to 260, Tottenham Court Road, and afterwards went to the premises and found a chemist's business carried on there—the name of Appleby was over the door—I saw Budget there; after two or three days I saw Appleby there, he talked on general business, and said I could deal with Mr. Budget—I negotiated the purchase of the business with Budget, and saw him from time to time on the subject—an arrange was made that I was to buy the business for 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the arrangement was finally settled on 24th October, 1874; and this cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given on that day; on the same day these three bills of exchange were given, one for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at one month, accepted by me at Martin's, my bankers endorsed by Appleby and Budget, and afterwards by Brown; that was paid on maturity, on 27th November—I gave it to Budget—the bills were brought to me ready prepared and I signed them; another bill is for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at three months, accepted and endorsed in the same way, and the other for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at six months—the two last were met by me before maturity, I think in January—they were in Brown's hands when I paid them—I don't remember when I gave this cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 10th November; both these are my cheques, dated 10th and 17th November respectively—I forget whether I parted with them at the same time as the acceptances, I have no memorandum, but I think I exchanged them, I think I gave one large cheque and then altered it and gave the two cheques and got back the one—the final payment was made by me on the cheque on 16th November; and on that day I accepted this bill for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I destroyed the large cheque after I got it back, it was for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I forget which—very likely the two cheques for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the bill for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were given in exchange for that large cheque, but I really can't say positively, the lost bill for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

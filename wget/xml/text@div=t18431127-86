                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the 9th of Oct., at ten minutes to twelve o'clock at night, I heard a cry of police from No. 9, Plough-court, where the prisoner lived—I ran into the house, and found the prisoner there lying on his back on the bed with his throat cut—his wife was there with a child in her arms, and she said he had stabbed the child likewise—I examined the child, and found a cut on its left breast—he said he hoped it would die, and said that distress had <hi rend="italic">drove</hi> him to it—I understood him to say in the confusion that the child was a cripple, but it appears he said he himself was</p>

               <p>a cripple, and could not get a living—he is a cripple—he has had a paralytic stroke—I got him up off the bed, got his clothes on, and got him down to the London Hospital as quick as possible—I got this knife which I produce from Isabella Humble, when I first went to the room—the prisoner seemed very weak, and very much agitated in his mind—he fell down twice on the bed, and bled very much—the mother brought the child down to the hospital at the time we took the prisoner there.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodged with the prisoner's wife. I understood he was in the Union workhouse—he came home on the Saturday afternoon before this happened, and was sitting at tea with his wife and children when I came home in the evening—I went out about nine o'clock on Monday morning, and re<lb></lb>turned about seven in the evening—the prisoner then had his two children—the boy Henry was across his lap, and the little one between his knees—he was sighing for about a quarter of an hour, and then he asked if I could lend him a penknife to mend a pen—I told him I could lend him one, but I was fearful my son had spoiled it, but as it was I would lend it, and I gave it him—he opened it, looked at the blades, and said they were very dull, but he would sharpen it—there were two blades—he shut the knife, and put it into his pocket—he used to behave particularly kind to his children—his wife came in shortly after—he said to her, "Ann, this child will not trouble you long," meaning Henry—he spoke of that child—she said she had thought so a long time—the child had been consumptive for a long time—it was about six years old—he asked her if she would give him a stone to sharpen the knife upon—I believe his eldest son gave him the stone—I saw him sharpen the knife upon the stone—he afterwards went and laid across the bed, while his wife and children had their supper—they had sausages—there were some put away for the prisoner, but he did not have any—they went to bed, I think, about ten o'clock—I slept in the same room that night—somewhere about twelve o'clock I heard the child Henry cry very loud—the prisoner's wife said, "Michael, what are you doing to the child?" and she said, "My God, he has killed my child!"—I did not hear the prisoner speak, there was such confusion in the room from the wife and children screaming—the wife said the child was stabbed, and, before I could call the police, the prisoner began to cut his own throat—his wife screamed out that he was cutting his own throat—I went and called for the police—I afterwards looked at the child, and saw blood on its shirt, but did not take particular notice of the wounds—I did not see the knife again till I saw it in the policeman's hand at the hospital—the prisoner had asked me on the Sunday if I bad such a thing as a penknife to lend him—I told him I had—I did not lend it him on that Sunday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospi<lb></lb>tal. I remember the prisoner and the child being brought into the hospital—the prisoner was in a very agitated state—he had a wound across the front of his neck, about three inches long—I cannot say whether it had bled much—there was not much blood about it—it was not dangerous—the child had a small punctured wound close to the left nipple—I could not tell how deep it was—I did not probe it—it appeared slight—there was only one wound—I thought there was danger in the first instance, but there were no symptoms indicative</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184311270073"></xptr>
               <p>of danger afterwards—no bad symptoms came on—the prisoner inquired if the child was dead—I said it was not—he said he wished, or hoped, it was, I do not recollect which—he inquired if his own wound was likely to prove fatal—I replied I thought not—he said he hoped he might die before morning—I ordered a strait waistcoat to be put on him, to prevent him doing himself any further injury, as I had received information from the police that he had attempted to enlarge the wound by inserting his finger—the child got well—it was in the hospital about a fortnight—the wound was such as might be pro<lb></lb>duced by the blade of a small knife like this.</p>

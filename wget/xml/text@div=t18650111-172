I was a seaman on board the Killingwood steam ship—on 14th December, I was in Albert-street, Shadwell—I went to see Elizibeth Turner—I went up stairs to bid Martha good-night, and saw the prisoner just inside the room—he said something, but I do not know what he did, because I was drunk, but I felt something afterwards—I went down stairs, and said, "I am stabbed"—my drawers and trousers were all over</p>

                  </hi>. I am unfortunate, and live at 13, Albert-street, Shadwell—I was sitting in the parlour with a person named Mills between 12 and 1 o'clock when the prisoner came—the prosecutor was very drunk; the prisoner was not so drunk—he remained with me about five minutes, and went up stairs—no one was with him—I heard a shout, and heard the prosecutor say, "Where are you, Martha?"—the prisoner said, "What do you want here in my room?"—I heard the prisoner say that he would push the prosecutor down stairs—I took a candle and went up stairs to fetch the prosecutor—I do not exactly know whether there was a light burning up stairs—when I got up, I saw the prisoner draw this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from his right side and thrust it at the prosecutor, who was standing by the fire<lb></lb>place, saying, "Do you see this?"—I caught hold of his left arm to stop him from doing it, and he knocked the candle from my hand as he tried to swing me off his arm—I said, "Do not do that; do not make a noise in the house—I ran down immediately and called the police—there was no other man in the room—the prisoner ran down stairs, and pushed me out at the street-door as he made his escape—Martha Kelsey had come into the house with him about half-past 12, but she went out before this happened—I afterwards saw blood coming from Smith's clothes—he had come in to wish me good-night—I had only drank two pints of ale between Mary Mills and myself—I was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house-surgeon to the London Hospital—on 15th December, about 1 o'clock, the prosecutor was admitted there—he had two stabs; one on the left side of the chest, penetrating to the ribs, and the other in the abdomen, penetrating into its cavity—this knife would produce them—he was in danger, but is quite well now—the fat of the abdomen protruded through the wound.</p>

She did not say anything about it. They came up to rob me; they knew I had money in my pocket. Two of them came in at 12.30, and I said, 'This is no time to come in my room,' and they called me an Italian son of a bitch. I said to the girl, 'If you like to stop, I'll go out;' then one of the chaps squared at me. I said, 'You are two, I am only by myself; I cannot fight you.' Then I fought with the prosecutor, and the other jumped on top of</p>

               <p>me. Then I began to defend myself with the knife, and they tried to rob me of my watch and chain. The chain was broken in two pieces. One of the men ran away, and I went home, and in the morning the policeman came and took me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live at Ratcliff-highway. On Tuesday, the 19th of April, I was the first person up—I got up a little before seven o'clock—it had been light for some time—I have a niece at my house, my wife, and myself, but no servants—I had gone to bed at half-past ten o'clock, and my lodger came in a little before eleven o'clock—I heard him come in after I was in bed—he a Key—I know he shut the door, because I found it locked next morning—when I came down, I found the parlour window open, which looks into the yard, and the escrutoire drawers drawn out—the yard leads to a wharf—the window was only thrown up—it had been shut down the night before, but not fastened—it had no shutters to it—I missed a suit of clothes, my wife's cloak, and &amp; child's frock from the drawers—I have a slight knowledge of Sullivan, by sight—I do not know where I have seen him, but I am certain I have seen him before—this is my wife's cloak (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday, the 19th of April, I saw the prisoner and four or five more, standing with them, about a quarter or twenty minutes to one o'clock at night, at the corner of New Gravel-lane, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's premises—I knew them both before—I ordered them to go on, and not stand there—they went away—the prisoners went in the direction for Mr. Fryer's house—on the Saturday following, the 23rd, I saw Sullivan in High-street, Shadwell, between twelve and one o'clock in the middle of the night, walking along with another man, who I did not then know—I followed them—they went into a night-house—I followed them, and there was the prisoner Sullivan, the other man, two or three girls of the town, a coachman, and some other person; Sullivan was standing up, and I think drinking when I went in, I told him, when he had drank what he had got there, I should want him to go with me—I did not say what for—he staid a few minutes, and then asked me if I meant to take him, I said I did; he said he would be d—d if I should take him—I called in two policeman, whom I had left at the door, and took him; as I went to the station-house, he asked me what I had taken him for—I told him I would tell him when I got to the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About one or two o'clock on Tuesday night, on the 19th of March, Monday, an officer, who is ill, called me to him—I went with him to Juniper-row, Shadwell—there is a wooden bridge that goes over a rope ground, and under the arch of that bridge I saw Monday pick up this cloak—in consequence of a noise made by a dog I went about, and afterwards came back to near the same place—I heard footsteps on the bridge, and saw it was the prisoner Adams coming down the steps of the bridge, and he turned to where Monday had taken the cloak from—the bridge is about 200 yards from Fryer's—when he saw us he started, and went on one side for a particular purpose—he began to unbutton a portion of his dress, and pretended to sit down—I did not take him at that time—I left Monday there and went on the bridge—I there saw Sullivan—I knew him before by sight—I said, "What do you do waiting here?"—he said he was waiting for a young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> who had just gone down to ease himself—I then asked were he was going—he said home—I asked him where he came from—he said, from Vinegar-lane—that is not near the prosecutor's—Monday then came up with Adams, and Adams called out loudly, "We have been to the Pavilion, that is where we have come from"—he had been near enough to her me question Sul<lb></lb>livan—the Pavilion is not near Vinegar-lane—Sullivan was near enough to hear him say this—I followed Sullivan and kept close to him for nearly one hundred yards, and then he suddenly gave me a kick on the ancle, and said, "B—if I will go with you though"—he ran away down Shad<lb></lb>well-market—I sprang my rattle, and called, "Stop thief"—he outran me—I went back, and Adams was secured by Monday, and was taken to the station-house—Osman afterwards apprehended Sullivan, and sent for me.</p>

            . I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, on a Saturday night in November, about an hour after they were taken away; the prisoner was taken up on the Monday following, when she owned she had taken them, and took me to Mr. Rotchford's, a pawnbroker, where we found them.</p>

            . I took in these stays and petticoat of the prisoner at the bar [producing the stays deposed to by the prosecutrix.]</p>
               <p>Q. What account did the prisoner give of herself when she brought them ?</p>
               <p>Rotchford. She said she had but just taken them out from another place, and was obliged to pledge them again.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she bring them?</p>
               <p>Rotchford. On the 17th of November, just about candle lighting.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>A young man and woman lived at the prosecutor's house, up three pair of stairs; they quarrelled and parted, and he cut her cloaths to pieces. He desired me to come and make it up between them. I went, and staid drinking there till about ten o'clock at night. Having drank plentifully, going out of the room, saw the lace of the stay hang down upon the stairs; I laid hold of it, and down came the stay and petticoat with it. I took them up, put them into my apron, and took them away. She came to me afterwards, and I owned where they were.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The pawnbroker would not let me see the petticoat, except I would first pay the money it was pawned for.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Rotchford, your shop should be open to all customers; this is a misbehaviour; you ought to shew people their goods when they come for them.</p>

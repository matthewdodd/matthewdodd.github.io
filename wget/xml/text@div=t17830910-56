               <p>I am a Marshal's man, I went to this house, Mr. Hatton went first, as I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100087"></xptr> known, the outward door was on the latch, I lifted up the latch and went into the passage and down into the kitchen, when we got into the kitchen, we saw Mr. Moore standing by the dresser, and these three basons and that pipkin were standing much the same as they do now, upon the dresser, about three or four feet from the vice, in one of the basons I saw Mr. Dixon take out several shillings that seemed to be in pickle, I saw him put them into paper, he bid me look at them, which I did; looking a little further, we saw a woman's gown lie on the dresser, the body flat and the tail part covered over it, and lifting up the tail we found a parcel of shillings finished, fit for uttering; Mr. Dixon took them up: While Mr. Dixon was standing at the dresser, he desired Mr. Hatton and me to examine the prisoners, and see how their hands were; the man's hands seemed to be sandy, the woman's hands appeared as if she had been polishing.</p>
               <p>Court. What appearance does that give? - Rather a yellowish hue, after I had done that, I went into the vault adjoining to the kitchen, there I found a cutting press with a fly upon it, also a cutter in it, which is in now, (the press produced) Mr. Dixon found the files; there were two small quantities of filings, which I found over where the vices were fixed, and two bottles, one stood on the shelf over the dresser.</p>
               <p>Where was the man standing? - Near the dresser in the kitchen, he appeared to have been at work.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. When you came there, you apprehended the prisoners knew your face, did you not? - I knew if they did not, the neighbours did.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing like the appearance of resistance after you appeared? - No, Sir, they behaved very decently and very well, whether the woman pushed Mr. Hatton, I cannot say, but she held the door in her hand.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the clock or watch-making branch? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing more of the coining business, than you do of the watch-making business? - I do not.</p>
               <p>You found some powders in a paper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know nothing of these powders, only they are powder? - Yes, I conceive they are filings from base coin.</p>
               <p>You think, but you have already declared you do not know the nature of base coin, do you know them to be so? - I say, I apprehend them to be so.</p>
               <p>Do you know the difference between the filings of base metal, and the filings of a watch and clock? - I think I do.</p>
               <p>Did you see any watch-work; or any clock-work about the dresser? - I believe there was some part of a watch upon the dresser, it appeared as if it had been brought in to be compleated, but had not been meddled with.</p>
               <p>Did you see a clock face? - There was an alarm stood upon a shelf, but it seemed to be very dirty.</p>
               <p>Respecting that instrument, do you know any thing of that instrument; you know these instruments are applied to many other purposes? - I cannot say, I have heard that they have been applied to many other purposes.</p>
               <p>Now as to these phials, they are in the same state? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing of this kind, that it was acquafortis, and that it should be acquafortis? - I said then, that if ever I saw acquafortis in my life that was acquafortis, I believe them were the express words.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any phrase to this purport, that it should be acquafortis? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. There has been no alteration in the liquor? - None at all, I have particularly kept them in my own possession, under lock and key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Do you know any thing of the application of acquafortis any further than by hearsay? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the button-making business? - I never made a button in my life.</p>
               <p>Then that instrument might be applied to the purpose of cutting out shapes for buttons as well as for shillings? - I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100088"></xptr> this to say, that I am sure the shillings were cut out from that.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the appearance of button tops are like them or not? - The button tops, I believe, are not so thick as that.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Did the prisoners appear to be about any watch-making work? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with Catchpole and the other officer, to this place in Green-harbour-court, we opened the door and went in, there was a little girl in the parlour, we went down stairs in the kitchen, we found Mrs. Moore with the door in her hand just opened, and we rushed into the kitchen and found Mr. Moore standing near the dresser, I saw the three basons stand by him, and the sand in the tin shovel, I then put my hand into the white bason, and I found some blanks that were not finished, they were quite dirty. (Produced.) I then ordered the constables to tie the man and his wife together, and put them at the further side of the room away from these things, and they sat down, and I searched further, and the first thing I found was these three shillings, on the ledge of the dresser; Catchpole saw me, I found that shilling partly rubbed, but not so much as the other; in searching further there was a gown lay on the dresser, I lifted up the tail of the gown, and there were eighty shillings, which I found finished, I believe there wants one now in the examination, I lost one somehow; those shillings all appeared just finished; and in the different basons I believe there was water, and sand and water, I do not know exactly what was in the white bason; Mr. Clarke will tell you that; I found the corks and things laying on the bench, near to where Mr. Moore stood, and the files likewise, and some filings, and corks, and scowering-paper, and weights and scales, and a crucible; I found the finished shillings in the body of the gown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Do you know any thing of the use of that kind of press? - I have produced many in this Court.</p>
               <p>Are those presses used in any other operation, similar to that of cutting out blanks for base metal? - They may.</p>
               <p>Do you, or do you not know? - I do not, they are used in button making.</p>
               <p>Are they in watch making? - I dare say they may; that press appeared to me to have been used by some person or other at the time it was fixed, in cutting out base metal, such as these shillings, there were some little bits of the metal about, but they were in the niches of the press, that we could not get at them.</p>
               <p>Base metal is applied to other purpose? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Did you observe the hands, of these people? - I did, I examined them, Mr. Moor's hands appeared to be all over sand, the same sand that is in that shovel appeared to be on his hands, the sand was wet; the woman's hands were dirty, but not so dirty as her husband's, I I suppose her business was to be taking them out of the water, and putting them between the cloth and drying them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Would not the hands of persons employed in scowering of brasses or in clock work have that kind of appearance? - If they had been making use of that kind of sand it might.</p>
               <p>Is not sand used in other business besides that? - No doubt of that.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You have been concerned about fifteen years I believe for the mint? - Pretty near Sir.</p>
               <p>You have attended I believe many times in this Court on prosecutions for coining? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Tell the process? - From the casting or from the time they are cut out of the cutter.</p>
               <p>Look at this and tell us? - These are all cut out and afterwards struck up with afaint dye made on purpose to strike up a faint impression; first they have the metal flatted to the size, but this is not what is used in it.</p>
               <p>(The metal shewn him.)</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100089"></xptr>That is plated that cannot be it, after the metal is flatted out it is cut out with a press, and every turning round it forces out one piece, next they are made round with a file and scowered.</p>
               <p>(The filings shewn him.)</p>
               <p>I have not a doubt but these have been filed from the edges of those; if you break one of the shillings you will find it to be the same colour.</p>
               <p>Court. What are your reasons? - Where there is a body of silver and metal the silver is purged by aquae fortis, it throws out the silver on the outside on the surface; these in the bason have been thrown into the aquae fortis, but they want the scowering of sand.</p>
               <p>Court. Are there any particular files made use of? - No, you may use any file or any scowering paper; they fine it with corks, all fine work of all sorts, must be either rubbed with a cork or a stick.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alderman Hart. Did you ever find any instance that people in this business have had their outward door open? - I should think they would be more discreet, but it is possible for people to have it open for a deception; the last coiner that was tried here, his cellar door where the press was, was open, and he was in the garret; this in the phial is weak aquae fortis, in the basons is sand and water; the aquae fortis being a strong body it turns it black, but being rubbed with sand it takes off the blackness and leaves the white behind.</p>
               <p>Court. Is this apparatus compleat? - Yes, except wanting the dyes that strike up the impression.</p>
               <p>In the making of silver with the cutting out press in this manner, how much could they make tale in a day? - It is impossible to tell, they could make thirty or forty pounds of shillings if they had the silver, they can cut five hundred weight a day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You have given your evidence with great candour as you always do; did not you attend the trial of Beeby in Surry? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>You said a good deal of the uses of the fly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe you know enough of button making and other machanick arts, to know that every one of these articles are used for other purposes, are they not? - Sometimes they are and sometimes they are not.</p>
               <p>Court. Distinguish? - I do not know any business where sand and water, or aquae fortis is used, without it is to add to the colour, where there is counterfeit metal used, it requires something to add to the colour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You are well informed in the business; is not aquae fortis used for other purposes as well as for coining? - It is used in a number of businesses, brass founders use it very particularly, they cannot lacker their work till it is cleansed by this, it only cleanses it, it does not cover it; you cannot gild any thing without aquae fortis.</p>
               <p>Now as to that instrument it is applied to many other purposes is it not? - Not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>It is applied in the button and watch, and clock manufactures, is it not? - I believe little in clocks; it may be in watches.</p>
               <p>But in button making it is? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Are you sufficiently acquainted with button making to know whether that instrument is used in button making? - If a number of people were here who knew the nature of button making, I should tell them that no man (though I am bold enough to say it in this Court) knows the nature of button making better than myself.</p>
               <p>Instruments of that kind are employed in cutting out shapes for buttons? - Not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Is not that instrument employed in six, seven, or eight, other branches of mechanism? - I should suppose it is.</p>
               <p>As far as you know there were no dies found there? - I have not seen any, or else I should have said so.</p>
               <p>Court. These blanks have been made shillings, though by another process? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. What connection<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100090"></xptr> has Beeby with these people? - None that I know of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, and five in East-street, Red Lion-square. On the 3rd of April, about one o'clock in the morning, I was in Holborn—the prisoner and another female joined me—they asked me to go with them to a house, which I refused—they then asked me to give them something to drink—I took them to a house, and gave them a glass of wine, and I had a glass of brandy—the other female left me—I was going towards my own house through a mews leading to Bedford-row, and felt a hand in my pocket, where I had three sovereigns and a half, and some silver—I found something was gone—I caught hold of the prisoner's hand, and accused her of robbing me—she denied it—I took her under a lamp, and found that I had but one sovereign and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left—I said she had taken two sovereigns and a half and some silver from me—she said she bad not—I took her towards Theobald's-road, to see for a policeman, and saw her stoop and put something in the corner of a dung-heap—I ac<lb></lb>cused her of it—she-said she had not—I left a mark on the place, took her to the corner, and gave charge of her—I then went back to the place, and under the dung the officer found two sovereigns and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

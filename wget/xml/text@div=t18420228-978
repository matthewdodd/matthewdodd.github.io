                  </hi>. I am cashier in the Provident Institution for sav<lb></lb>ings in St. Martin's-place, established by an Act of Parliament, which I pro<lb></lb>duce. Lord Dynevor is president and one of the trustees—there are several others—Lord Dynevor is not aware of this prosecution, but several of the trustees are, and the managers generally have sanctioned and authorized it—on Saturday, the 29th of January, Coleman came to the bank, repre<lb></lb>sented himself to be Philip Smith, a depositor in the institution, and ap<lb></lb>plied for payment of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when I called out "Philip Smith," Cole man stood before me, and answered to that name—it is necessary, in order for depositors to get out their money, to produce their book at the bank<lb></lb>here is the genuine book of Philip Smith—Coleman produced it, and when I saw it, I called out the name of "Philip Smith," to identify the portly with whom I had to transact the business, and Coleman answered to that name—I filled up a receipt for the money to be paid, and handed it to Cole<lb></lb>man to sign—he first signed "Smith" only—I told him it was necessary to sign both names, and returned it to him, requesting him to add Philip to it—he then signed "Philip," and returned it to me signed "Philip smith"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184202280095"></xptr>
               <p>—I compared that signature with the original signature of Philip Smith, which be had given in to our institution when he deposited the money—I have that book here—on making the comparison, I was not satisfied with the identity of the handwriting, and I asked him if his name was Philip Smith—he replied that it was—I felt satisfied that he was not Philip Smith—I then cautioned him, told him my suspicions, and that if he persisted in stating that he was Philip Smith, and it turned out he was not, he would get him<lb></lb>self into trouble, at the same time I said, "What is your name?<hi rend="italic"></hi>"—he re<lb></lb>plied, "Philip Smith"—I said, "And the money belongs to you?"—he said, "Yes"—I spoke to Mr. Boodle, the comptroller, my superior, then took the receipt, and requested the prisoner to accompany me to Mr. Boodle, who was in an adjoining room—I stated my suspicions to him, but perhaps Coleman might not have heard me—I produce the book which has Philip Smith's writing in it.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever see two handwritings more unlike than these two? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was that which excited my suspicions—I find that the prisoner Smith has lived with Mr. Drummond, the banker, and I believe with Mr. Biddulph, and also with a Mr. Seaton, in the Adelphi—I did not see Smith outside the institution—he was not taken into custody—he was committed from the police-court—Mr. Twyford, the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate, considered him as a party concerned, and committed him accord<lb></lb>ingly—I should say it was the act of the Magistrate more than any thing—the interest is paid, as a matter of course—Coleman did not ask for it—he asked at persons usually do—he said nothing, but answered to the name of Philip Smith, and produced the book—I understand the prisoners are brothers—they were said to be brothers at first, because Coleman gave his name as George Smith, and passed himself off as such, and I rather think be was committed under that name—I believe, he represented himself as George Smith—I did not hear him—I think the Magistrate committed the prisoners for forgery—it might be for conspiracy—I cannot tell which it was—when money is all taken out of the Bank, we generally return the books to the depositors—many leave their books behind them—this book was never asked for back again, as the money was not paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the book had not been returned to him, supposing you had paid him, could you ever have lost any thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, parties losing their books can obtain a duplicate—I thought it right to keep the book under the circumstances—if I had paid Coleman, Smith could have applied again for another book, which we should have given him, and we might have had to pay the money twice.</p>

               <p>name—he said his name was Philip Smith—I put that question to him two or three times distinctly—I did not call his attention to the original signature-book—I merely called his attention to the place of residence out of it—I said the writing was very dissimilar, and his answers were very unsatisfactory, I certainly should not feel justified in ordering the money to be paid to him, unless some respectable person could identify him as being the true depositor—I asked whom he knew in the neighbourhood—he said, "Mr. Drummond"—I asked what Mr. Drummond, whether it was one of the firm at Charing-cross—he said, "Yes, Mr. George Drummond"—he said he had lived with him—knowing where Mr. Drummond lived, I asked where it was—he said he could not tell me, he did not know, he only remained with him one night—I then asked him whether it was in a street or a square—he could not give any answer to that—I said I did not wish to delay him, if he was the right depositor, in the receipt of the money, but I should feel it necessary to send him to Mr. Drummond, to see if he could identify him—I sent John Martin, our constable, with him for that purpose—they returned in a very short time, and Martin told me, in his presence, that he had confessed that he was not Philip Smith, and that he did not live with Mr. Drummond—I said, "Is that the case?—Coleman said, "Yes"—I said, "Am I to understand, then, that you are not the depositor?"—he said he was not, but his brother was—I asked him what his name was—he said, "George Smith"—I said, under all the circumstances, I must send him to the police-office to account for it—be then said his brother had sent him, and his brother was outside—Martin then went away with him—he came back again very soon after, accom<lb></lb>panied by the prisoner Smith, and said he had brought the brother back—I asked Smith if Coleman was his brother—he said, yes, that he had sent him in to receive the money—I asked Smith why he did not come in to receive it himself—he said he did not like—he gave me no other reason, than that—he said he was not aware he was doing any harm—the money had been deposited very nearly two years—I then said he had got his bro<lb></lb>ther into a very serious <hi rend="italic">scrape,</hi> that I should send him in charge for the forgery, and that he might attend at Bow-street, to explain the matter as he could—I did not give Smith into custody—he was not given into cus<lb></lb>tody at all—the Magistrate called on them both to find bail, but not on the first occasion—there was only one prisoner at first, and that was Cole<lb></lb>man—he was remanded from Saturday till the Wednesday following—he was brought up on the Wednesday—Smith then attended voluntarily—it was on a subsequent occasion that the Magistrate called on him to find bail.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>remand—between the first and third remands I made inquiries to see whether Smith was the party whom Coleman represented him to be—I beard a very good character of him from Mr. Drummond, for the short time he lived with him—I also inquired of Mr. Biddulph, but did not find his character so satisfactory there—I should say it was not good—Mr. Biddulph only said he did not feel satisfied with him—he did not enter into particulars—he made no complaint against his honesty—it did not seem to amount to that—he said he was a boy of bad temper—I in<lb></lb>quired of Mr. Seaton, and found his character was good there—I told the Magistrate that Coleman gave the name of George Smith—I believe information was given against him, as George Smith, and the depositions were taken against him in that name—he went by that name on the two first occasions, and on the third occasion, I found out that his name was Coleman—I have the letter in my pocket, which first informed me that his name was Coleman—the Magistrate recommended me to charge Smith with conspiring with Coleman to defraud the institution-r-Smith was dressed much the same as be is now—I cannot tell whether he had on the same clothes—be was certainly not in a tagged state—it has been the opinion of some persons that this proceeding arose more out of the ignorance of the prisoners than any thing else, but I can hardly reconcile that in my own mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether Coleman was the person who gave the notice for withdrawing the money the week before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is no means of saying that for certain—the notice must have been given—Smith said he had employed Coleman to give the notice, and that he thought the same man was to go and receive the money.</p>

             were in the shop, about eleven o'clock; the prisoner came into the shop with another man-there were four or five customers in the shop at the time. The prisoner asked for some brass wire. There were six eye-glasses on the counter, near to where he was - I had packed them up about an hour before; I was serving other customers - I told the prisoner I would wait on him when I had done with them. I turned my head, saw the parcel safe, and kept serving my customers. In about five minutes I missed one of the parcels. I immediately went to Edward Walker, and told him-the man who came in with the prisoner went out of the shop. Mr. Walker told me to follow him - I brought him back. Mr. Walker asked him if he had seen any thing of the parcel on the counter? he said he had not, and would be searched - He went away. The prisoner waited there sometime - I suspected him. Mr. Walker said, it must be one of them, as they were close to it, and asked the prisoner if he had any objection to be searched? he said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181804010019"></xptr>had not. Mr. Walker put his hand into his great-coat pocket, and pulled them out. They are worth more than 6s. - they sell for 1s. 3d. each.</p>

            . I am a watch-tool-maker, in partnership with James Walker. I saw the prisoner and another man at the counter; the other man put his hand behind a clock-case, which made me suspect them. I went to the bottom of the shop; Burton came and said that he missed the glasses, and suspected one of them-the other man went out-he was brought back; nothing was found on him. I found the six eye-glasses in the prisoner's great-coat pocket-he had his hand on that pocket. I took him to the office.</p>

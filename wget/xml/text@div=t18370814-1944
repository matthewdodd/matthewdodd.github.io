                  </hi>. I am a master shoemaker. The prisoner was in my employ—I had reason to suspect him on the 4th of August, and I asked if he knew of any irons that were in my seat-drawer—he said "No"—there was nothing more passed—in consequence of information from my boy's father, I took an officer and searched his room—I knew that he lodged there, because the boy that worked with me lodged in the same place—I found there these articles and these shoes—these are my property—journeymen do not take home these articles to work.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, Lockwood's-gardens, Clerkenwell. On Tuesday afternoon, the 31st of Dec, I was passing along Red Cross-street, from half-past four to a quarter to five o'clock—I stopped at Mr. Williamson's to ask the price of a pair of Blucher boots—whilst speaking to the boy belonging to the shop I saw both the prisoners—it appeared great deal of notice of me—after I priced the pair of boots I looked round and saw them close to my arm—I saw Lovell touch Davis, who imme<lb></lb>diately went'away, and went to the corner of Jewin-street, to the chemist's shop—they looked at me very hard—I had suspicion, and went a little further, and stood looking in the shop of Mr. Reeve, a pawnbroker—I saw Davis come by and look into a currier's shop, a door or two beyond Mr. Williamson's, and imme<lb></lb>diately go back again—Lovell then went by, and came back again—they went backwards and forwards several times, sometimes together, and sometimes alone—five or ten minutes after first noticing them the prosecutor was engaged taking his shoes in from outside the shop—at last only one parcel was left hanging on the line—I saw davis go by, and, as I thought, untwist them, but when I went up I found part of the string on the nail, and it had been apparently cut—he placed one hand on the boots, and the other on the top—immediately went and said to the prosecutor, "You have lost some boots," and called, "Stop thief!"—Lovell was about fifteen yards from Davis when be went up and touched the boots, about three doors off—he could see what Davis was about—he made motions with his hands to him, and shook his head—when I gave the alarm they both ran away—they turned down Jewin-street, and into Jewin-crescent—Davis was stopped in Aldersgate-street—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184501060013"></xptr>
               <p>did not see Lovell till the policeman had Davis in custody it another shoe-shop in Aldersgate-street—we turned down Long-lane, Lovell fol<lb></lb>lowed on the opposite side, and when we got near the station he went away in the direction of St. John-street—next day I saw him at Guild-hall, lurking about the outside of the office—I mentioned who he was to the officer, and he was taken directly—I am quite certain he is the same man who was with Davis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Davis.</hi> I did not take the boots, and had nothing to do with them; I was running down Aldersgate-street, when the mob collected and took me; I was never in Red Cross-street at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I was looking at them from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour, having suspicion of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Lovell.</hi> I was out of work, and went down to the docks that morning with Davis, thinking I might get a day's work; I was with him till twelve o'clock in the day; I then left him, and when the boots were stolen I was up stairs along with my mother having my tea, from four till five o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It was half-past four or a quarter to five o'clock when I first saw them—Davis was taken to the station before it struck five o'clock—it was then that Lovell went as far as the station, and went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, and live in Jewin-street. On Tuesday afternoon, the 31st of Dec, I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw Davis running round Jewin-street, and up Jewin-crescent—I ran up Jewin-street and met him coming out at the other end—as he was passing Mr. Alexander's the carpenter's in Jewin-street, I saw him throw three pairs of boots over the railings—I picked them up—these now produced are them—I afterwards saw Davis cross Aldersgate-street, just by a green-grocer's shop—I saw a mob of people, and heard that he was taken—the policeman came over to me—I went with him to the station and gave him the boots—I saw the policeman search Davis—he pulled off his boots, and as he was putting them on again I saw him shift something I from his hand towards his pocket—the policeman took hold of him, and I took from him a leather case, from which he pulled a white handled knife.</p>

The deceased was crossing the way with a heavy load of greens and turneps, opposite Half-moon-alley, in Bishopsgate-street; the pole threw him down, and the wheels went over some part of his body; the man died very shortly afterwards.

            . I was coming down the gateway of the Fox and Hounds in Bishopsgate-street; I saw a coach on the same side as I was, go by me very quick, and a coach on the other side of the way; they seemed to drive against one another; it was the coach on the other side of the way that did the mischief. I saw the deceased crossing the street with a load upon his back; it appeared to me that either the pole or the horses threw him down; the fore near wheel went over him about the stomach, the hind-wheel went a little lower, and that turned his body over, I called out to stop the coach, and I ran as far as the church, I could run so farther; then I walked, and saw him turn down Threadneedle-street.</p>

I turned back when I got on the path-way, and saw the pole of the coach, on one of the horses, strike the deceased on the right side; when he was knocked down he fell upon his face, the hind-wheel turned him round. I did not observe the coachman's face so as to know him again.</p>

            . I live opposite the London. Work-house, Bishopsgate-street; one of my men told me a man was killed; I ran out of the shop; Mr. Hunt gave me the alarm of the man, and I pursued him. Seeing me after him, he drove faster and faster; when I came out he was about six times the length of a coach and a pair of horses from the deceased. I pursued him into Threadneedle-street; about the middle of the street he looked back; I was sensible he must hear the cry; then he droves into Bartholomew-lane; there was a cart stopped him; I caught hold of the bridle of his horses, and asked him how he could for shame drive away? he was frightened; he at first had not power to speak; afterwards he said he was very sorry. He said he could not stop his horses; I think, he said his pole-piece was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hunt. You remember Mr. Waite's pursuing a coachman? Was that the coach that had run over the deceased?</p>

               <p>Mr. Saffroy, the surgeon, deposed, that the deceased was brought to his house, and died in a few minutes; that there was a confused wound upon the right side of his head, which he believed to be the cause of his death.</p>

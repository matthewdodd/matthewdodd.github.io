                  </hi>. I keep the "Lord Stanley," Camden Park Road—on 6th March, about 8 o'clock, I served the prisoner with a half-pint of beer—he paid me with coppers—about 10.45 I served him with <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of rum, warm—he gave me a half-crown—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and put the half-crown at the back of the bar, by itself—I commenced serving a servant-girl, and it then flashed across my mind that he had given me a bad half-crown, and as I took it up, he left—I ran round to the other door, but he got away—I found the half-crown was bad, marked it, and locked it up—on 14th March, about 10.10, I was in the bar-parlour, and recognized the prisoner, who was in the bar, as having been there on the Monday previous, and went to the till, to see what money he had passed—he saw me go to the till, and walked away, and I said "Stop that man!"—the barmaid said "He gave me this shilling"—I said "Can't you see at a glance that it is a bad one?—the prisoner said "If I have given you a bad one, I will give you another for it"—I said "No, you have had me before, and I intend to prosecute you"—he said "You are locking up an innocent man; do you know there is a God above, and you will have to meet me face to face with Him"—I said "I do not know about that, I know you will have to meet me before the Magistrate to-morrow morning," and gave him in charge with the half-crown and shilling.</p>

I am barmaid to Mr. Forbes—on 6th March I was in the bar the whole evening, except a quarter of an hour, when I was at supper—I saw the prisoner there first at a little before 8 o'clock—I do not know who served him—he stayed some considerable time, and went out before 9 o'clock, because he asked for the "<hi rend="italic">Standard"</hi> and it had not come in—I saw him again just before I went to supper, between 10 and 11 o'clock—I was asked for the "<hi rend="italic">Standard"</hi> and he had it—I did not serve him at all—I saw him next on the 14th, at a little after 10 o'clock, and served him with a half-pint of stout-and-bitter—he paid me with coppers—Mr. Forbes was then at supper, in the bar parlour—the prisoner then called for more drink, and gave me a shilling, which I placed in the till, where there was only a half-crown, and gave him his change, a sixpence, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—Mr. Forbes came into the bar, recognized the prisoner, went up to the till, and was going to open it, which the prisoner saw, and left his drink, and went away—Mr. Forbes called out "Stop that man!" and the potman ran out, and he was stopped—Mr. Forbes broke the coin in two, and gave it to the constable.</p>

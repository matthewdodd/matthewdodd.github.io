                  </hi>. I live servant with Mr. Henry John Neale Chase, of Tavistock-place, Tavistock-square. On the evening of the 14th of Febru<lb></lb>ary I was in the kitchen—I heard a knock at the door, and answered it—I saw the prisoner there—he said he came for some shoes—I showed him into the back parlour, and told him to wait—I went into the drawing-room to speak to my mistress, and, as I was coming down stairs, I heard the street-door slam to, and when I came down the prisoner was gone—I found the door a little ajar—I missed from the table a great-coat of my master's brother's, Mr. Samuel Compeny Chase—it had been safe when I let the pri<lb></lb>soner in.</p>

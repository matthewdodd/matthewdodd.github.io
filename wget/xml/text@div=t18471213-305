                  </hi> I am a carman in the employ of the Eastern Counties Railway Company—on 4th Dec. the prisoners were employed by the Com<lb></lb>pany—the boy Rounce was guard to a van, of which I had charge—on 4th Dec., at half-past four in the morning, my van was at the Shoreditch Station, with packs of meat and hampers in it—one was to be delivered to Mr. Dor<lb></lb>rington, in Newgate market—it is down in the way-hill—Rounce was in the van, and Crane by the side of it—I left the station—when I got to Bishopsgate-street a policeman brought Crane to me, and asked if I knew him, and knew what he had got—I said, "No"—the officer said he had got a loin of port—I got off the box and looked at it—I examined the parcel directed to Mr. Dorrington—it had been opened, and something gone from it—none of the other packages had been opened—the officer took Rounce in charge.</p>

On 4th Dec., at twenty minutes before five o'clock in the morning, I saw Moses driving his van in Union-street, Spitalfields—both prisoners were on it—I followed it a little distance and saw Crane get off, and hold up his apron—Rounce opened a hamper at the end of the van, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> a piece of pork into Crane's apron—took Crane into custody directly, and asked what he had got there—he said, a piece of meat that a boy had given him in Spitalfields-market—I said it was no use saying so, I has seen him, and he must go with me—I took him round to Bishopsgate-street, and saw the van—I looked in the hamper, and about a pound and a-half had been cut off the pork that was in it—I compared the piece Crane had, with the piece in the hamper, they corresponded exactly—I than took Rounce and Crane to the station—as they were going, they said I had been a boy myself once, and asked me to let them go—Rounce said, if the other boy had taken it off he van it was unknown to him.</p>

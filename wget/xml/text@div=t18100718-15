            . I live at 58, East-street, Marylebone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes. On the 6th of this month I saw her in Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any acquaintance with her before - A. I had the pleasure of seeing her before, but not knowing her so closely as this night; I met her about half after twelve at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in liquor - A. No, I was sober, I had the share of a pot of beer with my supper before I met her. When I met her she asked me to go home with her, she would get me a comfortable lodging; I went home with her to her lodging in <placeName id="t18100718-15-crimeloc83">Church-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. What money had you about you - A. I had four one pound notes in my breeches pocket; I undressed myself when I went to bed; the four one pound notes were in a pocket book, in my breeches pocket when I was undressed.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you lost the notes they were not on your person - A. No; after I got in bed I saw her put her hand into my pocket, she wanted some money to get some porter; she then locked me in and ran down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180011"></xptr>stairs. I rapped at the door, some person came and said, make yourself happy and comfortable, she is only gone for a pot of porter. I laid in the bed till seven o'clock in the morning, and when I was loosened out of the room, I enquired of the mistress of the house where Mrs. Foley was, I told her I was robbed of my money: she told me she was gone to a shop in Charlotte-street, and there I should find her drinking of gin; I went, and found the prisoner coming out of a gin shop with half a pint of gin, and a handfull of halfpence; I stopped her and asked for my money. I sent for an officer, he came and searched her, he found no notes; I have never found my notes since.</p>

            . I live in Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury. The prosecutor wanted me to keep his money for him before he went out that night; I know no more than that he had four one pound notes, he offered them to me to take care off, I refused.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor asked me if I could tell him where to get a bed, I told him in Church-lane, where I lodged. I went and called the girl, I said, Jenny, this man wants a bed; she said it was one shilling and sixpence; he said, he had got only half-a-crown and some halfpence; he gave the girl a shilling; and after the girl went down stairs, he said he would give me eighteen pence to sleep with him; I said, I would not stop for eighteen pence; I never saw any more than the eighteen pence which he put in his pocket.</p>

The woman came down, and said she would stop no longer for the eighteen-pence; I went into the room to him and asked him if all was right, when he was sitting by the bed side, he said yes, then I locked the door and came down stairs. I always lock all the doors every night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he make any complaint in the night - A. None at all, until the morning, between nine and ten, when he got up, and then he said he was robbed of four one pound notes.</p>

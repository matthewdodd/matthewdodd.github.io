             sworn. - I am a carpenter, employed by Mr. Whitaker; I went to the watch-house and saw these posts; I believe them to be Mr. Whitaker's, I cannot swear to them; he had a great quantity of that sort; I am building on the spot.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of these posts placed in a field near this building? - A. They were within about twenty yards; there were a great many; I went to the heap where they laid, and I could see there had been some removed that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you look at the heap? - A. I suppose about an hour after he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether all that whole heap were the property of Mr. Whitaker? - A. They were all Mr. Whitaker's and mine, together.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of these five posts? - A. I suppose they are worth sixpence a-piece, if they are worth any thing at all.</p>

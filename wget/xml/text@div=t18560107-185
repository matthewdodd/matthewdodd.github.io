                  </hi>. I live at No. 13, Brunswick-street, Homerton, in the parish of Hackney. The prisoners came to lodge at my house on 29th Nov. last—they occupied the back room on the ground floor, unfurnished—they stated that they had four children, but I never saw but one until the death happened—on Sunday, 23rd Sept., the male prisoner came up stairs between 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning, and asked where the parish doctor lived—I asked him what was the matter—he said two of his children, he believed, were dying—I told him where the doctor lived, and he left—I went down into their room, and found the female prisoner there, and the four children, two alive and two dead—one was quite dead, and the other nearly so—he gave a groan when the doctor came into the room—the doctor came in while I was there, and the male prisoner with him—I looked at the children—they were in a state shocking to relate—I could not describe the awful state they were in—they were quite skeletons—there were not any bed clothes, there was a thin covering over their faces—I took it off, and looked at them—I asked the female prisoner why she did not tell</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, residing at Hackney; I am surgeon to the South Hackney district. On Sunday morning, 23rd Dec., the male prisoner came to me, at 7 o'clock, and told me that one of his children was dead, and the other dying, and asked me to go to his house—I went with him—as we went along, he said that if his children died he should say they had been starved to death—he told me that he had had an order to go into the workhouse—I told him, if he was in such distress, he was very silly not to do so—I do not recollect that he made any reply—I went into the back room on the ground floor at No. 13, Brunswick-street, and there found the female prisoner and four children—the eldest girl was nursing the infant in one part of the room, and the two children who have since died were lying in another corner of the room, on a mattrass—the girl was dead, and the boy was in a dying state, nearly dead—he died in a few minutes, while I was in the house—they presented the appearance of extreme emaciation—there were two old chairs and a table in the room, and this bed on the floor in the corner—that appeared to be all the furniture—on the chimney piece I saw a little paper with some oatmeal, and another paper with rice in it—the female prisoner told me that there was 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of oatmeal in one paper, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of rice in the other—I made a <hi rend="italic">port mortem</hi> examina<lb></lb>tion on the Tuesday morning, by direction of the parish authorities—I first examined the girl—I found all the organs of the body quite healthy, except that they were entirely devoid of fat—there was no fat about the body at all—I found no food of any kind in the stomach, only a little liquid feculent matter in the lower part of the intestines, and one or two little pieces of stick, which the male prisoner said might have been taken in the oatmeal—I made the examination at the house—the prisoners were not present during the whole of it—I called them in to account for the pieces of stick—there was also a fish bone in the intestines of the girl, which the female prisoner accounted for by saying that they had had a herring the day before—she also said they had eaten a hearty supper the night before—I should not have thought it at all likely that the stomach would present the appearances it did if they had had a hearty supper the night before—in my opinion, the children died from the long continued deprivation of proper and sufficient food—I took away the stomach and intestines of the boy, and next day those of the girl, sealed them up, and took them to Dr. Letheby.</p>

                  </hi>. I am. professor of chemiatry at the London Hos<lb></lb>pital. I received from Mr. Vinall the stomach and intestines of the female child on 29th Dec.—I examined them—I found the stomach slightly red<lb></lb>dened on the interior coat; and the intestines and stomach were perfectly empty, excepting a little feculent mucus—that was in the intestines both of the boy and girl, but more particularly in the boy's—I also found in the stomach of each some pieces of fish bone, which I produce—I did not find any small pieces of wood—I carefully examined the remains of nutriment, to ascertain whether there was the remains of a meal—I searched particu<lb></lb>larly</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Looking at the state of the stomach and intestines, and assuming that the body presented an appearance of great emaciation, what inference would you draw from that state of things? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That starvation had been the cause of death—there was not a trace of fat in the intestinal canal, which is very unusual—if a person is deprived of food, the system lives as it were upon itself, until all the fat is consumed—I should imagine that the exhaustion of the system had been a lingering one, from the whole of the fat being absorbed—I think it could not have been any sudden matter; it must have been progressing for some time—there was some redness on the inner lining—I found nothing deleterious—the redness was probably owing to the mechanical irritancy of the fish bone, and the pieces of wood on the coat of the stomach—that appearance has been observed before in cases of starva<lb></lb>tion—I attribute the death to a lingering deprivation of food, going on for some time.</p>

I took the prisoners into custody on 28th Dec., at the Black Boy public house, at Hackney, where the inquest was held—I said, "I charge you with having caused the death of William Harvey, aged seven year, and Harriet Harvey, aged five years, by neglect<lb></lb>ing to provide proper and sufficient food and nourishment for them"—they said nothing in answer to that—I took them to the station—I searched the male prisoner, and found on him an order for work at the stone yard, dated 21st Dec., two shillings, a halfpenny, and a farthing, two orders for bread, two for 56 lbs. of coals each, and an order for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of meat, dated 26th Dec.; that was after the deaths—the coal and bread orders are not dated, they were given from Ironmonger-lane, City; it is not parochial relief—I searched their room, but could find no article of children's clothing whatever—there was no clothing, there was merely a dirty mattress, but no blankets, or sheets, or anything for covering—there was every appearance of the deepest misery and distress.</p>

They must first be satisfied that the duty existed. With respect to the male prisoner, the father, there could be no doubt the obligation lay upon him, and the culpable neglect of that duty would make him responsible, in the form of murder or manslaughter. With respect to the female prisoner, the case was different, and the only duty cast upon her was the supplying to the children such food as was given to her for that purpose.</hi>)</p>

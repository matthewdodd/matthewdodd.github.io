            . On the morning in question, I was going down Tottenham-court-road; I saw the prisoner and another person standing against the shafts of this waggon- they crossed over, and I saw something under the prisoner's arm, which I thought was a horse-cloth; I asked the prosecutor if he had any horse-cloths - he said no, but he had some great-coats; he looked up and said there was one missing - we then followed the prisoner and his companion, who were going on towards the corner of Gower-street: the coat dropped from one of them, but I cannot say which - the prisoner's companion had something under his arm: I did not see them taken anything from the waggon - I picked the coat up; this is it.</p>

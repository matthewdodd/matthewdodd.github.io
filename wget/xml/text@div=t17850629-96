               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Council. You keep a public house? - Yes, this woman was a servant of mine, a house keeper.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say she lived with you as a common servant? - I looked upon her to be in trust so far as this, you might come in and think we were man and wife.</p>
               <p>Aye, I thought so; why, did not every one else think so? - People that did not know us might.</p>
               <p>How long has she lived with you? - At different times she has lived with me twelve years; she lived with me eight years together.</p>
               <p>Did not she pay the taxes, and take the house for you when you was a bankrupt? - She never took a house for me when I was a bankrupt.</p>
               <p>Did not she pay the bills? - I paid my bills in general; I have said to my servants, go and see where she is gone.</p>

               <p>Will you swear that? - I will not.</p>
               <p>When you sent her to pay the rent, did not she pay it as Mrs. Marshall, and your wife? - She paid it on my account no doubt, and Mr. Wallis might certainly think she was Mrs. Marshall.</p>
               <p>Did not you treat her in every respect as your wife; you quarrelled sometimes like man and wife, did you not? - There are very few but may have words.</p>
               <p>You used to beat her too, I believe? - I have servants now that I take and beat; I have a nephew now that I beat.</p>
               <p>Now this watch, did not you in one of your loving fits give her this watch? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Was not you vexed when the man prisoner took her away? - I never heard of such a thing till I found it out, till I traced the marriage.</p>
               <p>Was not you angry at losing your deary? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not she and you live in every respect like man and wife? - Upon my oath we did not live in every respect or pass to all the world as man and wife.</p>
               <p>I give you fair warning Mr. Marshall, did you, or did you not? - No, we did not.</p>
               <p>Did you generally pass as man and wife? - Some people in the neighbourhood looked upon us as such, but there were thousands of people that knew to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Had not you a marriage agreement? - As to any marriage agreement that is erroneous, it could not be, she knew my wife well all along; my wife lived in the country, there was a disagreement between her family and me, and she lived in the country.</p>
               <p>Who had the care and management of your bed and all your property? - The housekeeper had the management of the curtains and the bed, I was a little intoxicated that night, and fell asleep.</p>

               <p>I live in Leather-lane, this watch the prisoner at the bar brought to me on Monday the 6th of June, there is a paper of mine of that date in the case now, I always date every watch at the back.</p>
               <p>In what state was the watch when brought to you? - Very much bruised, and no glass, and no minute hand; I had orders to put a new glass in, take the bruises out, put a minute hand, and engrave the cypher T. B. upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you know Mr. and Mrs. Marshall? - No, Sir, I did not know there were any such people in the neighbourhood, for I never go to any public house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marshall. This is my watch, I know it by the name J. Day, No. 190; I knew the number before I swore to it before the Magistrate, it was much bruised on the outside case, and the minute hand broke.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How long had Mrs: Marshall had this watch? - Not long, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290127"></xptr> broke the glass and minute hand when I was down in Moorfields, it lay in my drawer, she had no keys to that drawer, she had keys of the drawers underneath, where her clothes lay.</p>
               <p>Who advised you to indict this woman capitally? - I thought the robbery that was committed upon me was sufficient; we did not live as man and wife, she knew that, no doubt but many of the neighbours looked upon us to be man and wife.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever pay this woman any wages? - Yes, many different times, I paid her about a year and a half ago.</p>
               <p>What is due to her? - I cannot think there is anything, considering the money that has been made use of.</p>
               <p>What did you pay her for wages? - Eight pounds a year was the agreement, and I believe we have not settled for a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Were there any arrears due? - No, I paid her up to Christmas was a twelvemonth; she has had at different times of me a good many guineas on account.</p>
               <p>Have you any receipt for wages? - Yes, I have, I shall be able to prove that a great part of my books and writings have been destroyed and burnt.</p>

               <p>Mr. Marshall gave me that watch, when he won a watch at a raffle, a little watch that he had, he gave me this in the presence of my sister, he told her so; he went out afterwards and staid out all night, and lost his own watch, and then he wore mine.</p>
               <p>Marshall. I never won a watch at a raffle in my lifetime.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Buckle. When we first went together we were in ready furnished lodgings a year and a half, and he had not a bed to lay on; then afterwards I went to his house.</p>
               <p>Marshall. I bought it, or lent her the money to buy it in my name.</p>
               <p>Court to Marshall. Is that true that this was her bed, or that she had a bed? - She never had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Tether. He has laid in bed till I have washed his shirt, many a time.</p>
               <p>LIDIA TETHER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am sister to the prisoner Buckle, I know Mr. Marshall very well many years; when first they went together I did not know but they were lawfully married for some years, I asked her first, and she told me they were married; and I asked him separate, and he told me they were married at Bishopsgate church; with respect to the watch, I went to their house in April, and I was shewing my sister a watch I had lately purchased , and she shewed me one that she had, I asked her if it was her watch, and he made answer, he had given it her, she replied it was all broke, it was not worth a gift, it was broke, the glass and hands.</p>
               <p>Had she any furniture when they were in lodgings? - I believe the first was a ready furnished lodging that they had, and after that they had a room with one bed, and a very little furniture.</p>
               <p>Who purchased that bed? - She had feathers of me to fill a bed, but that was since; I do not know who purchased the bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Where was this watch broke? - The glass was broke and the case was injured.</p>
               <p>Was any thing more broke? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What watch was this? - A silver watch.</p>

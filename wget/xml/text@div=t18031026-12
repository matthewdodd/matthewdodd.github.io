               <p>LAZARUS LEVI sworn. - I am an apprentice to Mr. Jacobs; I generally put the shoes out in a morning, and take them in of an evening: On the 6th of October I put out six pair of new shoes; when I took them in in the evening there were only five pair; when my master came home I told him of it; he was standing at the door very uneasy, and saw the little one, Connell, about the door; he was alone; my master brought him in doors, and asked him if he knew any thing about the shoes; he was very obstinate, and would not tell till a good bit; my master then went out to see if he could find any other boy, and left Connell with me; while I was putting up the half hatch he ran out; I ran after him, and caught him, and just as I was bringing him into the shop, my master came back again; Connell still said he knew nothing of them; my master offered him two shillings to tell where they were, and then he shewed the other boy to my master, but I was not present then; my master came home with the shoes; I knew them immediately; my master and me made them together.</p>
               <p>Q.What has become of them? - A.I sold them, and my master made a great noise at me for selling them; I did not know they were to be kept; I knew them by my own work, and by the stamps.</p>
               <p>Jacobs. I saw Connell near my own door, and laid hold of him; I asked him what he wanted, and he asked me if I had an old pair of shoes to give him; I told him, no; I asked him, have not you stole a pair of shoes from this window; says I, I am sure you have; I was a long time before I could get him to tell me any thing about them; I offered him two shillings if he would tell me, and I then went about Covent-garden with him for two hours; at last he said, he dare say the other had pawned them at Dirty Dick's, in St. Giles's; just before we came to Dirty Dick's I saw Groves; Connell immediately said, that is him; I immediately laid hold of him, and took the shoes from his bosom; he tossed himself on the ground, and began crying; I took Groves to Bow-street, and the little one followed; I knew the shoes to be mine; I took them home, and put them upon the shelf; I did not know that I was to keep them separate; I knew them perfectly well, and swore to them.</p>

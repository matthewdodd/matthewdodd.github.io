                  </hi>. I carry on business at the Star Foundry, St. John-street; Hopping was in my employment, and left four or five days before the 27th Jan.—I believe this order to be his writing—I gave him no authority to write it—he had frequently written orders on my printed forms—I have missed blank printed forms from my order-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), there are two or three blank counterfoils here—this order does not fit either of those—this part is printed "Star Foundry, 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

               <p>orders were written—I have given other orders besides those that are altered on the counterfoils—I may have given 100 orders during this year—every one that I have ordered has been executed—I had ordered ten or twelve tons of bar-iron from Messrs.

Fisher and Bramell, of Sheffield; that was written on a piece of note-paper, because the paper would not hold it—I gave no order to the Birmingham Cutnail Company for three tons of coals, nor for a quantity of files from Sheffield—Hopping had left my service five or six days before this order was written—he bad no settled wages; be was to be remone<lb></lb>rated for what he did—I did not require him wholly and solely; he was to make out a few bills, and do what was required, as my work was so dirty—be was six or seven weeks in my service, and may have received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he may perhaps have signed twenty or thirty orders for me in his own name—he has never written his own name to orders when I have put mine—there has not been any joint order, to my memory; I will not swear either way—I do not think my name has been appended to any order with his—I was not in pecuniary difficulties while he was with me, nor am I now—I do not think he has pledged anything for me; I do not think he has pledged my watch for me; I do not know whether he has or sot—I never authorized him to do it—my watch has been out of my possession—I knew where it was—I do not recollect a wagon coming with tome spring-steel from Messrs. Daniels and Payne's, or any other place, when there was an amount of wharfage and cartage to pay upon them which I could not pay, nor did I give Hopping my watch to pledge for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay the charges—I swear that—I never got him to sign a bill for me—I never asked him; I swear that—there have been no conversations between us about his signing bills for me—I did not ask him to accept a bill for me at three months for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know a person named M'Cabe—he vu never in the habit of getting bills discounted for me, or borrowing money for me; he frequently disposed of goods for me—I directed Hopping to draw a bill on Mr. Woodyer—I put my own name to it, I did not authorize him to do it—I endorsed it myself—I never gave Hopping authority to write to different houses, and use his own discretion in getting goods; that I swear—he has never given an order for goods without my sanction which I have afterwards received—I never told him if he could open an account for me I would pay him for it—I never sent orders to Messrs.

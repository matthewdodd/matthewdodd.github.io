            . I am a watchman of Oxford-street. On the 29th of September, about eleven o'clock at night. I saw the prisoner with a basket on his shoulder - I followed him about a hundred yards, and then asked him what he had got in his basket? he put it on the pavement, and said it was lead, which he had brought from a house at Kilburn, which was being repaired, and was going to take it to his master, Mr. Wilson, No. 27, Newman-street. I said I thought it was odd he should carry it at that late hour. He said I might go to his master with him - He said, perhaps I thought he stole it. I took him to the watch-house. I then went to No. 27, Newman-street-no such person lived there. Next morning I found they were the prosecutor's nails-the hinges were with them.</p>

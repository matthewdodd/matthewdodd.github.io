               <p>Court. What fort of cellar was it? - It was a dead cellar window, nailed with planks over it.</p>
               <p>How were those planks laid on? - It was planked up and the nails drawn.</p>
               <p>Court. What was become of the cask? - In the gin cellar, the lock was wrenched off, and the staple was drawn, and the rasberry gin was taken out, and carried to the hole where they broke first in, ready to take it away, the cellar was eight yards distance from the window, and where I found him was ten yards distance.</p>

               <p>I was drinking in the house till one o'clock, and was very much in liquor, and I went to the Black Boy the next door and had two pints of beer, and I slipped down coming along, I stunned myself with slipping down, and I laid down and went to sleep.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Did he appear in liquor when you found him in the cellar? - I believe he was, for he had certainly been drinking of the liquors that were in the gin cellar.</p>
               <p>Was he very much in liquor when you found him? - Not so much because when I got him to the door, he would have fought me.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was he drunk when you let him out? - I look upon him at eleven to be fuddled, but he staid till between twelve and one o'clock, and had nothing more to drink to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court to the watchman. Was the prisoner drunk when you found him in the cellar? - No, I cannot say he was, he said, he fell down, I said, you shall not fall out, we will help you out.</p>

On the 1st of April, between four and five o'clock, I was in my shop, my family were at home; a person knocked at the door; I have only one house but two shops. A person came in and wanted something in the other shop, which is a brush-shop, the man wanted a set of brushes, and said he would call again. When I came into the other shop, I found the door half open, it was shut when I left it, and for some time before-it goes on a latch-both shops front the street; there is a door goes out of each of them into the street; I am sure I fastened the door of my tailor's-shop; I stood close to it until I heard the knock at the door-there is a door communicating between the two shops. When I found the door open. I missed nothing at that moment - I remained at the counter, until I was called in to tea. As I sat at tea, I observed a vacancy in the window where the kerseymore stood; this was about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes after. I had never left the door, nor had any one come in after. About a quarter of an hour after that, a person came and asked if I had lost a piece of cloth or kerseymere, and said it was at St. Martin's watchhouse; I went there, and found it - I knew it to be mine. The prisoner is not the man who came for the brushes; I saw nobody with him - I saw nobody come into the other shop. The man who came for the brushes kept making a noise all the while, by knocking them on the counter.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Sherrard-street, Golden-square. On the 1st of April, in the afternoon, I was passing up Chandos-street; a man either passed me, or was before me, who excited my notice. I kept my eye on him for some time, and found he was looking for something behind me. I looked round and saw the prisoner on the other side of the street, with a piece of kerseymere under his arm. I kept my eye on him for sometime, and was induced to think all was not right-thinking he belonged to the other man. When they got to the narrow end of Chandos-street, the prisoner appeared to be making up to the other man - I felt convinced they belonged to each other, and I followed them - They ran - I could hardly keep up with them, the prisoner turned round, and saw me following him; he immediately quickened his pace, and turned up Bedfordbury. As soon as I turned the corner myself, I found he had thrown the piece of kerseymere down; a man picked it up - I took it from him, and pursued the prisoner; he turned round May's-buildings; I raised a cry after him; he was stopped in St. Martin's-lane - I am sure he is the man who had the kerseymere; I came up and took him to St. Martin's watch-house.</p>

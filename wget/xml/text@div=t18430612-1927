                  </hi>. I reside at No. 13, Melcombe-place, Dorset-square, and am a sculptor—I dwell in the house—I left my house on the 17th of May about seven o'clock, and returned about half-past eleven—I found it had been entered from the attic window—there are some new buildings going on close by, and I suppose they had got up by them—my servant had locked the attic door, and the box of the lock was unscrewed and taken off, and the door left open—I cannot tell whether they were safe when I left the house—I searched that night, but did not miss anything—next morning, about a quar<lb></lb>ter</p>

               <p>before seven o'clock, I found that my razor-case and seven razors had been taken from the dressing-table in the front room, on the second floor—a diamond pin was left on the dressing-table, I had seen it there the day before, and that was gone—I have seen the rasors in possession of the police, but not the case—I recognised the razors instantly—these are them—I have no hesitation in saying they are mine—I am quite sure they were in the house the day before—I use them every day.</p>

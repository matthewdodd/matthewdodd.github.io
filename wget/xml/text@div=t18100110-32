            , she keeps an oil shop, and lives at 74, St. John's-street. On Saturday, the 2nd of December, the prisoner at the bar came to Mrs. Clarke's shop to buy something, I cannot exactly state what articles she asked for, she bought something, I cannot speak to the amount precisely.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she offer to pay for it. - A. She offered a one pound bank of England note, apparently I asked her what name I was to place on it; she replied, she did not know from whom she received it, she had taken it from a new married couple, living some where in the neighbourhood, she did not know their names. She went out of the shop taking the note with her; and returned in perhaps six or seven minutes, gave me the address, which I put on the back of the note, Gerain, New-court, 2d of December, 1809, she gave me that address. I am sure it is my own handwriting, and I am sure the prisoner is the person that offered it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When next did you see the prisoner after having passed the note on the Saturday - A. I think on the Thursday following she came to Mrs. Clarke's shop to take the note that she had paid me on the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ask for it - A. Yes, Mrs. Clark was in the shop, I was present, I heard her say that she had come for the note and had brought eighteen shillings; I think she gave Mrs. 
               <persName id="t18100110-32-person316">Clarke</persName>
             the money that she brought and she hoped Mrs. Clarke would not mind trusting her for the remainder to make up the one pound note, Mrs. Clarke took it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you serve her the things when she first came - A. I did; I do not recollect what it was, it was two or three shillings worth of something.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. Q. Did she get back the note - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether since the first time that she came and rendered the note that any enquiries had been made after her - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q, Do you know whether she called and paid Mrs. 
               <persName id="t18100110-32-person317">Clarke</persName>
             the remainder - A. Yes; she called the same morning and paid the remainder, I saw her give some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100020"></xptr>money; I believe it was two shillings to make up one pound.</p>
               <p>JAMES HENDERSON DOWE. Q. You are book-keeper to Mrs. Clarke, she keeps an oil shop in St. John-street. A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any intelligence that you received from the bank, did you go for the purpose of finding the prisoner. - A. I did; I went on Wednesday the 6th of December, I went to New-court; I afterwards saw the prisoner in the street in the evening; I heard that she was an old woman; she was turning into the place where she lived; I asked her, if her name was Gerain, she told me, yes. I asked her, if she recollected changing a one pound note at Mrs. Clarke's on the Saturday, she replied, she did; I asked her, if she knew who she took the note of; she said, yes; she took it of a gentleman. I asked her, to give me his name; she said, she could not; she said, she would make enquiry, and call the next morning at Mrs. Clarke's; she said, that she knew the gentleman that she took it off, but she, did not know his name; I left her.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, that she has never given you the gentleman's name. - A. No; she never has, nor any body else to my knowledge.</p>

Yes; perfectly well, she came to my master's shop about the end of November, or the beginning of December, she purchased some trifling thing, I cannot exactly tell the amount, she paid it in a one pound note, I gave her the change; I I asked her for her name and address, she gave me the name of Gerain, 2, New-court; I said, Cow-cross; she said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note, is that the note that she tendered. - A. Yes, I wrote upon it, Gerain, 2, New-court, Cow-cross.

               <p>Q.In consequence, sir, of two notes having been traced to the bank, did you proceed with Foy the officer on the 16th of December any where. - A. I did; I went to number 2, New-court, Peter's-lane, leading one part to Cow-cross.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the house where you found the prisoner. A. Yes; I found the prisoner in the house when I came there, both of them were present; I questioned her, respecting a one pound note, that she passed at Mrs. Clarke's shop; she told me, that she found it near the Horns, public-house as she was crossing St. John-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you confine the enquiry to Mrs. Clarke's note at that time only. - A. To Mrs. Clarke's note only; I asked her what time of the day she found it; she said, it was after dark; I then asked her, if there were any other note with it, she said, no there was not; I asked her, if any person was present and saw her pick it up; she said, there was not, she found it wrapped up in a bit of paper. Foy the officer searched her, he found six or seven seven shilling pieces; I asked her again, where it was she found Mrs. Clarke's note; she then said, she found several; I asked her, how many, she said, she believed there might be five or six; I asked if she had any of them by her; she said, she paid them all away; I asked her to whom she had paid them; she said, to different shops; I asked her then, if she had paid one at Mr. Osborne's shop; she said, she had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing at that time about her husband. - A. As to the first note, her husband knowed nothing at all of. I asked him likewise, do you know any thing of these notes: he said, no; I do not, I asked the husband if he knew any thing about Mrs. Clarke's note; he said, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now go to Osborne's note. - A. She said, she did pay a note at Osborne's, that was the note that she had found. Then her husband said, my wife is very wrong; she is telling you stories, I gave them to her.</p>

               <p>Court. Speaking both of Clarke's and Osborne's. - A. Clarke's and Osborne's both, I asked him then, where he got them, they were both present; he told me, he found them on his beat, he is a watchman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you accompany the last witness to the prisoner's lodgings. - A. I did; I searched her; I found on her person seven seven shilling pieces, upwards of a pound in silver, in shillings and sixpences; about three and twenty or four and twenty shillings, and nearly two shillings of copper money. She said, she had found the note near the public house, called, the Horns, at St. John-street; she found it at night, there was no other note with it, she said, at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. There was none other with it. - A. There was none other with it. After we had found the change, and Mr. Glover questioned her more, she then said, she found several, there were five or six.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. After the conversation had ended between Mr. Glover and her, which has been stated, did you apprehend her. - A I did, and the husband also, and took them to the office in Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took them away, did you secure the room. - A. I did; I locked the door, and took the key with me.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house was this room situated. - A. There are but three rooms to the house, this was the upper one, the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after the examination had taken place, did you return to the lodgings. - A. I did; leaving the prisoners at Marlborough-street. I searched the lodgings, I saw my brother find some more change, it was in my presence, he found fifteen or sixten dollars put under a pan on the floor covered over with some cloths; in another part of the room under some bricks, we found upwards of a pound in copper money, they were covered over with more things: they were all halfpence, I believe they seemed to have been packed up in five shilling papers, some of them were packed up. I searched up the chimney, after having searched all the other part of the room, there I saw hanging upon a nail up the chimney, a small black parcel, tied up with some twine, on taking it down and opening it, it contained eleven one pound notes, and four two pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Take these notes in your hand, and see whether these are notes that you found, and which were wrapped up. - A. These are all the notes I found, and these are the papers that they were tied up in.</p>
               <p>Court. When you returned with your brother, did you find the door in the same state which you left it. - A. I did; there appeared no alteration in the room whatever.</p>

               <p>Q.Of course perfectly acquainted with their paper - I am now putting into your hand the one tendered to Mrs. Clarke - Look at that note and see whether it is a genuine bank note, or whether it is forged - A. It is a forged bank note; the whole of it is forged; it is not the paper used by the bank, and the signature is not the signature of persons in the bank; it has not the water mark used at the bank. (The note read.)</p>
               <p>Q. That one pound note, the one uttered to Mrs. Osborne, is that a genuine one or forgery - A. It is a forgery; it is not the paper of the bank, nor from a plate used in the bank; they appear to be from the same plate, and filled up with the same hand-writing, the same date and the same signature.</p>
               <p>Q. I now put into your hand the eleven one's and the four two's which were found in the chimney, are they all a forgery - A. They are throughout a forgery, they appear to be from the same impression and from one plate, all the one's, and filled up by the same hand, the same kind of figures throughout; the two's are from another plate, and they appear to be filled by the same hands as the one's.

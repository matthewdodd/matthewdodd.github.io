                  </hi>. I am an accountant—I was appointed trustee of the defendants' estate—I produce a statement of affairs signed by them both at a meeting held at Mr. Woodall's on 20th January—since then I have had several interviews with them, and referred them to the section of the Act by which they were bound to give me every infor<lb></lb>mation—Bultitude stated that he had given up everything to the receiver, Mr. Waddell, and Rummell acquiesced in it—I asked them whether they had anything which ought to be in my possession, but I never could get any information from them; they declined to give me any—they said that all the particulars were contained in their statement—I asked Bultitude to go through all the books with me, but he put it off; a day was fixed at last, and they attended—I told Bultitude that the books had not been posted since April, 1879, and it was impossible to ascertain what were his cash receipts or the goods obtained, and invited him to come and assist me in making them up, but he refused to give me information; Rummell also refused, but said he had told me all—I asked them about the receipt of money three or four months previous to the failure, but they each said they did not know—I knew of the Alliance Bank; I asked them if there was another banking account, and they said no—I found out the account at the Central Bank quite by accident, through the crossing of a cheque of Mr. Aldridge's—the assets amount to 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the extreme limit, and the liabilities 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—among the papers found on Bultitude are some particulars of goods sent to Sharp's Wharf, and the receipts of the wharfingers—I produce the ledger, order-book, stock-book, and letter-book—the last entry in the order-book is on October 28, but I do not know whether it is an order or not—the last account, except F. B. Wheeler's, is in April, 1879—Wheeler's entries go up to June, 1879—the policy of in<lb></lb>surance by Wheeler mentioned in the bankrupt's evidence is of no value whatever—Wheeler brought an action upon it, and the Counsel threw up their briefs, and the case has not been heard of since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first saw the bankrupts at Mr. Waddell's office on 20th January, 1880—I did not learn whether they had been in communica<lb></lb>tion with Mr. Waddell, but I suppose so, because he was their receiver—I learned that day that they had placed their books in his hands—I found that a statement of affairs had been prepared; it was handed in at the meet<lb></lb>ing, and I read it through immediately I got it—I found an account of Smith and Collins, but not what I should call a full and particular account—I read "Holds as security the following dock warrants for goods lying at Sharp's Wharf, 17 barrels of varnish 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," also "Cartwright and Co., Great St. Helens, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>accounts—I asked them on 26th January for further particulars, but there was no entry in the books to which they could refer me, nor can I find any entry to lead me to suppose they could have given me any information—I asked Mr. Waddell, who turned me over to a clerk—I knew pretty well what was in the books, because it was gone into fully at the first meeting on 20th January—I did not decide to prosecute till early in February—I went to the solicitors to the estate, Messrs. Philbrick and Corpe, the day after I got the books, as they seemed very imperfect—I asked Mr. Waddell's clerk if I had everything, who said that all he had had been given over to me, and I got no information from Mr. Waddell—I asked the bankrupts whether they had any reversionary interest or policies, and whether they had given up their banking account, and all their books, papers, shares, stocks, and securities—I asked them at Guildhall whether they had any banking account, and they said "No"—I presume Mr. Ditton was acting as solicitor to the bankrupts at the time I came to know them—the bill of sale to Buck was not settled in bankruptcy; it was settled with me—a claim for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for rent was made by Rummell's mother, and a distraint was put in—the balance over the furniture was very small; it may have been 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had the furniture valued, and gave her credit for it, and she gave me the difference—I gave Mr. Ditton notice not to part with the dock warrants—I wrote to Mr. Collins and Dr. Smith—Dr. Smith was examined at Guildhall—Kichardson and Co. are the proprietors of Sharp's Wharf, and these are their receipts for the goods lodged there—I went there in February, or it may have been January, and found certain entries—my report is on the file—Mr. Ditton sent me notice of the marriage settlement almost as soon as I was appointed trustee, and also of the bill of sale—I took possession of both houses, and am in possession of the furniture now—nevertheless action had been commenced when I became trustee—Mr. Ditton had charge of it—Mr. Garford is a creditor for over 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the account is ruled off in the ledger, as if they owed him nothing, but they return him as a creditor for 2,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he has proved for 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd; I could not stop him from proving, but I have not admitted his claim; I have seen his books, and they show that the claim he sent to me is a true one, which is for 3,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor in the City, and have prac<lb></lb>tised there a great many years—from the time the defendants started in business I have been more or less acquainted with their affairs—I have known Rummell almost from his boyhood—his sister married my brother 15 years ago, and she afterwards became Mrs. Bultitude—Rummell was not articled to me, but he was in my office for some years—he had money coming to him when he came of age—he has a mother, his father has been dead some years—instead of coming to the law Rummell went to America for a time, then he came back and went into business in the City—I did not know Bultitude up to the time of Rummell's starting in business with him—Rummell had no practical experience of the business—Bultitude was for some years in a confidential position with Mr. Garford, not exactly a clerk, manager or something of that sort—at the time Rummell was enter<lb></lb>ing into business with Bultitude I saw Bultitude—as I understood, Mr. Garford gave them a part of his business, transferred a part of his business only, and gave them unlimited credit—Rummell had a reversion Which wilt be some day of some value—I don't think they had much capital to start with—I think they were chiefly depending on the credit Mr. Garford gave them—I don't know what expectations Bultitude had—Mr. Garford gave them credit up to the very last—at the time of their stoppage, Mr. Garford's solicitor was Mr. Philbrick, who is now the solicitor in this procedure—the claim of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Garford is, I think, part of the 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. referred to in the statement of affairs, and in this indictment—in June or July, 1879, Mr. Garford was anxious to assist them by enabling them to acquire the whole of his business and business premises—I believe they are very extensive premises; I have never seen them—it is a very old established business—I found that from time to time they required assistance, and I have lent them small sums, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and so on, which I got back, and then helped them again—about 28th August, 1877, they applied to me for a loan of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, and I saw Dr. Smith, a client of mine, on the subject—Dr. Smith sent me his cheque, and I paid mine to Bultitude and Co., taking from them a promissory note for the amount, and I think there was a collateral security for the same amount by Mrs. Eummell, the mother; at any rate, there was a charge on his reversion to the same amount—I think the mother became security for the amount; I think her name was on the bill—she assisted them, more or less, during the business—the bill was at three months, and was renewed from time to tone—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the papers relating to it—I also lent them 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>for Mr. Collins, of Tunbridge, one of my clients—that was paid to them by a cheque on my bank, the same as the other—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Mr. Collins's cheque to me, less the discount—it is for 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that was the exact amount I gave them, deducting 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for interest—I think I took from them a bill of exchange for that—I do not know anything of Mr. Cartwright—I know he is a connection of the Rummells, but I never saw him till after this transaction arose—I helped them to enter into this contract with Mr. Garford in June, it was carried out by Messrs. Mark by and Stewart, solicitors—they had to pay an instalment of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I paid that for them, and they repaid me a few days afterwards—it was understood that they were to repay me immediately, as I advanced the money, because Mr. Garford wished to have the agreement settled—at that time the agreement was certainly regarded as a beneficial one; it was to take over the whole of an old-established business—I found that in March they were sued by Risley and Co., in respect of a parcel of goods which had been sent abroad—I received instructions to defend the action—that went forward till October, 1879; it was set down for trial—I was informed by Bultitude that there would be no difficulty whatever in getting the money to carry out Mr. Garford's agreement; I don't know in what way—Mr. Wilson himself subsequently told me he thought it would be worth a large sum—it was a seed-crushing business and oil mills, freehold waterside premises, called Garford's Wharf, with a river frontage of 115 feet—the defendants had large transactions with a Mr. Wheeler—there was a fire on Wheeler's premises; I don't know the date—I was con<lb></lb>sulted by the defendants with respect to a claim they had against Wheeler—it was settled at 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I took a charge by Wheeler dated 22nd October, 1879; he was unable to meet it; I don't know how it comes to be put at 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the statement of affairs; Mr. Waddell will be able to explain that, I think—the non-payment of that money was the substantial ground of their embarrassment—I pressed on the action against the Company on the fire policy as far as I could—there was nothing to make me or Bultitude suspect that there was any impropriety in the nature of Wheeler's claim against the Company; if I had I should not have taken it up—the Company substantially raised the defence that the claim by Wheeler was fraudulent, in the sense that he claimed more than there were goods on the premises—the action was carried on afterwards by Mr. Leslie, so I suppose he had faith in it—I don't know the exact date of the fire which took place on the defendant's premises—I know about the account being opened at the Central Bank in Whitechapel—the defendants consulted me about some bills which they had not been able to meet promptly, and they asked me about the attachment in the Lord Mayor's Court, and I advised them to open a banking account out of the City—in the Mayor's Court the simple commencement of an action enables an account to be attached—there was a bill for 749<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated November 22nd, drawn by Mr. Garford on the defendants, and Mr. Garford called on me with Rummell about the time it matured—that was the only time I saw him—we had a long conversation about the matter, and Mr. Garford took a charge on the amount he expected to get claimed by Wheeler, to cover himself for the moneys due—of course he knew perfectly well how the defendants stood at the time—the banking account in Whitechapel was opened under my instructions—you will find two cheques of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn on that</p>

               <p>bank given to me—the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was on account of costs, and the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in exchange for one I had given them—there was an action of Risley against them, and there was a correspondence with Johnson and Upton as to a settlement of the expense of a commission to take evidence in India—they had a set off of 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, and there was a dispute as to that—I saw the defendants as to the settlement of that action—I had not at that time learnt from them that they thought they were unable to carry on their business; on the contrary, they paid 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in settlement of that claim, and if I had had any doubt of their being able to go on I should certainly not have advised them to pay that money—I had heard the proposed marriage between Bultitude and Mrs. Rummell spoken of months before, but in June I was formally consulted about it—I am one of the trustees of the property, and Mrs. Rummell consulted me about a settlement—I advised that there should be a settlement, and it was carried out—there was a reversion of considerable value, and she had an income, not a very large one, settled on herself and child—Bultitude's furniture was to form part of the settlement—I found there was an execution put in on one of Risley's bills, which they were unable to meet, and I pressed them for payment of the principal due to Dr. Smith and Mr. Collins, and as they could not pay I pressed for security, and they gave me dock warrants on goods which they had at Sharp's Wharf—that was as security for my own costs as well, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not at all aware at the time I got that security that they would be unable to carry on their business; I believed they would pull through; there was no reason, so far as I was aware, why they should not—I was negotiating with Johnson and Upton up to 24th or 25th November to hold over the execution—I asked Mr. Waddell to call a private meeting of creditors—when I found they would not withhold I advised the defendants to place their books in the hands of Mr. Waddell, and knowing that Mr. Philbrick was the solicitor in many matters for Mr. Garth, a large printer, I said, "The best thing you can do is to place yourselves in the hands of Mr. Philbrick," and I took them to him and asked him to take it in hand—at this time I had consulted a gentleman of very high standing, and entrusted the agreement to him, that he might see one or two merchants of the City privately, to see whether arrangements could be made to find the necessary capital to carry on the business—that was from instructions from the defendants—I believe every one at that time thought the business was worth 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I know Mr. Wilson told me he thought so, and that was undoubtedly the impression of the defendants—I think the petition was presented on 30th December, and I must have taken them to Mr. Waddell at least a week before, because the first object was to call a private meeting and explain the position of the matter, particularly as to Mr. Garford's agreement—the meeting was not called—I asked Mr. Waddell to see Mr. Garford and ask him whether he would have any objection to his business being turned into a small limited company—Mr. Waddell proposed a statement of affairs for the first meeting at the end of December—Mr. Leslie was appointed receiver at the end of January—I did not know that any portion of the warrants was unpaid for at the time I got them; I asked the question, and Rummell told me they were paid for, and I am satisfied that he believed they were, and I believe they are now—I wrote this letter to Mr. Leslie, dated 14th February, 1880 (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I was present at the examination at the Bankruptcy Court—no cash account has been prepared.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think five or six charges were brought up at the police-court from time to time, and they all fell to pieces—I have been acting as solicitor for the defendants ever since they have been in business, about two years—the only action that I defended for them I think was Risley's—I don't think they were ever served with a writ till very shortly before this difficulty arose—with regard to Risley, I had notice of trial, I think, in June, 1879—I think the banking account in Whitechapel was opened before the execution was put in—I never saw their cash-book; I never went to the place till after it was in the hands of Mr. Waddell, in fact I did not know where it was—they told me they could not meet Garford's acceptance on 8th November—I was only consulted about one bill of Garford's—the opening of the account at Whitechapel was entirely to avoid the attachment in the Mayor's Court, that was the single object with which I advised it—there was no object of concealment, I think the account will show that, because there are cheques drawn for wages and all sorts of things—I never saw the account till after the meeting—Garford was in liquidation, after this liquidation commenced—it was long after Wheeler's fire that I spoke about trying to form Garford's into a limited company; it was a week or 10 days prior to the petition—I have, the entry here, December 29, that was the day before the petition—the arrangement was, that 2,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid to the vendor by 28th February in instalments of 98<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid for the good will, but that extends over—it was not intended to pay it down, and that included the lease—I think I heard of Garford going into liquidation after the meeting at Mr. Waddell's—I had nothing to do with Garford's liquidation—I cannot refer you to any entry in my diary that I had directions in June to prepare a settlement; I have looked for it; there is no such entry—I was not aware that Catlin's goods were put into the settlement—I should, not have per<lb></lb>mitted it had I known that the goods were Catlin's—I knew nothing about Powell's goods being put into the settlement—I had nothing to do with the settlement—I gave the instructions to a gentleman in my office to prepare it, and I recommended that the lady should be advised by Messrs. Wilde, Barber, and Brown—I think I attested one or two of the signatures, and that was all I had to do with it—I wrote the letter of 17th December, 1879 (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I have made out some of my bill of costs; my clerk's estimate was over 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I am told that is under-estimated; there is Risley's action, I have never had anything for that—I have not got the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. dishonoured cheque of Bultitude and Co. here, I can get it—as to the taking out the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, I knew nothing of that at the time—I have seen one of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and it bears the signature of Mrs. Bultitude before her marriage—I sent this notice of 18th December to the Alliance Bank request<lb></lb>ing them to hold the funds for my 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe it was the next day that I took the warrants to protect myself—I have been told that they are not worth more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know how much Dr. Smith's were, not enough to pay his debt, I believe, which was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for interest; he would be very glad to hand them over against his debt—I know nothing of the other security for Cartwright—he is some connection of Mrs. Bultitude, and is one of the trustees—I don't know the value of Collins's warrants; I have not the—slightest idea; the trustee can have them at any time, both Dr. Smith and Mr. Collins offered to give them up—the bill of sale to Buck was prepared in my office—I read it over, because the Act requires it, that is all I know about it—I should not have put in Green and Co.'s goods if I had known of it.</p>

Having missed money repeatedly from the drawer of the table in my dining room I took the number and dates of some notes, and put them in my drawer, and locked it. On the morning of the 4th of April, about nine o'clock, I told them it was all right. In the evening I told them again one of them was missing, No. 0012, dated the 4th of March; I applied to the office, and two officers came with me to search all the servants, they found the one pound note in the possession of the prisoner in a box in his table drawer.</p>

             the officer, and in the prisoner's drawer we found this note. Mr. Chippenden said it was his. I asked him how he came by this note, he said he pawned a seal in Bishopsgate Street, and got the note, there at the office the prisoner was put off for a rehearing for him to bring the pawnbroker. The pawnbroker knew nothing of it, he did not appear.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

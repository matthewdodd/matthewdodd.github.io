I am not the housekeeper—I keep a little shop in the front-parlour, and sleep in the back—no one but me occupies them—when I go out I lock them up—I know the prisoner—she is the wife of a policeman—she lived at No. 7, Short-street, opposite me—she visited me sometimes—on Monday afternoon, the 16th of Jan., at ten minutes past four o'clock, I was talking to the prisoner at my own door—I told her I was going to Stepney—she said as I was going out she would not detain me, and she went home—I then went up stairs to Mrs. Saxon who lodges on the second-floor—I came down again between five and six to get my bonnet to go out, and when I came down I missed my things, and saw the back-parlour window was taken out—it had been fastened in<lb></lb>side—a square of glass was broken to enable the party to undo it, and the broken glass was lying on a box—the window stood outside, in the back-yard, on the ground, and the washing-tub was turned bottom upwards under the window—that would enable a person to get in—I had left my clothes in the drawer when I went up stairs, and when I came down they were gone—I missed the articles stated, which are worth from 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to me.</p>

She came to me on Monday afternoon, the 16th of Jan., between five and six o'clock—I went out, and as I returned soon after, the door of the house was open—I turned round to shut the door, and found some one behind it—I cried out, "Good God, who is there?"—it was the prisoner—she said, "I have knocked three times; I can make no one hear; I wanted a halfpennyworth of pins"—I said I would call Mrs. Bugden down—she said, "No, never mind, by and bye will do, as I am not in want of them now"—I then went up stairs, and left the prisoner in the passage.</p>

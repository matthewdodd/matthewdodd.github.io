               <p>FREDERICK BATWOOD. On the night of the 25th of November, I had been drinking, but was sensible. I met the prisoners near <placeName id="t18261207-204-crimeloc1193">New-street, Covent-garden</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you not as drunk as you could be? A. I was sensible - it was about half-past one o'clock in the morning; I had been at a public-house in Chandos-street at eight o'clock at night; I paid 2s. as my share - there might be ten pots of beer amongst us - I was kept in the watch-house till Monday morning, as the watchman thought me in liquor - 14s. 6d. was found on Parker; my money was not marked.</p>

            . I saw the prosecutor in the street - three persons went up to him; I believe Parker to be one of them; I saw the prisoners run away - he then said he was robbed, and called Watch! I pursued and took them; Parker said he had but 2d.; he took off his cap, and threw something into the road - I then thought it was money, but cannot tell; 2s. 5d. was found on one prisoner, and 14s. 6d. on the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he arm in arm with them? A. Yes; he was insensible - I kept him in the watch-house from Saturday night till Monday morning.</p>

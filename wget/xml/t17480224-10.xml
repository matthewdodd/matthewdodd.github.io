            . I am husband to the East India Company. In August last there was some tea landed from Holland by licences from the Treasury: on the 14th of September one Roberts a carman was taken up by order of the East India Company, and Roberts gave an account of the injuries done to the company. I know nothing of the Prisoner, but before my Lord Mayor he confessed the taking the tea.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he charged with?</p>
               <p>Day. He was charged with taking the tea out of the cart at Botolph wharf; he said he did take the tea, but that he did not take it out of the chests.</p>

               <p>Q What is he?</p>
               <p>Roberts. He <rs id="t17480224-10-deflabel58" type="occupation">drives a cart</rs>

               <p>Q. Did he drive any cart with tea?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Yes; and the chests were generally pretty much broke, and the tea run out; they are often broke when they come out of the carts by rubbing against the ships.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasioned the tea to run out?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Because the corners of the chests were broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the Prisoner do any thing in order to get the tea out?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Yes, I have seen him take the tea out several times, by making little holes on the top of the chests, and so shook the tea out into his hand, or into the cart, and then take it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him do it in the month of August last?</p>
               <p>Roberts . I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he take away?</p>
               <p>Roberts. As much as he could well carry in his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he take at a time?</p>
               <p>Roberts. A pound, or three quarters of a pound, sometimes half a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him take half a pound in the month of August?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Yes, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What, not out of the chests?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Yes, some out of one chest, and some out of another.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you along with him?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Yes, there are two in a cart to load it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him in August?</p>
               <p>Roberts. I was there one day, and I saw him take some several times as well as I.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the tea?</p>
               <p>Roberts. He sold it; he sold one parcel to one

Mr. Day came, and the Prisoner said that he and two more were concerned: the Prisoner at the bar made his escape, and I had a warrant to take him up; he absconded himself for some time, and I took him at the tackle porters alehouse: they used to shake the chests, and put the tea into their bosom. I found it was a growing evil, and I thought it necessary to endeavour to prevent it. They have made their brags that they have got six or seven shillings a day by it: the Prisoner said he had been guilty, but he did not say as to any time, or any quantity, he said he sold some to

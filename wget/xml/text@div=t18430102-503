                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live with Mrs. Ann Westgate, in Devon-shire-street, Commercial-road. The prisoners took a furnished room in the house—I let it to Pratt, who said her name was Dowsett—her husband came at night, and they lived there together for more than five months—I went into their room on the 23rd of Dec.—Pratt was out—Dowsett was lying down on the bedstead—the bed looked very thin—I asked Dowsett where my flat irons were—he said he did not know any thing about them, I must look for them—I could not find them—on Saturday night, the 24th, I looked in the bed, and missed the bolster and pillow—most of the feathers were gone out of the bed—on Sunday afternoon, I saw Dowsett in Mrs. Westgate's room, and he said he had a great deal of trouble with his wife, and she was not his wife.</p>

On Tuesday, the 12th of July, when I got up in the morning I left my watch under my pillow; it is gold, and cost me eight guineas about a fortnight before. I missed it about half-past eleven o'clock, when I went to look for it, it was gone, and my bed was made - I am sure I left it under my pillow. The prisoner was a servant in the house, and made the beds. I went and asked her in about five minutes if she had seen any thing of it - she said she had not.</p>

            . I am usher at Westminster school, and know that Mr. Grant's house is in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster. A little before ten o'clock on Wednesday, the 13th of July, I heard of this loss, and at twelve o'clock I was present when the prisoner's box was searched; she had the key, and unlocked it herself, and began to take the things out - it seemed to contain nothing but rags, a bundle of which she put under her arm; one of the servants who stood by, said, "We had better open that bundle, Sir;" she took it from under her arm, and the watch fell out on the ground; she at first denied all knowledge of it. I neither threatened or promised her any thing; she at last fell on her knees, and said if I would let her go she would leave town, and never come again. When she found I had sent for a constable, she said, "I suppose the devil prompted me to take it." I kept it in my possession till I gave it to the constable.</p>

The officer gave him up; I told him what I had found at his lodgings; he admitted the trunk might be found there, because he found the trunk in Aldersgate street before Christmas, he said it was open, he hardly knew what was in it; I said you have had it repaired since, have not you; he said no; I found the old hasp in one of the drawers; here is another hasp had been put on; he said he had not broke it open, it was open before. I took Seton on the 13th of June; I found him at a public house door in Nightingale lane. I told him the occasion of my taking him; he said he was quite innocent, he knew nothing of it. I have known him for some time; I believe he has something coming in.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not find this man with Worboys - A. No.</p>

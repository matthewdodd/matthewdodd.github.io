                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Mansfield-street, Kingsland-road. On the 20th of November, I was at the Dun Horse public-house, Kingsland-road, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I had two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-notes in my pocket—I called for a pipe of tobacco, and took one of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes from my pocket in mistake, thinking it was a bit of paper—I broke it in two, and gave one part of it to the boy to go to the fire to get me a light—he did so, and I could not light my pipe with it—I then gave him the other part of the note, he took that to the fire, and then he said it was part of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I directly put my hand to my pocket, and found I had taken the note in mistake—I took the part of the note and gave it to a man named Reynolds—he saw what number it was, and gave it to me again—I was looking to see the number, and the prisoner who was sitting there came across the room and said, "I can read, I can tell you the number"—he made a grasp at the note, took it out of my hand, and put it into his pocket—I took hold of him and there was a noise—the landlord came in and sent for an officer—I gave the prisoner into custody—the note has not been found.</p>

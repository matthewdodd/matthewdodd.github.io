                  </hi>. I am master of the Middlesex Society School in Cannon-street-road. On Sunday, the 12th of Jan., I left the school about six o'clock in the evening—I went to church with the boys. I locked the door, and gave the key to my wife, who went to Trinity Episcopal chapel, opposite the school—I left nobody in the house—I returned about half-past eight—my wife had not come home—I stood at the gate till she came and opened the door for me—she called me to get a light, and we found the front room strewed all over with papers—two tea-caddies were broken open, also two trunks, and their contents strewed about the room—I missed a time-piece from the house, a brown cloth cloak, with a cape, an umbrella, a clothes-brush, a brooch, seven Britannia-metal and three silver tea-spoons—the two room doors upstairs had been locked, and the keys taken out—they were found wide open—a person at the corner of Chapman-street, if he stood within five or six yards of the corner where the lamp-post is, might see my house door—they must have opened the door with skeleton keys.</p>

On Sunday night, the 12th of Jan., about eight o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Chapman-street, Cannon-street-road, on the same side of the way as the lamp-post—I was not near the lamp-post, but standing against where the barrow stood—I could see the door of the school-house, and saw Mr. Crawcour come to the door with a light—he stood against the door inside, and had a candle in his hand—he looked about, then went in again, closed the door, and let two men out—one was the prisoner Hankins—I knew Crawcour, the Jew, before, about Cross-street—I knew Hankins before, about there—he had a bundle with him—the other man had nothing—they went down William-street, and about two minutes after, Crawcour came out after them—I knew both the prisoners before by sight—I had seen them together two or three times walking up and down Cannon-street-road, and Salter-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a toll-collector at St. George's-gate, Cannon-street-road. I know Cummings—I did not tell him he had better say he had made a mistake about Mr. Crawcour—I met him at the corner of New-road, between twelve and one o'clock at night, last Wednesday week, and said, "Halloo, young gentleman, what do you do out at this time? it is late to be out"—he said, "I am frequently out as late as this, I have been check hunting at the Pavilion theatre" (to get a check from somebody who came out of the house)—I said, "What did you do riding up with that <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> the other morning?"—he said, "I have a case on at the Thames<lb></lb>police"—I said, "What is it about?"—he said, "For robbery; did not you see that <hi rend="italic">swell</hi> inside? that was one of them"—I said, "Why he is a gentleman, a surgeon, living in the Highway, you most be mistaken"—he said, "No, I am not mistaken"—I said, "I think you are, he is a gentleman, and has plenty of money, and would not do such a thing"—he said, "Well, as I have said it, I had better <hi rend="italic">stick</hi> to it, had not I, Mr. Woolman?"—I said, "No, I would not if I was not sure"—that is all that passed—I did not try to persuade him to say he was mistaken.</p>

On the 17th, before I returned, I had information that my house had been robbed. It appeared to me, on my arrival, by marks of violence on the door, that it had been forced; when I got into the house, I perceived that all the articles named in the indictment were gone, the sixty yards of carpeting I immediately missed from the stairs; a bed, worth five pounds; a lookingglass, worth two pounds; a set of bed furniture, worth two pounds, and all the other articles. I saw these things on the morning of the 15th, in the possession of Sapwell. I came to town between the hours of ten and eleven in the morning.</p>

            . I am an officer of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100034"></xptr>City of London. I know Mr. Hart's house. On the evening of Wednesday, the 13th of December, about eight o'clock, I received information of a cart going up Bishopagate-street. I took Gildersleave and Bengough with me. When I came, the cart was coming out of Sweet Apple-court, which is about ten minutes walk from the prosecutor's house; I searched the cart, but found nothing in it. I then left Gildersleave and Bengough in the court with the cart; I then went into Pollock's room; I knew his person; he lived in that neighbourhood; I found Pollock in a room in that neighbourhood; when I opened the door, Pollock was behind the door; Neale was in the same room, standing up opposite to the door, and Harris was sitting by the fire place, and there was no fire in the grate. I then called to Gildersleave to assist me in taking them; as soon as he came in, Bengough came in, and told me that the man in the cart had made his escape. This room is in a house nearly opposite to where the cart stood. I then asked Pollock if the things on the ground were his things; (those were the things which are the subject of the present indictment;) I asked him was that his room, and he said it was, and he gave me the key of it, and he said that the man who had made his escape, had brought the goods there. I then asked Neal how he came there, and whether he knew any thing of the goods, and he said he knew nothing about them, he came to see Pollock. I asked Harris, and he told me the same. I secured them, and searched them; but found nothing at all upon them. On searching the room, I found all the things named in the indictment. I then secured the prisoners, and we took them to the watchhouse, and returned back to Pollock's room. In the room Gildersleave found four pick-lock keys, in my presence, in the dresser, and a bunch of keys besides, which were not picklock keys; keys of different sizes; but no one of them would open Hart's house. In the chimney I found an iron crow; it was not visible until I got up the chimney; there was a cupboard by the side of the chimney, and the crow was shoved through; I found part in the cupboard and part in the chimney; it could not be visible in the cupboard; I found nothing else at all. I went to Mr. Hart's house on the Friday following; there is a mark of something on the door; I found an impression on the door, which appeared to me to be matched by the end of the crow; Mr. Hart was present at the time. I tried some of the pick-lock keys. I am not able to tell you how the persons obtained entrance.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the Wednesday evening at about ten minutes before eight, I was parading up and down Bishopsgate-street. I went up Sweet Apple-court and saw the cart standing empty facing of Pollock's house. I looked about it, and could perceive no number on it. I immediately went to Mr. Sapwell, and informed him, and then he came along, and brought me and Bengough. Then the cart was coming out of the court, upon which Mr. Sapwell stopped it; and searched it, but found nothing in it. I staid below to mind it, with Bengough, and soon after Sapwell called out for me to come and assist him to secure the prisoners. I know nothing more than what Sapwell has related.</p>

One man was leading the horse, Pollock was some distance behind, and he paid me the two pence for going up that way. The cart went up Sweet Apple-court laden; that was a quarter before eight o'clock.

               <p>Harris's Defence. I left my work at four o'clock, and had got some eggs to take to a gentleman. I went down to his house, but he was not there. I heard of a Free and Easy; I was in company with this young man Neale, and asked him to come and spend the evening with me at the Free and Easy; he said he had got no money, but however, he went along with me, and going through Sweet Applecourt, and seeing a light in Pollock's room, I said we will go and see the wooden legged man, as he is at home, and have a bit of fun with him. We went in, and had not been in five minutes, when Sapwell came in. That is all I wish to say.</p>

He brought the goods to my house, and requested me to let him leave them in my house for one week; immediately when he had put them in, Mr. Sapwell came in and asked who the place belonged to, and I told him it belonged to me, and they immediately took me into custody.</p>

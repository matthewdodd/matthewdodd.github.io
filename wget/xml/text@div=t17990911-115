               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Whether there was a deficiency of stock, or not, you cannot say, without having resort to your books? - A. Not to a certainty, we cannot.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you got your books here to-day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN COOK sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the officers of Shadwell-office: I took up Mellish, the accomplice, on Sunday the 16th of June, in the evening; and, in consequence of his information, on the 24th, I went to Mr. Welsford, and received this stick, with a hook at the end of it, (produces it); on Monday the 17th, I went to the house of Mrs. Hayes, in Golden-lane, and there a piece of calico was delivered by Mrs. Hayes, to Haynes the officer, in my presence; I apprehended the two prisoners at St. Catherine's, on Monday the 17th, Haynes, Holebrook, and Brown were with me; we secured them, and Brown searched them. As we were conveying them to the office, we found, upon Robertson, a hook, similar to that which has been produced.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CULLEN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am servant to Messrs. Welsford; This is the stick that I found in our warehouse, about a fortnight or three weeks before the officers came to our house, it laid upon the calicos in the warehouse; the square of glass had been broke some weeks before the robbery.</p>
               <p>JAMES MELLISH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. About the beginning of June last, me, Robertson, and Smith, agreed to go to a house in Lad-lane; we went, and tied a handkerchief round a stick, to break the window without making a noise, that was between nine and ten o'clock; we then went away from the house to the Wilkes's Head, in Wilkes's-court, without doing any thing further, and there we remained till half past eleven; then we returned to Lad-lane, and concealed ourselves in an alley, till the watchman went past one o'clock; then we fetched the stick which we had concealed in the alley, and went to the house of Mr. Welsford, where we had broke the square of glass; we took the said stick, and hauled up two pieces of calico, while the watchman was going his rounds; I put the calico into a bag, took it to Honey-lane-market, and concealed it there; we returned to Mr. Welsford, and the watchman was sitting at the door; we walked a little way up and down Cheapside, till the watchman went off at four o'clock; then we returned to the said house again, and hauled up another piece of calico, with a hook and a stick; I am not positively sure whether we hauled up any more or no; we immediately went to the concealment, and took the goods away; Robertson and Smith took them to one Mrs. Hayes, in Golden-lane, to dispose of, between five and six o'clock in the morning, and they told me that Mrs. Hayes had given them ten-pence a yard; they said Mrs. Hayes opened the back door and let them in with it; they said there were twenty-one yards in each piece; they brought some money, and were to call for the remainder in the course of the day; we went to the same house three or four times afterwards, and we lost the stick, it was dropped down into the area, through the same square of glass that was broke; this is the said stick, and the said hook, and no other.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What trade are you? - A. No trade particular; I used to get my livelihood by the sea, two or three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How have you got your livelihood since that? - A. I have been two years in confinement for that that I was never guilty of; people swore against me, and said I had stole a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. That was a sad charge against an honest man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.But twelve honest gentlemen thought otherwise and convicted you? - A. Yes; but I was green at that time, or I could have proved an alibi.</p>
               <p>Q. You got your back flogged, I believe, besides two years confinement? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you returned to your old trade again? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.And you will get discharged if you hang these men? - A. It is not my wish to hang them; I wished to retrieve my character to the Magistrates, and go to sea again.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you never a soldier? - A. Yes, I was once; it was about six or seven months back, when I enlisted, and I did not join the regiment.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an officer of Shadwell-office: I apprehended the two prisoners at St. Catherine's, on Monday the 17th of June, at a house where girls of the town, and people of that description resort, it is not a public-house, they were sitting together; we handcuffed them in the room, and in bringing them to the office, I perceived Robertson trying to pull something out of his right-hand waistcoat-pocket; I immediately stepped round him, put my hand in his pocket, and found this hook, which he was endeavouring to get out of his pocket; it had a cork at the end of it. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Q. Would it be too sharp to carry in the pocket without a cork? - A. I should think so.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HAYNES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an officer belonging to Shadwell-office: On Sunday the 16th of June, I apprehended Mellish, in company with Cook and Holebrook; the next day, in the morning, I went to Mrs. Hayes's, in Golden-lane, in search of some calicos; I found one piece with a bit taken out of it by some sharp instrument or other. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>MARY HAYES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am the wife of Henry Hayes, No. 6, Golden-lane: I delivered that piece of calico to Haynes, the officer; I bought it of the prisoner, Smith, I believe I had seen him before; I bought it, with more calicos, between six and seven o'clock in the morning; there was another man with him, but I don't think I should know him again; there were three pieces in the whole; I gave them one shilling a yard for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I take it for granted you are married? - A. Yes; and have been near ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept a shop all that time? - A. No, about nine months; I deal in old and new clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. And if an odd piece of calico is brought before your shop-hours you will buy it? - A. I did then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not taken up as a receiver? - A. No; they sent me a note, and I went to the Magistrate's.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body has said you gave but ten-pence a yard, it is false? - A. I gave a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it worth? - A. I leave that to your judgment.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, what is it worth? - A. I should suppose about twenty-pence.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever been threatened to be prosecuted for receiving stolen goods, unless you appeared here to-day? - A. Yes, I am sensible of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walsford. There is no mark upon the calico; we generally mark them in this part which is cut off; it appears to be of the exact quality of that which we missed; it is worth about twenty-one pence per yard.</p>
               <p>Robertson's defence. I am quite innocent of what I am charged with.</p>
               <p>Smith's defence. I am as innocent of it as the child unborn; I never saw the man in my life.</p>

On the 6th of June, at eight o'clock in the morning, I was informed this property was gone from the front parlour - the street door was kept open - the parlour door has a lock to it - I missed a tea-caddy, sugar basin, drawing-case, ink-box, and two ink-stands - I found some of them in pawn afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave quite a different statement at my first examination - he said nothing about breaking and entering - he said his doors were left open. Witness. The front door is always open - I know nothing about the parlour door, but it was wide open at half-past seven o'clock, and I shut it.</p>

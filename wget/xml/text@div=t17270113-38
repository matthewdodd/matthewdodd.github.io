             thus depos'd. The Prisoners came to my Shop about 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon, and wanted some printed Linnen, I called my Wife, being engaged on the other side of the Shop; afterwards I came and relieved her; the Prisoners were very difficult, as most such Customers are, I shewed them some, they said they liked the Fancy, but the Cloth was too thin. Randall said they should do no good to Night, so went away, and Murfey followed; I told my Wife I didn't like the Customers, and looking amongst my Goods I miss'd a Piece of printed Linnen: Murfey came back and offer'd one Penny a Yard more; whereupon I sent for a Constable and secured her. I saw Randall standing over the Way, who observing me coming towards her, avoided me by going into an House; I afterwards meeting her in the Street, stopt her, and found my Goods I had then mist in her Custody; at which Time another Piece dropt from her, which a Boy in the Street took up, and proved to be my Goods also; and a Mob arising, some Body said they believed she had more Goods about her: However, having brought her back, and got her and Murfey in a Coach, had them before a Justice; when as Randall was stepping out of the Coach she chanced to drop a Piece of Garlick Holland, which being mine, I had but small Suspicion, having shewed them none when in my Shop; but looking upon it I found my own Mark on it: But when we came before the Justice he happened to be indisposed, and could not take their Examination, but had them committed by another Justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Devon thus depos'd. I was standing at my Father's Door, and hearing Mr. Atkinson was robbed, I and another stopped Randall, and asked her what she had got, she answered what's that to you; at which Time I saw the Goods drop from her.</p>

             the Constable thus depos'd. I having the Prosecutor's Orders to secure the Prisoners, had them before Justice Railton, when I observ'd Randall to have something under her Petticoats very stiff, and thought it had been a Sword, but it happened to prove a Piece of Garlick Holland, which was the Prosecutor's. Randall confessed the Fast and said Murfey was innocent.</p>

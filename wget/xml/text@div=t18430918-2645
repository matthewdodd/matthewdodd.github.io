                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Stratford. On the 19th of Sept., about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was working on board a corn ship in the West India Dock—the prisoner was there—I had some words with him, and struck him first—he struck me several times with a bushel-strike, which is a round wooden thing, about eighteen inches long, on the arm and shoulder—I came up to my work again about six—when I had left off work I came outside the dock, and saw the prisoner again—I took hold of his collar with my left hand violently, and said, "Are you in the same</p>

               <p>temper now as you were inside?"—he said, "Let me alone"—I immediately let go of his collar—he went across from one side of the road to the other, and picked up a half brick from a clump of bricks—he threw it at me, and struck me on the head—I had ray cap on—it struck me on the cap, cut my head, and knocked me down—it made a wound in my head—I had a doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Seward and Capel. I was passing along by the West India Docks on this occasion, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor scuffling together—the prosecutor put himself in a fighting attitude—the prisoner immediately ran towards a stack of bricks which were on the pathway, and took up a half brick—the prosecutor ran towards him, I suppose to prevent him—the prisoner threw the brick as the prosecutor was going towards him—the prosecutor then—I cannot say whether it was from the brick, or as he was running, but he fell with his face downwards—I went up to him afterwards, and found him wounded on the head—while he was on the ground the prisoner threw two pieces of brick, apparently with all his force, and hit him on the back part of the head—several of the party then closed round them, and took the ma away.</p>

I was on board the barge with the prisoner and pro<lb></lb>secutor, and saw what happened, at four o'clock—I saw them at six, when they came out of the gates on leaving work—the prosecutor got hold of the prisoner, shook him, and dragged him across the road—the prisoner said, "Let me be, I don't want to have anything at all to do with you"—he wanted to get away from him—I went and got hold of the prosecutor, pulled him on one side, and wanted to keep peace between them—the prisoner stooped, got a piece of brick-bat, threw it at the prosecutor, and struck him with it—I had not hold of him at that time—I had separated them—the prosecutor was stooping to get a brick-bat, and said, "I can play at brick-bats as well as you"—the prosecutor fell when he was struck, and bled—the prisoner struck him again twice after he was down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Limehouse. On the evening of the 19th the prosecutor was brought to me—he was bleeding from two wounds at the back part of his head, apparently made by some blunt instrument—each wound was about an inch long—they were not deep or bad wounds—it might have been done by a brick or stone.</p>

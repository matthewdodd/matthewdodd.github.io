            's house; I have lived there about two years, or there away, it is a private house; I lost fourteen guineas and a half, in a purse, the 1st of February, Saturday, it was taken from my wife, out of her chest of drawers; the money was in a little box, in the bag, in the chest of drawers.</p>
               <p>Q.What time of the day was it taken? - I went out on duty about five o'clock in the evening; I am a patrole belonging to Bow street, I left this woman with my wife about a quarter of an hour before I went on duty, I never saw her before that day in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she there? - It appears she had seen my wife the day before, the 2d of February, being Sunday, about eleven o'clock, I cleaned myself, and was going to church, my wife asked me as I was going down stairs, where I was going? I told her I was going to church, and I had gone about half way, and she ran after me, and said John, have you got that little bag in your pocket? I said what bag? says she the little bag with the money; I went back with her, and it could not be found; says I to her, who has been here? says she, nobody but that Welch girl, the last night; I found the purse was gone, I went to my partner, Mr. Creedland, and we pursued the prisoner, and we found her in Queen's-court, Pimlico, in the house of one Mr. Davis; on Sunday about four o'clock, when I came to her, I asked her how she came to make my property away, and rob my wife of it? I said to Mr. Creed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190076"></xptr>land I wish you would search her; so Joseph Creedland began to search her pockets, and was proceeding to search her about the breast, and she refused, and said she would not be searched about her bosom, or bubbies, by him, or any man, she would be searched by a woman, accordingly Mrs. Davis, the person who was in the room went to search her bosom, and there she found a little pocket-book in her bosom, she spoke something to Mrs. Davis in welch; says Mrs.

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness, I was going through the park, and met the prisoner, and understanding she was a welch girl, I asked her what part she came from, and she came from a part that I happened to know; I wished to talk a little with her, about that part, and I asked her to call on me, and she called on me the next day, Saturday, just at the same time that my husband was going out on his duty, and I gave her some bread and cheese, and when I went out for a pint of beer to treat her with, she went and took that purse, with fourteen guineas, and a half in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was taken during the time that you went for the beer? - Because I never left her there but at that time; then the next morning I went to look for a cap in the drawer, and I saw the little box open, and my husband was just gone out to church, and I went out after him, and asked him if he had taken the purse with the money.</p>
               <p>Q.How long did she stay with you? - She stayed with me till between eight and nine o'clock, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a chest of drawers, was it? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the drawers locked? - No, they was open.</p>

             came to me and told me that he was robbed of fourteen guineas and a half in a purse, so we went to seek after the prisoner, and we found her in Queen's-court, Pimlico, and I asked, her what she had done with the money that she took from Mr. Harris the last night? she said she had not seen his money, nor ever had any of his money. I then told her I must search her pockets, she readily pulled her pocket outside of her petticoats, and I found three-pence halfpenny and two keys, then I told her I must search her bosom, she said she would not let me search her bosom nor no other man; I asked if she would let this good woman search her bosom, Mrs. Davis, and she readily consented and she brought out this little pocket book and she threw it down, and I picked it up and have kept it ever since.</p>

I said no, I said to her as you have got two bundles about you it will be dangerous that you will be robbed, you had better have a coach; I went out to see for a coach, and I could not get any, and I told the watchman that there was a young woman that was going to Wales at my house, so then he came down to my house, and he says to her it is better you stop here till the morning four o'clock, and I will go with you through the Park to see you safe, but now I can not; in the morning the watchman came at four o'clock, and we went to the White Horse cellar, and I asked if the Bristol coach was gone? it was half past four when we got there, they said it was gone ever since four o'clock; O! says she what shall I do? says I, is there no other coach will do? and we found that that there was another coach going again at half after five in the afternoon, and she took the coach for seventeen shillings and had change for a guinea, and had four shillings; I then said you had better go home with me now, and go to sleep,or else perhaps you will tumble over the coach, so she came back with me and had a bit of breakfast, and a bit of dinner; so at four o'clock she saw the Corporal

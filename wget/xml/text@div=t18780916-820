                  </hi>. My wife gave me a florin, which I found to be bad from its general appearance and sound on the stones—there was no ring in it and it rose very slowly—my wife pointed to the right outside my house, and I went out and saw the prisoner join another man and hand him something, and a piece of paper dropped at the time—they went on a little further and separated, and the prisoner went into a tobacconist's at the corner of Malt Street—I went in after him, and heard him say "Well, never mind"—as he was turning round to go out, I held up the bad florin and said, "Do you know anything about this?"—he looked at it, and said "No"—I said "You have been <hi rend="italic">smashing</hi> down the road"—he said he had not, and asked what right I had to stop him—I said "I can ill afford to loss 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., if you don't return my money I will smash your face"—I asked the person of the house to send for a policeman—she said she could not, she had not a soul in the house—I then said to him "Are you going to <hi rend="italic">turn up</hi> My 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." or "my two <hi rend="italic">bob</hi>?" I don't know which; and he said "No"—I caught hold of him then and hauled him outside away from the crockery and pulled him up to a fishmonger's next door, and asked him to send for a policeman—he said he had nobody to send—I then saw the prisoner with the florin in his hand—he put it in his mouth—I caught him by the throat and said "My boy, you shall never swallow that"—we struggled, I threw him over my hip, and we both fell, and our heads and shoulders went over the side of the roadway off the kerb, and the florin fell out of his mouth on to the iron grating, and then slipped down the grooves between—I said "If you don't give me my 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I will choke you"—I meant 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. good money I had given him—he said that he would give it me if I would let him go—I let him get up, still holding him by the throat, and he gave me four six<lb></lb> pences—I then let him go, saying "It is a sin to let you go"—I had appealed to the people round to fetch a constable, and nobody would do it—a con<lb></lb> stable came up shortly after, and I went with him down Bermondsey and Rotherhithe to see if we could find him in any public-house—I showed the florin to the constable, and I have since lost it—I put it in an old till at home.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Dean-street, Soho, and am an attorney. On the 31st of July, I was walking in Bow-street, Covent-garden—Mr. Har<lb></lb>rison came to me—I put my hand to my pocket, and missed my handker<lb></lb>chief—I had just before that observed the constable stop the prisoner—two handkerchiefs were taken from him and one was mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Long-acre. I spoke to Mr. Wood, in Bow-street—I was at my Printing-office in the neighbourhood—I could see what passed—I saw the prisoner near the prosecutor's person—I saw him deliberately draw his handkerchief from him—the impression on my mind was, that it was not done felonioulsy, but from a trick—the handkerchief was drawn out half a yard before he rolled it up—I went out to lay my hand on him—he bobbed down, and jumped up, and run down the whole length of Bow-street—I never saw any one run so fast in my life.</p>

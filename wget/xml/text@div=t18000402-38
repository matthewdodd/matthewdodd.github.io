             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am foreman at the shop where the prisoner used to work, Mr. Rice's, Whitecross-street, Cripplegate: On Sunday the 16th of February, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner at my master's shop-door, as I was going out to get shaved; he was crying, he had a bundle in his hand; I asked him, what was the matter; he said he had had an accident, his child was dead; I asked him how it came; he said he would tell me presently; he went up stairs to my lodgings in the foundery, we took a pint of beer up with us, and then he said, his wife persuaded him to make his escape; I told him, if he offered to make his escape, or run away, people would say he had done it wilfully; and being persuaded by me, he did not offer to go, he staid with me that day; then I said, I would go and try if I could not see his wife; I went to the place where they lodged, she was not at home, and I came and told him that she was not at home; he said he knew where she was gone to, and he went up the street with me towards his lodgings, and we met with her in Old-street, and all three came home to his lodgings together; she began to say what a sad accident it was, and she was in tears, and persuaded him to make his escape, in my presence, for she said she could not bear to see him any more in her sight; and the answer he made was, he should not make away with himself yet; he then left the room; I did not see the prisoner again, to speak to him, till the Tuesday evening following, the 18th; the Coroner's Inquest had sat that evening, I attended the Inquest, and after the verdict was given, I went, with one of the other men that works in our shop, to the prisoner's lodgings, his name is John Burbidge, he was not at the Coroner's Inquest; I called him by name, Jem; I will not be positive whether he answered the first time, or whether I called a second time, he was in bed, it might be then between ten and eleven o'clock; he raised himself up in the bed.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that the same lodgings he had lived at before? - A. No, it was in a court in Golden-lane; he raised himself up in the bed, and I said, Jem, they have brought it in accidental; and he said, you are not a joking, are you; I put out my hand to him, says I, there is my hand, for truth; and to the best of my knowledge, he pulled out a book, whether from some part of the bed, or whether from his pocket, I cannot say, it was a prayer-book consisting of prayers, and he said, he had been reading of that in the evening; then he rose from the bed, and put on his things, and came with me and Burbidge away from that house to the end of Shrewsbury-court, where he formerly lived, and I went up to the door of his lodgings with him; I went into the lodgings, and he stopped at the door, his wife came out into the passage and spoke to me; after that, I gave the prisoner a shilling to get something to eat, he said he was in want, he then left me; he was gone, to the best of my knowledge, about half an hour; while he was gone, I had some conversation with his wife, his cousin, and his cousin's wife; and I saw Burbidge again before I saw the prisoner; I went to the prisoner at the Swan, in Whitecross-street, where he went to get his refreshment; I said to him, so, Jem, you have been and owned to it; I asked him how he came to own to it; did you do it, says I, for the purpose; he said, yes; I said, with what; he said, it was aqua-fortis; I asked him where he bought it; he said, at Macdonald's; and I said, no, you did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the place he meant? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020030"></xptr>Yes, perfectly well; it is a chemist's and druggist's; he said, yes he did, and I told him they denied it; then I asked him whether he asked for that stuff or no; he said, yes, he asked for two-pennyworth of aqua-fortis; I said, did not they say any thing to you about it; he said, no, he laid the two-pence down, and said, if you do not like them I will change them; then I asked him if that was the bottle that he took from our shop on Saturday evening, and he said, yes; then, says I, you thought of doing it he said, he had thought of that two or three months past; that is all that past, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear at that time to be perfectly collected, and seem to have a recollection of what he was about? - A.Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be at all in liquor at that time? - A. I did not see that he was at all intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Have you ever seen him with this child? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was always very fond of the child? - A. He seemed always remarkably fond of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he worked in this foundery with you? - A. Ever since the 15th of last July.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a young man, very much liked among you, as a very worthy, civil, young wan? - A. Yes, a very civil young man, he always behaved very civil.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not a sort of a person from whom you would have expected an act of cruelty or barbarity? - A. No, he was not, very far from it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, when you went to him, after the Coroner's Inquisition, he was at another lodging? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not concealed at all there? - A.From his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. He and his wife had had some words, but you knew where he was? - A. No, I did not; only the man that got him the lodgings, Burbidge, I was informed by him where he was, and I went to him, thinking it would ease his mind.</p>

             sworn. - I am a fellow-workman with the prisoner, at Mr. Rice's; I had my beer with him, on Saturday the 15th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular that he did on the Saturday? - A. No; on the Sunday, I was informed of the accident, by Bell, the foreman; I then went to the prisoner's lodgings, but he was not at home, his wife was at home; I saw him in the afternoon of the Sunday, between four and five o'clock, or it might be sooner, I cannot say exactly; I saw him at the public-house, opposite the shop where we work.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he at that time sober? - A. He appeared to me very sober, I did not see that he had been drinking any thing at all; when I went first into the tap-room, I did not see him till he spoke to me; he said, Jack, is that you? then I called him out of the box where he was sitting with some more men; he came and sat along with me, I said to him, for God's sake, Jem, what have you been doing at home; I said, Jem, were you drunk last night, or were you out of your mind; I then asked him what he had been about; then I asked him where he had got the stuff from, he told me, from Mr. Macdonald's; he said, he went there and asked for two pennyworth of aqua-fortis; I said to him, Jem, had you any thought of this? - Yes, he says, I have had it in my head a long time, but he did not think, he said, it would kill the child so soon; then I got up out of the box and left him; I had seen the child that morning, dead, it looked very much burnt, sadly burnt about the mouth, and on the left hand, I think, but I am not quite certain which hand; I left the box where he was sitting, I would not sit with him any longer; I staid in the house till about nine o'clock, in another box; about that time, he asked me if I would go with him to get him a lodging; I went with him, and got him a lodging; I left him at his lodgings in Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the Coroner's Inquest? - A. I was not before the Jury, but I was in the house; it was a public-house in Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were in the house, how happened it that you were not examined? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you told any body of this conversation? - A. Yes, I had told Bell, and ever so many of my shop-mates.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. And yet you did not offer to tell what you knew before the Coroner? - A. No, I did not; I saw the prisoner again on the Tuesday night after the verdict; Mr. Bell and I went after him, we found him in bed at his lodgings, in Golden-lane; either Mr. Bell, or else me, said, Jem, every thing is all right, and he could hardly believe it; and Bell offered his hand to him, as much as to say that it was the truth, and he made answer and said, thank God Almighty, for I have been here a praying, and I am very hungry; he had a book, but I cannot read, I do not know what book it was, he got up, and went along with Bell and me.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he any money of his own, do you know? - A. I do not know; we then went to the end of Shrewsbury-court, and there I left him, very near his door, where he had formerly lived; I went to the house where my shop-mates were, opposite the shop where we work, that might be about ten o'clock at night; it was a public-house; I left that house, and I saw the prisoner again the same evening; I went with my shop-mates to the Swan, and there we found the prisoner; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020031"></xptr>him, Jem, are not you glad that you got off in this manner, he said, yes; and I asked him then, whether he had an intention, or a thought to destroy the child, he said, yes, and then I left him, and went to another part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Tuckey there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mrs. Tuckey come to fetch her husband home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing more after that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The conversation you had with him on the Sunday, you told Bell, before the Coroner's Jury sat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Bell of it on the Monday or the Tuesday morning? - A. I mentioned it on the Monday, but I do not know whether I told Bell of it on the Monday or not.</p>
               <p>Q.But you told Bell of it before the Coroner's Jury sat? - A. Yes; I told all my shop-mates of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Bell.) Q.Before the Coroner's Jury sat, had Burbidge told you that the prisoner said he had had it in his head a long time, but did not think it would kill the child so soon? - A. Not to my recollection; I do not remember that he told me of it till after the Jury had sat, when he told me of it at the Swan door.</p>
               <p>Q. But before the Jury had sat, he did not mention it to you? - A. Not to my knowledge; he might have mentioned it in the shop, but not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Barbidge.) Q. You say, you told your shop-mates of it on the Monday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you remember whether Bell was among those shop-mates to whom you mentioned it? - A. I cannot rightly say; I do not remember who was there.</p>
               <p>Q.What makes you sure that you had told Bell before the Coroner's Jury sat? - A. I cannot rightly say that Bell was there, when I told of the conversation that I had had with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were your shop-mates at that time? - A. In the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember telling Bell of it, on the Tuesday night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then it is most probable you had not told him before? - A. I do not rightly remember my telling him of it on the Monday.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM TUCKEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a brother workman with the prisoner; I went to the Swan public-house on the Tuesday night, after the Coroner's Jury had sat; Burbidge went with me, I believe it was somewhere about ten o'clock, we found the prisoner there, he was talking to Burbidge; I heard him say he gave it to the child on purpose, I did not hear him say what; my wife came in just afterwards to fetch me home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.How long have you worked with the prisoner? - A.Ever since about a week before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him with his child? - A. Many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see a man more fond of a child than he was? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not a very worthy humane man; I never saw any thing bad of him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not a man from whom you would have expected any barbarity? - A. No.</p>
               <p>MARY TUCKEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am the wife of the last witness; on the Tuesday evening, after the Coroner's Jury had sat, I went over to the Swan, to my husband, and the prisoner was there, talking to his shop-mates; I heard him say he gave a drop out of the spoon, and then a drop out of the bottle; it gave me such a turn, that I turned myself away, and heard no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Had you ever seen him with this child? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a very affectionate father, was he not? - A. Yes, very fond of his child indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think him a likely man to murder his child? - A. I do not think he did it on purpose.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.Why were you to question him? - A. We thought he would tell us the facts that he had told the other men before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.When you took him into the parlour, did you tell him he had better confess? - A. I believe some of his shop-mates did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know nothing about the apprehension? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a surgeon: In consequence of an application from the overseers of the parish, I went to see the body of a dead male child, in a court in Whitecross-street, on the morning of the day on which the Coroner's Inquest sat; the child appeared to be about six months old; the lips were discoloured; about the size of a small saucer upon its left breast, and about the size of a crown by the thumb, upon the back of the left hand; I then opened the body, but found that no part of the fluid which had stained the mouth and lips, and breast and hand, had got farther than the mouth; the appearances upon dissection proved the child to have been ailing; the liver was twice its natural<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020032"></xptr>size, and must, even before the stomach was half full, have produced vomitings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you able to judge from your observations, what was the immediate cause of the child's death? - A. The fluid that had been put to the mouth I knew immediately was aqua-fortis; I then asked to examine the bottle that the fluid might have been in.</p>
               <p>Q. If aqua-fortis got into the mouth of the child it might produce a suffocation from whence death might ensue? - A. I do believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. And you believe the appearances upon the mouth of the child were the effect of aqua-fortis? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Then are you inclined, upon the whole, to think that aqua-fortis put into the mouth of the child was the cause of the death? - A. I believe so, it appeared to me as if the child had lifted its hand up to its mouth to wipe off the aqua fortis; from the direction of the stain upon the hand, it appeared to me it had been done in that manner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Look at those two bottles; is the one aqua-fortis and the other Dalby's carminative? - A.This appears to me to be what is called Dalby's carminative; but I am no farther acquainted with it than from its appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. The colour of the one is not at all like the colour of the other? - A. In the appearance in which you now see them, they are not of the same colour; but the carminative will, I believe, upon standing, have a sediment at the bottom; and I believe the carminative itself will be of a brownish red.</p>
               <p>Q. Even after it might have stood a considerable time, would it then have the appearance of aquafortis, as to colour? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I take it they would have both much the same appearance in the dark? - A. Of course.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the two bottles had been of the same form, a person would not find out in the dark, the one from the other? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This supernatural swelling of the liver must have been of a dangerous tendency? - A. It must have produced other disorders.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to state perfectly that the death of that child was owing to aqua-fortis? - A. I cannot perfectly state that; I would not presume to state that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. From the appearance of the mouth, do you think aqua-fortis sufficient to produce early suffocation and death? - A. I think it is likely to produce suffocation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any natural causes, upon dissection, to which you could ascribe sudden death, independent of this aqua-fortis? - A.None.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not open the head of the child? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The opening of the head might have enabled you to discover other causes, that you are now ignorant of? - A. It frequently has.</p>
               <p>Q.Probably you have known instances of violent vomitings, producing suffocations, and ruptures of blood-vessels in the head? - A. Not suffocations; I have known instances of ruptures of blood-vessels in the head.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. No part of the aqua-fortis had found its way down the throat? - A. No part.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that aqua-fortis had been used, before you were told any thing about it? - A. I had had no information whatever respecting it; but the moment I saw it, I knew it was aquafortis.</p>
               <p>Q. Could that discolouration be occasioned by any thing else? - A. No; unless it was spirits of nitre.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. How the aqua-fortis came into the house I do not know; I did it accidentaily.(Mr. Miles proved that Shrewsbury-court was in the county of Middlesex.)</p>

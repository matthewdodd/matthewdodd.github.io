                  </hi>. I live at 8, Well close-square, and am an appraiser—I on 11th May, about 9 in the evening, I was at my door, and heard some one call "Police!" and" Murder!" and then saw the two prisoners closely fol<lb></lb>lowed by the prosecutor, running as fast as they could run—they ran into my side door—there is a fire engine station opposite—I was talking to the fireman, and we kept the door closed until the arrival of the police—it is an eight-roomed house—they could go all over it—we afterwards found one of them concealed up the chimney of the attic, and the other one behind the water-butt in the kitchen—I found a latch-key on the step of my door which the prosecutor afterwards identified at the station—I then went back with the police, and in the second-floor of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> house we found the prosecutor's purse—it contained a penny, a halfpenny, and a farthing.</p>

I live in Grove-street—I am a German—I don't understand much English—I am a sugar baker—on 11th May, about half-past 9 in the evening, I was walking along Ship-alley, three or four men came towards me; one laid hold of me from behind, and another one put his hand into my pocket—they then ran away, and I ran after them—they ran into a house—I called out for a policeman, and the police came—one of them struck me at the time they put their hands in my pocket—the tallest one had hold of me—I cannot say whether he struck me or not—I was struck one blow in the eye—I afterwards saw my purse and key; it was a box key—they had been quite safe in my pocket before.</p>

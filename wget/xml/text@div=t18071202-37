               <p>Q. Are you in the habit of letting that house ready furnished. - A. I have, to one family.</p>
               <p>Q. When you let it ready furnished you let it to one family. - A. Always at times.</p>
               <p>Q. When you do not let it do you occupy it yourself. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 23d of October, was it let then. - A. It was not, I was in the occupation of it myself; I slept in it every night, from the 16th of September until the 23d of November.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 24th of October what time did you leave it. - A. It might be half after five or five, I will not be sure which; I locked the street door, and left the key in the door, in the inside, to preven it being picked as I thought, and likewise bolted it; then I went down into the kitchen; I locked the area, and took the key with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that you locked it. - A. I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020029"></xptr>quite sure of it; I then went up the area, locked that gate and took the key with me; I can be upon my oath that every other part of the house was safe, there was no way of entering of it without very great force. I had secured all the windows. Between seven and eight o'clock I received a letter from my neighbour that my house was broken open, and part of my property taken away; I returned to the person that wrote me the letter; I went with Mr. Simmons, and the neighbour that gave me the information, to the house; I found the street door then open, with the key still in it on the inside, it was unbolted; therefore they must have come in another way; the kitchen door was unlocked.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the door that comes into the area. - A. Yes, that is a door which I had left locked and taken the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, ma'am, did you go up stairs, and what did you find missing. - A. I found two feather beds.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth. - A. I cannot exactly ascertain; I believe the whole of the property is worth thirty pounds to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the two feather beds worth thirty pounds. - A. Yes, and I could not purchase them for that money.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the two bolsters worth ten shillings. - A. Yes, a pound; the pillows are worth five shillings. I lost three counterpanes, one was quite new, it never had been washed, it cost me a guinea and a half; the three are worth two pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all these articles that you have stated to have lost, in the house at the time you went out. - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was the counterpanes. - A. Two white, and one coloured, it was brown and red, a kind of copper plate.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out was it dark or light. - A. It was getting dusk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a person afterwards of the name of Foy - A. Not very soon; I saw him at Marlborough-street office some days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any keys tried to your door by Foy. - A. Yes, which easily opened my door.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that. - A. It was in the same week; one key opened my kitchen door with the greatest ease.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. How long have you had this house. - A. Since Christmas last.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had it before. - A. Mr. Simmonds.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any interest in it now. - A. Not any at all. I purchased the goods of him,</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Simmonds a bankrupt. - A. He is; his certificate has been granted him.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was a bankrupt at the latter end of July or the beginning of 
               <persName id="t18071202-37-person409">August. </persName>
            - A. I cannot justly ascertain that.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not he kept the house. - A. He has, before I had it, but not since.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, has not there been an understanding between you that the house should be between you. - A. Upon my oath it is mine, I had a lease granted by him at the same rent as he had it.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you slept there. - A. I have slept there at various times when the house has been vacant; the lodgers left it in September; since then I have slept there every night excepting one; Mr. Simmonds lives at No. 44.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that he does not live nor sleep in the same house that you live in. - A. Yes, I positively swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was dusk, the day was not shut in. - A. No, it was dusk, you could not distinguish persons' features, being such a wet night; I could not distinguish persons at the door, because I had been looking to see a person passing by; I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my lord that it was just dusk, the day it was about closing in, but not closed. - A. Yes, but it was so dark that I could not see at any distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to distinguish the countenance of one person from another. - A. Not at any distance.</p>
               <p>Q. But it was light enough, if you had been near you could. - A. It was very likely I could if I had been near enough and had taken much pains I could, but I will not be certain of that.</p>

            . - Mr. Pooley. You are an upholsterer, you live at 44, Southampton-row. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You was formerly the owner of the house at which Mrs. Kinsey now resides. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the afternoon of the 24th of October observe any persons near her house. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from her house do you live. - A. Mine is No. 44, and her house is No. 39 in the same row and the same side.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you observed some persons about this house on the evening of the 24th of October, what time of the day was it. - A. About half after six, to a few minutes, I will not be certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts were you when you observed them. A. I was going from 44 to 37, I was going by her house, I saw two men come out of the house from the front door; I saw them, but to the best of my recollection the door was opening as I was passing, it was either open or opening; there were neither of them out when I passed; I think to the best of my recollection the door was open.</p>
               <p>Court. Neither of them were out of the house at the time when you first saw them, but the door was open. A. Yes, and they came out; one was a tallish man and the other a shortish man.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was the shortish man. - A. I cannot say, there was a good deal of difference in the height of the two men.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any thing with them when they came out of the door. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You could not identify either of the men. - A. No, I could not, they were covered with large bundles on their heads.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. What had they upon their heads. - A. It was something white; I imagined they were sheets at the time when I first saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that which they had upon their heads large enough to be a bed. - A. Full large enough; they went down Southampton-row into King-street, in a direction towards Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had not an opportunity of seeing either of the faces of the men, was either of the men the size of the prisoners. - A. Yes, of the name of Brady; he had a dark coat on and boots, with apparently new tops.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man that you are speaking off, that had the dark coat on, and boots with new tops, was that the shortest man of the two men. - A. That was the shortest man of the two men; after I saw them come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020030"></xptr>out of the house, I traced them down King-street, I went on the opposite side of the way; the short man threw the bed down in King-street, a few doors from Orange-street, at a mattrass maker's door; it was darker in that part of the street than any other. The other man was at some distance before; I imagined he went down for Holborn; I went down King-street, towards him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you now speaking of the taller man. - A. Of the taller man, I lost him there, I did not see him. I then turned back thinking I should be time enough to see the short man before he took up the bundle; the whole of the time was not more than three minutes; I came back to look for the short man who put down the bundle, he was missing also, and the bundle. I then went into Southampton-row, to the house where they were taken from, and I saw the street door wide open; it was the same door that I saw the beds come out of.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is King-street from Southampton-row. - A. King-street leads out of Orange-street, into Red-lion-square; there is but one street as you enter out of King-street, that is Kingsgate-street, that is a short one. I then went to Mr. Wilkinson, a neighbour, and I made enquiries afterwards, and I traced the goods into Kingsgate-street; I called upon a neighbour, as Mrs. Kinsey and I were not upon very good terms. I got a watchman and him to go into her house. I then made enquiries, and traced the goods into Kingsgate-street, to a house kept by a person of the name of Fielding. I did not see them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long would it take to go to the house where you traced them. - A. Not two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the way in which he was going, did he turn to Kingsgate-street. - A. He turned to Kingsgate-street, instead of going down to Holborn, and there it was I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. At the place where you last saw the tall man with a bundle on his head, how soon could he have got to Kingsgate-street. - A. In two minutes, with the greatest ease.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you saw this door open, and two men go out at half after six - was it day light or dark. - A. It was darkish, the lamps were lit.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it so dark that you could not see a man's face, was the day closed. - A. The day was closed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Then it was not dusk, the day was closed. - A. It was not dusk, the day had closed.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to swear that positively. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you never saw the face of the two persons at that time. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen them, should you have been able to have known them. - A. Most likely I should by the light of the lamps.</p>
               <p>Q. But on turning Kingsgate-street you lost sight of them. - A. Yes, but in two minutes they might have got to Fielding's house.</p>
               <p>Q. And in two minutes they might have got any where else at an equal distance. - A. No doubt of that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pooley. Humphries and he came to your house on the 24th of October in the evening. - A. Yes, about seven o'clock, as near as I can recollect, or between six and seven o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Had they a bundle each. - A. Each of them had a bundle; they said they were beds; they asked me if I would purchase them in some kind of words, but I do not recollect the words; I told them no, and that their bringing such thing to me were nonsense; I told them they would not suit me.</p>
               <p>Q. They knew your business. - A. Yes; independent of that I do a little in the shop in the brokering way; I buy little odds and ends of furniture, not such large concerns as them, because I have no convenience, and I told them that they well know; I desired them to take them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they put them down in your house. - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Court. They put them down perhaps before you awoke. - A. Yes, sir; they were down before I awoke; upon which Humphries turned upon his heel, and said he would call a coach; Humphries went and called a coach; they were not three minutes in my house altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that Humphries went for the coach where was Brady. - A. Standing in my shop by the goods; they then brought the coach a few doors from my house, they came and took the bundles upon their shoulders, and went away, and as I supposed put them in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see them put them in the coach. - A. No, Humpries took both the bundles; Brady helped him up with them on his shoulder, and away they went; I do not know where they went to.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is Brady. - A. I have heard that he is a sadler and harness maker; that is what I have always understood him to be. I am a man that people is pleased to say can sing a good song; I go to sing a song where I am invited, many people know me.</p>

            . - Mr. Pooley. You live at 32, Eagle-street, Red Lion-square. - A. I do; I am a hackney coachman; I drive for an hackney man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your coach standing on the 24th of October in the evening. - A. At the Pilgrim in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from Kingsgate-street is that. - A. It may be forty or fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on that evening go to any house in Kingsgate-street. - A. No, I went opposite of Eagle-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time were you called from your stand when you was there. - A. About a quarter past seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that came to you. - A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020031"></xptr>cannot tell I am sure; the man came and asked me whether I would like to take two beds; I told him I would take two beds, but I would have a shilling more than my fare, for carrying them, and by this there was an altercation; he said he would give me sixpence more, I agreed to go for a shilling more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go and take up the beds. - A. I did; in taking them there they told me to take them to Broad-street; I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of them, look behind you. A. No, I do not know either of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the articles that you took up there fill up the coach. - A. Nearly; one rode on the box, I cannot say whether the other rode or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the men at the time they were putting the things in the coach, were they of the same size. - A. I was feeding the horses; the little man seems to be like the man that rode on the box, but I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you will not positively swear to him. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been to the house since. - A. Yes. I think I have seen the house since.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a shop or private house. - A. A shop, where they make looking glasses.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the person's name that keeps the shop. A. Bainbridge is over the door.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you seen the name written over the door since. - A. Yes, on the Wednesday I saw the name written over the door; I could not see it the night I took the goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. When you carried these goods it was on the Saturday. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you saw the name of Bainbridge over the door that was on Wednesday - how far is that shop from Kingsgate-street. - A. About three quarters of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be going to it. - A. About ten minutes, or rather better.</p>
               <p>Q. When they took the coach did they till you where to drive to. - A No; after the man got on the box he told me to drive to Broad-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man on the box and you get into any discourse. - A. Yes, we got into deep discourse; I thought they were the peel makers beds, I thought the landlord had better lose his rent than the peel-maker his beds. The man on the box told me he had a large family, and as Fielding and me were neighbours, I thought I would do him a neighbouring action and get the goods off as soon as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time that the man went on the box, and the time you have described, do you believe him to be the man - I do not ask you whether you can swear positively. - A. I do not know whether he is or not, I have no belief, only by his size, it being so dark; it was a man of that size.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you to stop when you got into Broad-street. - A. The man that rode on the box; I drawed up to the door, the door was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Who knocked at the door. - A. To the best of my belief the man that rode upon the box, he knocked at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see come to the door. - A. I saw nobody come to the door at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing carried into the house. - A. Yes, two beds what were put in the coach from Kingsgate-street, that were put in the house in Broad-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the two men go into the house. - A. What two men? I only saw one man, the man that rode on the box with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that man, after the things were put in the house, go into the house. - A. Yes; I took two shillings, and then I went away about my business.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there no light in the shop. - A. No light at all as I saw.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. When you went there who did you go with. - A. With Mrs. Kinsey; I went with her to shew her the house, I did not go in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went in the house with her. - A. Two runners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. At the time you went from Kingsgate-street to Broad-street, it was very dark. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The shops were all shut. - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any name over the door of the house that you went to that night. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went with Mrs. Kinsey you went in the day, the shops were all open. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the shops, when they were shut up that night, very much alike. - A. Very much, they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will ask you, if you went there of a dark night again, whether you might not mistake one from the other. - A. I might, of a dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. Now are you quite sure that when you went at broad day light, when the shops were open, that you did not go to a different house. - A. I am sure that I did not go to a different house.</p>
               <p>Q. By day the shutters were down. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At night, when you went, the shutters were all up, and there was no light at all. - A. There was no light at all.</p>

            . - Mr. Pooley. You are a constable of the police office, Marlborough-street. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Brady. - A. Yes, I know him to be Michael Brady; I have known him this last month, upon no other occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Humphries. - A. I do, I have known him two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are Humphries and Brady of the same size. - A. No, Humphries is considerably taller than Brady.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information, did you on the 25th of October last go to the place where Brady lodged. - A. I did; I went to the second floor of No. 19, Queen-street, Seven Dials; we were searching that place; there were me and three other officers. I observed a woman, while we were searching, go down stairs; I followed her immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you known in the house. - A. I was known by the person in whose room we were in.</p>
               <p>Court. What person's room was it. - A. A person of the name of Hankey; we had him in custody at the time. The woman knew me very well, she went down stairs, I followed her down; she went into the front parlour, she come out again in an instant, and at the same instant she came out a little boy followed her, he had a bundle in his hand: when she came out of the parlour with the boy she was going up stairs, the boy came out and went into the street, I laid hold of him directly and took the bundle from him; I carried him back and the bundle into the parlour, there I found the prisoner Brady who had just arisen from the bed and was dressing himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020032"></xptr>Q. What time was this. - A. Between seven and eight o'clock on Sunday morning the 25th of October, the morning after the robbery had been committed; I asked Brady how it happened that the lad came out of the room with these things; Brady said he knew nothing of it. I put Brady in the watchhouse, and took the boy to be examined before the magistrate; there was no magistrate at the office, being Sunday; I put him in the watchhouse till Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy give you any information from whom he had them. - A. He did, on the Monday, before Brady, he said he had given him these implements of housebreaking; there is three double skeleton keys and crows. The boy said Brady had given him them to carry out and to throw them behind a door of a green shop in that street; Brady said it was true that he had done so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to No. 39, in Southampton row. - A. I did, in a day or two after, I think it was about the Wednesday, in two or three days after; Mrs. Kinsey went with me, and Burton and another officer.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went there did you find any of these keys to fit the lock of the door. - A. I did; the door of the kitchen that goes out of the area. I made her go inside, double lock it, and take the key out, and then with this end of this key I unlocked it with the greatest ease; here is six parts to these three keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any opinion whether it was that key that opened it. - A. It would open it, certainly. This key is forced with having turned a lock or bolt; in the form I put it in that very form it came out.</p>
               <p>Court. You were very sure that you did not bend it. - A. Certainly not, in that state it opened that lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to Mr. Bainbridge's. - A. Yes. I did sometime after this, when the prisoner Brady was brought up for examination, I think about the 6th of November, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. After your house had been broken open, and your goods lost, did you go to the house of Mr. Bainbridge. - A. I did, in company with the coachman; I went to No. 5, Broad-street, Carnaby-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you get to shew you the way. - A. The coachman, Matthews, he told me it was a frame maker's shop.</p>
               <p>Court. What shop did you find it to be when you got there. - A. A glass frame maker's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when you went. - A. Between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, on the Tuesday or Wednesday after the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go two days to the house. - A. I did; on the Thursday, when I went the first time, I saw a person that was called Mrs. Bainbridge, a female, and a tall thin man in the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was Mr. Bainbridge present. - A. He was not.</p>
               <p>Then you must not tell us what was said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. What did you see there. - A. I saw a feather bed upon another, in a garret; I found the bed myself; two officers went with me. I had a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Petherick was one of the officers. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In that house you found a feather bed that you thought was yours. - A. I found one bed that I thought was mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any alteration in the bed then, since the last time you had seen it in your house. - A. There was an alteration in the bed, the binding was taken off; I wanted to fetch the man that I bought it of that was Mr. Simmonds.</p>
               <p>Q. The binding being taken off that made you doubt. A. Yes, and for that reason I wanted to fetch the man that made it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else there. - Q. A pair of blankets; I do not mean to swear to the blankets; but with regard to the bed, I had a day or two before dirted the edge of it with my foot; this bed was dirty much in the same place. I then obtained a warrant on the day after, and went with the man that I bought it of, but the bed was then removed; there was one bed only that looked like my property, but that bed was gone; I searched the house all over.</p>
               <p>Court. On the first day you went and saw this bed, you were not quite positive that it was yours; who were attending you in the house besides the officer. - A. Mrs. Bainbridge was in the house both days; I submitted to her both days that I thought it was my bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I object to that.</p>
               <p>Court. I only want to know the fact of her claiming it as her own; you claimed that bed as your own. - A. I did, not only once, but repeatedly; I said, I think this bed is my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, you went the next day, did you take Mr. Simmonds with you. - A. I did, I went about the same hour, as soon as a warrant could be obtained in the morning; I saw Mrs. Bainbridge there and the man, the same as I did on the day before; I went to the same place to look for the bed; it was removed; I enquired of Mrs. Bainbridge, and I asked the man; I said is the bed here, he said no.</p>

            . - Mr. Pooley. You are a constable. - A. Yes, of St. James's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the 28th or 29th of October go with Mrs. Kinsey to the house of Mrs. Bainbridge. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard what she has been stating. - A. I was present with her at the first time she went I went; on searching the house, Mr. Bainbridge was not at home, when we went into the attic story, we went into the front room, where we found two bedsteads with beds on, it was a double bedded room.</p>
               <p>Court. You are speaking of these beds upon the bedsteads, as if they were belonging to the house, to the family. - A. Yes, there were sheets and every thing complete; when I come to one of the bedsteads in the front room, there were two or three beds on that bedstead, and one on the other; at that bedstead where there were three feather-beds, one on the other; Mrs. Kinsey looked at them carefully; when she came to one bed she said this looks like my bed, I think she said this is my bed.</p>
               <p>Q. In short she thought one of the beds was her own. A. Certainly, my lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. There is no case made out against Bainbridge.</p>
               <p>Brady's Defence. I am quite innocent of it; I have people to bring forward that I work for, to my character; I always worked for my bread; these housebreaking things that were found on my premises did not belong to me; the boy that I kept, his father is at sea; and to keep the boy from going to prison; I said that I gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020033"></xptr>it to him. I understood they were in the room, and they were brought by another person into the house.</p>
               <p>Bainbridge's Defence. I know nothing about them, I never saw an article brought into the house that evening.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon this evidence, it does not appear, certainly, that this man was at home when these goods were delivered.</p>
               <p>Brady brought three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

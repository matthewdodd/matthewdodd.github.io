On the 15th of June the prisoner came into my shop and asked for a leg of lamb, and beef steaks for the kitchen. I weighed the leg of lamb and the beef steaks together, she told me I must make a note of it and send it to her mistress, No. 10, Banner street, and to send every day for orders, that her mistress would be a customer, and she told me to send change for a two pound note, which was to come back. I sent my own boy with the meat, a one pound note, four shillings in silver, and ten shillings in copper. She was dressed decent like a servant, with a street door key on her finger. The meat came back again, but not the change</p>

            , JUN. Q. You were sent with this meat, were not you - A. The prisoner and me went out together; she took me round Charles's-square, I told her that was not the way to Banner-street; she took me into Winkworth-buildings, City-road, then she asked for the change, she took the change, a pound note and four shillings out of my hand, and then took all the copper out of my basket; she then told me to go to Banner-street, and not to knock till she came, and then the mistress was to give me the two pound note. When I went there there was no person had ordered any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come to you at No. 10 - A. No; I went back to the City road, I could not find the prisoner.</p>

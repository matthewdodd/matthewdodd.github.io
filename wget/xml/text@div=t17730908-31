            . I gave intelligence to the last witness of the mare; I received it of the prisoner on Friday morning; I was going to a place called Hayes, and met the prisoner with the mare; I suspected he had stole it; I met with an acquaintance about half a mile off; he had offered it to him to sell; he asked 18 guineas and would have taken nine; he had offered it to me; we consulted together about it; we went after him and took him, and put him into the custody of the constable at Acton, and from his confession I went and informed Howes of it.</p>

               <p>Camden. He told Justice Lamb he bought it at Worcester, and gave 17 guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when you took him?</p>
               <p>Camden. That he brought it from two miles beyond Oxford; he told Mr. Lamb the very field where he said it was brought from.</p>

I took the prisoner in custody on Saturday, 28th May, on a charge of being concerned, with another man, in uttering counterfeit coin—I took him in Park-street, Camden-town, in the street—I ran after him, and caught him by the collar—he then stooped down, caught me up, and chucked me over his back—I did not loose my hold—he then turned round, and gave me a kick on each knee—I got up and chucked him down—I then saw him put something in his mouth—I tried to get it out, and he bit my hand in three different places, and made it bleed very much—my knees are not well yet—I then got up, and with the assis<lb></lb>tance of Mr. Smith, I got him to the station.</p>

I saw the prisoner down on the ground, and the police<lb></lb>man trying to take something out of his mouth—before that, as I was coming down the street, I saw the policeman above the other people, as if he were being thrown up; but I saw the prisoner down when I got up to them—I said to Mr. Smith, "That is not the man who came into my shop"—the policeman was then taking the prisoner to the station-house—he first took him to my shop door, but I was not there.</p>

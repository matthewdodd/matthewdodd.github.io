I had some more money in my right waistcoat pocket, but the four shillings were taken from the left; the whole six hustled me when I was down - I cannot swear whether my money was taken out or dropped out: they all ran away when the watchman came up- the prisoners struggled to get loose, but I kept hold of them - the watchman came up so soon, the others had no time to get them away from me. My hat was picked up a short distance off, by the watchman, who asked if it was mine - I said it was not, as it was dark, but at the watch-house I immediately recognised it, and a silk handkerchief which was in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At what time in the evening was this? A. Half-past one o'clock in the morning; I had not left work till late - I was quite sober - I had only drank about three pints of beer; they came behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any force used when your hat was taken off? A. It was suddenly snatched off: I was in the road, close to the pavement - they said nothing to me - I had no acquaintance with them: it was not a lark. The watchman came up in half a minute.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. After you were tripped up, what did they do? A. They surrounded me, and were in the act of hustling me.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was close to this spot about half-past one o'clock in the morning, in Old-street-road; I heard the prosecutor call out Watch! he was all over dirt and sludge; he had hold of the prisoners - he was standing up then: he said he had been robbed; I took hold of Williams, sprung my rattle, and another watchman came up; I took them to the watch-house; I did not see the others; they were gone round the corner - I was in Old-street-road. It was a dark night; I saw nobody but the prisoners; Best appeared quite sober, and so did the prisoners; Smith struck at Best twice in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is this your beat? A. Yes; I was within thirty yards of the spot; I had called the half hour five or ten minutes before. There are gas-lamps in the street.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL BEST re-examined. The prisoner Smith struck me twice in the watch-house, but I did not wish to mention that.</p>

            . I was the second watchman who came up. I heard the rattle spring when I was in Hoxton-square, three or four hundred yards from the spot; I saw nobody but the two prisoners; I found Williams and Best both without their hats; I looked round, and five or six yards off I found a hat; Williams said it was not his, and the prosecutor said the same; there was a handkerchief in it - I do not think Best saw the handkerchief: he said at the watch-house that he had lost a hat and handkerchief, and claimed it, and said he had lost about 4s. - he appeared in liquor a little, but not at all insensible. The prisoners appeared perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far off is your beat? A. It comes within about thirty yards of the spot.</p>

            . I am a headborough. The prisoners were brought to the watch-house about a quarter to two o'clock; the prosecutor claimed the hat and handkerchief, and a glove was in it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAMS' Defence. I was going home to Crabtree-row, Hackney-road; as I turned round by the alms-houses the prosecutor laid hold of my neckcloth, and said, "Here is one of them;" Lloyd came by - I asked him to lay hold of me, or the prosecutor would choke me; he did so, and I asked for my hat, which had fallen off - he could not find it.</p>
               <p>SMITH's Defence. I was coming home with Williams; we had been drinking, and were pretty merry - I might have run against the prosecutor, but not with intent to rob him.</p>

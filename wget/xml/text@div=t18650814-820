                  </hi>. I live at 20, George-street, Camberwell, and am a labourer—the prisoner occupied the same bed with me—on Saturday night, 30th July, I went to bed about half-past 12—I folded my trousers up, and laid them on the box—I had seven shillings and sixpence in the pockets—I was awake when the prisoner came in-doors, but while he was paying the landlady, and talking to her, I fell asleep—about 8 in the morning, I missed four shillings, a florin, and two shillings—I went down to the George Tavern where the prisoner was working, and accused him of taking my money—he said that he did not know anything about it at all—I said, "I think you took it, I am sure you have, and if you don't give it to me, I shall go and get a policeman, and give you in charge"—as soon as I walked away he said, "I can tell you where your money is"—I said, "Come and show it to me"—he then went back with me to were we both slept—he put his hand under our bedstead and under a box, and pulled out a florin and a shilling—I refused to take it, and said, "I shall send for a policeman—he then said he would give me two shillings for the one that was gone if I would not go for a policeman—I fetched a policeman.</p>

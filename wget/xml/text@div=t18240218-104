I have seen the prisoners at different times, at different public-houses. On the 21st of January I met the man in Tothill-street, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and treated him with a pint of beer, and some gin, and then went to the Feathers, public-house, Broad-way; his wife came in, and we had a pot of beer - he borrowed one shilling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180056"></xptr>and sixpence of me; I pulled my purse out of my left hand inside pocket. I had eight half-crowns there - I laid all the money on the table - put it into my pocket again, and treated them with two pots of beer; we came out, and went into the George and Ball public-house, St. Ann's-lane. I treated them there with three pints of beer; the woman said,</p>

               <p>"Mr. English, you are wet and cold, come to our lodgings, and warm yourself, it is only three doors off;" they took me to <placeName id="t18240218-104-crimeloc590">Pye-street</placeName>

I had some soup there, and sent for some beer - the man wanted her to stop with me while he fetched it, but I said she was the most fit to go, and she did, and after that I wanted her to go for more, but heard him whisper to her,</p>
               <p>"Don't go for any more, I will knock him down, and take his purse" - I then got up, and said</p>
               <p>"Good night, I will have no more here, but will give you anything down stairs;" he got between me and the door, and she came and laid hold of me, while he took my purse out. I said,</p>
               <p>"Bartlett, you have robbed me" - he said if I said a word he would knock my eye out - she ran towards the fire-place, and he ran down stairs. I followed him into the One Tun, public-house, and said he had robbed me - he said he would split my skull - a parcel of girls came round, and began laughing. I went to the office, could find no officer, but next morning got one, who took the woman, and on the following night I saw the man, drunk, and fetched Pace, who took him - a man came and gave me 10 s. not to prosecute. I shewed it to the Justice, but he committed them - I had drank no liquor but two glasses of beer - I did not halloo out in their room, as it was of no use. The landlord was in the bar of the One Tun, but it was of no use to say any thing there. I told two or three watchmen that night, but they said they would have nothing to do with it.</p>

               <p>THOMAS PACE. I am an officer. On the morning of the 22d, the prosecutor informed me he had been robbed in Old Pye-street, and took me to the first floor of No. 20; I found the female prisoner there - she denied the charge. I took her to the watch-house, and about six o'clock in the evening the prosecutor came, and said the man was at the Feathers, public-house - I ran there, and found him quite intoxicated. I asked if his name was Bartlett - he said not; the prosecutor said he was the man, and I took him.</p>

I said, if I thought 10 s. would do them good, if they were not guilty, I would sooner pay it, as it would be more out of their way, as they would lose their work - he offered at first to take 7 s., but said it was 10 s.</p>

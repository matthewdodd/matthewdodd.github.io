            . I am a baker, 67, in Wilson-street, Somers Town. I bought the numbers of Woolfe, the prisoner, as waste paper, on the 16th of January; I sold it to Jonas on the Tuesday following as waste paper.</p>
               <p>Miller. I searched Jonas's premises on the 26th. The prisoner is a baker; he lives in Charlotte-street, Hoxton.</p>
               <p>Q. to Abrahams. How far from Hoxton was it when you lost this parcel - A. About a mile and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dukeworth. On the 14th of January had you a supper with the prisoner - A. I had, with a few friends, at the White Hart, in the Coal-yard, Drury-lane. The prisoner was one of the party. When the prisoner has not work enough to do he goes out to work. He is a baker. I have paid him eleven shillings for jobbing for me. I know of my own knowledge that he was at work for Mr. Gregory on the 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th of January. The prisoner came to the White Hart, and staid there until half after ten o'clock, and on the 14th of January I saw him about three o'clock working in Mr. Gregory's bakehouse. I went there to invite him to the supper.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hancock. Look at the books and see whether they are the same that you packed up - A. Yes, these are the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 14th of January, a woman came into my shop, she said she was very poor; her husband was in trouble for debt. She said she had been taking in these numbers of the bible; she could not afford to keep them by her, if I could purchase them of her it would be of great service to her. I offered her four pounds for them. She said she kept a chandler's shop, she would take part in bread. I gave her three pounds fifteen shillings in money, and five quartern loaves. I have some knowledge of the woman, although I cannot say who she is.</p>

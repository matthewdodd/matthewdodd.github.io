               <p>The prisoner came into my shop between seven and eight, on the 31st of August; I knew and suspected her before, she asked for a quarter of a yard of muslin, I watched her closely, she had a long cloak on, I perceived her stretch her body out, and take a muslin handkerchief under her arm, which lay in the centre of the counter, her arm was upon the muslin, and she dragged it off the counter, and it dropped down, and she said, O Lord! here is something down; yes, says I.</p>
               <p>Court. Before she said that, did you perceive it was down? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You had not charged her with any thing then? - No, she denied knowing any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. The thing was never removed from your shop? - No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a very good character.</p>

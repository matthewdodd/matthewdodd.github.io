On the morning of 27th March I was on duty in Richmond-street, Walworth, in plain clothes, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's house, and met the prisoner about half-past 8 o'clock, currying a large carpenter's basket, which was very bulky, on his shoulder—I knew him to be a notorious thief, stopped him, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Tommy,</hi> what have you got here?"—he said, "What I have got here is my own; it has nothing to do with anyone"—I said, "You must go to the station"—he said "All right, I will go with you quiet"—we walked a short distance together very quietly—I took hold of him and he all at once swung his basket over his shoulder on to my neck and said, "You you don't take me to the station—he closed with me, and threw me down—I fell under him—he placed both his knees on my chest, and his right hand on my neck<lb></lb>tie—with his left hand he took hold of my hair, and bumped my head on the ground—a man coming past at the time took my rattle from me, and sprang it—as he did so the prisoner left go of my neck, and tried to get away—I just managed to get hold of his right leg, and stopped him—he kicked me in the side—assistance came, and I took him to the station—another constable took the basket to the station—when we got to the station, I asked the prisoner what was in the basket—he refused to say, and refused to give any account of himself—Mr. Mills identified the things found in the basket—the prisoner was wearing this coat, in the pockets of which, were 11 keys, 1 pair of goloshes, and the prosecutor's badge—I went back to the prosecutor's place and found some footmarks, but there had been a slight frost, so they did not make much impression—there was just enough to see that somebody had been there.</p>

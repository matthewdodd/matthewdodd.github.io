The prisoner was in my service for a fortnight - she went away between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning of the 26th of February, without giving me any notice whatever; I had hired her by the week; I had counted my money about six o'clock the evening before, and left 20l. in my bureau, which stood in my front parlour - it was in sovereigns, half-sovereigns, and some silver; the bureau was locked, but I left the key in another drawer. After she was gone I went to the bureau, found it locked, and the key in the same place - I missed eight sovereigns and three half-sovereigns. I saw the prisoner a fortnight afterwards, at Marlborough-street; the Magistrate was not present; she said she had taken them for the purpose of being sent out of the country; nobody but her could have taken them; I have no other servant. She had not been in place before, and I had her character from her mother.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 12th of March I was calling half-past ten o'clock, and met the prisoner in Duke-street, St. James'; she said she gave herself up to me for being a thief - that she had stolen 7l. 10s. from her mistress; I asked who she was - she said, Miss Eves, of Sloane-square - that she and another woman had spent the money. I took her to the watch-house, and found her mistress out.</p>

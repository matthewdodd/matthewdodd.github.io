HUDDLESTONE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it you saw the pri<lb></lb>soner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw him once three or four months ago—that was the only time as far as I can recollect—I was before a Magistrate, when I was entrapped by the younger Feistel, who offered me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to settle this matter—I accepted it, and he then gave me into custody for attempting to extort money by this very charge—there was a policeman outside, whom he brought in—that proves the trap—he had marked the two sovereigns—I took the two sovereigns, and would have kept them if I had not been trapped, because it would have been loss than the value, the offer having first come from Feistel—I have not been before any Magistrate about this charge—we could never catch Mr. Feistel to do so—I found he had left all his old haunts—as far as I know, he lives in the Waterloo-road—the last time I was there was on Saturday evening, after the bill was found here—I went before the Grand Jury without having been before a Magistrate—I have known Scott, I should say, fifteen months—I have never carried on the wine business—I have been a wine agent for different persons, for Mrs. Fincham, of Dowgate-hill—I was an agent for her not a month since—she is now dead, and will be buried to-morrow—the shop is not shut up—the business is continued—she was the principal person I did business for, and her customers—I have been employed by Mr. Greatorcx—he is of the firm—I have not been employed by anybody but their firm and their customers—I have been in different capacities—I once managed my father's business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever been in prison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that I shall answer that—I decline to answer—I was unfortunately in prison once, for embezzle<lb></lb>ment, and imprisoned twelve months—I was then a solicitor's clerk, and had been so five or six years—I was convicted of embezzlement for robbing my master, who is since dead—his name was Harrison, of Cambridge-terrace, Hyde-park—when I applied to Scott for the baskets, he said they had been stolen from him—I first suggested making this charge—I said I would have the value or the baskets—that was before the commencement of last Sessions—I never heard that an action had been brought against Scott, except within the last two or three days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not heard that an action was brought against Scott for false imprisonment, by Feistel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—I thought you alluded to an action by the Sheriff—I never heard that Scott took Fiestel before the Magistrate—I never heard of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were taken up, being entrapped by young Fiestel, did you say that if he would not prosecute, you would tell all about it, as you were drawn into it by Scott—Now be cautious, I give you fair warning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said, "It is a pity you have done this; you asked me to do your father a service, and having consented to do it, you turn round upon me"—I said I would render him all the assistance I could—I said I would do him any service—I did not say I would tell all, as I was drawn into it by Scott—that I swear—I said I would render him any assistance I could, if he would not press it—I never set up in business as a wine-merchant—I never set up in partnership with Fiestel—I never spoke a word to him in my iife—I never put him in a place to take care of the business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Calcutt, butcher, Queen's-buildings, Knightsbridge. From information I received on the morning of the 17th Jan. I watched the prisoner, who was our servant, from half-past five o'clock to half-past six, in the back parlour—it was dark—my husband goes to market at that time—I had a view of the shop without being seen by any one—there was a gaslight in the shop—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner talking to some person at the door—a policeman first, then a man passed along who I did not know—the prisoner said, "Good morn<lb></lb>ing, stop a bit, I have a bit of washing for you"—I know where the pri<lb></lb>soner's washing is done—it was not his washerman—the man said, "You must be very quick, as I am rather late this morning"—the prisoner said, "Step round the corner, I will be with you immediately"—his going to the back would bring him close to the door—the prisoner then got on the desk and looked over to see if any one was in the parlour, but as I was close under the blind he could not see me—he then turned off the gas, and sawed off a breast of mutton, chopped it, and handed it to the man—he did not weigh it, or receive any money—I then looked over the blind to see if I could identify the man—I could not—the prisoner looked round and saw me—I went out and accused him of the theft.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Mrs. Calcutt brought forward my fellow-servant, Knight, who was in the shop and saw the whole transaction. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was in the shop hanging up meat, the Magistrate refused to take his evidence.</p>

I took the prisoner—I told him the charge—he said his master knew nothing about it, he was not at home, and his mistress was looking through the window at him—he never told me he had received the money for the mutton—this is Mr. Painter's the Magistrate's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The prisoner says I weighed the breast of mutton, it was 2lbs. 10oz., at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb., which is the usual price; I received 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it."</p>

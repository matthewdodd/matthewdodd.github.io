I am cook to Dr. Hague, of 14, Chapel Street, Belgrave Square, where the prosecutrix was housemaid—I saw the prisoner at my master's on Sunday night, 7th May—I opened the door to him, he asked for her—I called her, she was upstairs, she came down—I heard what passed—he asked her if she would give him an answer, and before she could do so he struck her with something—I heard the blow—I caught hold of him and threw him down—she ran away into the dining-room, and I went for assistance—he shut the street door and walked down the road, and began to run away—the hall was in darkness at the time—I saw her shortly after he ran away, and blood was streaming from her forehead—she fainted away.</p>

The prosecutrix was in my service—I saw her on the middle of the following day, the 8th of May—there was a very serious wound on the left side of her head, above the temple—she had lost a great deal of blood—it was a deep stab wound—it must have been done with a very sharp instrument.</p>

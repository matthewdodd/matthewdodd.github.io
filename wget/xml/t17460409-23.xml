            . The 21st of February I detected them in digging the Pipe, between Seven and Eight o'Clock; I ask'd them what they were doing? They said they were digging Pipe out of Water; that they did not pay for the Water. I was forc'd, with a great many Words, to prevent them digging. The 28th of February they came again; I got the Watchman to my Assistance, and I took the Prisoner at the Bar with the Pipe upon his Back.</p>

The prisoner is my son - he did not live with me, but in consequence of missing some articles I charged him with taking them - I did not threaten him nor make him any promise, but I told him he must not come into the house, as he was taking the things out and pawning them - I found some duplicates on him the day before he was taken before the Magistrate; some of them are here, which relate to my property - one of them is for a silver spoon, pawned at No. 95, Wardour-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not go with me to get me a place in the expedition of Don Pedro? A. Yes; you did not give me the duplicates - I did not say I would freely forgive him; I found some of the duplicates in his waistcoat pocket in my own house, and other things I have taken out at different times - I was aware that he had pawned things, but I never allowed it; I was not aware of his pawning these things, and I never gave him permission.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, and live at 92, Borough Road—on the night of the 8th inst I was called to see someone in the Southwark Bridge Road—I there found the deceased; she was insensible, but not dead—there was blood on the pavement—she was bleeding at that time; I could not see the state of her face and head, it was too dark; I ordered her to be removed to my surgery—I examined her there; she was dead; she must have died on coming into my place, ox in being brought there—I made a post-mortem examination; there was a large contused wound on the right side of the cheek, and a smaller one on the left, a slight cut on the right side of the Hose—there was no injury to the temples; the bruise went up above the eye and eyebrow on the right side; that was. the large contused wound—they wen such blows as might have been caused by a man's fist—there were no other external wounds—I examined the inside of the head; the brain itself was in a healthy condition; there was a slight clot of blood on the surface of the brain, under the frontal and parietal bones in front of the head; that was a recent deposit, and I believe was the cause of death—I should say that that clot of blood was caused by the bruise rupturing one of the small vessels; I don't think it could have been occasioned by drink.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If she had fallen on the kerb with sufficient weight that would account for the clot of blood—the wound on the nose see med like an incised cut—there was an injury on the cheekbone and an injury on the eyebrow—I don't think an oblique fall on the kerb would have occasioned, the injuries—I am prepared to say it would not? because the cheek itself would have been cut; it was not cut; it was simply bruised—it is possible the injuries might have been caused by a fall; everything is possible; but I don't see how it could have been done in that way—I don't think so; if she had rolled over on to a small stone, it might have caused the bruise—the body was well nourished; she had not a weak heart; every organ was healthy except the lungs; they were slightly diseased by consumption—drunkenness and excitement might predispose to faintness—I don 't think she had been drinking very much—I saw the prisoner; he did not say anything he was very quiet; he helped to carry her in; he did not help</p>

I was called to the Southwark Bridge Road about 12.20 in the morning—I found the deceased sitting on the doorstep of a warehouse—I asked what was the matter; and when I turned on my light I saw the marks of bruises on her face—I asked who had been knocking the woman about—the prisoner said nothing—I heard Mrs. Toomer say "Charlie, Charlie, why did you do it?"—I did not hear him make any reply—a woman, whom I afterwards found to be Catherine Lambert, said "It won't make matters better getting him into trouble, and do her no good"—I went with the deceased to the doctor's; the prisoner said nothing while there—I charged him with causing the death of the woman; he made no reply—I took him to the station; he went quietly.</p>

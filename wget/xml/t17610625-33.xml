            , a servant of mine, informed me that one of them had got a piece of cloth under her arm, which was Ingram. [She was the purchaser.] I desired him to take no notice, but leave it to me. They went both out of the shop about three minutes after. I followed them out, and desired them to walk back. When they were in the shop, I threatened to send for a constable to have them searched. While I was doing that, some of the people said, She has dropped it; that was Ingram. Then the other prisoner took it up, and put it upon the counter. Then I threatened them, and turned them out of the shop, desiring them to come there no more. After they were gone, I recollected they had been in the shop before; I went after them again.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had they got that time?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I believe they had got about 300 yards. Soon after they had got into the shop, Ingram dropped a piece of clear-lawn, while I had her by the arm. Then I sent for an officer, and had them committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did it drop from?</p>
               <p>Saunders. It dropped, I believe, from her petticoats; I felt it by my leg. [Produced in court.] It is German lawn, there is about seven yards and a half of it, my property.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know it by?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I know it by my book-keeper's writing upon it; and likewise by the mark that I put upon it, after it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they looked upon such lawn in your shop?</p>
               <p>Saunders. They had looked upon lawn of the same sort, I believe Ingram bought a small quantity of the same.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Saunders's shop at the time he wanted to take the prisoner Ingram to the body of the shop; but she would not go that way, but went towards a piece of red bays, and stood close by it. I had before been by it, there was no lawn upon it when I first saw it; when she stood there, I saw the lawn laying upon the bays.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it fall?</p>

               <p>I went into the shop to buy a quarter of a yard of lawn; I bought it, and paid for it; I went out of the shop; I did not intend to take any thing; I took nothing but what was my own; the other stuck to my cloaths.</p>

               <p>I came to London to buy my husband two files in the Minories, going along I met Mrs. Ingram; she shewed me a bit of lawn; I went in, and had a quarter of a yard of the same lawn. After we came out the gentleman followed us, and brought us back again; she opened her cloaths, and said she had nothing; he took her by the arm, and pulled up a bit of lawn, and said she had robbed him of it. I am innocent, and know nothing of it.</p>

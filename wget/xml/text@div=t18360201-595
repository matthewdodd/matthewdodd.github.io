My master, John Jutsum, keeps the Red Lion, St. Greenwich On Saturday week the constable brought the prisoner to our house, and asked if this was our glass—my mistress said, "Yes, we have such glasses as these, which the old college-men have two penny-worth of rum in"—it has the name on it—we had missed such a glass on the Wednesday before—the prisoner was in the habit of coming to our house every day, till Friday week—I have not seen him there since—we do not allow glasses to go into the hospital.</p>

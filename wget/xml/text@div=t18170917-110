               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. The prisoner frequented the house - I did not hear him say that Golding had an execution out against him.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner hurrying Bamford along the passage into the street - I followed, secured him, and brought him back - I saw him take something away, but did not take it out - We took him into the parlour, I picked up a small instrument by the side of the chair where he sat.</p>

I was in the house, if the prisoner had been drinking there I should have seen him-I first saw him run by the girl out of doors - I followed and saw him throw something out of his pocket-he was brought back. I saw him pull something from under his coat and put it under the chair-it was a crow-bar.</p>

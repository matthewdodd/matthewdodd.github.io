               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. I never saw her until the officer brought her to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140005"></xptr>house. I was at home on the 1st of August; I was in the shop. About four o'clock in the afternoon, I went up stairs; I found the door of one of the rooms open, the key of that room hung upon the bail below stairs, where it always did. My daughter, Charlotte, had locked the door of that room.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know - A. Because the key hung in the place where it always did. My daughter, Charlotte, locked the door When I entered the room, the drawers were all open, and empty; about half after two o'clock. My daughter's clothes were all in the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. to Charlotte Powell. Upon this first of August, were you in the room where your mother has been speaking of - A. Yes. I left the room about half past two; I locked the door, and left the key down stairs in the parlour. When I left the room, the drawers were all locked, except one. My clothes, and my sister's clothes, were in these drawers. In one of these drawers, was a black veil, two necklaces, and a great number of things; almost all the things I and my sister wore. On the Saturday following, I saw one of my gowns again. This happened on Monday, the 1st of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see all that was missed - A. No, not all. Some are lost entirely; a veil is now missing, a broach, some collars, and a pair of minature pictures.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that all these things were safe in the room when you went out at two o'clock - A. Yes; I had looked over the drawers that morning. I did not return home until Tuesday. I shall know all the things when they are produced.</p>

            . I keep a clothes-shop, in Fore-street; in the parish of Cripplegate. On the 1st of August, the prisoner came to my house, between the hours of five and seven; I cannot positively say the hour; she offered me for sale, five gowns, three small neck-handkerchiefs, three bonnets, a small white muslin cloak, and a shawl; she offered these for sale. I bought them all. She asked me two pounds eight shillings; I gave her two pounds five shillings for them. On the Saturday following, Miss Powell passed my door; she saw a gown hang in my window; she asked me if I knew of whom I had purchased it; I described the prisoner. I then told her every article I had bought, to the best of my knowledge, and told her, I would go in pursuit of the prisoner in Rag-fair. I had seen her at my shop three or four times before. On the 18th of August, the prisoner came to my house again; I caused the prisoner to be taken into custody. I returned to the Miss Powells all the property.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I produce two collars, a pair of stockings, and a silver tooth-pick. On the 19th of August, I went to the prisoner's lodgings to apprehend her upon another charge; she was not at home. On searching her box, I found these things belonging to Miss Powell. The man that lived with her, told me it was her box. He was bound over to attend here; he has not come. It was at No. 17, Bell-court; I knew her to lodge there.</p>
               <p>Charlotte Powell. The things produced by Mr. Dickens, are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The things in my box were my own; they have taken all my things away, and left me destitute.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. to Mrs. Mailer. Did the prisoner give any description how she came by these things - A. She said, she bought them of a person in the fair.</p>

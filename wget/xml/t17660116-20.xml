             came to my house, and asked me if I suspected any body had robbed me. I told him I had suspected that some months ago, and had laid a scheme to discover the person, but did not succeed. He told me he had some brass in his possession, which he suspected to be not honestly come by. He brought me a quantity, which is now here. After examining it, I found I could be positive to part of it. I applied at Hicks's Hall, and got a warrant, and took up the person that Mr. Fleetwood had received this brass of, who said he had it of the prisoner at the bar (the brass produced.) Here is part of it; it is part of a brass mould; the other part I have now at home. Then I got a warrant of suspicion against the prisoner. I took him before Justice Girdler; he there confessed he stole the whole that I apprehended to be mine. Part of this brass he acknowledged he stole from Mr. Monkhouse, his master. He was asked what he got for it a pound; he said he sold it to

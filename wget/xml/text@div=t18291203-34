On the 18th of November I was going home at half-past eleven o'clock at night - I saw some persons round the watch-house - a man said his wife was in there, and he could not get to see her; I said I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030017"></xptr>an old parishioner, and I dared say I could get him in - I knocked at the door, got in, and was immediately seized and locked down stairs in the cell, without being asked how I got there - when I got in to the cell I saw the prisoner and four or five others; before I had been there two minutes the prisoner knocked my hat off - I said to him,"Don't ill use me, I don't interrupt you, let me sit quiet;" he said, "You be d-d, you are one of us" - I got my hat again, and in two minutes he knocked it off again; I said, "Don't ill-use me, I am a gentleman" - he said,"What money have you got about you?" I said, "I have three sixpences in silver" - he said, "Give me that," and I gave it to him, because I was afraid I should be ill-used; the other persons who were there sat very quiet - I was not particularly afraid of the prisoner, but I wished to sit quiet- I had sent for bail, as I wished to go home to my family; I called out to Mr. Baker that I had been ill-used, and the prisoner came up again, knocked my hat over my eyes, bruised my nose, and stole my seal, key, and rings from my person - it was a violent blow on my hat, and the snatch was at my watch; I felt the things taken - when the door was opened I told the officer I had been robbed by the prisoner; he was searched, and the property was found on him - I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was quite tipsy - he was there before me. Witness. I was not tipsy - he was there when I went down stairs; I do not know whether he was tipsy - I was not; I had not drank more than six glasses of wine.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BOND. I am a serjeant of the Police. I was at the watch-house - there was a great disturbance at the door, with a man whose wife had been locked up; the prosecutor came to the door, and attempted to get in - some of our people were ordered to go and clear the people away; the prosecutor was brought in, and charged by them with an assault and making a disturbance - those persons are not here; the name of one of them was Oliver- I do not know the other's name; he was not under my command - the prosecutor was put down on a charge of assault and disturbance outside the watch-house; the prisoner was there before, charged with assaulting his master, who is a publican, and making a disturbance - the prosecutor called through the bars that he had been robbed; Mr. Baker went down, and the prosecutor pointed out the prisoner, who was tipsy - I cannot say the prosecutor was sober; he had been drinking, but was not so far gone but he recollected what he was about - he charged the prisoner with robbing him of his seal, key and rings; I asked the prisoner if he had them - he said No, he had not; I am positive of that - he had heard the charge, and said he had neither taken them, nor had he got them; I commenced searching him - I took off his jacket, waistcoat and shirt; I found nothing in them - I told him to put them on again, and to pull off his trousers; as he pulled them off I heard something jingle - I felt something in the lining at the bottom of the trousers; I took my knife, and opened it - I found this key, seal and ring: each of his trousers pockets had holes in them and would not hold any thing - it would go down between the lining and the trousers; he said they must have been put there by some one, and that he knew nothing about them - I found this part of a ring under the seat where the prisoner had been sitting, and the other part was in his trousers.</p>

               <p>MR. LATCHFORD. This is my property - I had not drank more than I have stated; I was very unwell - I knocked at the watch-house door when the man said his wife was locked up, and he could not get in - when the door was opened I was laid hold of, and taken down; I told Mr. Roe the circumstance as it occured - I have lived twenty-five years in the parish; I heard no charge made against me, and I know of no name being entered in the book.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BOND. The charge was entered and produced before the Magistrate - it was regularly entered; the inspector received it - I was present, and I locked up the prosecutor: they were discharged on paying 1s., the prosecutor and the man who was with him.</p>
               <p>MR. LATCHFORD. I was not taken before the inspector, and had no man with me at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was drinking at my master's, and became quite insensible - I made a disturbance, and my master sent me to the watch-house; when I got there I fell on the form, and went to sleep - the officer came to search the place, and shook me; he said I was to get up, and be searched - I got up, and the things were found on me, but I know no more of them than a child.</p>
               <p>JOHN LATCHFORD re-examined. I should think there were half a dozen persons in the cell - it is but small; I have served the office of constable in the parish - it was about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>MR. HENCHAF. I am a publicar. The prisoner lived with me as pot-boy, and behaved well, but on the day in question he got so drunk I was obliged to put him into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WOODWARD. I am a Thames Police-officer. I have known the prisoner between three and four months - I was at his master's on the night in question; he would not be persuaded to go to bed, and he was forced to be dragged to the watch-house by a Police-officer - that was about eleven or half-past eleven o'clock.</p>

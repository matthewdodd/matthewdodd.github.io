I charge him with uttering a bad two-shilling piece"—at the station, I put down the paper parcel and the bag—the prisoner said, "They are mine; they are my hard earnings"—I searched him, and found on him four shillings and three sixpences, good money, and one shilling and three farthings in copper, all good—I received this florin from Mrs. Carpenter at the station—the prisoner's wife was with him at the time I apprehended him.</p>

She asked me to treat her; but I told her I had but a few halfpence; she said, never mind, she would treat me. She changed the two-shilling-piece, and told me to put the change in my pocket, which I did. She said she had been to Westminster to see her cousin, and he had given her a half-sovereign. My wife has, I am sorry to say, been in bad company for years. I have tried to put a stop to it, but could not I have been out all hours of the night, but could not get her away from bad company. About five months ago, I came up to speak for her on her trial here, and she got off with four months; and the very next day after she came out, she took a good half-crown from my pocket, and put a bad one in its place. She has told parties she would get rid of me. I found one of her bad companions in bed with her.</p>

The pri<lb></lb>soner was engaged in Dec. last, as traveller and warehouseman—I carry on the City portion of the business, and Mr. Price the West End—I gave the prisoner instructions to bring all money at once to me, immediately he received it—he knew nothing about what moneys belonged to the firm before I joined it—he produced an order from Mr. Laxton, and I said, "Have you got his money?"—he said, "No, I did not know there was anything due"—I said, "If you will refer to the paper I gave you, you will see that there is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due"—he said, "I will call for it"—he has never accounted to me for it, and I was not aware that he had received it till he was before the Lord Mayor, on another charge—he left our service; I had engaged him for a month, but finding he was doing so little, I advised him to get something better—his salary was paid him when he left, and when the orders were paid he was to receive 2 1/2 percent., but nothing was due to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and reside at 4, Ebury-street, Pimlico—on 8th August, at half-past 3, I was coming out of the London tavern with two gentlemen, the prisoner pushed by me and I heard a snap at my chain, and saw it hanging down—I caught hold of him round the waist, and said, "You have got my watch"—he said, "No, I have not"—a policeman came up, and said he saw him do it—I got my watch again; a gentleman picked it up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Could I help pushing against you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You could have done so; pushing the way you did—there was no person between you and me—the people were standing still except yourself; they were passing in and out—there was no person pushing behind you, I can positively swear—I did not look at my watch to see the time—I am sure I had it when I came out, because I had my hand on it coming, down the steps, and all through the tavern.</p>

About half-past 3, on 18th August, I was standing facing the door of the London tavern—I saw the prisoner and the prisoner come down the steps; she stood on the kerb, and I was standing almost touching her cape—the prisoner come down the steps out of the tavern, pushed by the lady, and I saw him with his hand this way (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—the lady said, "You have got—"—I said, "Yes, I saw him take it"—he dropped the watch down by the side—a gentleman picked it up—two gentlemen came out of the tavern and passed between the prisoner and I, or I would have caught hold of him at once—on the stairs at the Mansion-house, the prisoner said to me, "You have no occasion to say you saw me take that watch or drop it; it will do you no good, and it will do me a great deal of harm."</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you known the prisoner? - A. He had worked once or twice in the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - A. He is a very good clerk; he is a very good writer; but, I believe, he was starving; and, in short, people that know him give him a very good character.</p>
               <p>- BENJAMIN sworn. - I am a dealer in clothes: On the 15th of May last, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, I bought this watch of the prisoner at the bar, with a silver seal, and a broken key to it, he told me it was his own property; I gave him a guinea for it; he wished for the seal back, on account of its having been in the family so long, and I returned him the key and the seal.</p>
               <p>Ryan. I know this to be my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never saw Benjamin till I saw him at Marlborough-street; he came and looked at me, and said I was not the man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>, F. 117.) On the 1st of Aug., about twenty minutes before five o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Chancery-lane, and heard something at No. 39; I went to the door, pushed it, and it opened—I went into the passage and found the prisoner close to the staircase, with a coat under his arm, in the pocket of which I found this brush—I found the premises broken open—a person could go from there to No. 43, by going out at the first-floor, and going on the leads which cover the back offices—I found that a person had gone in that direction—we traced the marks of corded trowsers—I found this file in the prisoner's possession—there were marks outside the window of the back office, at No. 43, where he had pushed it to try to break the glass—they were marks which could have been made by this file—it fitted them—the lock had been forced off a cupboard in the same office—the house is in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn.</p>

                  </hi> I am housekeeper at No. 43, Chancery-lane—it belongs to Archibald Keightley and other—on Saturday night, the 31st of July, about half-past nine o'clock, I shut up the house—I shut the back parlour—the window was shut and fastened—in the morning, about the half-past five o'clock, I was awoke by the dog barking—I found the door of the back parlour was not as it ought to be—the lock had been jammed—I forced the door open with my foot, found the window wide open, and the place in confusion—a desk was broken open, and a press and a bookcase—this brush belonged to Mr. William Austin—I have no doubt it was in that room that night—it was taken from the drawer under the window—I do not know whether anything else was taken—the place was ransacked, and everything strewed about the room.</p>

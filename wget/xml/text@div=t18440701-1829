                  </hi>. I am ostler at the Star and Garter, Kew-bridge. On the 13th of June, about a quarter to twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner stabbed me—he was not sober—he had been in custody about a quarter of an hour before, and had got free—he came up to me, and desired me to fetch his ser<lb></lb>vant and his gig—I told him to walk into the coffee-room, and his servant would be back shortly, he had gone to Brentford to get bail for him—he said, "If you do not find my horse and gig, I will find something that will settle you very shortly"—he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a weapon like a knife—the waiter said, "Mind, Roach, he has got a pistol"—he ran behind him, caught hold of his arms, and at that moment the rush he made at me cut my finger—he rushed at me with that weapon—he attempted to strike me with it, and did so in my finger—I cannot say whether it was done in the struggle as I rushed to get the instrument from him, but at the first moment he made the rush at me, I found blood on my hand after I got the weapon from him—I cannot swear whether my finger was cut at the first rush, or by taking it from him—I bled a great deal, and went to the surgeon next day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at the Star and Garter. On the 13th of June the prisoner had something to drink at the house, and desired the ostler to fetch his servant—the ostler said he could not, he was busy—he threat<lb></lb>ened the ostler, and said, if he did not chose to fetch him, he would show or give him something that would make him fetch him—I saw him pull some<lb></lb>thing from his left-hand pocket—I said, "Stand on one side, the gentleman has got a pistol," as I heard something snap—I laid hold of both his arms behind, and the ostler endeavoured to take it from him—he did not strike the ostler, to my knowledge—after I got hold of him a scuffle took place between him and the ostler—I heard the ostler say his finger was cut, but I did not see it till next day—I saw a knife or something, but did not see it taken from him, as I was holding him behind—I saw it after it was taken from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Brentford. On the 14th of June Roach came to me—I examined the index finger of his right hand, and found a wound about one-third of an inch deep, and three parts of an inch long—the knife had entered the finger about the middle, and pasted along the surface of the bone, under the integuments—a wound of that de<lb></lb>scription could not be inflicted except by a pointed and cutting instrument of this description—it was cut and stabbed—there was a cut on the outside where the knife penetrated along the surface of the bone about three quarters of an inch—I considered it a severe wound, and considered him in danger, as the tendons were wounded and divided, and in all those cases there is danger of locked jaw—he was in very great pain—there was inflammation all up his arm, but that subsided—he is still unable to straighten his finger, which proves that the tendons were injured.</p>

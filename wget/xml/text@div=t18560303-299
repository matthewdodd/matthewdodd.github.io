                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the London Docks. Ashcroft gave me the marks of the casks he found—I can tell by our books that they ought still to be in our custody—they have not been given, up to the merchants, nor sold.</p>

I know Meekin, and I know Wall—I spoke to Meekin about Wall—I told him the result of this work which was curried on between Mr. Wall and me—he paid no attention to it—I told him about home casks taken from the London Docks—he said Mr. Wall represented. he was at work for me—I said; "He is not at work for me"—he was taking the casks out under pretence of being at work for me—I went and saw that they went to Glass House-yard—I dare say it was a fortnight or three weeks before that that I first spoke to Meekin—I know Fogarty—I believe he has been led into the error—it was a week before the last trans<lb></lb>action that I went to Meekin's, and said, "You are wrong in buying these casks."</p>

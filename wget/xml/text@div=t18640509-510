                  </hi>. I live with my mother, at Ickenham, Middlesex—on Friday evening, 29th April, some clothes which had been washed were hanging on our hedge to dry, between 7 and 8 o'clock—they belonged to my mother and myself—they were not near the highway—they were gone on Saturday morning, and on Sunday morning, between 12 and 1 o'clock, a policeman brought them back in a bundle, and the prisoner—they were then still wet—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, T</hi> 133). On Saturday morning, 30th April, I received information from Mr. Godliman, and on Sunday morning, about 1 o'clock, I saw the prisoner lying down, apparently asleep, in front of a public-house, about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Godliman's—he had a bundle of wet linen wrapped up in a horse-cloth—I awoke him, and asked him how he became possessed of it—he said, "I found it; I picked it up in Glebe-lane, in the parish of Ickenham"—I took him to Mrs. Godliman, who identified the articles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where is the public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a roadside house; the Coach and Horses—he was lying on the road, and the bundle was close to his head—he was not lying on it—he was not really in the public road, but in a public place by the side of the road, and in front of the public-house—there is no public highway there—he did not claim it as his, or attempt to escape—he had been drinking a little, but was not drunk—I knew him as a labouring man there—I have been nine years in that district, and never heard a charge against him before—he is in regular work, and was in work at that time—these are the articles; they were wrapped up in this horse-cloth—the head of Glebe-lane is about 300 yards from there—that would be in his way from his master's place going towards London.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at No. 11, Searle's-terrace, Kensington, and am a surgeon. I left a tavern in Jermyn-street on the 26th of July—I met the two prisoners, and asked them to have some whiskey—I then went to Durham-street—I felt myself sick—I laid hold of the rails, and told the prisoners I had a watch and some money, and I asked then to take care of them while I was sick—when I turned round from the gate, instead of finding them there with my property, they were gone—the watch was worth about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my purse had a sovereign in it—this was about four o'clock in the morning—I beckoned to a policeman, and told him I had been robbed by two soldiers, and a policeman went after them—the watch has not been, found, but the money has—among it was this crooked six pence, which I can swear to—there are two lines on it—I did not tell the officer that before it was found, but I said so when I saw it—I was an hour and a half or two hours with these men—I am sure of their persons. <hi rend="italic">Duncan.</hi> I showed him the money I took out of his pocket, and offered to count it that he might have it safe again—I got robbed of the watch—the money I gave up at the station. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He put his hand into my pocket, and took out the money—I remember his offering to count it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private watchman and constable. I was standing at the door of the banking-house in Durham-street—I saw the prosecutor in company with two soldiers—I do not know the two soldiers—I afterwards saw the gentleman sick—I saw one of the soldiers running away, and turn up Bedford-street, and turn again down into the Strand—he was running then—I cannot recognise either of the prisoners—by and by I saw the other soldier run away, and turn up Bedford-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the regiment to which the prisoners belong. On the morning of the 26th Sinclair was sent to me to be searched, about 8 or 9 o'clock—he was ordered to take off his clothes, and he produced from his forage-cap a purse which was empty—he then told me he had a sovereign in his blankets, in Buckingham Barracks—I went there—it was not in the blankets, but in his knapsack, and there was 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his blankets—</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant F</hi> 1.) I live in Belton-street, Long Acre. A few minutes after four o'clock that morning, I saw the prosecutor lying down in the street in liquor, but he was sensible enough to tell me he had been robbed of his watch and money by two soldiers—I ordered him to be taken to the station-house—I went after the soldiers, and found Duncan in a brothel, in the Almonry—I took him, and found on him this crooked sixpence, and some other silver—he said the money belonged to a girl, who was with him in the brothel—before he was locked up, he said another soldier was with him of the name of Sinclair.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Duncan's Defence.</hi> Having had leave of absence from the barracks, I was proceeding home, when on arriving at the bottom of the Hay-market, we met with the prosecutor, with some girls of the town—he asked us to have something to drink, but we could not find a house open—there was a gentleman with the prosecutor, who begged him to go home, but he would not—we were going down Bedford-street, he was sick, and asked me to take charge of his watch and money—I offered to count the money—he laid there was no occasion—I gave him my name and the barracks—I then left my comrade, and met a friend, and was robbed of the watch—I had no intention of committing a robbery on the prosecutor.</p>

The last witness dealt with me; I know nothing of this bill, which has the receipt to it - it is not my hand-writing; the money was never paid me - these two bills are my writing; the prisoner had the beer and spirits charged in them on account of her mistress; I delivered the bills to the prisoner, and have never been paid; the receipt to the other bill is not written by me, or any of my servants.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she had got spirits for herself, without so stating to Mr. Merry; and that at times when her mistress gave her money to pay the publican, she had laid it out for house-keeping.</p>

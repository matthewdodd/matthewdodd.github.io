                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Gilbert-street, Gros<lb></lb>venor-square. On the morning of the 13th of June, the prisoner came to my shop and offered a pair of table spoons to pledge, which I produce—I asked her whose spoons they were—she said they belonged to a Mrs. Sharpe, a lady's maid, living at No.9, Brook-street, that her own name was Baker, and that she lived at No.7, Davies-street, and afterwards at No. 10, Mount-street—the lady's maid was going to be married, and had sent her to pawn them—I sent my young man to No. 9, Brook-street—she left and came again—she then told me a person in the street had given them to her to pawn—I sent for a policeman and gave her into custody—she said she had slept two nights in the Fair in the Park.</p>

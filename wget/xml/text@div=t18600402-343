                  </hi>. I keep the Duke's Head public-house, Reed's-mews, Grosvenor-square—the prisoner had been a customer of mine for about four months before the transaction in question—on 21st February he was in<lb></lb>debted to me in the sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—I had not asked him for payment then—he said as soon as he received his money from the Zinc Company he was employed by, he would pay me—he said their offices were in St. Paul's-churchyard—I cannot state the name of the Company—he said he was to receive 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Company—on 21st February, a letter came by post for him; he opened it in my presence, and produced from it this post-office order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—as soon as he opened it he said, "It is 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I don't understand the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to it—can you tell me?" I said, "No, I could not; he ought to know his business best as he had just come from the Company's offices;" he gave it in my charge, and he said "It is too late to get it changed, I will get it changed to-morrow;" he did not get it changed on the Wednesday—I named to him about getting it changed about a quarter to 4, and he said he did not feel very well; he would not go that day—on the Thursday night I spoke to him about it again and told him I wanted the money—he asked me to lend him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the order until he got it changed—I lent him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him if he would get the order changed in the morning as I wanted the money—he said he would get it changed the first thing in the morning—on Friday morning, about 11 o'clock, he came to me and asked me for the order—I gave it him and he started to go for the money—he returned about 12, and he said, "I have been for the money and I have not got it,' for I asked for it in the Com<lb></lb>pany's name, and they told me it was not in the Company's name; that it was in the Secretary of the Company's name"—and he said he did not know the Secretary's Christian name, he would have to go to the city to find that out—he promised me he would return about 2, on Friday—he never appeared till about 10 o'clock at night—as soon as I saw him, I asked him if he had got the money, if he had been to the city—and he said he had been to the city, and had met with an accident in grazing his leg, and he had got it covered with plaster, and he was very lamo—on Saturday morn<lb></lb>ing he got up about 11 o'clock—he was lodging at my house—he said, "I am going up there now"—I understood him to mean to the post-office for the money—he came home about 7 that afternoon; and then I said to him, "Have you got the money?" he said, "No, I have not; I have been down to my home, and from the accident I met with the day before, I felt so cold because I had to leave my stockings behind"—I said if I had known he was going to serve me in the way he had served me, I would have seen him and his, somewhere else—he then put his hand in his pocket, took out the order, and said, "If you think I have not got the money here is the order;" and I said, "I will go and see if I can get the money"—he said, "If you think I have got the money, do"—I told him I would go and see if I could get the money myself—I asked him to sign his name to this—he said he would not sign his name to it—he gave me the order to go and get the money—he refused to sign his name, and I then asked him to give</p>

               <p>me the man's name that sent him the money, and he wrote me this piece of paper out to go and get the money—he wrote the name of Gant—I took the order with this direct to the post-office in Park-street, Grosvenor-square—they refused payment; they said it was a forgery—it was on Saturday night I went to the post-office—it was open, but not for business—when I returned home the prisoner was not there—he was fetched in a cab by a brother of mine about 10 o'clock—I told him that the order was not right, and accused him of stealing my watch—at the same time he asked me to forgive him, and I told him I would not—I cannot say whether or not I told him what I had heard at the post-office—I cannot say now what the words were that I first said to him—I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a file manufacturer, and live at Shef<lb></lb>field. In August last I came to town, and was staying at the Thatched House tavern, in the Strand—on the 1st of August the prisoner called on me there—I did not know him before—he said he was recommended to me—that Mr. Wilson his partner, who lived in Regent's-park, was connected with the Customs, and had considerable influence, and if I could supply articles well he should be able to purchase to a largte-amount—he appointed to meet me at a coffee-house at half-past seven o'clock next morning, but did not come, and I returned to Sheffield—about ten or eleven days after<lb></lb>wards I received this letter—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—(I saw the prisoner afterwards, and told him I had received his letter—I do not know that he made any remark—he did not deny it being his letter)—it contained an order, signed "B. Martin &amp; Co."—in consequence of that order, I supplied the goods directly, as mentioned in the letter, amounting to 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a few days afterwards I saw the prisoner again—he came to my house at Sheffield—I asked him how he liked the goods—he said he had not received any, and said I had not sent any—I took him to the warehouse, and showed him a sample of the goods that were made over what I had sent—he said they would do very well—I took him to the wagon-office, and convinced him they had been sent, and he said he would pay me for them—I went with him to where he was staying, and he said, "I will pay you now," and he took out an invoice which I had sent him of the first goods—he said I might send the other goods—he did not name any particular quan<lb></lb>tity—he said I might send what was in the warehouse in a box—they were files, and came to better than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were sent off to the wagon-office before we went to his lodgings—when we got there, he asked for the in<lb></lb>voice, and said he would pay me for both together, which was 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., odd—I received these two bills from him in payment—they are for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which was more than the amount—I gave him a memorandum to make up the difference—I asked him who John Watson, the drawer of one of them, was, and he told me—a friend of mine wrote down what he said in my presence—I asked him who Richard Houghton was, and my friend wrote down his answer—I saw what my friend wrote—it was, according</p>

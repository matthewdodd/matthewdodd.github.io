            . I am an officer of St. Sepulchre's. On Saturday, the 25th of April, I saw the prisoner in Cow-cross; he went into a marine-store shop - he came out again, and I asked what he had got there; he said an old file, which belonged to Mr. Meggs, of Soho, whom he worked for - I found a paper in his possession, by which I found he belonged to Mr. Galloway; he said Meggs had sent him to make what he could of it for a drop of beer, not being able to pay him wages that night - I went with the officer to the prisoner's lodging on Saffron-hill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not say it was an old file or rubber? A. Yes - this is nearly worn out.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the prisoner's lodging on the 27th of April, and found two screw drivers, two files, and an iron chisel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the man's wife there? A. Yes - she gave us every facility to search the place.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARD HODGSON GALLOWAY. My father's name is Alexander - he is an engineer, and lives in West Smithfield; he has many hands. On the 25th of April we had about one hundred workmen; the prisoner was a labourer there - he had 24s. a week; he was rather a superior hand - they are entrusted with tools like these, but are not at liberty to take any away; this rubber is my father's property, and these other tools - one of them has my father's name at full length; I have laid the value of them at 14s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What is that large article? A. A rubber we call it, but it is in fact a file - comparatively these things are worth nothing; my father is a very particular man, and always makes out the men's wages himself - the prisoner has been five or six years in our service; we should not have kept him had he not been honest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. For the last seven years back labourers have lodged with me - both single men, and married men and their wives, have lodged with me; they used frequently to bring files, hammers and screw-drivers when they went to breakfast - they threw their tools down on the floor, and then took them back to the factory; if any of them have been left till night I have taken them to the gate, and the time-keeper has said, "Take them back, and bring them in the morning," and now at last they came and found these things in my house; the officer said,"Tell me the truth" - I said, "I am not ashamed, I live on Saffron-hill; tell my wife to come here" - she came, and I told her to go to Mr. Galloway's, to tell him I was in custody; she did, and he said, "It is more than I expected, but if it is my property I shall know it."</p>

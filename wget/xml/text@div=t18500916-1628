               <p>July, the prisoner came to my shop—he said he wanted goods to furnish a house, called Kent Cottage, Regent's-park, as a boarding-school—he said his wife had 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year coming in, and he wished to establish her in a boarding-school, that he was an architect, his wife had got five or six pupils ready to come in, and the house must be furnished by the 10th or 11th July—I allowed him to have some goods, and amongst the rest 111 yards of carpet, different sorts, worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., also thirty-eight yards of damask—he entered into this agreement(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is his handwriting—this inventory which is attached to it, contains the carpet, and the damask and all the furniture that he had—(<hi rend="italic">this was an agreement to let the furniture to the prisoner for </hi>3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per month, signed Frederick Ford</hi>)—about a week after, I went to the house, and found it deserted, and the whole of the goods were taken away—I found no appearance of young ladies pursuing their studies—there was a female there, and some old furniture belonging to her—I have seen my property since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The first time you saw him, before you went to see his references, did you not have a paper between you, and did he not propose to pay you 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a proposition to that effect, but the goods were not to be on hire if he did so—there was a proposition, that I was to give him credit for four months, but it was done away—it was on 6th July that we talked about the hire—I should say I had seen him about twice before that—on the 6th we went into an arrangement about the hire, and then we made another on the 8th—Harvey was not with the prisoner on all the occasions—I believe I went twice to the Grapes public-house, and met Harvey and the prisoner—the prisoner afterwards came to my house—when the prisoner came after July he brought one of his references with him.</p>

               <p>plate of the boarding-school was taken off the door—I had put the plate on myself, the prisoner asked me—this agreement is the prisoner's writing—I saw him draw the first agreement, and saw him write on two or three occasions—I know his handwriting well—he said he expected five or six scholars there, and had not got a room fit to show anybody in—one of the references was Mr. Lennie, who became guarantee—I agreed with Lennie and the prisoner that the goods might be removed on 26th Sept., if the prisoner did not pro<lb></lb>duce a receipt for his rent and taxes, and that Lennie should be a guarantee to that effect; and if the goods were damaged, Lennie was to make it up to me, in case the prisoner should die.</p>

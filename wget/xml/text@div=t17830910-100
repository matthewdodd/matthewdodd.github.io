               <p>On the 31st of August I lost a silk cloak, I was in St. Thomas's Hospital very bad of the dropsy, and I was turned out that very day incurable, and a young woman that is here fetched me in a coach, and when I came home, the prisoner and another man were at my house at dinner, when I came in I was very much fatigued, and the next witness laid my cloak on the head of my bureau bed in the kitchen, the other man went out, and the two women went out and left me, and the prisoner, and the next witness in the room. I was ready to faint, and I sent the young woman to get some milk, and she left me and the prisoner together, my cloak was gone.</p>

               <p>How long was it before the prisoner went away? - About a quarter of an hour from the time I came in.</p>
               <p>Did he go before the last witness returned? - Yes, I never saw my cloak again, he had his elbow on the cloak, I missed the cloak before she came in, which was in about five minutes, she then run to look for the man, and could not find him, I never saw the prisoner till that time, he was taken that night; he was passing by the lane, and a young woman saw him, and asked him if he did not dine with me, and he said no.</p>
               <p>Court. After one of the men and the two women were gone, can you be sure that you saw your cloak on the bureau? - Yes, Sir, as sure as I am a living woman.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. According to your account the other man and the two women went out before you sent this young woman for the milk? - I know there was not a creature left in the house but the man at the bar and I.</p>

               <p>Now after the two women were gone did you see the cloak on the bureau? - I am sure I saw the cloak on the bureau a good while after they were gone; I was so unwell that some body else might come in.</p>

On the afternoon of the 23rd of March the prisoner and another woman came to the shop, and looked at some silk handkerchiefs; I observed her slip one piece off the counter, while another person who came with her was talking to me - they did not buy any thing; as they were going out I stopped the prisoner, and saw her throw these handkerchiefs from under her shawl, as I was going to take it from her.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PICKARD (Police-constable E 65). I searched the prisoner and found nothing on her - the other person had 2s. 11 1/2d.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not have them - I was only waiting while she looked at the handkerchiefs; she said she wanted a red one, and there was none but of a very old pattern - I did not throw these down; the shopman held both my arms tight.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COLSTON. I took hold of her arms, but she slipped one of her hands away, took the handkerchiefs, and threw them down.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character, and her former mistress promised to employ her.</p>

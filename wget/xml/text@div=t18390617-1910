               <p>to one o'clock, I overtook the prisoners in Barbican—I passed them, and Beaumont said, "Goodnight"—after walking a little way, seeing they looked like hard-working men, I asked them if they would take a glass of any thing to drink—we went into a public-house, and had a pint of ale—we then went towards Smithfield, and soon after turned into St. John's-street—each pri<lb></lb>soner took one of my arms—we walked a little distance, and they asked me again if I was going to stand a drop more of something to drink—I said I would have no objection if they would walk a little farther—we had not walked many paces before Beaumont left my right arm, and took my left by one hand, and soon after I received a blow on my arm, and a kick on my leg, and fell on the ground—my hand was pulled out of my pocket, and my money was drawn out with it—I heard some fall on the pavement—no one was near me at the time but the prisoners—I had taken my money out in their presence when I treated them—there was four half-crowns, one shilling, a fourpenny-piece, and some copper—I do not sup<lb></lb>pose the blow would have felled me to the ground, if it had not been for the kick—I lost my hat and handkerchief—I believe Yardley secured Beaumont.</p>

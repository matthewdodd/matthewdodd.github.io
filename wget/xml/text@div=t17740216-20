            . I was at Mr. Dodson's in Charter-house-lane; I drank rather too much; the prisoner came in and asked me to drink part of a pint, and said he would have a pint with me; we staid till ten, then they would draw no more liquor; from thence we went to the Wheatsheaf in Fleet-market; there we had two pots; I paid for them; the prisoner had no money, but said he would get money enough before he went home to give me my money back ; as we were coming down Peter-street we saw the alley door open; I stopped to case myself; the prisoner passed me, and said stop a bit for me; I lost him for ten or twelve minutes; then I heard a great noise in the passage; the alley door was open before I went to it; I do not know what the prisoner did there.</p>

               <p>It is entirely a malicious prosecution: I am innocent of the matter ; I have a person at the door to prove that the watchman said he would lay a wager that he would cast me for death right or wrong.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160014"></xptr>Q. to the Watchman . Was you before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Watchman. Yes. He said he saw him coming out of the wash-house.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Did not the Justice ask Warren what they were going there for?</p>
               <p>Watchman. He said he went up there, and swore he would have some money before he came down again.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Here, Warren, I will read the account you gave before the Justice; there you said Walsom told you he would be d - d if he went home without some money; Walsom went up an alley in company with me, between Cow Cross and Saffron Hill; Walsom pulled down a window light belonging to a shop, and another light belonging to a wash-house of one Hawkins, a widow, both which places were adjoining to the dwelling house, and that Walsom in your sight went into the wash-house window; Walsom told you he could not get in at the other window, and upon bearing a woman cry out, you two made off together as soon as Walsom came out of the wash house window, and Walsom left a stick in the wash-house that he borrowed of you; was that account then, or the account you have now given, the true one?</p>
               <p>Warren . I did mention to Justice Girdler that he might let the window down for what I knew, and might be in for what I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you told a lie before him?</p>
               <p>Warren. I said he might.</p>

            . I am an iron founder; I live upon Saffron hill; I was at the Fox, a public house in Charter-house-lane, drinking, after I came from my work; there was this watchman in blue drinking; some of the people in company was jeering him about the blood money, and said he would have a suit of clothes; he said you may laugh or do what you will, I will be obliged to have a suit of clothes out of him, for he would swear his life away right or wrong; he said that in the public tap room, and laid a wager with Jemmy Stanford, a currier, of two pots of beer, that he would hang him right or wrong.</p>

I saw the prisoner about a yard from me, and secured him - I said I should have him searched - he appeared alone; he took the handkerchief from his trousers, and gave it me - he said a boy had picked it up, and given it to him, and he was to have given it to me. When I got him a little way he said he would fall on his knees and beg my pardon. I gave him in charge to Philpot, with the handkerchief, which is marked K., my mother-in-law's initial.</p>

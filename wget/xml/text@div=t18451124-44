                  </hi>. I am coachman to Mr. Thos. Dobson, of Forty Hill; Enfield. On the 13th of Nov. my mistress ordered the carriage to London—I, went with it—the prisoner accompanied the carriage—we stopped at Mr. Miller's, in Baker-street, Enfield—I was waiting there with the carriage, whilst my mistress went in—two policemen came up—they took a hamper which was under the driving-seat of the carriage where I sat, with the prisoner by my side—they took the prisoner into custody, and asked if anything in the carriage belonged to him—he said that hamper did—I believe he has friends in London.</p>

My attention was directed to Mr. Dobson's carriage on the 13th of Nov.—I took possession of a hamper which was under the driving-seat—the prisoner said it was his—Walkins took the prisoner, and I saw him take from his waistcoat pocket a tin box containing a piece of putty with the impression of a key on it—I afterwards went to Mr. Dobson's, and went to a room which was pointed out as the prisoner's bed-room—I found there a chest containing four drawers, two of which were locked and two open—I opened the drawers, which were locked with keys we had got out of the prisoner's pocket—in one of the drawers I found seven bottles of wine, six cloths, a piece of new carpet; in another drawer two more bottles of wine, two bottles of brandy, some spirit of anniseed, two foreign glass bottles, a towel, and in a portmanteau a bottle nearly full of wine, and another bottle with some gin; in a box I found two jars of sugar, a tin cannister of tea, and three tumblers—I found the key of the box in one of the drawers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am engaged in mercantile pursuits in London, and have a house at Forty Hill, Enfield. The prisoner was my footman and indoor servant—I kept no other man-servant in the house—I had a pretty good stock of wine—a lady in my family, named Moore, was almost always in the habit of going down to the cellar to give the prisoner wine when it was wanted—she is lame and very near-sighted—I have looked at the articles which have been produced—I have not a shadow of a doubt that they are mine—I always import my wine myself—the bottles of spirits which I have, used to be stamped on the corks, and the tops of the corks of the bottles of spirits found by the officers have been cut off—when I was at the police office I was regretting to see the prisoner in the situation he was in, and he told me he was very sorry—he had been with me eighteen months.</p>

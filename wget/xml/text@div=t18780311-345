On 18th February I saw the prisoners with a third man in Brick Lane, about eighty yards from Osborne Street—Donovan had half a sheep's head in his hand eating it, it was cooked—they went towards Osborne Street, and in about ten minutes I heard a scream and saw the prosecutrix lying on the pavement—she complained to me and I saw two persons running away, but did not pursue them at that time—about five or eight minutes afterwards I took Donovan about ten yards from where the assault took place—he said "It was not me, sir, I had no half sheep's head"—I am quite sure he is the person who had the sheep's head—I took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 13). On 18th February I saw the prisoners and a third man going up Brick Lane towards Osborne Street, but did not notice that either of them was carrying anything—shortly afterwards I saw Donovan in Inhof's custody—on the 20th I saw Callaghan in a public house and told him I should take him on suspicion of being concerned with a man in custody and a man not in custody in assaulting and robbing a woman on the 18th; he made no reply—I took him to the station, placed him with other men, and the prosecutrix picked him out.</p>

               <p>a constable came up, and she gave me in charge for kicking her and knock<lb></lb>ing her down, but nothing was said about any shilling. Is it likely that if I stole a shilling from a prostitute I should come back to the spot? She never mentioned the shilling till afterwards. She has given a wrong name; she cohabits with a man and goes out to keep him. The detective can speak for me if he likes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Callaghan's Defence</hi>. We came out of the public-house and she was going in with three men. She said to Donovan "Give me a bit of that sheep's head." He told her to go and buy one. She called him a s—, and he said that he would punch her in the jaw. When we got down Osborne Street we heard her screaming. When the constable asked her if she had lost anything she said "No;" he said "Will you charge him with kicking you?" she said "Yes." The man she cohabits with had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with her and kicked her, and had a fender to hit her with, and then she gave us in charge for kicking her. She knows very well she never lost a shilling.</p>

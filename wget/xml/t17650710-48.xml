               <p>Q. Are you sure it was bolted over night?</p>
               <p>Easley. I bolted it myself on the Tuesday night: my wife had told in half-pence and silver to the amount of nineteen shillings on the Wednesday morning, and put it into a pewter pint wine measure, and set it on the cellar-head; they could come up the cellar stairs to it, but could not open the door to come into the tap-room: she turned it out on the Friday, and there was but twelve shillings and two-pence halfpenny remaining, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100035"></xptr> she had put in a shilling and some halfpence after she told it: I desired her to say nothing of it: I thought they would come again for the rest, so I sat up the next night, but nobody came. On the Saturday my son and I both sat up; we left the cellar window unbolted, and I had put a few halfpence into the measure. About two o'clock on the Sunday morning, we heard the window open: then I went out to the window, and call'd who was there: I call'd to a man; he came to my assistance; then I got a light and went down at the window; these were the two boys at the bar; one of them had emptied the halfpence into his hat: he threw his hat and all down: there were some of the halfpence lying in the hat, and the measure lay on the ground by it: I heard them throw'd down: I brought the boys up into the kitchen, and asked them if they had any body belonged to them; they said they had not: they owned they had been there on the Thursday night, and took seven shillings and a bottle of gin, which they said was the first time; and that they came on the Friday night, and took away a bottle of gin, and sold it to the soldiers for fourteen-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of the prisoners before?</p>
               <p>Easley. Vincent was apprenticed out of Kensington school; the gentleman at the school says he is fifteen years of age; Bingley says he is about the same age. I took them to the constable, who took the pieces of brass cocks out of Bingley's pocket.</p>

            . Last Sunday morning the two prisoners were brought to my house, and delivered into my custody: I searched them, and found this tinder-box, steel, and flint, (no tinder) in one of Vincent's pockets, and the other pocket almost full of gun-powder: I asked him how he came by that tinder-box; he said a boy gave it him to strike a light on the common, when they were at play; and I took these pieces of brass cocks out of Bingley's pocket. (produced in court and deposed to.) I found in his pocket four shillings; I asked him how he came by it; he said Vincent told him it was four shillings of the money they took on the Thursday night: I asked what they did with the rest of the money they took that night; Bingley said they had brought a pistol in Oxford-road, and had sold it again to the man they bought it of, for one shilling and ninepence.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What money was in the measure on Saturday night?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was about a shilling or sixteen pence in halfpence.</p>

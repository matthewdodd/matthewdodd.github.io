               <p>Q. Did you ever use to assist him?</p>
               <p>Breese. Sometimes; about two months ago I was at justice Welch's office; Atwood asked me to go along with him to take one Murphy, who had escaped out of Clerkenwell Bridewell; we took him out of a house in King-street, Seven Dials.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Atwood know the man's person?</p>
               <p>Breese. He said he knew the man; we went to a house; we enquired for him, and he came down stairs to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the person?</p>
               <p>Breese. No; he is not the person that came down stairs to us; that man was the brother of this

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner Murphy present then?</p>
               <p>Breese. No; Atwood was going to put him in the round house till morning, for making his escape; we got him just to the corner of King-street, then they struggled together: they collar'd one another, and both fell down: while they were down the prisoner Murphy came and jumped with both his feet upon Atwood's breast.</p>
               <p>Q. With much or little force?</p>
               <p>Breese. Middling. Then Peter Murphy took the stick out of Atwood's hand, and hit him over the head with it; and then hit him in the mouth, and knocked one of his teeth out.</p>

               <p>Breese. No other provocation than seizing his brother; then he beat him over the ribs.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do?</p>
               <p>Breese. Goddard took me away and kept me in hold; I was about a yard off from him; there was Goddard and some other people, a fort of a mob, round me; they would not let me go to assist Atwood.</p>
               <p>Q. You are positive you saw all this very plain?</p>
               <p>Breese. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he continued to beat him some time; how did this end; when did he leave off?</p>
               <p>Breese. After he had given him some blows over his ribs with his own stick; Murphy made his escape; then the Murphys made off,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030023"></xptr> and Goddard kept me some time after; then Atwood went to a house in Monmouth-street, one Mr. Dawson's, a cloaths shop, to wash his mouth; when Goddard let me go.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not beat, was you?</p>
               <p>Breese. Not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Atwood complain?</p>
               <p>Breese. Yes, very much, of his ribs being sore with the blows he had received; his jaw was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was broke; it might be bruised perhaps?</p>
               <p>Breese. The apothecary said it was broke; then we parted and he and I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live after this?</p>
               <p>Breese. I believe about a fortnight; but he always complained of the wounds and bruises; he chiefly complained of his ribs.</p>
               <p>Q. Not complain much of his jaw?</p>
               <p>Breese. No; chiefly of his ribs.</p>

               <p>Breese. Yes; he always complained.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep his bed?</p>
               <p>Breese. I mostly saw him in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing whether any body had made their escape or not?</p>
               <p>Breese. No; only that I went with him to take Murphy; after he was down this

               <p>Q. What had Atwood like to have got the better of Murphy?</p>
               <p>Breese. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any cry raised upon you; what did they say you was?</p>
               <p>Breese. They called us thief-catchers.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of people were there gathered about?</p>

               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man that invited you to eat and drink, or the other man?</p>
               <p>Breese. Not the prisoner; the other Murphy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you had any authority to lay hold of him?</p>

               <p>Q. For what?</p>
               <p>Breese. Because we took him upon a wrong cause.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Murphy do any thing more than endeavour to get away?</p>
               <p>Breese. No; only in doing it he knocked him down and the like.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning you took Murphy, the prisoner, at his lodging?</p>

             very well; I have heard him often talk that he knew him and his brother for some years before he was a prisoner. He came home much bruised; he had a cut a-top of his head, and a violent blow upon his jaw, which appeared afterwards to be broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he came into that condition?</p>
               <p>Walbank. He told me it was by retaking of Murphy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he relate any part of the story to you?</p>
               <p>Walbank. He told me he had taken him, but he was rescued from him in the street; some considerable way from the house; he said they jumped on him, and beat him, and rolled him in the kennel; he declared that the brother that came down the next morning was not the Murphy he had taken, but his brother: that he knew him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not mention any person in particular?</p>
               <p>Walbank. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your method when a person escapes; do you get a warrant and take them before a magistrate or how?</p>
               <p>Walbank. We take them; we apprehend we have authority under their old commitment.</p>
               <p>Q. These runners are officers belonging to the prison I suppose?</p>
               <p>Walbank. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose any person escapes out of your prison, who is sent to retake them?</p>
               <p>Walbank. We go that have the best intelligence, and are most likely to take them again; we went next morning to Mr. Welch's office.</p>
               <p>Q. For what?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030025"></xptr>Walbank. For a warrant for the assault.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get the warrant?</p>
               <p>Walbank. I was not there; this Murphy came and represented himself as being the Murphy that Atwood took first; but he said to the hour of his death that this was not him; he declared he had hold of the right man; it was reported that he had taken Peter instead of Daniel.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after these blows did he die?</p>
               <p>Walbank. The 24th of May; twenty-four days after he received these bruises: he constantly declared that the ill usage he had received was the occasion of his death; he was very sensible to the last hour.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. The usual employment of these runners, I understand, is to take the prisoners from the prison to the justice's and back again?</p>
               <p>Walbank. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Atwood the commitment about him by which Murphy was committed?</p>
               <p>Walbank. He was committed by order of the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he that order about him?</p>
               <p>Walbank. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any charge being given to Atwood to take Murphy into custody?</p>
               <p>Walbank. A charge to take him wherever he could find him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear such a charge given him?</p>
               <p>Walbank. No doubt but my master gave him a charge as he had made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray was you present at the justices next day?</p>
               <p>Walbank. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The deceased was often in scuffles, being a runner in taking prisoners?</p>
               <p>Walbank. I never knew him to get hurt; he was never capable of doing any thing afterwards.</p>

            . He refused; he said, Come out and I will shew you the letter. When I came out the deceased laid hold of me and dragged me away; he would give me no satisfaction what he took me for; they never said that I had made an escape; they told me they would dash my brains out if I would not go with them; being a powerful man he knocked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030026"></xptr> me down; he was going to stamp upon me, and dragged me five or six yards; he struck me first, and there was a struggle between us; I cannot say whether I struck him or no; I was so stunned when he knocked me down. Before Mr. Welch they had nothing to alledge against me; and they desired us to go and make it up. Mr. Cox said if we were not friends when we had been over to the White Hart we had better go and make it up; they advised me to make it up.</p>
               <p>Goddard's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am an innocent person; I know nothing of it any further than being looking at them, as other people were; It was close by my house; they brought him a letter; he was a lodger of mine; I called him down stairs; I had nothing to do in it. I did not assist in this fray any further than looking on, which I have witness here to prove.</p>

               <p>Locke. Only a spectator.</p>

            . I am an apothecary in St. John's-street. I have in my hand some minutes I made at the time, in my own hand writing; I attended the deceased on the 21st of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you attend him before?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. No. He had a quick pulse; a great heat, and great difficulty of breathing. Upon my enquiring if he had any particular pains, he told me the small of his back was considerably affected; I judged, his kidneys: I found his water black: I judged there must be some degree of putrefaction: I thought it impossible that his life should be saved. I sent my servant to take some blood from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a certain sign of putrefaction?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. Yes; except in a jaundice, it is generally allowed so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he came by it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. He said he had had a beating; I did not enquire particulars: he was then almost a dying; he died the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the outside of his body?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. Not at all; I found him so near death, I did not chuse to disturb him. I advised him to be reconciled to what would shortly happen. I saw no possibility of his life being saved.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any mark upon the side of his face?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. Yes; after his death: I saw it when alive, but did not examine it; he had a poultice upon the side of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not examine the jaw?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. After his death I did, and found his jaw was fractured; there is no dispute of that; the right jaw.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not open the body?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. No; his wife informed me the coroner would sit upon his body: on Monday I said the body should be opened; she brought me back word she did not chuse it should be done till the coroner came; then there was such a state of putrefaction, that no gentleman would have chose to open it: the coroner did not sit till Monday evening, about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. to Walbank. How came the coroner not to be sent for sooner?</p>
               <p>Walbank. He said he was obliged to go to Chiswick upon some affair that happened there; and the next day being Sunday, he could not come till Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. to Burnet. Upon the whole, by what you saw of it, without opening the body, what do you imagine to be the occasion of this man's death?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. I could very readily answer your lordship's question, did I not consider that this man, since the accident, had been confined in the Compter; how far that might produce a fever is impossible to say; he was in Wood-street Compter; it was for serving a Compter warrant in the city, or something of that sort, and, I believe, was only discharged the evening preceding my attendance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any bruises?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. Only those common bruises that will be after a body is dead; the blood will settle.</p>
               <p>Q. You are pretty clear the fever was the cause of his death?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. Yes; I would be very tender in my evidence, when I consider the lapse of three weeks; his jaw was fractured; I believe there was a cup full of atter ouzed out when I touched it with my finger.</p>
               <p>Q. The colour of the water is an indication of a putrefaction?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. Yes; his wife mentioned to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030028"></xptr> me that he had black water all along; I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. If the kidneys had been so putrefied as to have occasioned the water to be black all along, do not you think he would have died before that time?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. The putrefaction might spread; I don't say it was of that colour at first; it was then the colour of the grounds of coffee. Had he not been sent to goal, I should have thought it came from the bruises; but it might arise from a fever occasioned by the confinement.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Atwood. When had your husband any of this discoloured water?</p>
               <p>Atwood. The day after he received the blows.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell me any thing before of his being confined in the Compter; how came you to conceal that?</p>
               <p>Atwood. I did not know I had any occasion for it; he was very bad before he was had to the Compter; he was had there a week before his death; he died on Friday; he was in from Friday till Tuesday.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he in a very bad way when he was carried there?</p>
               <p>Atwood. Yes; very bad; he never was out of his bed; he had kept his bed but one day before he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just now he kept his bed a fortnight before his death?</p>
               <p>Atwood. It was near about that; he was in bed in the Compter all the whole time; his water grew black the day after the blows, and continued blacker and blacker till the day of his death.</p>
               <p>Murphy. I was told this man fought in the Compter.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witness of that?</p>
               <p>Murphy. No.</p>

            . I deal on coals, and live in St. Giles's. I was standing at my door; I saw two men pulling the prisoner Murphy along by the collar. He said, What do you pull me for? I said, You shall know what it is for. As they passed my door he said, I will know what it is for before I go much further. They went into St. Andrew's-street; there they pulled his shirt and coat over his head.

               <p>Q. There was no pretence then, that Peter had behaved in that way that he is now charged with?</p>

No; at five o'clock he warrant was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030030"></xptr> read; the governor of Clerkenwell and the deceased Atwood, seemed much frightened, finding they had taken the wrong man into custody, and had handcuffed him; upon which the warrant was gone into examination; the magistrates finding it turned out as before related, they advised the party to make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. So you apprehend that Breese thought Peter was the man, they had taken up the night before?</p>
               <p>Carter. Yes; and Atwood said he believed it was not; Breese said Goddard had struck Atwood with a stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he always consistant in that?</p>
               <p>Carter. Yes; the parties made him satisfaction; and they seemed very glad that it was made up, as they seemed afraid of disagreeable consequences.</p>
               <p>Justice Cox. I confirm Mr. Carter's evidence: this matter was all made up and reconciled, and the parties prosecuting were very glad it was made up; and it appeared that Murphy had been exceedingly ill used.</p>
               <p>Justice Welch. I knew nothing of this affair till Murphy was brought before me upon the coroner's warrant; Breese said the whole had arisen from a mistake, in taking up the wrong Murphy; I entered into an enquiry, there were two witnesses, Breese was one; I enquired how this affair came; they declared this man was taken up by Atwood for his brother; Breese told me so; they said it was the evidence they gave the coroner; I would not go further but committed the party because of the coroner's jury.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Cock-alley. I was at John Williamson's slaughter-house on the 30th of May, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening;. I had been informed there was some one in there; I sent for Beavis, and told him to bring a candle; but before he came Bosward jumped out of the window, and I collared him; Payne then jumped out and hit me on the head - I seized him, and held them both till Beavis and the watchman came; they were then taken to the watch-house - I returned and picked up this lead and a knife, which appeared to have been cutting lead.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went into this slaughter-house - Bosward was struggling with Smith, who had hold of both the prisoners - I took him to the watch-house, and then returned to the premises and saw the lead - I went in the morning, about half-past three o'clock, and saw the place where it had been taken from - it was the end of a gutter - I took an apron out of the gutter, which Payne owned and put on.</p>

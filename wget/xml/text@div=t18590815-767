On the morning of 8th August, I went to a house in the Borough-road and saw the prisoner standing in the passage—he went into the front parlour, and I left him in charge of Harris—I went and searched the back room on the same floor—I found this silver sugar basket—the landlady was in the house at the time—and the prisoner came into the room—I asked the landlady how she accounted for the possession of this basket, and she said, <hi rend="italic">"Harry</hi> gave it me—did not you <hi rend="italic">Harry;"</hi> speaking to the prisoner, who said, "Yes I did"—I then went to the front parlour, the room which the prisoner first entered—I there found, wrapped in some rags, by the prisoner's bed, this bread basket and this egg stand, and 3 cups in it; one is deficient—the prisoner saw me find them—I asked him how he accounted for the possession of these—he said, "A man left them here last night for me to buy"—he then said, "You may as well have all," and put his hand in his coat pocket and handed me this sugar ladle—I took him to the station in Fleet-street, and while there I took from him a pair of boots.</p>

These things were brought to me to be left till Monday morning; a man told me they were purchased at Debenham and Storr's. The policeman came to my place and found the things. That spoon I had in my hand, and hearing a double knock, I put it in my pocket; I did not hide it. I said, "This came with them." I know nothing about stealing them.</p>

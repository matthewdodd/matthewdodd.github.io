               <p>in my service for about seven or eight months—my house has been under repair for the last two months—she was sleeping in another house, with a young lady who serves in my shop—on the 7th of May I went to chapel—I left my apprentice and the prisoner at my shop—I returned from chapel, and received information—I spoke to the young lady—on the Monday morning I was sent for by the young lady, and I opened a box which was at the place where the prisoner was sleeping—I there found this calico, Persian, and jean, which are mine—I had missed this Persian on the Friday evening, or the Saturday, and I had caused a search for it, but it could not be found—I got an officer, and said to the prisoner, "Fanny, I have brought an officer to take you; you have been robbing me"—she said, "Pray do not; it is the first time: I hope you will forgive me."</p>

I serve in the prosecutor's shop—I was sleeping with the prisoner in the room at the next door—in consequence of some in<lb></lb>structions from my master, I looked into the prisoner's box on Monday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 8th of May—she was not there—I saw a piece of calico wrapped in her shawl—I did not open the shawl; I only saw the calico—I sent for Mr. Davy—he came, but he did not search the box; he only looked in—I am quite sure these things were in the box—I was in the room when it was opened.</p>

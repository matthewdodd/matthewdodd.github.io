In about a minute the prisoner and another man came up - the prisoner sat by my side. In a little time he took my bundle from under my arm; I told him to let it alone - he revised to give it to me, and said it was a joke. He struck me several blows about the head, and gave the bundle to his companion, who ran away with it. I got down and pursued him; he then turned back, and gave it to the prisoner on the coach; they knocked me down, and struck me several blows. I took it from them, and took the prisoner into custody.</p>

            . I was passing, and saw a man give the bundle to the prisoner, who was riding behind the coach - the prisoner knocked the prosecutor down. I stopped to look at them, and took the prisoner to the office. I believe he was the worse for liquor.</p>

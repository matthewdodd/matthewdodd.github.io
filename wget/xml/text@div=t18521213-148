At 4 o'clock yesterday morning I was in Eltham parish—I met the two prisoners coming towards London; they were both together; Hollyoak was carrying this pair of stocks, and Smith was carrying this basket—I stopped them, and asked what they had got;</p>

               <p>Smith said they had got their tools—I asked where they were going; Smith said they were going to Oxford-street to a job, and they were to get there at 6 o'clock in the morning, and he said they came from Eltham—I asked who they had been working for; Hollyoak said for a man of the name of Foster, and he afterwards said they were going to Deptford to a brewhouse—I searched the basket, and found a number of taps and a brass tap and valve—these are what were in the basket, and Smith had a number of taps in his pocket—I found some small taps in Hollyoak's pocket, and he was carrying these stocks on his shoulder—when they were at the station, Hollyoak said he took the things out of revenge on Mr. Le Keux, and he meant to pawn them and send him the tickets.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Eltham, and am an ironmonger; I have a workshop at the back of my dwelling house, inclosed with wooden palings. On 11th Dec. I was there about half past 1 o'clock in the day, and on Sunday I was there about 11 o'clock in the morning—I left it all in a perfect state as far as I know—I believe I was the last person there; no one was there when I left it—it was all closed up, and the door was fastened—at a quarter past 5 o'clock yesterday morning I was tailed up, and found some policemen in my yard and the shop door open—I did not observe any marks of violence on the door—I went in the shop, and missed two large stocks and dies and some taps—these are the articles I missed; these large stocks have my name in full length on them—I am able to swear these are all mine, and I believe they were safe when I left my shop—I saw some of them on Satur<lb></lb>day, and some on Sunday.</p>

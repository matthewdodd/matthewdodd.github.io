                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 179). About half past 8 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing of Saturday, Jan. 17th, I was on duty in Albert-street, Westminster—I stopped the prisoner, in company with another man—I asked him where he was going to work, and then I observed something bulky about him, and said, "What is it?"—he said, "Grub, master"—I heard it jingle, and said, "I must take you to the station house," and the other man then ran off—I took him to the station, and found he had fifty-three pieces of metal gas fittings, and that it belonged to Mr. Wilson—there has been more found—he said he found them just outside the prosecutor's premises—it was about 200 yards from the premises where I stopped him, in a direction from the premises—that is about a mile from where he states he found them—I knew nothing about him before—I do not know the man who was with him, for he ran off immediately—there were some more found, but they might have been thrown away by the other man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gas fitter, in partnership with my bro<lb></lb>ther Edward—I have a workshop attached to my dwelling place, No. 200, Edward-street, Deptford—that is about 200 yards from the road—my shop was safe at night, and I missed the goods in the morning—I found the back door of the shop wide open—I went towards the front, and unbolted it, for the boy to take down the shutters, and the boy said, "Master, did you take anything out of the window?" I said, "No, my lad"—he said, "It is stripped"—I said, "Indeed!" and went to the police station, and found the property, and the prisoner in custody—this property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is all mine—it is pieces of pipe with which we make up different goods—I missed, altogether, about 50 lbs.—they are pieces that do not fit together in any way—I have found others of them since—they have been distributed about—I do not know the prisoner—I had such things as all of them—there is nothing I could say was not mine.</p>

               <p>I am innocent; I left my mother in Shoreditch; I worked on the water, as a lighterman; I met the other man, and came up by the bank, and he kicked against this basket, and said, "What is this?"—I said, "I don't know," and picked it up, and it was a lot of gas fittings, and he said, "Pack them up," and I did so, and when I had gone about a mile, the policeman came and took me.</p>

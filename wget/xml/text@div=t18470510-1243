                  </hi>. I am a flour factor, and reside in King's-road, Chelses✗ About the middle of April I had a horse and chaise to sell—the prisoner called at my house about it on the 15th or 16th of April—he said he knew a lady near the Regent's-park who wished to buy a pony and chaise, and he wished to see mine—he said it was just the thing she wanted, and he made as✗ appointment to come down on the Saturday to bring the lady—I waited at home on the Saturday, but he did not come—I went out, and left word that if the lady came they were not to take less than 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I came home the pony and chaise were gone—on that occasion it was brought back again—on Wednesday, the 21st of April, the prisoner came and said he had seen a gentleman who wanted to buy a horse, but he knew a pony would suit him purpose well, and he would call the next day—he did call, and said it was an independent gentleman living at Walham-green—I said I was parti<lb></lb>cular in selling it to a person who would take care of it, as we had had it some time—he said it was a gentleman living on his property, only him and his wife—I said, "Bring the gentleman to me"—he said he would not like the trouble—I said, "We must not mind trouble"—he said, "Will you let me take the pony and chaise and show the gentleman, and I will bring him back to you"—he went with it—he said, "Shall you be at home?"—I said, "Yes, I will wait at home till you come; how long shall you be?"—he said, "I shall not be gone above an hour"—I waited till half-past six o'clock, when he came driving up with a large horse and chaise—he said, "I have got a young horse, will you go down with me and see the gentleman'—I said, "I will not get up to risk my neck and I asked him what he had done with my horse and chaise—he said, "I have left it with the gentleman; he likes it very well, and will give you 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for it"—I said, "I would not sell it for any such money, that you knew, and I never gave you authority to sell it"—he said, "I will go and bring it back"—he went, and I sat up till between one and two o'clock in the morning—he never returned—I found my pony and chaise at Mr. Portlock's, who keeps the Red Lion at Walham-green, a sort of third rate public-house—I should not call him an independent gentleman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you say this pony had been taken away once in your absence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, by the prisoner, and he brought it back in the afternoon—the prisoner said that Silvester told him I had a pony and chaise for sale—I do not know where the prisoner took the pony and chaise to the first time he had it—I went out about twelve o'clock that day, and returned about three o'clock—that was on Saturday, the 17th of April—I might have seen the prisoner two or three times between that Satur<lb></lb>day and the day he took it to Walham-green—he brought a deaf and dumb gentleman one day—he might be there about a quarter of an hour—he looked at it and went away—it was on Thursday, the 22nd of April, the prisoner took it to Walham-green.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he had sold the pony and chaise for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you would not have objected? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what I should have done—I did not tell him to sell it for that—he was to bring the gentleman back to me—he was going there to show it to the gentleman—he said if I would allow him he would bring the gentleman back—supposing he had brought the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I do not know that I should have taken it—I do not think I should have taken it, but I had no chance—I never authorized him to sell it—I wished to see the gentleman—I</p>

               <p>was very cautious as to whose possession my pony and chaise got to—the prisoner said it was an independent man retired from business, and my pony and chaise would be well taken care of—I told him to bring my pony and chaise back—I did not say anything about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him to tell the gentleman I would not take less then 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was to bring the gentleman back, and the pony and chaise, and I was surprised at his leaving at behind—he had the pony and chaise between eleven and twelve o'clock, and he came back between six seven o'clock—he asked me to go to see the gentle<lb></lb>man, and I refused—I had told him I would not take less then 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when he came back I told him to go and fetch it back—he had no authority to leave it—Walhem-green is a mile and a quarter, or a mile and a balf from Chelsea—when the prisoner came to me that morning, between eleven and twelve o'clock, he was very sober—when he came in the evening he was in liquor, or appeared to be so—I could not tell whether he know what he was going—there was no knowing how he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had the pony? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between four and five years—it was a favourite—I would not sell it till I knew whose hands it came into—that was the principal thing to know where it was going—whether the prisoner was drunk or not, he said the gentleman would not give more then 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never received a farthing.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">GILLINGHAM</hi>. I am veterinary surgeon. I was at Chelsea on the 22nd of April, about one o'clock, and saw the prisoner at the Cadagon Arms—he had a pony and chaise with him—he offered me them for sale for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I offered him 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at first, and ultimatly offered him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he agreed to take—I afterwards had some doubts, and wanted to be off my bargain—I told him I thought the lot was not very cheap—he said, "You can do as you like"—I said I would not have it, and I think I paid for some sherry to be off the bargain.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been a veterinary surgeon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since 1838—I have been residing in Chelsea about five years—when I of<lb></lb>fered 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I thought that was as much as the pony and chaise were worth—I thought they were not worth that—that was the principal objection I had—he told me they belonged to a gentleman, and he had them to sell—he has frequently brought horses to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and live at Fulham. on the 22nd of April, between three and four o'lock in the afternoon, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner—he had a pony and chaise, and Mr. Fellows was in company with him—the prisoner said, "I have a pony and chaise to sell for a gentleman who discharged his servant about four months ago, and he has no further use for it, and, with a little attention, I think it would answer a person's pur<lb></lb>pose"—I said, "I have no more occasion for a pony and chaise then a cat has for a side-pocket"—I did not buy it then, but I ultimately bid him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—(he asked me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—when he was going away he said, "Give me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, you shall have it"—I said, "No, I offered you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "Give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more"—I bought it, and paid him 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening when I bought it, or nearly eight—he had gone away and returned again before that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

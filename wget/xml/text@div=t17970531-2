               <p>Q. Were you in liquor? - A. Not much; she said I should sleep with her all night for two shillings; I went up in the room with her, and she desired me to undress myself, and I did, and put my breeches under the pillow,and I sat down upon the bed, and she came and tumbled over me, and blowed the candle out, and took the breeches away, and was going off with them; she told me she would fetch some water she was so dry; I missed my breeches and went after her, and caught her on the stair-case, I held her fast, and brought her into the room again; I felt in my pocket, and the money was gone, and then she began to cry for the watch, and so did I, and the watchman came, and I gave charge of her; I had my money in my pocket when I was in the room, and she knew it too, for she felt my breeches before I undressed myself; there were eleven shillings, a dollar, four sixpences and three-pence, and a pair of sleeve buttons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you give me the dollar? - A. No; I was to give two shillings to sleep all night with her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. Last Sunday night, about half<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310011"></xptr>past ten, that man attacked me, he said, if I would take him home with me, he would give me a dollar; he went home with me, and pulled me about on the bed, in a very ridiculous manner, and though I am an unfortunate girl, I never saw a man have such actions in my life; he tore my clothes all to pieces, and my money fell out of my pocket, and I had it in my hand, I might have taken the button up in fun.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Wilson-street, Gray's-inn-lane. I am a tailor. A little before day-before day-break, on Sunday morning, the 27th of March, (I had been out all night to party of friends,) I met the prisoner in Gray's-inn-lane—she prevailed on me to go home with her to her lodging, in some court in Liquorpond-street—this was about a quarter past four o'clock—I went to a room in which Ellen Cavill was in bed—I took off my cloak, and sat upon the only seat what was in the room, and she directed my attention to Ellen Cavill—I rose from my seat, and the prisoner made</p>

About seven o'clock in the morning of Sunday, the 27th of March, I saw the prisoner with this cloak in her arms—she gave it me, and asked me if I would carry it up stairs for her, while she staid at the door, but I did not—I was walking with her with the cloak, and was stopped by the two policemen.</p>

                  </hi> I am in partnership with Mr. Francis Thomas Clarke; we are wholesale tea and coffee dealers, and live at No. 7, Arthur-street, London-bridge; the prisoner was in our service. In consequence of some circumstances, I ordered him to be watched, and on the following Monday afternoon I saw some goods at the Mansion-house which had been taken at the prisoner's house—they consisted of various parcels of sugar, thirty-two pounds of tea, some coffee, and some canisters which I can swear to—I cannot say when I had seen them last—I can swear they had been taken by somebody from us, and we had not sold them—the tea corresponded with ours—I believe it was ours—I could not swear to the sugar—there were five or six paper bags found, and some of them had pencil marks on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the <hi rend="italic">E</hi> division—on or about the 28th July last, I and Carter, another detective, received information of a robbery from Messrs. Leet &amp; Edwards, some bran fittings had been lost—in consequence of information I apprehended two men, named Eley and Floyd, who had formerly been in Leet &amp; Edwards' empty, and they were charged with breaking and entering the warehouse, and stealing the property—from information I went on the 29th, to the premises of the defendant Gale, at 69, Cow Gross, Smithfield, he carries on the business of a dealer in second-hand machinery, and old brass and metal—we saw Gale and had a conversation with him, he afterwards produced the stolen property—we took him into custody, and were bound over as wit<lb></lb>nesses to appear against him at the Middlesex Sessions—Floyd and Eley were also committed for trial—I gave evidence before the Magistrate of the finding the articles and of the conversation—the Middlesex Sessions commenced on Monday, 15th August—it is the custom there to fix a special day for the trial of bail prisoners—we went there on the Monday, to give evidence before the Grand Jury—about 1 o'clock, Carter and I went into the Fox and Horns public house to have lunch, it is a house close to the Sessions House, kept by Mr. Lambert—after we had finished lunch, Miss Lambert made a' communication to me, and pointed oat the prisoner Stewart, who was in the opposite bar to us—I looked to<lb></lb>wards him, he held up his finger, and I went to him with Carter—he said "Holloa, how are you, what will you have"—I said "I have not the pleasure of knowing you, sir"—he said "Oh, never mind, have a drop of brandy, and I will tell you who I am; you know me"—we each had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of brandy—he said "You have Gale in custody, have you not"—I said "Yes"—he said "He is a particular friend of mine, I have known him for a long time; I am told that all the evidence rests upon you two (that was Carter and me, who were standing together) any amount of money in reason you can have, if you will but get him off"—I said "We don't want any money"—we had just then drank up the brandy and were about to go out, and he said "Look here, here is my card,"he gave me his card and said "Go home, think it over, and meet me to<lb></lb>morrow evening, at 7 o'clock, at the Clock House, Leather Lane"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the card he gave me, "F. Stewart, iron-merchant, 48, Southampton Street, St. John Street, Clerkenwell. Smith's shops cleared on the shortest notice"—I said "Well, I won't promise you that we will meet you there, he said "I will wait from 7 till half-past, to see if you come"—we then went</p>

               <p>back to the Sessions, and when we returned to the Station, about 4 o'clock, we saw Inspector Shenton, and communicated to him what had taken place, and consulted him—we afterwards saw Superintendent Thomson in the evening—we received certain directions from him, in consequence of which we went on Tuesday evening, to the Clock House, Leather as appointed—the bill was found by the Grand Jury that day—Sergeant Kerley accompanied us to the Clock House, he was standing a little distance off—Stewart came to the Clock House just about the same time we did; I think we went into the public-house first, he came in just afterwards—he said "Good evening, my friend Gale is not a hundred yards off, would you like to see him"—I said "Well, I have no objection"—he said "We won't stop here, go to the Yorkshire Grey public-house (that is at the corner of King's Road and Gray's Inn Road) end I will meet you there in half-an-hour"—about 9.30 that same evening we went there; we went into the coffee-room, and the two prisoners came in to<lb></lb>gether directly—Stewart said "Good evening, here is my friend Gale, I want you to do what you can for him, I know you can get him off if you like"—I said "I can't say anything about that"—Gale said it was a very bad job, he had got a large family, he hoped we would do what we could—Stewart said "To show you I am genuine, I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now, and I will give you 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to<lb></lb>morrow, and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after the case is settled; I wont give it you in here, come outside, there is somebody sitting over the other side, I don't know who they are"—Gale was sitting close to us at this time, he could hear what was said—we all four went out into the Gray's Inn Road—there is a dead wall there—Stewart then handed a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—Gale was standing just facing him—we were all four standing together, looking at each other—Stewart said "If you come down to my place to-morrow I will bund you—, no, I will not do that; if you don't come to my place to-morrow I will come down to the Sessions House, about 12 or 1 o'clock, and I will give you the other 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then, and the other 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after the case is settled, malting altogether 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said I could not promise whether I would go to his house—I said "I don't think we shall come there"—he said "Then I will come to the Sessions"—I said "You shall see someone there"—we afterwards went to the Red Lion, and had some lemonade, and parted—as soon as I came out of the public-house, Sergeant Kerley had been standing outside, watching us, and I handed the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to him—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>—I wrote my name on it, and Kerley and Carter also wrote theirs—we reported what had occurred to Superintendent Thomson, and received further instructions—next day, Wednesday, we were at the Sessions House till 2 o'clock, and saw no one—in going home we had to cross Farringdon Street; a man came up and made a communication to us, in consequence of which we went to the Farringdon Street Railway Station, at 7 o'clock that evening, and saw Gale there—he said "I am very sorry we could not meet you this morning, being very busy; you must not stop here, I will meet you up at the Yorkshire Grey in half-an-hour or so"—we saw Sergeant Kerley, and we went to the Yorkshire Grey, and saw Gale there—said he was very sorry, he had been very busy "and another thing,"he said "I am rather short of cash; I lent some money out a short time ago, but I have two bills, one for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., twelve months after date; you can have that if you like"—he shewed it to me, and I fancy there was a little more than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, I think—I told him I would not take that—lie then</p>

               <p>said "Meet me to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock here, or a little after, I will see Stewart, I know he has been very busy, he is clearing some iron away from the House of Correction"—he said he would bring the remainder of the money, that was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Kerley was still outside—on our return to the station we reported what had occurred to the superintendent—about 9.30 next morning, Thursday, by instructions, we met Gale at the Yorkshire Grey—he said "My friend Stewart is not coming up yet, can you wait half-an-hour?"—I said "We hare got some business to attend to"—he said "I won't be long; you might come part of the way, come down as far as Hatton Garden, to the Globe public-house"—we waited outside the Globe till he came—he said "Come inside"—we went inside, and he there gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and five sovereigns—he said "I have not seen Stewart; but if you will meet me to-night, at 8.30, I shall see him in the meantime, and will see you to-night at the Yorkshire Grey—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I handed it to Kerley, with the five sovereigns, as soon as we came out<lb></lb>side the public-house—we again made a communication to the superintend<lb></lb>dent, and a warrant was applied for, before Sir Thomas Henry, to arrest the prisoners—that same night I and Carter went to the Yorkshire Grey, and saw Gale—he said Stewart was not come yet, he knew he had been very busy, he had hardly had time to get home and clean himself, "we will walk down that way, and I will go down to his house"—we went to Northampton Street, and Gale went to a house which he said was Stewart's—we remained at the top of the street; he came back and said "He is not in, he will be in in a few minutes"—whilst he was speaking Sergeant Kerley came up and took him into custody—he was taken to the station—Stewart was after wards brought there—he was going to say something—the superintendent said "Wait a moment, allow me to say that anything you say will be given in evidence against you"—Stewart then said he should not have done it if it had not been for Gale persuading him to do so, and Gale said "Shut up, don't say nothing here"—at the Police Court I gave evidence against the prisoner—Mr. Lewis, senior, defended Stewart—Stewart was about to say something, and Mr. Lewis told him to be quiet—he said "No, I will not; all the officer has stated is quite correct, and I don't want to tell any falsehood"—Mr. Lewis kept persuading him to hold his noise, and not to say any more, and Sir Thomas Henry said "As your solicitor advises you not to say anything, we will not take it down"—at the trial of Gale, Eley and Floyd, Gale was acquitted—I gave evidence against him at the trial as to what I knew of it.</p>

I am Superintendent of the <hi rend="italic">E</hi> Division of Police—on 15th August I received a report in writing from Carter and Chamberlain—I gave them certain instructions—reports were given to me by them from time to time, not quite daily—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes were brought to me by Sergeant Kerley—I was at the station at Bow Street on the 18th August when the prisoners were brought in under the warrant, I read the warrant to them, it charged them with conspiring to prevent the due course of law and justice, by offering to bribe the officers—Stewart said that what he did was to serve Gale—Gale said he would not bay any thing.</p>

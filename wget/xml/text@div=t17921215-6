He asked, whether Mr. Kay was at home? He was told, yes. He came into the counting-house, and shut-to the door. I did not at that time recollect him, because his face was painted; and he had the appearance of a person of a very ruddy complexion. He held up this pistol. - Says he, your money, or your life. I said, sir, my money! He said, sir, your money - your purse, or your life. I said I have no purse. I put my hand into my pocket, and took out 4 guineas, 4 half-guineas, 2 s. and a half-crown piece, and one farthing. I laid it upon the desk, where some half-pence were laying. - He took the chief part up with his left-hand, and held the pistol with his right. - He then changed the hand with the pistol, and directly held it up. - Now your pocket-book. My pocketbook, sir, says I. Yes, says he. - No<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150011"></xptr>hesitation. Your pocket-book, or your life! I took this book, and laid it on my desk. He said, that is not the book. No hesitation. - Your pocket-book, or your life - and if you move or stir, you are dead, you are dead, this instant! I thought I might as well lose my life as my pocket-book; and the prisoner, just at that time, seemed rather fool-hardy. I perceived he held his pistol rather loosely - I clap'd my hand on it, and seized him by the collar. He disentangled himself from me, struck me on the head, and brought me to the ground.</p>
               <p>Court. What did he strike you with? With the pistol - he cut my head violently, and brought me to the ground. I called out, Help! - Murder! On which my servant, who was in the passage, opened the door, and came in; and the prisoner took up the pistol, and cut his head likewise; on which my servant seized him. He was a powerful man. He seized him. I called out, hold him fast, till I can get a cord to tie him. He held him fast, and I went and got a cord, and tied him, hand and foot; and when he found he was over-powered - O! Mr. Kay, says he, You know me - You know me. I said, directly, - You villain, who are you? and took the candle to his face. On which I said, you are painted, my friend, I see: on which I took the handkerchief, and wiped some of the paint off his face, first on the one side, and then on the other: and then my maid came up. - Soon after that, another maid came up; and they said, O, that is Thomas, who came after Molly! I know him. I then secured him, and sent for the watchman; and then he was secured and sent to New-Prison. I am confident, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known the prisoner? - About two or three years.</p>

               <p>I was porter to Mr. Kay. I let in the prisoner. The prisoner knocked at the door, on Tuesday, the 4th, about nine o'clock in the evening, and asked me, if Mr. Kay was at home. I told him, yes: then I let him in; and, in the passage, he asked me if Mr. Kay was alone. I told him, yes. He directly walked into the counting-house, and shut the door; and in a little time, I heard Mr. Kay call out murder! and a great scuffle. I directly opened the door, when the prisoner turned at me, and knocked me on the head, with the pistol, and cut my head. I directly seized him by the collar, and held him; and I saw Mr. Kay down on the floor. Mr. Kay called out to me to hold him fast, and he would secure him.</p>
               <p>Q. After he was secured, did you recollect who the man was? - No, I never saw the man before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. This is the man you secured? - Yes; it is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bear an excellent character, my lord. My friends are not in town, at present. I expected my friends to be present to-day, but they are not here now.</p>

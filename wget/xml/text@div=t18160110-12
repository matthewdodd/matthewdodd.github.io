            . I live at Messrs. M'George, and Co's; they live at 43, Watling-street. I lost this piece of cotton on Monday, the 8th, about two o'clock, I was standing at about the center of the warehouse, and a man came in under a pretence of selling apples; I immediately ran forward to the door, and perceived the prisoner in the act of taking away the printed cotton, behind the man who had the apples in his hand, and he ran off with it; I pursued him, and he dropped it at the door, in the passage. I followed him into the street about a hundred yards, and caught him; I brought him back into the warehouse; a constable was sent for. The apple-man ran off, while I was following the prisoner. He was taken to the Compter.</p>

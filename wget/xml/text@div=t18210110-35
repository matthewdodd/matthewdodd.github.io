            . I am a constable. On Sunday the 24th of December, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I was in White Hart-yard, <placeName id="t18210110-35-crimeloc207">Drury-lane</placeName>

I saw them surround the prosecutor, and get him up against the shutters; Judd made a snatch at his watch, but did not get it then. Hancock laid hold of his watch in his fob, the prisoner got round on his right hand, and struck him on his ear; Hancock then fell, and another

             the watch out of his pocket, another took his handkerchief off his neck, he was down and they over him; the pad dropped out of his handkerchief, and Beach picked it up, he is a painter and was with me. I worked my way in among them, got Hancock out, and took him to the watch-house, he was intoxicated; I returned in about five minutes, and found Judd at the door of a coffee-shop. I seized him, and he resisted. I took him with great difficulty; several others were there, but Ewer came up, and we secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Where had you been all night - A. I left a friend's house in Vinegar-yard about a quarter before one o'clock. I was quite sober, and only drank porter, I do not like gin. I had been watching this party above an hour.</p>

On the morning of the 24th of December, I was in liquor, I remember being in the Strand, and going, I think, towards Temple-bar. I recollect nothing else till I found myself at the watch-house. I had my watch and handkerchief round my neck when I left work; when I was at the watch-house I missed them. My master's shop is in Great Portland-street; I left there about half-past twelve or one o'clock at night. I recollect being pushed or knocked down, but nothing more.</p>

            . I was with Rhind, and had spent the evening with him. I left about three o'clock or a little after with him. We watched several persons into a public-house for a quarter of an hour or more. Hancock came out soon after they went in, and several came out after him - they knocked him down, but whether he was robbed then I cannot say. I saw the pad of his handkerchief fall on the ground, but did not see them take anything - the prisoner was one of them, I did not know him before. I saw him over the prosecutor as he was on the ground, I could see his face. I did not notice any lamp there, but know him; I am sure he was one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw no robbery - A. No, I noticed no gas light - it was not particularly light. I was not so near to them as him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not leave the house till three o'clock - A. About three o'clock, I will not say whether it was before or after. The house was in Vinegar-yard, we drank different things - very little gin. I believe there was gin, we had porter, nothing else - there were above six of us.</p>

            . I was present when the prisoner was taken. I had been with Rhind and Beach early in the evening; left them, and came up as he collared the prisoner. He said it was for a robbery, and I assisted in taking him to the watch-house. Rhind said what he took him for; the prisoner struck him, and Rhind struck him again; several people came and shoved about, I kept them off. I had not been to Vinegar-yard with Rhind.</p>

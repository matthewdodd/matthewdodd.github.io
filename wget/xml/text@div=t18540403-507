The prisoner applied to me some time ago for the loan of some money; the first application must have been, I should imagine, about 20th March; it may have been a day or two earlier—I told him I was willing to advance him some money, provided he gave me a security—he said he thought a bill would be the best security, and I said I thought so too—I said I should be satisfied if his father-in-law, or brother-n-law would be security—he said his brother-in-law would do so—he afterwards brought me this bill, and I thereupon gave him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">The bill was here read, it was for</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">dated April</hi> 1, 1854, <hi rend="italic">and purported to be drawn and endorsed by S.

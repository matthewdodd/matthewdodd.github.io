                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Saysell, and live in Water-loo-road Lambeth. I took the prisoner, on the 10th of November, into my service she remained till the 21st of December—she then left without notice, and I missed these articles.</p>

I cannot say that it was by the prisoner—it was some female—she gave me the name of Ann Smith-the same day I took in a table-cloth, napkins, and a bed-gown; but they were redeemed—I should think they were pledged altogether, by my taking them in, and the ticket being my writing—I cannot recognise the prisoner—I think I live a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>

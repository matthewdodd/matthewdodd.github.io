                  </hi>. I am a chemist, of 1, South-street, New North-road—on 25th November last, between seven and eight o'clock, the pri<lb></lb>soner came to my shop and asked for a pennyworth of antibilious pills—she tendered at first a good half-crown, and immediately said, "Oh! wait, I have got some smaller change in my pocket"—she then put down a bad shilling, and instantly took up the half-crown—I took the shilling behind, tried it in the tester, and found it bad—I walked to the front of the counter, told her it was bad, and asked her how she came by it—she said her husband was a hawker and had taken it by mistake—I said I thought hawkers were better judges than that; that I did not believe she had got it that way—I asked her if she had any more in her possession—she said dis<lb></lb>tinctly that she had not—I watched her the whole of the time, and as I was looking out for a policeman I saw her drop another shilling on the cocoa-nut matting—I was going to pick it up, but she was too quick for me—she picked it up herself and declared it was the good half-crown—I sent for a constable and gave her in charge with the shilling—in the pri<lb></lb>soner's presence the policeman cautioned me to walk behind her, as she would no doubt drop the other one on the way—as we were crossing from one street to the other, in a soft part of the road, she dropped a bad shilling—I picked it up—I was close behind her then, watching her very closely—I halloed out to the policeman, "I have found a bad shilling; and she said, "Oh! no"—I gave it to the inspector at the station.</p>

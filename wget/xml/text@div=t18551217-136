                  </hi>. I am a cigar manufacturer and importer, of London Wall. The prisoner was in my service as traveller—his duties were to collect money, and, if in town, to send it in two or three days; if in the country, within a week or so—his commission was 12 1/2 per cent, on moneys received, not on orders got—in Aug., this year, he went into Kent, and returned in Oct., and handed me this account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the monies he had received—it amounts to 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had remitted to me 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—his commission taken off, leaves a balance of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due to me, and he said that he would call before the week was out and pay the balance, but he never did, and I went after him at the latter end of Oct.—he was then looking over some bills—I beckoned to him that I wanted to speak to him, and told him I should not want him to travel any more—I asked him for the money, took the bills out of his hand, made some sort of excuse, and put them in my pocket—those were further bills which I had given him to collect when he handed me in this account—we walked 200 or 300 yards, and he said, "Are you determined?"—that was to discharge him—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Can you give me a statement?"—I said, "Yes"—no more words passed between us—he only asked me for the accounts once—I had sent goods to Mrs. Isaacs, and she owed me, on 9th May, 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if I am not in the way the prisoner accounts to Mr. Wynn—he generally brings a statement of the money he has received, and we enter it from that state<lb></lb>ment into this book—the statements are preserved—this book is not in my writing, but I always gave him a receipt—the clerk in my presence enters the moneys he would pay to me—he pays me the money in a lump—he</p>

               <p>would sometimes, without delivering a statement, give me by word of mouth the sums he had received, and then we should give him a receipt for the money—the sums are invariably entered at the time in a boot—on this occasion he handed a statement in—he delivered no statement containing entries of these three sums, nor did he verbally account for them—I made inquiries, and on 8th Nov. received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), signed "Edward Bussell"—in consequence of the inquiries I made, the prisoner was apprehended on 23rd Nov., early in the morning—I appeared before the Magistrate on the same day, and when I came home I found this letter—I did not open it, but sent it at once to Mr. Hobler—I left home about 11 o'clock—it had not come then—the prisoner never put a date to a single bill. (<hi rend="italic">Three of the prisoner's written statements were here put in</hi>.)</p>

               <p>

What does that "366" refer to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is the page in the ledger—Blacklock is a customer's name—there were various times when the prisoner did not account at all—he has made a great many payments within three years, but out of all I have only got three written statements—I believe he did not give more than three—he used to say, "I will pay you 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to-day, and to-morrow I will bring you a statement," and would do so—I do not know that he ever paid me more than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—it was not immediately on his return from Kent that he brought this statement to me—he paid me about eight or nine days after he returned, and then we had to send after him several times, and when he came he brought this written statement with him—my clerk, Wynn, was present—we were both in the counting house—the prisoner handed this in as a statement of the money he had received in Kent—the goods had been sent to the customers three or four months before—he had been down canvassing, and had obtained the orders, and went down again to collect the money, and get new orders—this cash remitted, 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11 was sent to me by post, on account of these twenty-two orders, amounting to 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10 leaving a balance due to me of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he never went out of the house without his commission, after asking me for it—there was always a sort of running account between us as regarded his commission—my books will show payments to him—here is his signature for his commission, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my clerk can better explain whether that was given to him on account—this is in my clerk's writing—I always paid the prisoner cheques, and sometimes he used to have it in gold—I have never paid him on account more or less than his commission—I have several other travellers—during the whole of my dealings with the prisoner, he was sometimes a week without my seeing him—he also travelled for another house, a brewery, and they have discharged him too—the bills I took from his hand</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>.

'—that is another traveller who paid me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Parkham, his name is Spicer—I am positive that the pri<lb></lb>soner did not pay me that, because I know my own writing—my writing will not tell me who paid it, but I remember it, and I remember the day well—this "Hipgreen, paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," is included in the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Yes, I do, look at it <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, that is a mistake—no, it is not a mis<lb></lb>take, it is one of his customers, but there are two Packhams—Packham of Dover is one of his customers—he paid that 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I think, by my book, in the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not Mr. Spicer that paid it.</p>

               <p>

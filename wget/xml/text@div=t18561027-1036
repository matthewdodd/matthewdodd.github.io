                  </hi>. I live at No. 21, Oxford-street, Chelsea, and was porter to Mr. Stephens, of No. 28, Parliament-street. On 27th June the prisoner called at my house—my wife went to the door—I went up and found him stating his name to be Mr. Brown—I knew him—he came to give me information of the death of a gentleman who had lived with me, stating that he had died on his outward voyage, and that he was appointed to his place, and had landed yesterday at Liverpool, and if he could come to me he would have his things forwarded to my house—I could not give him an answer then—(Mr. Cook was the name of the gentleman; he was surgeon on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Assaye</hi>, and the prisoner stated that he was appointed in his stead to the <hi rend="italic">Assaye</hi>)—I told him to call at the office, and I would give him an answer in the course of the day—between 12 and I o'clock he came to Parliament-street, and after some little conversation I arranged that he should come to lodge and board as Dr. Cook had—he said that he had to go to Park-street to the Emigration Office to settle his affaire, and would return in half an hour to write a letter to Liverpool to have his luggage sent to my house—(the <hi rend="italic">Aseaye</hi> is an emigrant ship going to Calcutta)—prior to leaving he asked me if I would give him a glass of water—I went down stairs to get some water, and when I returned he met me at the door with the glass in his hand which I had left on the table; be drank a little, out the glass on the table, And left about 1 o'clock to go to Park-street—(after that I saw no more of him till I "saw him at Marylebone police court)—between 3 and 4 o'clock I had occasion to get out my purse, which had con<lb></lb>tained seven sovereigns and a half from the pocket of ft coat in the room in which the prisoner was, and missed fitora it three sovereigns—it was safe just before 10 o'clock—I cannot say how many people there are in the home, hut nobody has access to those rooms except me and persons who come on business—my coat was on the office table—I went to the office soon after 9 o'clock, and put one of the sovereigns in my purse just before 10 o'clock,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185610270130"></xptr>
               <p>and I counted my money then to see that it was correct, as my wife had put it in—I had not left the room at all from the time I counted it till the prisoner came, and then only to fetch the glass of water; he was the only person in the room then, and the only person in the room that day, except myself, I am positive of that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How long have you known me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had a little know<lb></lb>ledge of you about twelve months before, when you came to see Dr. Cook an acquaintance of your supposed grandfather—you called three or four times afterwards—you knew the address of my office—I showed you a case of instruments which the doctor had left, as he was indebted to me, and said that I wanted to sell it—I did not tell you to sell it for me—I did not know that you belonged to the Emigration Office, nor that you had just come out of jail, or I should not have had anything to do with you—you said that you had just returned from India—you showed me two papers, one signed by Mr. Cain, of the Emigration Office, and the other giving yourself a good character for the care of the <hi rend="italic">Coolies</hi>, who had been on their voyage to the West Indies; that you had seven deaths only, and had got very great praise for the care you had taken of them—I did not have occasion to show you that the money was in my pocket—when I missed the money I did not call at the Emigration Office after you—I have since known Mr. Lancaster then—I do not know the date that I went there—I did not see you in the passage there; I wish I had but I have only one eye—I did not call then to inquire for you, but to enquire whether the tale was true about Dr, Cook's death, and heard that you had been there borrowing money—I gave information to the police on the Monday after the Friday of my loss—when you called a gentleman was speaking to me, who had called to inquire for his letters—he did not go into the room at all—he was at the top of the stairs—he was not on my premises.</p>

               <p>---- (<hi rend="italic">policeman, E</hi> 109). On 24th and 25th June the prisoner was in Holloway prison, he came out on 26th June—I do not know that of my own knowledge—there is no one from the prison here—I saw him at the Mansion House on 4th April, and from there he went to Holloway prison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> When I called on this man, he offered me a case of instruments, and if I had had any felonious intention I should have accepted them; I had no knowledge of the money in his pocket; I left because he did not give me a decisive reply; he never came to inquire after me, and gave no information of his loss to the police; it is a place of public business, and anybody can enter; he has acknowledged that there was another gentleman there; I did not say that I had been to India, I said that I had received a letter from my father, stating that Dr. Cook had died, and I showed it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi>. The clerk at the Emigration Offiee confirmed the statement that Mr. Cook was dead—I am sure the prisoner said that he had just arrived from India, and that his things were on board the vessel at Liverpool, and that he would write for them and have them for<lb></lb>warded to my house—he did not say a word about his father—it was upwards of twelve months since I had seen him but I saw him five or six times.</p>

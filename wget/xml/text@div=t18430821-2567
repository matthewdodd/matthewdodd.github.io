                  </hi>. I am a farmer—I live at Deddington, in Kent—I have used the Nag's Head, Borough, for thirty-eight years when I came to town—I left home on the 13th of July, and had five half-sovereigns and some silver in a bag—I went through Sittingbourne, and there received three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, nine sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., t and arrived in town about eight o'clock in the evening—I supped with the landlady, and went to bed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184308210230"></xptr>
               <p>about twelve—I was quite'sober—when I came in in the evening, I felt my money quite safe in my left hand pocket—I doubled my breeches up, and laid them under the bolster—I had buttoned my pocket—I awoke next morning about four o'clock, just looked out of the window, laid down again, and went to sleep—I awoke by hearing a noise like the jingling of money—I said nothing for a few seconds—at last, thinking I heard somebody on the left hand side of the bed, I called out, "Who is there?"—I put the curtain aside, and there stood "boots" (the prisoner) by the side of the bed—I said, "Halloo, are you come for my shoes?"—he said, "No, I came to call you," and that he was ordered to call me at five o'clock—I said, "I gave no orders"—I saw him distinctly, and think it impossible I can be mistaken—I knew his voice, and saw his side face—he walked out of the room, saying, "I have made a mistake then, for I had to call somebody"—being one of the servants I did not at first think anything of it, but in a few minutes I examined my trow<lb></lb>sers, which I found just where I had put them—the pocket was not turned out, but unbuttoned and drawn up towards the top, and my bag and money were gone—I got up, went down stairs—I sat in the coffee-room, and gave him my shoes to bpush, which he did—he put them down, and turned to go out—I then asked him why he came to call me—he said he had not been in my room at all—I told him I had lost a parcel—he said he knew nothing of it—I then told him what it was—he said there was more in the house than him, there was sweeps sweeping the chimney, and people had got up and left about five o'clock, he did not know who they were, and there was another servant—I said, was he up?—he said "No"—he asked if he should call him—I said, "Do as you please"—he said, "It might be another person"—I said, "No, I am satisfied it is you"—I then considered I might as well see the other, though I was certain of him—I said I should go and stop payment of the notes—when I returned the waiter and prisoner were both there—when I saw the waiter I was positive it was not him—when I charged the prisoner with it about six o'clock he said, "Have you searched? you may have dropped it in the room; you was out in the evening, perhaps it might be picked out of your pocket"—I said, "No, I am quite certain it was safe when I went to bed"—the chambermaid afterwards produced my bag, containing three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—the gold was gone—I had been at the Nag's Head last June, but should not have known the prisoner if I had met him in the street before that, as a servant of the house—I am satisfied he is the man who was in my bed-room.</p>

               <p>and I was laying at the end of it—I got to the house about eight o'clock in the evening—I went out as far as St. George's church with a friend, and stood a minute talking by the railings—I know all was safe when I returned—the pri<lb></lb>soner was admitted to bail.</p>

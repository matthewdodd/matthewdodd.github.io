                  </hi>. I live in Brownlow-street, and am an officer of the Sheriff of Middlesex. I was in possession of the premises of Mr. George Hebden Gray, in George's-row, St. Luke's—I have the warrant under which I was in possession—I got it from the Sheriff's office in Red Lion-square—I put the prisoner in as my man—on the 17th of December I received information, and went to the station—I found the prisoner there in custody.</p>

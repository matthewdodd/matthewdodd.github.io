On the 19th of May, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I was on London-bridge, going into the Borough; I am sure I had a handkerchief in my outside coat pocket when I left home - I felt a motion, turned round, and it was gone; I did not see the prisoners - my handkerchief was produced by the officer of the bridge; the Police-man had stopped the prisoners, and brought them to the watch-house; the handkerchief has no private mark - I know it by the wear and pattern.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You seem rather to doubt about it - you had no private mark on it? A. No; it is not an uncommon pattern - there may possibly be another like it; I had used it a few minutes before, and was particular in putting it into my pocket, having been robbed twice before on the same spot - neither of the prisoners were in custody when the officer spoke to me: they were brought to the watch-house in about five minutes - nobody but the officer stated they had seen this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You felt your handkerchief go? A. I felt that I had lost it; I did not distinctly feel my coat moved.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 19th of May I was on London-bridge, and as I was pass<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270075"></xptr>ing, I saw the prisoners both close behind Mr. Harris -Hall was in the act of trying Mr. Harris' pocket; I stopped and crossed over the bridge - I lost sight of them while I crossed; I looked over, and saw Mr. Harris feeling in his pocket - I went up and asked if he had lost his handkerchief; he said Yes - I told him to stop; I went after the prisoners about twenty yards further on - I seized Hall, left him with Bowler, went on, seized Brown, and brought him back, took him to the watch-house, and Bowler produced a handkerchief, which Mr. Harris claimed.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Hall trying the pocket, and Brown in his company, was there another person between them who could have done the act? A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You lost sight of them? A. Yes; there was a great crowd on the bridge - persons might have intervened while I was crossing, or the handkerchief might have dropped on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. I have heard it said you are a preventive Police, why not try to prevent the robbery, instead of putting the County to the expence of the trial? A. I always understood we were to apprehend criminals; I suspected them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think a job at the Session would be a good thing for you? A. No, I did not - I know if they are found guilty I shall have my expences; it depends on circumstances, whether I shall have the expences if they are not found guilty - it depends on good evidence; I cannot say how much I expect, for I never received it - I know none of the Police who have had expences at these Sessions: I have been a Police-man four months - I was never at Clerkenwell; I gave evidence at Kingston, and got 7s. a day there - I cannot say what I expect here; it depends on my Lord's pleasure, whether I get any thing - I cannot saw how it will be: I may be mistaken about the amount I got at Kingston - I received 1l. 12s. altogether there; I said I got 7s., but did not say "a day;" I mentioned 7s., because you asked what I got a day - I did mean that I got 7s. a day, but I may have made a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think your expences depend on whether the prisoners are found guilty? A. I cannot say which way it will be.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you believe if the prisoners are found guilty you will have your expences, and if acquitted, you will not? A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What, do not you? A. What my Lord put to me; I cannot say whether I shall have them, if they are found guilty - I do not expect them if they are acquitted, nor if they are found guilty; if I say I do, you will say I came on purpose for them - it is left to my Lord's pleasure whether I have them or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know whether you expect any thing or not? A. I said just now I could not ascertain that: I do not expect the expences if they are found guilty - I have come here for the sake of pure justice; I do not mean to apply for the expences.</p>

            . I am an officer of London-bridge. I was standing on the middle of the bridge and saw the Police-man running, he had hold of Hall and gave him to me, and then went after the other; I had not seen either of them before - I took Hall to the watch-house, and found the handkerchief on him; Mr. Harris claimed it - I asked Hall where he got it; he said he had found it - the Police-man immediately brought Brown in; all he said was that he had seen Hall pick it up - I asked him what he was going to do with it, and he said any gentleman should have it who owned it, that he had picked it up; I had found it inside his shirt - his waistcoat was half unbuttoned.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Brown had not heard Hall's story when he said this? A. No; the bridge is always crowded from nine o'clock till eleven, with people as thick as they can walk - I do, and I do not expect my expences: I do not think about them when I come here for justice, and do not care whether I have them - I expect them.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you search Hall on the bridge? A. No, because it would cause a mob - I found the handkerchief in his breast between his shirt and body; it was an open shirt - nobody was in the watch-house then.</p>
               <p>Hall's Defence. I was going over the bridge, and on the turn of the bridge I saw a handkerchief lying: Brown was just before me - he attempted to pick it up; I took it up and put it into my bosom - he asked what I meant to do with it; I said if any gentleman owned it he should have it directly.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. I was about the centre of the bridge and saw the handkerchief lying - I was going to take it up; this young man took it up - I asked what he meant to do with it; he said to give it to the first gentleman who owned it - I went on, and the Police-man seized me.</p>

               <p>You do nothing with respect to this linen, but merely to porter it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you compare the linen with the bill? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>How was he drest? - I have only this to say, that he is near the matter of the dress that I saw him in at Sir Sampson's.</p>
               <p>What coloured coat had he on? now, I will tell you what you said there; you said,</p>

               <p>"he had on a livery coat, a handsome</p>

               <p>What waistcoat did you say he had? do not look at the prisoner. (To the prisoner.) Button up your coat. - I said, he had a striped waistcoat, I never said, he had a white waistcoat, to my knowledge, I said, he had a Monmouth-street great coat on, of a crimson colour.</p>
               <p>What coloured cape had it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, you never have said? - I never did.</p>
               <p>What were the breeches, buckskin or nankeen? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How soon after you had been sent for this coach did you see the prisoner? - It was the same day, at half past two I lost the property, and I saw Johnson about five.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - He was dressed in a different dress; he was in a very genteel brown coat, and a very genteel waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Had he buckskin breeches on? - I really do not know.</p>
               <p>How long was you with the man at his master's door? - I never stopped a minute.</p>
               <p>Is there any one feature in that man's face, that you dare swear to? - I swear to his whole face.</p>
               <p>Is there any one feature in his whole face that you know him by? - I know only this, that that gentleman, Mr. Johnson, is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Yes, yes, but thank God, Mr. Hall, that is not the evidence by which Juries decide? - He was a thin faced man.</p>
               <p>That will not do neither; why you might swear to me by that description? - He is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>What is there in his countenance remarkable, I ask you, brown or fair? - Every man's complection alters according to the season of the year.</p>

               <p>Court. What things did you see put into this bundle? - I saw shirts, sheets, a breakfast cloth, a table cloth, and ten napkins.</p>

               <p>Then how can you know? - Because they are all here; I saw no other things.</p>

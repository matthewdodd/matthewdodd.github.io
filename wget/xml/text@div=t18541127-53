                  </hi>. I am a sculptor, of No. 17, Newman-street, Oxford-street. I knew the late Mr. William Scoular for twenty years—he re<lb></lb>sided in Dean-street, Soho, and was a sculptor likewise—I have been in the habit of seeing him frequently during the latter years of his life, for the last ten years generally once a week, sometimes twice; and sometimes a month has passed when I have not seen him—I have been in the habit of calling there most frequently—in June last, the 10th, I think, I heard that he had become acquainted with a person named Edwards, with whom he had formed a partnership—I had not been consulted by any parties touching that part<lb></lb>nership—I only know from what I have been told how long the deceased had been acquainted with Edwards previous to the partnership being entered into—I do not know of my own knowledge that Mr. Edwards was acquainted with him any considerable time—in consequence of a communi<lb></lb>cation made to me by a man named Marcatti in June, I went to see Mr. Scoular (Marcatti has worked for Mr. Scoular ten or fifteen years)—I found him very unwell, I may say ill—his age was about fifty-nine—I saw him again about 9th or 10th July, and on that occasion I saw the defendant Edwards alone, and had a conversation with him—the first question he put to me was, "Do you know whether Mr. Scoular has made a will?"—I told him I did not know, but I thought it likely he might have made one—he then gain he thought it was quite proper that Mr. Scoular should make a will, and that he thought it also proper that he should make his (Mr. Edwards') solicitor, one of the executors—he then asked me if I should like to be the other—I said, "I suppose Mr. Scoular will do as he likes about that;" but that of course I should have no objection to act if Mr. Scoular did make me executor—I mentioned that Mr. Van Sandau was Mr. Scoular's attorney in case of a will having to be made, and that he had prevented Mr. Scoular from forming a partnership which might have turned out a dangerous one had it been formed—I mentioned to Edwards on that occasion that it would be more delicate for an old friend (meaning myself) to speak to Mr. Scoular on the subject of a will—I said, "I think it would be more delicate for me as an old friend to speak to him than yourself—I did not say "for me,"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270051"></xptr>
               <p>I meant to, but I said, "for an old friend"—lie referred to Mr. Scoular's brother, and said he should have sent to Scotland for his brother to come to London, but he had mentioned Mr. George Scoular to him, and he got in such a passion when his name was mentioned, that he should not do do—I think his words were, "He got into such a violent rage that I am afraid of mentioning his name again to him"—he said that the two brothers were at great enmity—that closed the conversation—from this day to the death of Mr. Scoular, I do not remember that Edwards said anything to me relative to Mr. Scoular making a will, nor did he tell me before Mr. Scoular's death that he had made a will—on 11th July, the day following, I believe I can swear to that date, it was Tuesday, I believe; I saw Mr. Scoular, he was extremely ill on the 10th, and on the 11th he was worse, in my opinion—I think he had been partially blind, and at that period he was purblind—if he was standing where I am he would see a candle on that table, but he would not distinguish any object—I mean that he was partially blind—I believe his illness was consumption—in consequence of a conversation I had with him, on 11th July, 1 saw Mr. Van Sandau, I believe on the 11th, and made a communication to him by the direction of Mr. Scoular; and in con<lb></lb>sequence of what passed between us, I saw the deceased again on the follow<lb></lb>ing day, and made a communication to him from Mr. Van Sandau—an appointment was made for Mr. Van Sandau to call on Mr. Scoular on the Thursday following—on the next day, the 12th, after I had seen Mr. Van Sandau, I was with Mr. Scoular, and Edwards called or beckoned me out of the room—I left the room, and he said that I was acting against the direc<lb></lb>tions of the doctor, that no one was to be allowed to see Mr. Scoular again till he was better—he did not mention who the doctor was—I already knew that it was Dr. D'Allex, one of the defendants—I went back to the room, and wished Mr. Scoular good bye—I do not think that Edwards accom<lb></lb>panied me—I called again that evening, but did not see Mr. Scoular—I saw Mr. Edwards, and was speaking to him, but nothing very important, wishing him good evening, when Dr. D'Allex entered the shop—I was then asking, I think, how Mr. Scoular had been; his reply was "A little better"—I then told D'Allex, in Edwards' presence, that Mr. Secular's attorney had appointed the following day to call for the purpose of making his will—I should men<lb></lb>tion that Dr. D'Allex said that Mr. Scoular could not be seen for some time, and in consequence of that I informed him of the intention of Mr. Van Sandau to be there, at his request, to make a will—I do not know whether I mentioned Mr. Van Sandau's name, or said "his solicitor"—Dr. D'Allex said that he was very ill, and must not be seen—I do not think Edwards said anything—I said to Dr. D'Allex, "Do not you think that the absence of, Mr. Scoular's solicitor, whom he has appointed to see for such a purpose, will be the means of exciting him very much, and making him worse?"—he said that it would not be well for him (Scoular) to see him for a few days—I then said, "I presume I must put off Mr. Van Sandau," or "the solicitor"—Edwards said "Yes," and so did Dr. D'Allex—that closed the conversation, and I then left the house—Ed wards was present all the time, to the best of my belief—in the course of that evening I happened to be in Dean-street—I think I passed the house two or three times that evening, but did not see Edwards—two or three evenings afterwards I called to ask how Mr. Scoular was; the shop door was opened by the nurse—a conversation took place between me and the nurse, and I left the house without seeing Mr. Scoular—I called on Dr. D'Allex that evening, and saw him—I did not tell him that I had been to Mr. Scoular and had seen the nurse—I asked him how Mr. Scoular</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270052"></xptr>
               <p>was; he said that he was better—I asked if he had been delirious, he said "No, only a little light headed"—I put that question to him because I had put similar questions to the nurse—I called on Dr. D'Allex in consequence of the conversation between me and the nurse—I asked him if he thought Mr. Scoular would know me if I called upon him—he said, "Yes"—I told him I knew Mr. Scoular would be glad to see me, and that if he would allow me to see him, I passed my word that I would not even speak or enter the room; I would merely look into the room to be satisfied that he was com<lb></lb>fortable—he said he could not allow it just then, not for a day or two, and he told me he would call on me next day, and let me know how Mr. Scoular did—he did call on me next day, and in the course of conversation he said, "Did you ever hear of Mr. Scoular's brother leaving him 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I said, "No, I do not believe it; I do not think Mr. Scoular is worth as many hundreds"—he said that Mr. Scoular was very ill—I do not think anything further passed of importance—on 19th July one of my sons brought me a message from Mr. Scoular, and I immediately went to his house; on my way I met Dr. D'Allex, and asked him how Mr. Scoular was; he said he was very much excited, for Mr. Campbell had been there (he is the celebrated sculptor, and a very old friend of Mr. Scoular)—I said, "I know Mr. Campbell has been there"—he said, "How do you know that?"—I told him that I heard that Mr. Campbell had been sent for, and that Mr. Scoular had also sent for me, and said, "I suppose there is no objection to my seeing him now"—he said, "Yes, there is, you must not," or some<lb></lb>thing to that effect—I then parted with him, and went on to Mr. Scoular's house; on arriving there I opened the door, and went up to Mr. Scoular's room immediately without asking permission—I saw him; he was very ill, I believe—Mr. Edwards seeing me go up ran after me, but I was up first; I think he stopped, that he did not follow me into the room; he did not speak to me—I considered Mr. Scoular to be perfectly sane always, but very weak; I conversed with him, it was half past 6 o'clock in the evening—after leaving I was crossing the street coining out of Soho-square, and crossing Dean-street; the house is almost at the corner, and I saw a van at Mr. Scoular's door; it was then 7 or half past 7 o'clock—I did not pay attention to what sort of goods were being placed in the van; there was something in it—I do not know of my own knowledge where what was in the van was conveyed—on that evening I received a note from Mr. Campbell, in consequence of which I called on Mr. Van Sandau, and on the following day, the 20th, I accompanied him and Mr. Campbell to Mr. Scoular's house—we saw the defendant Edwards; Mr. Van Sandau repre<lb></lb>sented that he was Mr. Scoular's attorney, and that he had called respecting taking instructions for his will—Mr. Edwards said he could not be seen, that he had his own interests to look after, and he should not allow him to go up stairs—a person who I believe to be Edwards's mother, and some other person, a man whom I do not know, were with him—Mr. Van Sandau conducted the conversation; he spoke in very strong terms of Edwards not allowing it—he said, "I advise you to allow him to see his solicitor, it is nothing but right," and advised him to allow him to see him—he said that if he was acting a fair part he would allow him to see his solicitor, and that he thought he was not acting a fair part not to allow him to see him—nothing more was said about a will—I said I was an old friend of Mr. Scoular, and I should go up stairs, and nothing but force should prevent me—Edwards then stood on the staircase to prevent me, and I desisted, it was then 12 o'clock—in consequence of what took place I went to Marl borough-street</p>

               <p>police office, and afterwards on the same day, at a little after 2 o'clock, I went to Mr. Scoular's house again, accompanied by a policeman, and a medical man, Mr. George Simpson, of Gower-street, Bedford-square—we saw Mr. Edwards—the policeman spoke to him, and said he had called by the direc<lb></lb>tion of Mr. Hardwicke, the Magistrate, to request that Mr. Edwards would allow Mr. Simpson to see Mr. Scoular—Mr. Edwards said that he could not allow Mr. Scoular to be seen by Mr. Simpson, unless it was in the pre<lb></lb>sence of Dr. D'Allex—we then left—on the evening of that day, I called at Mr. Campbell's house, in Marlborough-street—I had received a letter from The defendant Plowright that afternoon, Mr. Van Sandau has got it—(<hi rend="italic">the letter was here produced by Mr. Van Sandau, and read:</hi> "25, John-street, Bedford<lb></lb>row, 20th July, 1854. Sir,—In consequence of your unjustifiable proceed<lb></lb>ings, I have this morning, at the request of my client Mr. Edwards, seen Mr. Scoular's medical man, Dr. D'Allex, 60, Berners-street, Oxford-street; who has intimated to me, and has left advice that Mr. Scoular is not to be seen by any friends for the present, and that owing to your late proceedings his ill<lb></lb>ness has been increased. Mr. Scoular has also himself expressly desired that no one should be admitted to his room until he is better. I have, therefore, in the first place to beg of you, if you are the friend of Mr. Scoular you profess to be, that you will not for the present trouble him with your visits; but should you again adopt proceedings similar to those adopted this morning, I have left instructions with Mr. Edwards to call in a police constable. In great haste, your obedient servant, E. W. Plowright. E. Papworth, Esq., 17, Newman-street, Oxford-street."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the 20th, the day on which you received that letter, did you call at Mr. Campbell's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and there met Plowright; and in consequence of what passed between us, I called at Mr. Scoular's house that evening at 7 o'clock, accompanied by Mr. Simpson—I had told Mr. Plowright that he should not have addressed me in the note which has just been read—he said he did not know who he was writing to at the time—I told him I considered it extremely strange that Mr. Scoular was not allowed to see his friends—he said there was no reason whatever why Mr. Scoular's friends should not see him; that I might go any time I liked, and that all his friends might go—I then arranged with Plowright that I would go at 7 o'clock that evening, and I did do so, accompanied by Mr. Simpson, the surgeon—we saw Mr. Scoular; he was very ill indeed, but perfectly sensible—he was able to hold conversation, but was weak in the chest—Mr. Simpson went in with me—Dr. D'Allex was in the room—I think I said, "Good evening, Dr. D'Allex"—he said he had heard what I had been saying about him; he was very much excited, and talked very loudly, but I could not understand what he said—I remarked that if he had anything to say, he had better go out of that room—Mr. Simpson and Dr. D'Allex then left the room together, I do not know for what purpose, and I then had a conversation with Mr. Scoular—when I left the room, I found Dr. D'Allex, Edwards, and Mr. Simpson in the next room together—nothing of any consequence passed—Mr. Simpson said, in the presence of Edwards, D'Allex, and myself, "I will see what Mr. Scoular's wishes are," and went away for three or four minutes, leaving me with Dr. D'Allex and Mr. Edwards—he then returned, and said he had asked Mr. Scoular what he wished, and he said he wished to see Mr. Papworth occasionally, and he wished to see Mr. Van Sandau—we then left the room; and on descending the stairs towards the street, I was called back by the nurse—in consequence of what she said, I returned into Mr. Scoular's room, and a few words</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270054"></xptr>
               <p>passed between us—in consequence of what had taken place, I went that evening to Mr. Van Sandau's office, and on my return home late that night, I received this letter—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "92, Dean-street, Thursday evening. It is my particular wish, at the instigation of my doctor, that my interview with you may be deferred for a few days, until I am better able to bear the excitement Wm Scoular")—it is written in a strange hand, but is the signature of Mr. Scoular—I took this letter to Mr. Van Sandau that night—I went twice to him that night—I then felt it right to communicate with the deceased's friends in Scotland, and on the Saturday in that week, George Scoular, the brother of the deceased, arrived in London, and he and I and Mr. Van Sandau went on that day to Plowright's office, about 12 or 1 o'clock—we left Plowright's office together, but I left them on the way to the deceased's residence; I did not accompany them—on Sunday morning, 23rd July, I received a note from Edwards; this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "92, Dean-street, Sunday. Mr. Papworth. Sir,—I write to inform you that Mr. Scoular died this morning, at 8 o'clock, and yourself and Mr. Plowright are appointed his executors under the will")—until I received that, I had no idea that a will had been made—on that Sunday, I accompanied Mr. Van Sandau and Simpson to the house of the deceased—I think Mr. Plowright was the first person we saw—Mr. Edwards was not there at that time—Mr. Van Sandau said that I had received a letter that morning acquainting me of the death of Mr. Scoular, and that he was very much astonished at his dying so un<lb></lb>expectedly and so suddenly; I cannot swear to the words; and he requested Plowright to give up the will, if he, Plowright, had it in his possession—he said that Mr. Edwards had sent it to him—he said lie was willing that Mr. Van Sandau should see it, and that he thought it quite proper to put somebody into the house, to take care that the property was not removed, and for the purpose of getting some person, Mr. Van Sandau, Mr. Plow<lb></lb>right, and myself went to the police office.</p>

               <p>must correct myself; whether it was against Edwards or not I do not know—I did not hear Mr. Van Sandau accuse Edwards of causing the death of the deceased—I never had any interest in Mr. Scoular's private affairs, further than when he has asked me in do so—I have lent him money—that was when he was in Rome, in 1835—I lent him various sums, I cannot say how much—I took the benefit if the Insolvent Debtors' Act two years ago—Mr. Scoular was one of my creditors then, to a small extent; I cannot say how much—I do not know whether I was his debtor or whether he was my debtor—I do not think he was my creditor when I took the benefit of the Act—the account was so nearly balanced that I cannot say whether he was debtor or creditor if we balanced accounts—I had to swear to the correctness of my balance sheet—I mean to tell those twelve gentlemen, on my solemn oath, that I do not know whether I am debtor or creditor—I cannot swear that it is rather more "Yes" I than "No"—I do not think he was included in my schedule for that very reason—I will not swear that—I have been twice insolvent—I was so three years before—Mr. Scoular was not a creditor then—if I was in debt with Mr. Scoular at all it was not increased—I cannot say whether in the former one the balance was in favour of myself or not—I had no intention of becoming Mr. Scoular's partner, or of succeeding to his business—I would not succeed to it—he was a plaster caster, and I know nothing about the business at all—I perhaps saw Mr. Scoular ten times after 10th June, but I cannot swear to it—I did not always find him in bed—about the middle of June he was sitting in his ordinary sitting room, and towards the end of June also, I think—I saw him five times in July; he was in bed each time—I saw him twice or three times alone, and was with him a quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, or half an hour—I did not see him once in company with Mr. Van Sandau—I went to his house once with Mr. Van'Sandau, but Mr. Van Sandau did not see him then—I was there when Mr. Simpson and Dr. D'Allex retired, and then I was alone with the deceased—they were absent two or three minutes.</p>

               <p>Scoular's particular request—I do not recollect there being an altercation between me and some parties in the sick room—there was loud talking on Dr. D'Allex's part—I was perfectly calm—I merely told Dr. D'Allex that if he had anything to say he had better say it out of that room—I do not think that he told me on one occasion that my disturbance in the sick room had increased Mr. Scoular's excitement and endangered his life; I cannot swear that he did not—I had not an interview with Edwards on 9th July—I believe it was on Monday, the 10th, that he suggested to me that it was necessary that Mr. Scoular should make his will, but if you will give me leave to correct myself, it might have been Sunday, the 9th—he said that Mr. Scoular was very ill, and he thought it was necessary that if he had not made his will he should be told to do so—he did not say that he thought it was proper that I should be one of the executors—he rather asked me if I would be one—I did not act as one—you may say I did, as I ordered the funeral—I locked up the papers, but I did not act as executor—I do not know Mr. Goldsworthy—the gentleman who took the inventory was Mr. Chinnock—on my oath, I did not tell him that I was executor, and give him orders; quite the reverse—I did not say so—I repudiated the will, and said I was not executor—it was as an old friend that I ordered the property to be sold, put a person in the house, and had an inventory taken, and it was as an old friend that I ordered the funeral—you are the best judge whether I had any right to do it—I certainly did not do it as executor under the will—I did not, under the advice of Mr. Van Sandau, consent to have the inventory taken as executor.</p>

               <p>under that piece of paper, I have not attempted to realize anything—I did lock up papers; I did so to keep them quite safe—I also went to the police court for the purpose of obtaining officers of the law to watch the house—there has not been to my knowledge the slightest pretence for saying that 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing by me to Mr. Scoular; I never heard such a thing, I never heard that Mr. Scoular had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to lend—I did not know him at Rome as a student, but as an established man there; I lent him money; he was very badly off, he came to London" and when I returned to London I found him in this situation—I am with Mr. Bayley, the eminent sculptor; he is my father in law, I have been with him almost all my life—whatever is due one way or the other between me and Mr. Scoular, has reference to nothing but loans of money between us at different periods of my life; those trans<lb></lb>actions of small loans extended over fifteen or twenty years—Mr. Scoular never made any claim on me, or I on him, down to his death—he was aware of my misfortune in going through the court—I was not present on the Saturday, when Mr. Van Sandau went to take instructions for the will; I heard that he went on the Sunday, and found him dead—I felt it my duty to go to the Coroner, because I did not think that be would die so suddenly; I believe I was the only friend who visited him in a friendly way; he was a very singular man, and there was a great attachment between us, and the last time I saw him he said, "Things are going on very badly"—<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Edwards ever say anything to you, or have you ever had any conversation with him, by which you have learnt whether he did invest any money in the business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have since seen the books; I never had any conversation with Mr. Edwards about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I rather interrupted you, go on with your former answer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I remonstrated with Mr. Edwards upon what I considered the impropriety of his conduct; and I then insisted that if he would not allow me to see Scoular, at least he should allow Mr. Simpson, the medical man, who had teen him the preceding evening.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember the words in which you remonstrated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told him that it appeared to me his conduct was extremely improper, that he would draw upon himself very important consequences, that it was highly improper to interfere between a man who was in a state of extreme ill health and the making of his will, and he would probably draw very grave inconveniences and responsibilities upon himself—I cannot say that those were the precise words, that is the substance; and I then said, "I dare you to refuse Mr. Simpson, the medical man, to see him, to see the state in which he now is"—after some hesitation he consented to allow Mr. Simpson to go up stairs to Scoular—Mr. Simpson remained up stairs with Mr. Scoular five or six minutes, and during that time I asked Edwards how long he had known Mr. Scoular—he told me that the partnership had com<lb></lb>menced some time in May, but that he had had a great deal of business with him previously to that—he did not state how long he had known him—some mention was made of partnership articles—I asked to see those part<lb></lb>nership articles—Edwards said he believed Scoular's part was somewhere about the house, he did not know; but Mr. Plowright had his part of the agreement—I asked Mr. Edwards if Mr. Plowright would produce it to me—he said he had no doubt he would.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270062"></xptr>
               <p>of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in two years; that I have read—the partnership deed I have sufficiently looked at to understand its contents—the deed alleges, that in consideration of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then paid, the receipt of which is acknowledged and endorsed on the back of it, that Scoular sold to Edwards one half of his stock in trade, and various other things; then there is a bond for the payment of that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. two years after date: he was to receive as a partner 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week out of the concern—the partnership deed I should state also purports to be in consideration of some stock in trade of Edwards, which is alleged to have been brought into the concern—I waited till Mr. Simpson came down—I did not succeed in seeing Mr. Scoular at all that morning—when Mr. Simp<lb></lb>son came down, he stated, in Edwards' presence, and to Edwards and my<lb></lb>self, that Mr. Scoular was much worse than he was the preceding evening, that he was in a state of agitation, that he had learnt that he had passed a bad night, and that if he were asked to make a will, it was expedient be should do so immediately; it was desirable he should do so directly, for there was no knowing how long he would be capable of making a will—this was said in the hearing of Edwards—he further stated that Scoular had intimated a desire that the nurse should leave the room, and that he (Simp<lb></lb>son) had desired the nurse to do so—he stated that Scoular had told him that his medical man, Dr. D'Allex, had told him that if he saw Mr. Papworth he would no longer attend him, and that he said, "You saw what a scene took place yesterday; what I want is peace and quiet, and therefore I am forced to postpone seeing Mr. Papworth for some time"—I think he said for a week or a fortnight longer—Mr. Simpson further stated to Mr. Edwards and myself, that he had told Scoular that I was below, and that I had come by his appointment, and intimated that it was expedient if he meant to make a will he should see me, and that Scoular had said, that for fear of giving offence, he could not see me then, or for a week or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that he said, by way of repeating those words, "for fear of giving offence?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My recollection of the conversation is precisely as I have stated, that Mr. Simpson expressly stated that Scoular had repeated to him, that for fear of giving offence, he was forced to delay seeing me for a week or a fortnight longer—Mr. Simpson further stated that he had expressly asked Scoular if he had made a will, and Scoular had stated emphatically that he had not made any will—I then asked Mr. Ed<lb></lb>wards if he would, after hearing that, permit me to see him—Edwards replied, "I have my own interests to protect, and I will do so"—he then repeated that he had invested his money in the concern—he also expressly stated that he would not permit me to have any private interview whatever with Mr. Scoular—I asked him what right he had to interfere between Mr. Scoular and his solicitor, or with the making of his will—I repeated that he might draw grave consequences upon himself by his conduct, and I said, "I will now advise you as I would if I were advising you as your solicitor: I would say, 'Send for your solicitor, consult him, and if he is a respectable man, he will advise you, to quiet this poor old man's mind, and to permit him to see his solicitor, and those friends whom he is desirous of seeing'"—Mr. Edwards thanked me for my advice, and I then left.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand that when you asked Edwards whether, after hearing what he had heard, he would prevent your seeing him, the first thing he said was, "I have my own interests to protect"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe that was the first thing he said, the immediate answer—I have omitted to state that after this conversation Edwards stated, "Scoular may appear</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he recognise his brother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He recognised me—he spoke to his brother as "George."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the brother go up again with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The brother went up with me—at the time the brother went in, I did not see that there was any particular notice of the brother—he had previously seen him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">expressed an opinion that it would not be admissible, unless the will was in question, which it was not in this inquiry</hi>)—upon my coming down stairs, I learnt from Mr. George Scoular that Edwards had come in—I expressed a desire to see him, and it was intimated to me that he declined to see me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As regards the state of mind of Mr. William Scoular on that occasion, did he, in your presence, recognise his brother, or address him in any way, so as to show that he knew him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He gave him directions; and I am prepared to state, from what I myself observed, that his mind was perfectly composed, and he was perfectly conscious of all that passed—I received certain instructions from him in reference to a will—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">proposed to ask who were named as legatees, but the question was objected to, and over<lb></lb>ruled</hi>)—I had not, before I went there, prepared any will, or anything of the kind.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whatever instructions you took or wrote, did you take them upon</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270064"></xptr>
               <p>any paper that you had brought with you, or how was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I brought no papers with me when I went into the room—Mr. George Scoular gave me a sheet of paper which I hold in my hand, and very imperfect writing materials—it was upon this piece of paper that I wrote down, as far as I did write them down, the wishes he expressed to me with regard to his property; I also collected from my conversation with him what his wishes were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you had known Mr. Scoular for many years, did you know of any hostile feeling between him and his brother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware that I knew that he had a brother until about 11th July, when Mr. Papworth called upon me, and I certainly knew of no hostile feeling existing—when he saw his brother in my presence, upon the occasion of my taking the instruc<lb></lb>tions for his will; he did not exhibit by word or manner any hostile feeling towards him—what then passed would lead me to the direct contrary opinion, that there was no hostility towards his brother—I then returned to my office, after calling, I think, at another place, and I then prepared the draft of the will which I hold in my hand, in accordance with the instruc<lb></lb>tions which I had received, and the same afternoon, immediately afterwards, I had it fair copied by one of my clerks, and I hold that fair copy in my hand—when I went up-stairs on this occasion, there was no one else in the room besides George Scoular; and by the desire of his brother, which I repeated to him, he left the room—it was entirely in his absence that I took the instructions in reference to the will—I prepared the will in accordance with the instructions of the deceased; according to my judgment and know<lb></lb>ledge as a solicitor, and I believe in precise accordance with his directions—neither Mr. Papworth or myself had a shadow of interest or hope in reference to the property of the deceased—there certainly was not the shadow of a hope on my part, and I never heard any expressed by Mr. Papworth—I returned again on the Sunday, but previously between 5 and 6 o'clock on the Saturday, I saw Mr. Plowright, in accordance with the appointment I had made in the middle of the day at Plowright's, and of the letter which I received—I mentioned to him that I understood he had prepared some partnership articles between Edwards and Scoular, and I expressed my surprise that he, as the solicitor of Edwards, should have prepared partnership articles for a man in the state in which Mr. Scoular was, without the intervention of his solicitor—he said he did not consider the solicitor of Mr. Scoular was necessary, as the partnership articles which he prepared were a mere copy of the partnership articles which I had prepared some years previously, between Scoular and Loft—I told him that I had not been able to see Mr. Scoular's copy of those partnership articles, but that I had learnt from Edwards that he had Edwards's copy, and I asked him if he would permit me to see it—he said, "Yes," and produced it, and at my instance, he lent me the draft of those articles—he then said that the consideration was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that as Edwards had no money, he had given a, bond for the payment of the money in two years—he sponta<lb></lb>neously added that the capital was to be 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was all to be provided by Mr. Scoular, and to be paid into a bank to the joint account of Scoular and Edwards—he told me, also spontaneously, that he had found that Scoular was indebted about 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for rent to his landlord, and that he wanted some money for himself, and that therefore he had taken from Scoular a power of attorney to sell out 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Consols; that power of attorney he told me was made out to himself and to Edwards, and also extended to the receipt by them of the dividends due to Scoular—he told</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270065"></xptr>
               <p>me that he had sold out, I think it was the sum of 545<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, to raise the precise sum of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that as Scoular was not able to go to the banker's, he had paid it in to the separate account of Edwards, at the Union Bank—I inquired if the dividends had also been received, and he told me they had not, and if I pleased, he would himself receive those dividends, and pay them to me—(I afterwards found there was an arrear of dividends)—I objected to receive the dividends myself; I suggested that Mr. Plowright had better receive them, and I should be more content with their being in his hands, than their getting into the hands of Mr. Edwards—I afterwards found at the Bank that the dividends had then been received—I went to the Bank on the 24th, and I afterwards spoke, on the 24th, to Edwards and Plowright, and found that they had been received before—they did not state at what time—the Bank clerk is here—both Edwards and Plowright told me on the 24th that they had been received—I represented to Plow<lb></lb>right, in the presence of Edwards, that I found they had been received pre<lb></lb>viously to the 22nd—Mr. Plowright said that he had learnt from Edwards that morning that they had been received—I asked the amount; Edwards said 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or thereabouts, and that had been paid to the account of Mr. Scoular—I asked if he meant that it had been paid to the separate account of Scoular, or into the account opened in his name.—he asked Plowright if he should answer that question, and Plowright desired him not to do so—at my interview with Plowright, on the evening of the 22nd, I told him that I had that day been to Scoular's, had seen Scoular, and had taken the instructions for his will, and that those instructions were to leave every<lb></lb>thing to his brother, with the exception of legacies to his two cousins, whose names were Janet Thompson and Mary Ann Thompson—this was said to Plowright only—Edwards was not there—I am now speaking of what occurred on the evening of the 22nd—Plowright said that he was aware I had seen him, for he himself had seen him since—he said he himself had been several times to him to get him to make a will, and that he had always postponed doing so—I believe the expression he used was, "I have been several times to him to get him to make a will, and he always post<lb></lb>poned it," and he said, "I have desisted in consequence calling upon him for the purpose"—I then adverted to the note, which is dated "Thursday," signed by Scoular, and said, "I am fearful that any party who could get him to sign such a letter, might get him to sign any other document," and Plowright assured me that he believed that Scoular had made no will—I believe that was all that took place at that interview:—on Sunday morning, 23rd, accompanied by Mr. Simpson, I went to Scoular's; Edwards came in immediately after me—I stated that I came to take his signature to his will, and I was told that he had died that morning at 8 o'clock—I then told Edwards that I understood from Mr. Plowright that he had had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Scoular's money, and that it had been paid into the Bank, and I asked him if he would permit me to see his banker's book, that I might satisfy myself that the money was safe; he told me that Sunday was not a proper day for the purpose, but if I would call next day he would show me the banker's book—I then, with Mr. Simpson, left Dean-street, and went to Mr. Papworth's house, in Newman-street—Mr. Papworth was out for the moment, but his son told me that Mr. Edwards had just left a letter there—I found the letter, which I opened; it is here—it is dated Sunday—after that, I accompanied Mr. Papworth, and I think also Mr. Simpson, back to Scoular's, and we there met Mr. Plowright—I think Mr. Simpson did not then remain—when we returned, Edwards was out—Plowright told</p>

               <p>us that he had that morning learnt from Edwards that Scoular was dead, and that Edwards had left in his possession a will, which will we might see if we thought proper—I have a copy of the will—I afterwards went with Plowright and Papworth to the police office, to put a man in watch of the premises, and I accompanied them to Plowright's house—I was then shown a will, of which I was allowed to take a copy, and of which it is a true copy; Mr. Plowright himself having examined it with me—I expressed my conviction that the will could not possibly stand, in which opinion Mr. Plowright concurred, stating that Edwards had been too greedy, and that the will could not stand—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not say, upon Mr. Sleigh entreating him to hear the case, that if he could he would please all parties, and he would not hear anything until after the Chancery suit was decided? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe some words to that effect he did state, but he certainly did not dismiss the summons—he did not reject the argument urged by Mr. Sleigh, and the impression upon my mind is that he did not consider it was a case that he ought, as he did</p>

               <p>not, to dismiss—he declined to hear the evidence, stating that he thought it would be indecent for a single Magistrate to hear a case which was before the Lord Chancellor—I think it was on 15th Sept. that I preferred the bill before the Grand Jury.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you last do any legal business for the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think, according to the best of my recollection, it was in March in the present year, when I was, by his desire, instructed to inquire into, and make proper arrangements with a person of the name of Mismay, with whom it was proposed that he should go into a kind of partnership, and upon that occasion, although I did not personally see Mr. Scoular, he came to my office to see me—some few months previous to that, I had had some com<lb></lb>munication with Mr. Scoular himself—his business was in the collection of money, or otherwise—I cannot tell when the last time was—it was in the course of the preceding year—it was not years ago—my partner attended to those things more generally; it was the collection of money, which does not come under my department—I do not know that I ever heard of his brother before this matter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Although you were his confidential adviser? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not tell you I was his confidential adviser; I said that when he wanted a solicitor he consulted me—I believe if he had any matter of confidence he would consult me upon it—he consulted me upon the subject of his forming a partnership with Loft, and also upon the dissolution—I arranged the disso<lb></lb>lution—I did not find that the deed of partnership between Edwards and the deceased was nearly a copy of mine that I had made before; on the contrary, I found there were material differences—in the early part of the deed there are words introduced by which Scoular is made to make over, as I read the deed, all book debts—those words are introduced in the recital of the agreement, although they are not in the operative part—in my appre<lb></lb>hension, if the deed was valid, it would pass the book debts, although it is not in the operative part—a recital is often considered a covenant in part<lb></lb>nership articles—in the deed with Loft, the partnership capital was to be furnished by the two equally—in this instance they are wholly to be fur<lb></lb>nished by Scoular—in the partnership with Loft, I think, the capital was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or a larger sum, and that was to be provided in equal moieties by Loft and Scoular—in the deed with Edwards, it is wholly to be provided by Scoular—the bond is for the consideration—a larger sum was monthly or weekly, I believe it is, to be paid out to Edwards than was to be paid out of a larger capital to Loft, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, instead of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray, at that time, let me ask, if you were so intimate with Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270068"></xptr>
               <p>Scoular, was he in much better health when he entered into the partnership with Loft? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have never said that I was intimate with Mr. Scoular—I did not consider him in bad health at that time—he was certainly capable of taking an active part in the business at that time, and he did take an active part—I did not accuse Mr. Edwards of having poisoned Mr. Scoular—Mr. Papworth proposed that the Coroner should be called in—Mr. Simpson concurred in it, and I certainly thought it was a proper case for inquiry—I was present before the Coroner, and I did volunteer evidence—I did not instruct Mr. Simpson to commence opening the body—I did not know that he was so doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you express an opinion that Mr. Edwards had used some unfair means to hasten his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have written letters which will state the opinion which I expressed—I have stated, and I repeat now, that the mere fact of the absence of poison, and the absence of any appearance of violence, did not satisfy my mind that the death, for which there was palpable and apparent cause, occurring at what time it might, would have occurred at that precise moment, had it not been known that, if delayed, a will would have been executed, had it not been known that a will was about to be executed—I have said this, that the circumstance of the death occurring at the particular moment that it did, although there was disease enough to account for death at any time, certainly led to suspicions that the death might have been accelerated, not by making his will, that his death occurred a short time before it was known he would make his will—I do not know by what means it was accelerated—my notion was, that he held his life by so extremely attenuated a tenure, that the most trifling circumstance might have tended to destroy life—I have certainly not expressed an opinion that Edwards had used unfair means to accelerate the death of Mr. Scoular—I have said that the death might have resulted from any cause whatever—I said there was sufficient cause to justify suspicion that his death might have been accelerated—I went on the 21st to take his instructions for his will; on the 22nd I did take his instructions, and prepared his will in accordance with those instructions; and on the 23rd I went to take his signature—I prepared the draft on the 22nd, and in the draft there was one blank, and one blank only, which was for the amount of the legacy to be given to his cousin—I have got both the draft and the copy here (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—it was Mr. Scoular himself who mentioned the cousins, before I did—I have always said so—I asked him what sums he chose to leave his cousins—he aid he had not made up his mind, and therefore the blank was left that he might make up his mind between that and the next morning—with the exception of those two legacies, he ordered that the whole of the rest of his property should go to his brother George—I suppose it would not take me more than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to draw a will of that description—I suppose I was with him more than half an hour—if you please, I will tell you all that occurred upon that occasion—it was on Saturday, 22nd July, the day before his death—I went upstairs to his bed-room—Mr. Papworth was not there—George Scoular was there when I went up—he fetched me, and I went up with him—I said, "I am very sorry, Scoular, to see you so ill"—I commenced the conversation with him in that way—his answer was, as I understood him, "Not so ill"—after some conversation about the partnership articles, and his directing his brother to look for it, and not finding the key, Scoular said, "We will talk of that lay and <hi rend="italic">bye;</hi> there is to be a will"—I said, "Yes; I have come to take your instructions for your will"—George Scoular was in the room</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270069"></xptr>
               <p>when that was said—I then asked George Scoular for pen, ink, and paper, and he gave me a sheet of note paper, and a magnum bonum pen with a handle which would not fit into it, and an ink bottle which I could hardly put it in—George Scoular produced the paper and the pen out of a book in his pocket, and he went into another room and brought the ink bottle—the deceased then suggested that his brother should go out of the room, and I requested him to go out—I then said to him, "What do you propose to do with your property?" or something to that effect—I believe those were the words—it was either, "What are your testamentary intentions?" or, "What do you propose to do with your property?"—he said, "I don't exactly know," or some words like that—they were words stating that he was not prepared—what the precise words were I will not take upon myself to say—you have my affidavit before you, and if I state anything inconsistent with it you can contradict me—at the present moment I am not prepared to state the precise words; whether it was, "I have not thought about it," or, "I am not exactly prepared," I know not; it was one or the other—I will not take upon myself to swear what was the precise form of words he used—I believe I said, "You had better make up your mind," and I believe the expression he used was, "I have not quite made up my mind, or thought about it"—I said, "You had better do so at once"—I said, "What relations have you?" by way of leading his mind to what he intended to do with his property, and his answer was, "There is but that youth," referring to his brother.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What aged man is he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Scoular was about sixty and his brother fifty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you then say, "Am I to understand that you wish to give everything to your brother?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—he said, "Yes"—I then said, "If such are your intentions, I can prepare your will in a very few words; it will run thus: 'I give all I die possessed of to my brother George, and I appoint my said brother the sole executor of this my will'"—I said, "Is that what you mean?" or, "Is that your wish?" and he said, "Yes"—I commenced writing the said will—I wrote the words, "This is the last will and testament of me, William Scoular of—"—there is the paper—I did not read it out to him—he then made an intimation, a sound, that he wanted to speak to me, and I left off, and went to his bed to speak to him—I believe the bedroom was not much larger than this small space here (<hi rend="italic">in front of the witness box</hi>)—I went from the table to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You could not hear him a yard and a half off could you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was difficult for him, I think, to speak loud enough for me to have heard him at two yards or a yard and a half off—he was extremely feeble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say, "There are two cousins"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did—I said, "The Thompsons?"—he said, "Yes"—I asked him whether he intended to give them anything—he said, "Yes"—I first, I believe, asked their names, and where they resided—he told me Janet and Mary Ann Thompson, and they resided at Edinburgh, somewhere, in lodgings—I believe I also asked him whether there were any other persons to whom he desired to give legacies—he said, "No"—I then asked him how much he proposed to give them—I believe he said, "I have not made up my mind," or something to that effect—it may have been, "I have not thought about it"—I will not say the precise words in which he stated it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is rather an important difference; if you can, tell us? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I rather incline to think the words were, "I have not made up my</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you venture to swear that he did not say, "I have not thought about it?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not swear that he did not use those words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say, "Why, you should do so," and ask him whether it would be 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., each? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did use words to that effect—I believe I stated this: "This is a case in which there appears to be a likeli<lb></lb>hood of litigation; you must bear in mind that, in the event of litigation, if the costs are not paid by the other party, they will come upon the residue, and therefore you should regulate whatever you give to your cousins with reference to the amount of your property, and with reference to the amount you intend to give your brother; bearing in mind that he, out of the residue, will have to pay the legal expenses"—I expected litigation with Mr. Edwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that you said all that to this poor dying man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said all that at that time—I saw that Mr. Edwards was in the possession of his property, and I saw that he had been removing pro<lb></lb>perty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said how much to each, did you name the sums? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said this, "Will you give them 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,? you must give, of course, with reference to the amount of your property, and with reference to what you give to your brother."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. Q. Did he not tell you that he would prefer that the will should be delayed another day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he did not—finding that he hesitated in fixing the amount to be given to his cousins, I said this, "I fear I have already fatigued you, I will prepare the will in this way: 'I give to my cousins so much each, the residue to my brother, and appoint my brother my executor;' is that your wish? if so, I will prepare the will, and bring it to you to-morrow to fill up, and by that time you can make up your mind as to the amount of legacy you will give your cousins"—I should say I did not ask him if he would prefer it being delayed until the follow<lb></lb>ing day, that he might consider about the amount—I believe I have the draft of my affidavit here—I have here the office copy of it—(<hi rend="italic">the witness was desired to refresh his memory from it</hi>)—when I inquired what he pro<lb></lb>posed to give his cousins, he said he did not quite know—I should say he did not use the words, "I have not thought about it"—according to the best of my belief, I swear he did not—you may caution me as much as you please, I do not need cautioning; I am quite aware that I am upon my oath—I swear, according to the best of my recollection and belief, that he did not use those words—I have not been using the original affidavit for the purpose of refreshing my memory—I do not know that I have read over that affidavit; I believe, before the last indictment, I looked at it, without reading it, merely casting my eye through it.</p>

               <p>his cousins—I asked him if he had property in the Bank, or about the house, except the stock in trade—he did not say there was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid into the partnership—he said there was money in the Bank, as in Loft's matter—I do not believe that he at all mentioned the sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—according to my belief I will swear he did not, to the best of my recollection; I will not swear that he did not, but I state distinctly that, according to the beat of my recollection, no such sure was mentioned by him—I asked him if he thought the property he had in the house was all right—he did not answer, "I do not know, I will see;" he answered, "I don't know"—I said, "Then I think it is better that you should see"—I was standing almost close to him at that time—he spoke lowly; whether he could speak louder or not I do not know—he spoke above his breath, he spoke in a low voice—he appeared extremely feeble.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long were you with him altogether, half an hour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think about half an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it not occur to you that it was rather a perilous matter, this man being almost <hi rend="italic">in articles mortis</hi>, to occupy his tune for nearly half an hour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought that I had quite tired him enough, and I so told him—I cer<lb></lb>tainly considered that he was likely to die soon—whether he would live for a week, a fortnight, or a month longer, I could not judge, but it appeared to me that he was <hi rend="italic">in extremis</hi>—at that time I certainly did not suspect that he had been poisoned; I thought he was so extremely ill that his death might occur at any time—Mr. Simpson suggested the inquest; I certainly concurred in the propriety of the suggestion, as I thought that the death, occurring at the precise moment it did, was an extraordinary coincidence—I certainly have not the slightest supposition that my conversation with him could have hastened his death for a moment—I do not think so now—nothing occurred which was calculated to excite him; he was not excited, and I do not con<lb></lb>sider that his death could have been hastened by it—I thought I had talked quite long enough to fatigue him, and I therefore proposed to bring his will next day—I was extremely surprised to hear that he was dead—the fact of his death at any time would not have surprised me, but his death at that moment surprised me materially, notwithstanding the conversation I had had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not understand you; you say his death at any moment would not have surprised you, but at that moment it did? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The death occurring at that particular moment, when the will was ready to be pre<lb></lb>pared appeared to me an extraordinary coincidence—it did not surprise me, because there was quite enough apparent cause to account for death at any time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any doctor with you to see how much this dying man could bear? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not on the Saturday I had not, and on the Sunday I did not take him with a view to see how much he could bear, but took him to witness the will; although I did not consider a medical man was necessary to witness a will, leaving everything to his own relations, but expressly to see that he was put in a state of bodily comfort, and expressly to see to his bodily comfort—I certainly did not consider it necessary to take a medical man on the Saturday, nor did I consider, from the state in which I saw him, that there was anything in what passed calculated to excite him—I think I had seen him previous to visiting him upon the sub<lb></lb>ject of the will, some time about the middle of the preceding year; perhaps about twelve months before—I cannot tell how recently before that I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270072"></xptr>
               <p>seen him—I occasionally met him at Mr. Papworth's, and he occasionally came to my office; he had not much business to transact, and I never was in the habit of going to his house—in the ten years preceding his death, perhaps I had seen him twenty or fifty times; I cannot give you very accu<lb></lb>rately the times—he was not a man whose habits induced me to visit him, although I considered him in the character of a friend—I mean his personal habits; he was a man of slow habits and mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Being a man of slow mind, I think you must rather have adminis<lb></lb>tered a dose to him for that half hour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not consider that I ad<lb></lb>ministered any dose whatever; I thought I had done quite enough to tire him—possibly fatigue at that time is very near death—it is possible I was very imprudent in talking too much; I abstained as much as I could, except upon the immediate purpose for which I came—I recommended him to see that his stock was right, not his stock; I said, "Have you any other pro<lb></lb>perty?"—I found that Mr. Edwards, from his own words to me, had been looking among his private papers, and I found that he had sent property away from the house, and therefore I thought it quite proper that he should see—Edwards told me that he had learned the address of George Scoular from looking among his private papers—I did not recommend the deceased to go and look himself; I said, "You had better see that it is all right;" I meant by employing his brother, or anybody he pleased; he certainly was not in a condition to walk, or do anything.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, he not being a valuable client, and you not knowing much about him, why should you assume any right whatever to make his will? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Be<lb></lb>cause I was sent for to make his will, because I had received instructions, and it had been postponed—I did not force myself to this dying man's bed-side upon the suggestion of the brother, to whom all this money was to go—I had been consulted about the making of the will, by Mr. Papworth, as coming direct from him—on the 12th, I was appointed to come on Thurs<lb></lb>day, on the 13th my attendance was postponed, on the 19th I received a communication from Mr. Campbell and Mr. Papworth, that he had expressed a wish to see me to make his will; on the 20th I was informed that he had expressed a desire to see me to make his will; on the 21st I went for that purpose; on the 21st I heard from Mr. Simpson, which was stated in the presence of Edwards, that he was fearful of giving offence, and therefore he had postponed me; on the 22nd his brother came to town, and I accom<lb></lb>panied his brother to him; I sent up his brother to him to tell him that I was there, and to ask if he wished to see me, and he sent word down that he wished to see me—I went up, therefore, to him—I did not introduce the subject by saying that I came to make his will; I asked him first about his health, and spoke of the partnership articles, and he then said, "There is to be a will"—I did not say that the partnership was a riddle to me, I did not say anything about a riddle—that was the way in which I came to be at his bedside; Mr. Scoular and I had no conversation about his property—Mr. George Scoular came to my office, and told me what had taken place at the interview between himself and his brother that morning; and in my way up to Scoular's I asked him what relations he had, and he told me he was his only brother, and that he had two cousins of the name of Thomp<lb></lb>son—when I went to the deceased's bedside, I and George Scoular had not had one word of conversation about the disposition of the property—George Scoular is now my client in this matter, he is the person paying the costs of all these proceedings, he is my client, and he is indebted to me for every<lb></lb>thing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270073"></xptr>
               <p>—I certainly intend to render him liable for the costs of all these pro<lb></lb>ceedings—I look to him for payment, in the Chancery suit, the police court, Doctors' Commons, and the Old Bailey—Scoular will have to pay them all; there is no other person that I can look to, and he is liable to me—I have told him repeatedly that it would be extremely expensive—I told him so before I had spent a single shilling—he is a gentleman living somewhere in Edinburgh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose you have ascertained whether he has got any money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the first instance my conviction is, that it is impossible the will can be main<lb></lb>tained—I mean the will giving the property to Edwards—then the property will slip into Scoular's hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And then it will slip out of his hands into—? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is no question he will be liable to me for a certain amount of costs—there is no action going on, a suit was issued which ran out; immediately after the Coroner's inquest, I got one or two letters from Mr. Plowright, in the name of Edwards, threatening to bring actions against Mr. Papworth, against Mr. Simpson, and against myself, for defamation—I am not in the habit of defaming anybody intentionally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you just insinuate that there was a little bit of murder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nor a little smothering—I stated then, and I state now, that I thought there was quite sufficient cause to justify inquiry into his death, and there might be reason to suppose that his death had been accelerated—I did not state by whom—if you ask me by whom I now state, I say there were various persons about—the nurse told me that nobody had seen Scoular after I had seen him, except George Scoular, whereas I have since discovered that many did—I do not say who I think murdered him; I do not say that I think anybody murdered him—I say there was reason to suppose that his death might have been accelerated; by whom I have neither said, nor do I see that I am called upon to say—I think some time in the month of July a writ was served upon me—nothing further has been done in that writ—they are quite welcome to bring the action, and I am quite ready to defend it—a writ was also issued against Mr. Papworth—he brought the writ to me—he understood quite enough what it was for, and Mr. Simpson likewise—he did not require any explanation; he had received a letter, which I have here—I should say there could be no mistake what it was for—what it was for was, I presume, to intimidate us, for I do not believe there was a serious intention to bring an action—I suppose Mr. Papworth could not make any mistake about the nature of the charge—he certainly understood what the nature of the charge was—I do not know that before I sent any message, Edwards had sent a telegraphic mes<lb></lb>sage to George Scoular; I know that on the same day that Mr. Pap<lb></lb>worth was advised by roe to write to his brother I got the telegraphic message, which I will produce, which Mr. Edwards sent to him—it is dated the 20th—it is a telegraphic message sent to George Scoular, desiring him to come up to town—here is the document; it is a written document, it had better speak for itself; it is a letter, advising him to come up to town immediately—I suppose that was not before any of us had sent to him—Mr. Papworth had written on that same day, the 20th—he wrote by pos t—I had advised him to write a telegraphic message; but he could not find the address, so he wrote by post.</p>
               <p>

               <p>in the deceased's bedroom on my first visit—there was some loud talking, and he retired into another room at my suggestion—on my second visit the deceased told me something about Dr. D'Allex making him write a letter; and afterwards, on the occasion of the analysis of the stomach and liver, I told Dr. D'Allex that the deceased had informed me, on my last visit on Friday, that he had compelled him to send a letter to put off seeing Mr. Papworth, as he had expressed a wish to do—he nodded an assent; he did not deny the fact: he merely bowed his head—he did not say "compelled," but "made him sign a letter"—that he threatened that he would not attend him, or have anything more to do with him, if he allowed Mr. Papworth to visit him—that is the only conversation I have had with Dr. D'Allex.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You seem to have taken a more active part in this matter than a medical man who attends to his duty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not a bit—I was called in, as a medical man, by Mr. Papworth—I was in<lb></lb>formed at Marlborough-street, before Mr. Hardwicke, that Mr. Scoular had expressed a wish that some medical man should visit him—Mr. Papworth is a patient of mine—I have not attended him for seven or eight years, but I did formerly—I never had a dinner at his house—I have had no more acquaintance with him than any other gentleman whom I know, no more than I know of you—Dr. D'Allex and I had a consultation about Mr. Scoular—I merely saw the state he was in, and Dr. D'Allex told me that he had laboured under disease some considerable time—I saw no objection to Dr. D'Allex's treatment—I saw nothing to lead me to suppose that he had treated him improperly—I do not think we touched upon the treatment at all—I had conversation with Dr. D'Allex—I was satisfied with his mode of treatment, I saw no objection to it—he said, "This gentleman has been labouring under disease for several years," and he said, "He will die"—I said, "I can see that"—I did not differ from that opinion, and I never said I did—nothing on earth could have prevented his death; he was too far advanced in disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Sometimes there is such a thing as alleviating disease and pain; did you and Dr. D'Allex set to work to see how you could alleviate his pain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was perfectly without pain, and told me that he should get well; he expressed himself as perfectly happy—said I was sorry to see him so ill—he said he was not ill, and he hoped to get better—I did not <hi rend="italic">hit out</hi> any new remedies, or old ones either—I left him perfectly satisfied with Dr. D'Allex's treatment—I have said so all along—I should not object to Dr. D'Allex being paid for it—I consider that a medical man ought always to be paid; in fact he cannot be paid too well—the state of Mr. Scoular's legs was a secondary consideration; it was the disease—he had his legs bandaged—they would require continual treatment; the nurse would do that—they had swelling of the cellular tissue, which would require continual attention—it was the fact of organic disease pressing on the larger vessels, and inflammation set in—I do not think 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. too much for twelve months' attendance on a man in that condition, certainly not—I went, before the Coroner to prove the truth—Mr. Scoular died a natural death—he was not poisoned, or smothered, or shaken to death—I said that no human power could save him, but that is not analysing the contents of the stomach—a man might labour under disease, and yet be poisoned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who suggested poison to you; you did not imagine it your<lb></lb>self? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was on mentioning the fact to the Coroner of the circumstance of this gentleman's friends being prevented having access to him, and his dying at such a moment—nobody particularly suggested poison—Mr. Papworth and Mr. Van Sandau said that they thought there ought to be an inquest, in which I quite agreed myself, and the beadle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I want to know what induced you to suspect poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The only fact of his dying at the very moment when he was to have executed a will, and the Coroner said that it was a very proper case—I cannot say that the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270077"></xptr>
               <p>poison was a suggestion of my own mind—it is always customary, when you have made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, for the Coroner to ask you, though there is sufficient disease, if you have examined the contents of the stomach—I examined to ascertain the presence of poison—it was merely to see that everything was right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you subject it to any chemical tests? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that first originated with Mr. Edwards's party—when I had opened the body, a gentleman took a portion of the liver—there were several medical gentlemen present, Mr. Tatham and Mr. Bloxham; in fact he made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was said that he might not have died a natural death—I do not know whether Mr. Papworth or Mr. Van Sandau Raid that, or both—dying at the very moment that he did, the Coroner thought an inquest proper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You profess to give a conversation that you had with Dr. D'Allex; did not you tell the Coroner that the deceased said, "Dr. D'Allex has been very kind to me, therefore I was obliged to sign a note requesting Mr. Papworth not to come?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect saying the words to the Coroner—I recollect very well the deceased saying those words—he said, "I was obliged to sign this note immediately after Mr. Papworth left, because Dr. D'Allex has been very kind to me, and all I wish for is peace and quietness"—I have not yet been examined about that—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the occasion of your seeing him on 20th July, did you or did you not anticipate his immediate dissolution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but I did on the Friday—I was not in the least aware of the extensive character of his disease, but on the Friday I came down and told Mr. Edwards that I thought he could not live forty-eight hours, and that he had expressed a wish to make his will—he had had a very bad night on Thursday night—Thursday was the day on which all this altercation took place between the contending parties—I felt at the time that that was sufficient to make him worse, and that prompted me to ask Dr. D'Allex to go out of the room, and when we came in, Dr. D'Allex resumed the quarrel again—I do not think that talking about his will could in the least have affected him on Thursday, and did not anticipate it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you think that a medical man might conscientiously have recommended that it should be postponed for a week? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think he would say that being so well it was the proper time—I did not anti<lb></lb>cipate his death—he was in that state that I considered it my duty to suggest it, though he probably might live a month or six weeks, his mind being calm and collected, though he was so ill—I do not think that a medical man could conscientiously entertain an opinion that it was dan<lb></lb>gerous to trouble him about his will at such a time—I should not have had the least objection to his seeing his solicitor—if his mind had been at all impaired he would not be in a state to make his will—a medical man might conscientiously entertain that opinion, but that is not my opinion, certainly not—my opinion was that anything like an altercation would injure him, anything which excited him, in short; and he said to me the following</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270078"></xptr>
               <p>morning, "You saw what a disturbance took place yesterday"—I did not know what he alluded to, and he said, "Dr. D'Allex and Mr. Papworth"—it is usual for doctors to say, "If you do not obey my instructions I shall decline to attend you"—I myself should decline to attend any patient who did not attend to my instructions.</p>

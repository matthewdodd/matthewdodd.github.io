On Saturday, 9th Sept., I saw the prisoner, about eleven o'clock, roll<lb></lb>ing a cask of double stout across the yard to his dray—he and Edwards loaded it—(the delivery-note is for a cask of single stout and five barrels of porter—the men cannot possibly know whether the person who is taking tie beer to the wagons has a delivery-note)—there was at that time one kil<lb></lb>derkin of single stout and five barrels of porter in the load, and an emptv kilderkin—I told Mr. Jenkins what I had seen.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

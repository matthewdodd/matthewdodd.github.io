            . I was at work at Mr. Gunter's on Monday, the 25th of April, towards evening; the prisoner Driscoll told me to take hold of this basket and go on, and he would follow me - it had pewter in it: I went with it to Peter-street, and into an iron shop: Driscoll overtook me in Conduit-street, and then he led the way; when we got to the house we saw a woman, but I do not know whether it was Dunderdale or not, but she put it into the scale and said it came to 2 s. 9 d.; I took the 2 s. 9 d. and came out, and gave Driscoll the basket, and he asked me to give him a shilling, which I did and was taken into custody the same evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you tell what you have stated now, immediately you were taken? A. No, not till after my first examination before the Magistrate - I then charged Driscoll. I had been in custody all night before I told.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you give your account before the Magistrate that night when you were taken? A. No, not till the next day. I think Dunderdale is the woman - I am sure she is the same woman.</p>

            . I am groom to Mr. Gunter. On the 25th of April I was in South Bruton-mews, where Mr. Gunter's stables are, and saw Denton with a basket, about six o'clock in the evening; it had some pots and a mould in it: I followed him up Conduit-street, and from there to No. 24, Peter-street, Broad-street, Carnaby-market; I stopped there about ten minutes but did not see any thing of Driscoll; there were several persons about - I did not wait till Denton came out: I went home and told my master, and as I was going out again I met Denton, but did not see Driscoll at all.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I went with Mr. Gunter's groom and Plank to No. 24, Peter-street, about seven o'clock in the evening - I saw the female prisoner there; Plank told her he had got a search warrant, and asked if she had not bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190056"></xptr>some pewter and some lead; she was rather agitated, and then said she had, and it was under the counter - that she gave 4 d. a pound for the pewter, and 1 1/2 d. a pound for the lead. I took Driscoll into custody on the Wednesday following, in Church-street, St. Giles's; he denied all knowledge of it then, but on the following Saturday, at the Office, he said he had been in company with Denton twice that day, and went with him to the shop on the first occasion, with some lead - that he had carried it part of the way, and Denton the rest, and sold it; that upon the second occasion he went to the shop but received no money for it: this was said when Denton was coming into the room - he mentioned that Dunderdale was the person who purchased it. I do not think I stated the whole of this to the Magistrates - I certainly stated some parts of it before Sir George Farrant, who generally takes it down himself.</p>

               <p>DRISCOLL'S Defence. Denton swore "D - n your eyes, will you have some of this pewter?" on the Monday, while we were; there and he came and called me out of a pub-house - he took an empty basket down, and put some lead into it, and put some rubbish on the top of it; I thought it was all rubbish, and was going to empty it out; he followed me, and said, "Go on, go on," and then I put down the basket; he took it, and did what he pleased with it. I then came back, and said to one of my companions that I thought all was not right, and I would have nothing more to do with it. Denton then came back, and went to the ice hole, and came up again with a basket of pewter; Mr. Gunter's man saw him with it.</p>

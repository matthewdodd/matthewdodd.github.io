                  </hi>. I am a rent collector, of 139, Cheapside—on the night of 4th of March, about 10.30, I came from the London Bridge Station—I was wearing a gold watch and chain, and carried a black leather bag containing papers and books—I was on the Fishmonger's Hall side, going towards the city—when I got near the steps leading down to Thames Street I was hustled by three men—my watch was snatched and my bag taken from my hand—I was struck down the steps and thrown down—the prisoner was one of the men—he struck me under the jaw, snatched my bag, and ran away with it—my chain was broken, and the man who took it went down the steps—two of them ran up King William Street—I immediately recovered myself, got up, and ran down the steps into Thames Street, and called "Police!" and "Stop thief!"—I lost sight of the prisoner, and he got away—I turned up towards Crooked Lane, went up the steps again, and there found the prisoner in custody—I am sure he is the man, because he is the only one who stood in front of me—I saw his face—I saw my bag at the station—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> (807 <hi rend="italic">City</hi>). I was coming over London Bridge in plain clothes about 10.30, and when I reached the steps on the other side of the bridge I saw three men on the opposite side, surrounding the prosecutor—they hustled him down the steps—I crossed over, but before I reached the opposite side the prisoner and one of the men ran up the steps in the direction of Gracechurch Street—the prisoner was carrying this black bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw the prosecutor lying on his back on the steps, making a moaning noise—I pursued the prisoner through several streets—he threw the bag away in Arthur Street—he then turned down Fish Street Hill, and then into Thames Street, so that he took a regular circuit to the same point from which he started, only he came to the top of the steps instead of the bottom—I caught him there—the prosecutor came up directly and complained that he had lost his watch and chain and bag—I took the prisoner to the station—Tibbetts said, "I will swear to him as the person who knocked me down"—while the charge was being booked the prisoner said, "I took the bag, but know nothing of the watch and chain."</p>

I am a sculptor, of Artichoke Hill—on 4th March I was near Arthur Street, and found this black bag in the middle of the road close to King William Street—two gentlemen in a gig stopped—I spoke to them—they took the bag and gave it to a policeman—I went with him to the station—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

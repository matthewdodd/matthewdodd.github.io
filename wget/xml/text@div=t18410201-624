                  </hi>. I am a tailor, living in Charles-street, Hatton-garden—I am married. About one o'clock, on the 11th of January, I went into a public-house, and took a glass of ale—I saw Wilson there—no conversation took place between us, but when I came out the wished me to go home with her—I declined it, and said I was married, and had a family—Lewis then came up—they took hold of each arm, and forced me into a brothel, in a court about seven yards from the public-house—Idid not halloo out, because I considered I was in fear, being in a bad house—when I got in, both the prisoners began rifling me—I succeeded in getting my money from them again—my watch was taken out of my pocket two or three times by Wilson, and I forced it out of her hand—I wished to come away, but they said I should not, till I gave something to drink—I said I had no objection, provided they would let me go quietly—I put down 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., they said that was not enough—I then put down 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I could hardly spare it, having a family to support—Lewis then went for some drink, and when she returned they both began rifling my pockets again—Wilson then went out, and I missed my watch directly—it was safe when Lewis went out for the drink—I said to Lewis my watch was gone, and she said she would go with me to find the party—we went out—I directly met a policeman and told him—I missed my handkerchief also, and found it at the station.</p>

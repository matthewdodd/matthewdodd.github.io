                  </hi>. I am shopman to John Dennis and Son, of Tooley-street. On the 18th of May, between four and five o'clock, the prisoners came into the shop, and the shopwoman showed them several boxes of linen—as I went round the counter she said to me, "p s q," which is a term we use when we see anybody in the shop doing wrong—they left the shop—we afterwards missed a piece of ribbon, which the policeman brought to the shop about eight o'clock that evening—I know the ribbon produced to be ours—I had it in my hands between twelve and one o'clock that day, and cut the edges to trim it, and noticed it was faded a short length in—how it got from the shop I do not know.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you cut the edge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About nine o'clock that morning—I swear to it by the style of ribbon, and it being faded—I went before the Grand Jury in Surrey about this, and was in Court when the charge was read over to the prisoner—the charge was not gone into there—I believe that was the fault of the clerk.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you preferred an indictment there, how came you here on the same charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We knew the parties were frequently at our shop—the policeman did not tell me to Come here—my employers said they knew their characters to be bad, and they deserved punishment—I knew they had been imprisoned six months for another offence, from the Surrey Sessions—I think we came before the Grand Jury here the next Sessions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having a bill found in Surrey, and not tried, why prefer another bill here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was my employers' wish, as we often missed things</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 51.) On the 15th of May I was on duty in Tooley-street about half-past six o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoners about fifty yards from the prosecutor's house—I followed and saw them go into a tailor's shop there—they came out—I went in and came out—they saw me following them, and Bryant offered a bundle which she had to Roach, who refused it—I took them in charge—I asked Bryant who the bundle belonged to, and what it contained—she said it did not belong to her—I asked Roach if it was hers—she said not—I found it contained a gown-piece and this roll of ribbon—the witness did not describe any mark on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you before the Grand Jury at Horsemonger-lane? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was in Court there when the charge was read over to the prisoners—the clerk forgot this indictment till after they were convicted and sentenced on a first indictment—we came here the next Session and preferred a bill—I cannot tell why we did not go to the Surrey Ses<lb></lb>sion—I have not told them to send the depositions here—I did not consult the Magistrate about it—he said this was a harsh proceeding—a note was sent to the superintendent for me to attend here—I was ordered to attend.</p>

On the 28th of September, about eight o'clock in the morning, an alarm was given me, that a woman had stolen some pots, which she had concealed; she had gone across the fields with them; I pursued and overtook the prisoner; I asked her for the pots: she pulled a quart pewter pot out from under her apron; I took her back to my house and sat her in the tap room, and there she pulled out a pint pot from under her clothes; I asked her if she had any more; she said, yes, she had another; that was not mine. These are the two pots they are mine; I do not know where she had taken them from; she had nothing to do at my house.</p>

            . On the morning of the 28th of September, about nine o'clock, I met the prosecutor with a quart pot in one hand and the prisoner in the other; I followed him into the house, the prisoner sat down in one corner of the tap room; I saw this pint pot come from under her petticoats, she laid it down between her feet in the tap room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming across the fields I found one of the pots, and just as I was coming against the paling I found the other; I was coming along, the gentleman asked me where I was going with the pots; I told him I did not know.</p>

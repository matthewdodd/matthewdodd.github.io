            . On Monday evening, I believe the 15th of September, I met the prisoner in the Hay-market - I went with her to No. 50, <placeName id="t18341016-21-crimeloc111">Whitcomb-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18341016-21-crimeloc111" type="placeName" value="Whitcomb-street"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you say you could not identify the note? A. Perhaps I did - I think it is probable - I knew the name on it, but I thought it was necessary I should know the number, which I did not - I had paid for a room in that house - I had given the prisoner some money - I had not promised that I would stay and breakfast with her - I had not given her the note as an earnest that next day she should have more money - I never said I did not believe she intended to rob me - I paid her what she asked, but I cannot say what - it was all the silver I had about me - it is likely that I said if she conducted herself well, I would give her more next morning - I might say so.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by conducting herself properly? A. If she did not conduct herself riotously - I do not think I promised her more the next day - I will not swear I did not - I do not know what I paid her - I suppose 7s. or 10s. - I do not know what she asked - my memory was a little hurt - I had taken two glasses of ale - I might have said I would treat her, but to the best of my belief I never said I would give her more the next day - I suppose I left the house about five o'clock - I had not got above twenty yards from the door, when I saw the officer, and gave her in charge - I swear I gave her more than 5s. - I was not exactly sober - to the best of my knowledge I was in a public-house with her - I had never seen her before - I cannot swear whether I was in two or three public-houses with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then was not your memory very bad? A. It was not at all equal to what it is sometimes - I sent for some ale when I got to the house with her - I drank a very small portion of it - it was a pot, to the best of my recollection - I dare say I paid a shilling, but I will not swear it - I believe it was a woman I sent for it - to the best of my belief it was the landlady - I will not swear it was not a boy- I do not recollect seeing the person - to the best of my belief I placed it on the table - I will not swear positively- my memory was in such a state that I would not rely on it for all things.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you tell how much silver you had when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160027"></xptr>you went? A. Ten or 12s. to the best of my recollection - I had none in the morning - I gave her all I had after paying for the room, and said if she conducted herself well I would give her something in the morning - I am certain I did not give her the £10 note.</p>

            . I am an inspector of police. The prisoner was brought to the station-house - I asked her if she would allow us to search her, and told her she was charged with stealing a £10 note out of the man's fob - she said, "I did not take the note, I did not see a note - I did not know he had a note - I deny all knowledge of it" - she then took off her gown, threw it down, and called God to witness, and took an oath that the note was not on her - I took up the gown and examined the hem, where I found a bit of paper, which proved to be this note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you remember the magistrate asking Mr. Fitzgibbon why he charged the woman? A. Yes; and he said once or twice, "I do not wish to punish the girl, only to get back the note" - I am not aware that he said he thought she did not intend to rob him - I believe Mr. Conant asked what was the reason he gave her in charge - he appeared sober when he gave her into custody - there were three or four shillings found on her - it was given up to her - it was not in my hands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met him about half-past nine o'clock that evening - he told me he would give me 10s. to sleep with me - we walked some distance, and he asked me to have something to drink - we went to the house, and had a bed for half-a-crown - he then said he would give me 5s. that night; but if I thought he was without money he had got a £10 note, and he gave it me to keep till the morning - in the morning he asked me to give him the note - I said I would not till he had given me a sovereign - when I was taken I had 1s., and the 5s. he gave me, and 5d. change from the pot of ale.</p>

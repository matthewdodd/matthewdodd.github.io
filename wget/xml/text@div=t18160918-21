The prisoner had been five years in the same ship with him; my son was sick in bed. The prisoner was several hours with my son, and took tea and supper. My son appeared to be friendly towards him. I was out when first the prisoner came. Ill as my son was, he sat up; the prisoner stopped until I came in between eight and nine o'clock in the evening the prisoner went away. He came the next day between eleven and twelve to enquire how my son was; my son was then up stairs in bed; he went up to him and spoke to him. When the prisoner came down again he told me he had told my son, he would send a pigeon pie for his dinner; I asked him if he lived near at hand, or should I send for it, and he said a little brother of his should bring it. The watch was hanging in the kitchen below where I was; it was a silver hunting watch, jewelled, and gilt inside; the name was

I left the prisoner in the kitchen; I was washing, and in a hurry, and he talked with me some time, and then he went for his hat and let himself out; it was a little after twelve that he left that house; I missed the watch two or three hours after.

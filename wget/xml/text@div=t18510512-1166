                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am a sailor. On Wed<lb></lb>nesday morning, 14th May, past one o'clock, I left the Three Crowns—shortly afterwards I was standing in a court, talking to a girl—I had changed a sovereign in the public-house—I wrapped a half-sovereign up in paper and tied it, with a half-crown, a sixpence, some shillings, and coppers, in the corner of my handkerchief, which I put into the waistband of my trowsers, which fitted very tight—the prisoners came up and spoke to the woman, rendering her away from there—Wall struck me on the face—the woman went on one side, and they did not strike her—Renney struck me on the back of the head—I staggered, and one of them laid bold of the handkerchief—as I fell, one of them kicked me—they both <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> at the handkerchief—the sovereigns were out of the waistband, and could be seen—I held one end of it—one of them gave me a desperate blow on the head, of which I have the mark now, and I was obliged to let go—a policeman came up, but the last blow stunned me, and I saw no more—my shin and elbow were cut.</p>

I saw Hackett and a female standing at the corner of an alley—the prisoners went up, and Wall struck him a blow on the head and face, which caused him to reel back—Renney then struck him, and I heard money rattle on the pavement—I ran towards them, and I saw Renney trip him up with his foot, and he fell with his head against the shutter—I was sixty or eighty yards from them—they were under a gas-lamp—when I got thirty or forty yards from them they ran away, round Bear-alley—I ran, but lost sight of them—I found Hackett just rising from the pavement, holding his head—there was a mark on his lip—he picked up the handkerchief and twopence, and I found three or four pence, and this little piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in a few minutes I saw the prisoners passing round the corner of the alley—another policeman came up, and I went after them—they went into 11, Green-yard—we were obliged to knock in a panel of the door, and at last it was opened—I knew the prisoners lived there—I went into the back-yard, and heard some fences breaking, and the cry of "Thieves!" and "Police!"—I got over seven or eight walls, and let myself down into one of the other gardens, and found the prisoners—Wall said, "Here we are, we are the guilty parties"—I said, "I know you are, for I saw you both strike the man"—Wall said, "We did strike the man, but not with the intent to rob him"—Renney was nearly undressed—it was above ten or twelve minutes from the time it look place till they were in custody.</p>

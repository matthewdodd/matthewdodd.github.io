             sworn. - The morning after I was robbed, the prisoner came to my lodgings; I had never seen him before; I lodged then in Berners-street, Oxford-road; he said that the parties had applied to him to settle the business; there was a little of the money deficient, and it should come forward in the course of the day; he begged I would not take out a warrant; he came the next day again, and the day after, and the fourth day I went to Mr. Disney's office, he told me the business should be settled that day, and he would bring me Wilson; I got out a warrant for the whole three from Mr. Conant; and on Sunday the 3d of December, at four o'clock, I saw Foreman in Disney's house, and Kennedy the constable saw him also; Disney said he was not there, he said, cannot you see as well as me; the room was dark; and the next day I got information of Mr. Foreman, and Disney was with him, and then I was sure that one of the persons that I had seen the night before was Foreman; we took him then, and last Disney behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Foreman before? - A. No. I never saw him in my life till the day that I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. Do you know a man of the name of Ford? - A. I know Little Ford very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not write a paper out one Sunday morning of what you would swear against me? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you make a great many applications to compound this business? - A. I did not know what compounding was, till I went to Mr. Costant, and he told me I had done wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw Henry Foreman at my house on the Sunday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you? - A. Mr. Kennedy and another constable; they then denied him to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you did not take him into custody at that time? - A. Because there was not sufficient light to distinguish him; but the next night when I saw him, I was sure that he was the man that was in your parlour the night before, and you said you could find any of the parties at any hour.</p>

             sworn. - I went on the Sunday night, with Mr. Lord, to the prisoner's house; I saw the prisoner there, and two young men, sitting by the fire; I verily believe one of them was Foreman; I would not undertake to swear it; it was rather dark; and the next day I went to apprehend Mr. Disney; he kept an Agency-office, next door to the Bow-street office; he left his house, and I could not find him for some weeks after that; I saw Foreman afterwards, but I cannot positively say whether he was one of those two men.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.(To Chandler.) Do you not know, of your own knowledge, that Mr. Lord committed wilful and corrupt perjury upon the trial of Foreman? - A. No, I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Lord say that he should get 40l. out of his 53l. if Foreman was convicted; and he would swear hard to convict him? - A. I have heard him say, if he was convicted, he should get 40l. out of his 53l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Lord say that he would not have taken me up, if he had not known that I had had some property, and that he expected to get his money back and 40l. more, and he would not appear against me? - A. No; I have heard him say, that if you were taken up, he thought he should get his money, for that you had money.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard him say, he would swear hard against me, for if he did not convict me, he expected I should prosecute him for perjury? - A. I have heard something of that sort; but I do not exactly recollect the words.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember that Mr. Lord came to me, and wished me to apply to Mr. Read, a sadler, upon the business? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not he said that he would not have taken me up, but he expected, upon my being taken up, that I should have paid the money? - A. He said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180093"></xptr>he thought you would pay the money, rather than suffer yourself to be prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Lord write a sheet of paper of a false paper writing, and read it to you, to strengthen his evidence? - A. I remember the writing very well; he said that was what he should swear in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you not heard Lord say that Wilson was the man that robbed him? - A. Yes; we went to Mr. Bond to take out a warrant for Wilson, but there were three of them together at the time he was robbed, and Mr. Lord did not know any of them except Wilson.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Disney? - A. I had not known him before he came to Mr. Lord, about that business.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been upon any sooting of intimacy with him since that? - A. No, not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever talked the case over with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever suggest to him, at all, what you could say upon the subject? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the prisoner had no knowledge of the manner in which you would answer these multitude of questions that he has put to you? - A. It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Lord. Mr. Chandler has been arrested, and there has been a communication between him and Disney.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This prosecution is commenced against me for the purpose of extorting money from me, that I would not by any means comply with; I knew I was not guilty of the charge alledged against me, I am conscious Foreman was never at my house after the robbery, they had frequently applied to me to settle it; when they enquired of me for Foreman, I said, I would do all I could to find him out; it must strike every body, when they recollect the public situation in which I lived, next door to the Public-office, Bow-street; the father of Henry Foreman formerly kept the Brown-bear, and being known to all the officers, is it reasonable to suppose he would come into such a situation as that; in fact, he never did come into my house after that.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FOREMAN sworn. - I keep the Gold-chain in the Tower; Mr. Lord came to me to compound felony, with respect to

            , my nephew, I was examined here when he was tried; they wanted me to give them fifteen pounds, they then left me, and said, they should proceed to prosecute him; and, on the Sunday after, Mr. Lord came again, with Kennedy; he first asked me twenty-five pounds -</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Disney? - A. I knew nothing of him till that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Chandler before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mrs. - MORRIS sworn. - Mr. Lord called upon Mrs. Wilson, in Maiden-lane, the day of the robbery, and said, that he had lost his property; he called several times that day, and he has repeatedly called upon me since, at my house in Wardour-street, he got me to write into the country to his friends to get them to settle it; he told me, if Wilson would come forward with the pocket-book, he would go no farther in it, but think it was a drunken frolic. <rs id="t17980418-94-verdict499" type="verdictDescription">

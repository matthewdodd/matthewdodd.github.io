I lodged about three or four nights in her house; I met her by accident at Gravesend on Tuesday night, I do not recollect the day of the month; it was about a month ago; I came up to town with her in a Gravesend boat; on the Wednesday night I arrived in London between twelve and one in the morning; we shored at Limehouse; I went home to her house; she keeps a lodging house; I went to bed in a bed by myself. Last Saturday was a week I went to the India House and received money there; she would come with me; she saw me receive it; the last money I received was eighteen pounds; out of that I gave her a one-pound note, and when I came to her house at Poplar I had sixteen pounds. I am positive I had the notes at the time I was going up stairs She said stop for a light; I said I do not want a light. I went up stairs and went to bed. She came up stairs; I awoke; and said, who is there; she said it is me John; come down to supper; I said I do not want any supper; and when she was going away, she laid hold of my trowsers; I said let them alone. She said put them under your head; she went down stairs again. I told her I could take care of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine them before you put them under your pillow - A. She went down stairs; what time she stopped I cannot say; she came up again and brought half a pint of beer; here, said she, I have brought you something to drink: I said I did not want any, however I will drink with you. I asked her where her husband was; she said down stairs. I said go to bed to him. I got up in the morning, the clock struck five; I found my trowsers had been removed from the place where I put them when I went to sleep, curiosity led me to examine the pockets, I thought the bulk was diminished. I examined them, and found only six out of sixteen; they were all one-pound notes; I dressed myself, and went in the kitchen; I said, what, are none of you up; she said no, came and lie down with me. I said, no; I am robbed, and I will have every one of you up in the morning; a man that slept in the parlour said, d - n it if I did not think so; she dug a pit for another, and she will fall in it, and I went to get a constable, and had her taken up; she was searched, and only one-pound note was found upon her. My notes have not been found. They offered me seven pounds of the money.</p>

            . I am an officer of Poplar. On the 30th of May, about five o'clock in the morning, I was applied to by Flood; he said that he had been robbed of ten-pounds, that Mrs. Hughes had been in his room, and had taken the ten-pound. I took Mrs. Hughes into custody. She denied having taken any. It was supposed that the husband went out with the money, as he went out unusually soon that morning. I afterwards took the husband, imagining her might have had it; no property being found upon him the magistrate discharged him.</p>

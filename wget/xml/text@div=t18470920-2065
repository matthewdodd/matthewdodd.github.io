                  </hi> I am the wife of Ebenezer Webber. I occupy two rooms at No. 1, Gloucester-street, Haggerstone. On the 25th of Aug. I went out to an evening party—I left home at half-past nine o'clock—I returned at a quarter before one o'clock—I found my apartments had been broken into, and the prisoner was at the station-house—the articles now produced were gone—they had been safe when I left home—these bracelets were in a box, and all the other thing in the room—the parties had got in by the back window, which had been fastened, when I came home it was wide open—it had been opened by putting a hand through a pane, (which I had accidentally broken myself,) and opening the catch—this is all my pro<lb></lb>perty.</p>

On the 26th of Aug., ten minutes before one o'clock in the night, I was on duty in Haggerstone, behind the prose<lb></lb>cutrix's house, and found a bundle—I looked over the wall, and saw the window of the house was open—I placed myself in an unfinished house where I had a view of the bundle—I saw the prisoner come—he looked round and took it up—I rushed out and took him—he said, "Policeman, it is all right"—I said, "I must know more about it"—he said, "I took them out of the house"—he said the landlady was moving, he was to take the thing for her—I took him to the station—I found on him these bracelets, one shoe, sixpence farthing, a pair of scissors, and this little box in his pocket—I went back to the house—Mrs. Webber was just come home—she said she had been robbed—I went into the house—the whole of the bedding and wearing apparel was packed up ready to go away—there was a trunk broken open; this is the hasp of it—it appeared as if some person had gone through the window—this is the bundle the prisoner had.</p>

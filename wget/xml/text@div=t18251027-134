            . I am a broker. On Tuesday, the 27th, I left home at half-past nine o'clock, and about twenty yards from my house, I met Landers; he asked me if I would buy a table - he had none with him; I asked what it was - he said a three-feet six inches dining table; I asked where it was; he said just by, and I went with him to the Brown Bear public-house, in the parlour, where it was; it is a house where porters generally stand for work - I saw it in the parlour, and asked the price - he said 45 s.; I said that was more than I should like to give, and offered 2 l., which he agreed to take; I said I was going into the city and should return in half an hour, if he would take it to my house and wait. I would pay him. I have known him nearly sixteen years - he occasionally worked for me, and was employed by mechanics to take goods out and sell; I always found him very punctual in his transactions. I returned from the city in half an hour, and found the table standing in my shop; he stood outside.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270054"></xptr>I live at No. 5, Long-alley, Moorfield. I paid Richard (Landers) two sovereigns, and he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. You dealt with him for it as his own property. A. He said it was one he had brought out for sale from the mechanic - the maker. I did not ask who the maker was.</p>
               <p>Q. You, being in the trade, must know the make of one man is very different from another - did you not ask him whose particular make it was? A. There are so many goods sent into the market by men who make them themselves, and I knew him so long, I did not think any thing wrong. I took no receipt - he did not sell it for his own.</p>

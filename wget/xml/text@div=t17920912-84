               <p>Before you returned it, had the letter been opened by any body? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was the letter opened, before it was carried to the Dead Letter Office? - by Mr. Doe, in my presence; he had a son coming from the East Indies, and he expected it might be a mistake; he opened it in my presence; he looked at the top of the letter, which said, dear brother, he immediately said that was not for him, and returned it; it contained two bills; one of two hundred, on a ship-builder at Blackwall, whose name I believe was Perry; the other was a fifty pound, I do not recollect the name.</p>

               <p>Is there a drawer to each carrier? - Yes; every letter carrier returns his letter, and I kept them in my drawer till the time came, they remained therefore under my own care, till delivered some time the latter end of April, or beginning of May; I met the prisoner in Lombard-street; I was delivering my letters, that was my district; Mr. Dean asked me for such letter he asked me if I had not returned a letter; containing two hundred and fifty pounds, directed to

               <p>It was your common duty to have delivered it? - If it came to my hands it was my duty to deliver it; if I had it not, I could not deliver it.</p>

               <p>Do you remember the application of Flower and the other Mr. Dean to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go with them to the lodging of the prisoner? - Not into the house, but I was there at the same time.</p>
               <p>Who had the first opportunity to speaking to or saying any thing to the prisoner? - I believe Flower and Dean before me, I was out of the room, I went to look to see if I could see him any where.</p>
               <p>Did you yourself hold any conversation with him at all on this occasion? - After he came in I asked him if he recollected receiving this letter from the hair dresser in the New Turnstile, and he said he recollected it perfectly well; I asked him if Daniel, the letter-carrier, had delivered him a letter, and he acknowledged he had.</p>
               <p>Carry yourself back to the Post-office, where you saw Daniel giving him the letter? - Upon my word I cannot ascertain the time exactly, for there is so many circumstances of that kind, it is impossible for any man to charge his memory with it.</p>

               <p>It is a part of your profession to do these things? - By no means, it is the part of a notary publick.</p>
               <p>How long have you discontinued that? - What.</p>
               <p>Receiving money on securities? negociating and getting bills discounted and presented? - We may understand our own professions best perhaps.</p>
               <p>On that account it is, Sir, that I ask for information? - The bill was brought back to me unaccepted; the prisoner called for it some time after.</p>
               <p>About what time was that return of the 500 l. bill? - I do not know, I cannot recollect exactly the time, about three or four months ago; I returned the letter of advice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179209120060"></xptr>and the bill both together, that was the only thing that I doubted of the goodness of them by being both on one quarter of a sheet of paper. The next transaction was after I had returned it about a week or ten days after he came to me again; he offered me any pecuniary reward for what I had done, I told him that was not my motive, nor did I chuse to accept it; he came again and said he had got some more remittances; came and shewed me copies of the two bills now in question, for the sum of 800 l. and 50 l. not the originals; he desired my assistance to get them accepted as I understood, but I found otherwise afterwards. He met me by appointment, and desired me to go with him to Mr. Reads; Mr. Read had an objection to give him the bill, not believing him to be the person that the bill should come to, from his appearance, and from his appearance only; that he said in the presence of the prisoner, that till somebody came that knew him he did not chuse to give up the bill; I told him he need be under no apprehension, I knew him to be

            ; that I had known him many years, and had letters to shew he was the person, upon which he pulled out several letters to the gentleman, on which Mr. Read, or whoever it was, gave him the bill directly accepted; from that moment he gave it entirely to my directions; he said he was drawn upon for 10 l. and a few guineas, and that there was another hundred pounds drawn upon him and that that would not become due for some time; that he said was from the East India company; I told him he might have what money he would upon it, but he did not chuse to have any more; and I took him to Mr. Batson's the bankers, and recommended him to open an account, and recommended them to discount him the 50 l. bill and take the discount. I had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Before you went to Batson's had any indorsement been put upon it in your presence? - Yes, Sir, at Batson's coffee-house; it was indorsed by the prisoner at Baker's coffee-house; he did not know that it was necessary; I told him it was necessary to put his name upon it, and they gave him an recountable receipt likewise for the two hundred pound bill.</p>
               <p>Then your credit was not interposed between him and the banker? - No.</p>
               <p>Is that his indorsement? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your indorsement was put on in the banking house? - One of the people of the Office, whom I do not know, said, Mr. Withey, you may as well put your name upon it, which I did.</p>

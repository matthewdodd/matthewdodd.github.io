                  </hi>. I am the wife of Isaac Tortoishell, a mechanic, of 19, Henrietta-street, High-street, Deptford—on Monday morning, 20th August, between 9 and 10 o'clock I sent my little boy to take my boots to be repaired—some time afterwards a communication was made to me, and I went out and found him under one of the railway arches without any boots on—he had new boots on when he left home—they were worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went in doors, put him on another pair of boots, went out, and found the prisoner at the door of Mr. Harris, a pawnbroker—I had not known her before—she saw me and the little boy coining up, threw the boots down, and ran away—I lost sight of her—I asked a little girl who she was, and picked up the boots—they were wrapped up in a piece of spotted print which she had torn from her under petticoat—I am sure she is the little girl—I was within two yards of her.</p>

I am the wife of Edward James, a shoemaker, of 10, Mary Ann Villas—on Monday morning, 1Oth August, I was in the shop of Mr. Harris, a pawnbroker—the prisoner came in while I was there with these boots in a piece of spotted print, which she laid on the counter—she said, "My mother is ill and dying, will you ask Mr. Harris to take these in for me?" but I missed her all in a moment, parcel and all—I left the shop, and a few minutes afterwards Mrs. Tortoishell came in with the piece of rag and a pair of child's boots in her hand—I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

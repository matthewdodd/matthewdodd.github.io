               <p>Jacob Kendall I charge the Prisoners with breaking open a Door, and robbing me of a Pewter Bason and Dish, and other Things, between 3 and 4 in the Morning; they had moved 3 Sauce-pans, 2 Stew-pans, and a Tea-kettle, in order to carry them off. The Door they broke was adjacent to the Kitchen, and was lock'd fast. The Pewter Dish and Bason they had carry'd off a good Way. - I swear they were in my Wash-house between 3 and 4 in the Morning.</p>

            . I was going to my Labour about a quarter before 4 in the Morning, and I saw Mr. Kendall's Door open, and the Prisoner Howard coming out. I observ'd him to put his right Hand back and pull too the Door, so I went up and asked him what he did there? Then he pretended to be making Water, within a Yard of the Door: I pushed it open and saw the Stew-pans and Sauce-pans, and the Tea-kettle, all ready to be taken off. I saw nothing of Harrison, but Howard I took particular Notice of, and observ'd that his Hands and Face were crock'd and black'd.</p>

            . I am a Baker, and live exactly against Mr. Kendalls. The Morning he was robb'd I was up at Work, and as I was opening my Window, I saw the Prisoner Harrison at Mr. Kendall's Wall, with something like a Bundle under his Arm. He pretended (when he saw me) to be making water too, so I went to my Work, but in about half an Hour, my Wife bid me go and see what was the Matter at Mr. Kendall's; when I came there, I found they had got Howard; and Harrison coming in, to enquire what the Disturbance was, I told the People that I had seen him about half an Hour ago, with a Sack full of something under his Arm; upon which Mr. Kendall detained him with the other.</p>
               <p>Q. The Things that were remov'd, and lay ready to be carry'd off, - where did they stand over Night?</p>
               <p>Kendall. In my Wash-house. We found the Things again which they had carry'd off, in King Harry's Yard, not far from my House.</p>
               <p>Sanders. While I was telling Mr. Kendal that I had seen Harrison with a Sack under his Arm, some People came in with one which they said they had found in Maudlin's Rents, in a Dust Cart, and the Goods in it proved to be Mr. Kendall's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Howard. I know nothing of the Man's Goods being stolen: I was going to the Hermitage, and stopping at Mr. Kendall's Door to make Water, a Man rushed out of the House, and went by me.</p>
               <p>Bundey. When I saw Howard turn as if he intended to make Water, there was no Body at all passed him.</p>
               <p>Howard. As to my Hands and Face being crock'd, I had been mending a Hole in a Porridge-pot for a Woman, who is here in Court, and she gave me 6 d. for doing it.</p>

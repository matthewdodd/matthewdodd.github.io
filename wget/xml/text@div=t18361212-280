                  </hi>. I live in Tottenham-court-road, and am a jeweller. About twelve o'clock on the 12th of November, the prisoner came to my shop—I laid some rings before her—she tried some, but did not like the pattern—she thought there were some others in the window she should like—I said we had no others to suit her—she then showed some money which she had in her hand, and decided on one ring, and said she would leave a sixpence, and send a little boy for the ring—she went away, and I missed two rings—she came again on the 8th of December, and asked to look at some gold rings—I recognised her, and charged her with having stolen two rings—she said she had not been in the shop before—I said I should not let her go, and sent for a policeman—this is one of the rings—it is pre<lb></lb>cisely the same pattern—I and my brother, Jonathan Lucas, keep the shop.</p>

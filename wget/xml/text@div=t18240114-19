On the 22d of December, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was at the further end of the shop, and saw both the prisoners. Jones came into the shop, and took a print off a commode in the shop - the selling price of it is 50 s.; he went out with it, and I after him, and saw him give it to Slade at the corner of the street. I took Slade with it, gave him in charge to Davis, who was passing, then followed Jones and secured him. I had not seen Slade till Jones gave him the picture.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. COOK. Q. You saw Jones give it to Slade - A. Yes. Slade did not resist when I took him, but went back willingly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long were you with Slade before you followed Jones - A. About two minutes; he was walking away, but not out of my sight, and could have run away if he had liked; he turned out of Russell-street, into Museum-street. I am certain of them both. Jones had blue trowsers and a fustian jacket on.</p>

            . I was in Russell-street, and saw Jones come off the step of Mr. Bacon's door, with the picture before him; he was dressed in a light jacket. The shopman came out after him directly; I saw him give it to Slade, and go up the street; the shopman caught hold of Slade - I took hold of the picture, and minded Slade while he pursued Jones. Slade stood by my side, and did not offer to move. Shorter ran up Museum-street, and brought Jones back directly. I am certain he is the man who brought the picture out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. COOK. Q. How far were you from the shop when Jones came out - A. Close to the shop; he walked gently. Slade stood at the corner of Duke-street, about twenty yards from the shop. I do not think a word passed between them; they never looked at each other. Slade could not get away, as I was by him, but did not hold him; there were people about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Jones could have ran off if he liked - A. I think so; he got about two hundred yards before he was taken.</p>
               <p>SLADE'S Defence. I was passing by Russell-street; a man in a jacket and green apron asked me to hold the picture for a moment - I took it in my hand, and might have moved a few yards, when the boy came and said,</p>
               <p>"I want that picture." I gave it to him, and said a man gave it to me to hold.</p>

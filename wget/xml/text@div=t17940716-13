I had missed property to a very considerable amount, from the till; I had him apprehended by the constable, in consequence of suspicion, and I requested the constable to examine him. I was present when he was examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he apprehended in your own house? - Yes; I was talking to him when the constable came in, and I gave charge of him; indeed I was charging him with the same when the constable came in. The principal reason that I had him examined for, was, to see if he had the key of the till about him; and he said, we need not examine him, for he had thrown it over the house that morning. I have since received some of the goods from two witnesses who are here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby At the time you asked the prisoner about this key, you gave him to understand, if he told you what became of it, you would not proceed any further against him? - I don't know that I said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You had repeatedly asked him to confess before he said any thing about that key? - I never asked him to consess.</p>
               <p>Court. As a porter was he ever entrusted with the key of the till? - Never to my knowledge.</p>

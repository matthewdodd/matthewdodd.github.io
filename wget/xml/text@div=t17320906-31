But however, the Prisoner got off my Coat, and one of them put on my Shoes, and left me an old Pair of his in the room of them, and then they went away. I follow'd them over a Field in my Shirt, but kept at some Distance. By and by I heard a Woman shriek inwardly, and soon after she cry'd out Murder aloud. The two Men whom I had past were by this time but a little behind me, and they holla'd. I run along the Bank (the 2 Men still hallo'ing till I came to the Woman. She said, she had been robb'd by three Men, that they had cut her Apron to cram into her Mouth, and then took away her Bundle, and run over the Fields. I look'd and saw them running, and they were the same Men who had robb'd me. But as they ran they dropt the Bundle they had taken from her. Next Sunday I was told, that 2 such Men were in the Watch-house in Rag-Fair; I went to see them, and they proved to be the Prisoners.</p>

On the morning of 6th May, about half-past 2 o'clock, I was on duty in King-street, Tower-hill, and saw the prisoner lying drunk on the pavement—I lifted him Up on his legs, and he asked me where Mr. Thompson's coffee-house was, No. 6, King-street—I took him to the door, left him there, and went round my beat—I came back in five or six minutes, and he was still knocking at the door—I said to him, "You have not got in," and at that time the door was opened by the land<lb></lb>lord—the prisoner went in, threw his coat off, and then sprung out and</p>

I keep a coffee-house in King-street, Tower-hill—the prisoner lodged there for seven or eight days—I was awakened about half-past 2 o'clock, by a violent knocking at the door, went down stairs and stood in the passage about half a minute—I opened the door, and the prisoner came in, took his coat off, threw it about two paces, and went out and pitched into the policeman—he first struck him with his hands, and then kicked him—his hat fell off, his lantern was knocked off, and they both fell to the ground—I picked up the hat and lantern, and gave the policeman his hat—the prisoner said, "I will bite your nose off," and his mouth was about three inches from the constable's nose, but the constable struck him over the wrist with his truncheon—he kicked violently, and the constable struck him over the shins—after that he was worse than ever; a few more cuts would have done him good.</p>

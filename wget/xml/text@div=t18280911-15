               <p>WILLIAM FINCHER. On the 7th of August, between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening, I was at Brentford, and went from there to <placeName id="t18280911-15-crimeloc82">Ealing</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear you were not half an hour on the road hustling and quarrelling with them? A. It was not half an hour I am certain; I do not think it could be twenty minutes; I did not strike either of them, nor threaten to punch West's head; French did not interfere till he was pushed against the wall; they did not push me against the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Turpin say if you attempted to punch West's head you must fight him, as he was a better match for you? A. He did not; there was no watchman till we got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110017"></xptr>to Ealing; it happened about a mile and a half from Ealing; I was quite sober; I never said I had a scuffle, and lost the things; I have seen West's father several times, but never told him I was rather fresh, not tipsy: we did not leave work till six o'clock; we had been working at Ealing for Mr. Thorn, and went to take a walk; we had two pints of beer and one pint of ale at the Red Lion public-house, but had no spirits all day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. They said you were going the wrong way, was it so? A. No, it was the right way.</p>

            . I was going with Fincher from Brentford to Ealing, and met these men on the road; they said we were going the wrong way; West came up, and began pushing me about; I said I did not like it; he said, if I did not like it I must alter it; I said it was not right to push me about; Fincher said, "If that is what you mean, we will go back again;" he turned to go back to Brentford; Turpin and the third man turned back, and asked what he meant by saying that; he took hold of him and began hammering him; I heard him halloo; two gentlemen came out of a school, and then they ran away; I did not see whether they took anything; Fincher was standing at a door with a gentlemen when they ran away; I did not see him pushed down; Turpin and the third man ran up to me after the gentlemen came out, and he knocked me down directly; I did not see whether he had anything in his hand; West was with them then, and ran away with them; the gentlemen persuaded us to go another way, and in Ealing churchyard we met the prisoners: Fincher asked where his bundle was; they said they had not seen any bundle, nor had they seen us before; Fincher said "Come on, there is a watchman in the road, and we will see about it." Turpin turned round, and ran away; we took West.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you and your friend armed yourselves with sticks to renew the battle? A. We did not; we had no sticks in the church-yard; the gentleman who came out could not see me knocked down; as they were talking to Fincher, about 100 yards off - Turpin ran up and struck me, and directly they heard the gentleman's voice, they ran away; we got sticks to defend ourselves in case we should meet them again; we did not offer to strike them - the bundle has not been found.</p>

            . I was at Ealing on the night of the 7th of August, and heard a noise in the village; I was about twenty yards from the place; Fincher and French were dragging West towards me, and said they had been interrupted on the road, robbed, and used ill; I said, "Is that true;" Fincher said, "Look in my face, and you will see I have been ill used;" there appeared marks of blood on his face, as if from a scratch or something; I put West in the cage, but did not search him; they all three appeared sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had any of the men sticks? A. I saw one stick standing against the wall, who it belonged to I do not know; West said he was perfectly willing to go to the cage. I saw blood on Fincher's face, whether it was a scratch or blow I could not tell by that light; West said he was not the man - I did not hear him say they had been fighting upon the road; I took him about three quarters of a mile from the spot.</p>

            . I am headborough of Ealing. West was brought to the watch-house; he asked on Sunday morning if he was to be kept there all day; I said, Yes; he first asked if he could see the man who was knocked down; I said I did not know where to find him; he then said, it was a hard case he should be kept there, he did not do it - it was Turpin who did it; he said Turpin and George did it - that he did not know his other name, but he worked for Mr. Westmoore, and that Turpin also worked there; I found Turpin at the Chequers, at Apperton, on the Sunday night, tipsy, with a person named George; I took them both up, but George was discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ascertain, whether they had been struggling? A. I did not; I found Turpin about a mile and a half from where he works.</p>

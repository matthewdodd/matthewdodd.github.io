I am a surgeon, of Kent House, Bow Road—I am surgeon to the police—I saw Mrs. Rinka at her house on 2nd October, I believe—she was suffering from injuries inflicted within two or three days—the injuries were two fractured ribs and a fractured collar bone—I have been attending her since—she has had pleurisy, pneumonia, and vomiting of blood—the pleurisy, I believe, was caused by the fractured ribs—her brain is now affected—she is in a very dangerous state—she had also received scalp bruises, which might have been caused by a fall—the frac<lb></lb>tured ribs were caused by direct violence, a blow or a kick—my impression is she never will recover—one side is now paralysed—I have previously attended her—she was a fairly strong woman—my assistant had attended her on her having an epileptic fit—her fits have been aggravated by the violence.</p>

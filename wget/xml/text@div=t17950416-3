               <p>I am a pawnbroker. On the 18th of March, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar came with the goods that I have here, a white cardinal, a cotton gown, and stuff petticoat, to pledge them; she asked a guinea; I offered her fourteen shillings; she stood for fifteen, but at last took fourteen. The next day I was absent from home, and the prosecutrix, together with the prosecutor and the prisoner, came to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner? - I verily believe it is the prisoner, but I have my doubts about it, for she was then dressed with a black silk handkerchief about her neck, and a cloth cloak on, with a man's hat; she pledged them in the name of

               <p>Prisoner. He wanted my poor old mother to give his wife some money. I am sure he never saw me in his life till the constable took me up to his shop, and two more women, and she swore to one of the other.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen them? - I went out about nine o'clock and locked the door after me, and see them then; when I came home the staple of my door was drew, and my clothes were gone from off the line.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have got a very old woman a mother, and this gentlewoman came to my mother on Monday, and asked for my mother to pay the fourteen shillings, and then she would not appear against me; and my poor mother could not get fourteen shillings, and the neighbours made up seven shillings, and took it to Mr. Peate. and he desired them to give the seven shillings to his wife, and said she would not appear against me. As to the pawnbroker he does not know me from Adam.</p>

               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice ROCKE.</p>
               <p>Court to Peate. It becomes you to be a little more circumspect in future than you have been in this case; unless you are, you yourself will one day or other have to answer for an offence of a deeper die than this is. It is not to be conceived that a prudent man would not have taken more care than what you have done; you knew Margaret Murphy, and yet took these things of this woman under her name; it seems to me to be scandalous conduct; and you likewise hear what the prisoner has said, that you have now seven shillings in your pocket from that woman's mother.</p>

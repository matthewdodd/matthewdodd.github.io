I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and surgeon to the University College Hospital—I was present at a surgical exami<lb></lb>nation of the defendant at Battersea, on 5th June, 1872; there were present Mr. Barnard Holt, Mr. Savery, Dr. Edgcumbe, and Dr. Marsh—in the pri<lb></lb>soner's presence Dr. Edgcumbe made a statement about his symptoms—he said it had been necessary to cup him, and there were marks on his back—we subsequently examined the prisoner in bed—the upper part of his spine was curved and bowed, a little more on the left side than the right—the skin was sore from blistering—I asked if he felt any pain in his back, and we went into his case generally—we thought the pain was due to the general tenderness of the skin—by "we "I mean Mr. Holt and Mr. Edg<lb></lb>cumbe, not Mr. Marsh and Mr. Savery—I attribute the soreness of the skin to the blistering and cupping—the skin was considerably reddened and irritable—we came to the conclusion that the hump on the back was the result of a deformity of the spine; the result of slow changes of long stand<lb></lb>ing, not of any recent injury—I don't think we could arrive at any conclu<lb></lb>sion as to the length of time that deformity had existed, it must have been many years—we also examined him on 5th June, 1873, at Dr. Edgonmbe's house—he complained of incontinence of urine, and he wore a urinal—Mr. Holt requested to be allowed to pass a catheter, but the defendant refused by Dr. Edgcumbe's advice; he was pressed by Mr. Holt and Mr. Savery in my presence—if it had been a stricture it could have been ascertained by the catheter—if there had been incontinence of urine the bladder ought to be empty—I examined his back again on that occasion, and was confirmed in my previous opinion with regard to the hump—I did not think that his back was giving him pain—I thought his statement was not true—his urinary organs, externally, appeared perfectly healthy; if there had been any incontinence of urine I should have expected to have found the parts sodden and wet—it might be right to cup and blister for pains in the back alone, but not for an old deformity.</p>

               <p>control the functions of the bladder—I believed that arose from the acci<lb></lb>dent, otherwise I should not have continued to attend him—I have no doubt the inflammation of the back was the result of the accident, but with regard to the swelling underneath the inflammation, my opinion was un<lb></lb>questionably influenced by the statement of the prisoner and his wife—the accident might have caused it—loss <hi rend="italic">of</hi> power of controlling the functions of the bladder unquestionably indicates mischief to the spine—there was a slight curvature of the spine, but it was of a lateral nature—the prisoner had a serious relapse the beginning of this year, the only new feature being a severe inflammation about the bone—I could not connect this with the accident, but the state <hi rend="italic">of</hi> health in which he was might have induced a recurrence of any tendency to inflammation about the bone—I did not see any affection of the bone soon after I was called in—if he had another relapse it might be more severe than the former one—he requested another physician should be called in, and Doctor Kellett was called in—I called on him at all times and without notice, and always found him in bed<lb></lb>that is to say within a week or two of his going to the sea-side—the last time I called on him, I' think, was on the 27th or 28th of July—when he was recovering I occasionally found him out of bed, but I always saw him in his room—I understood he had been confined to his bed six weeks before I was called in—I never saw anything about him to lead me to suspect that he indulged in drinking—very likely I should have dis<lb></lb>covered it if he had—in conjunction with the other doctors I leeched, cupped, and blistered him, and he said the treatment was always accom<lb></lb>panied with relief—I made a joint report with Dr. Marsh—I recollect attending while he was at Harwich—he complained then very much of his water, but I did not test it—on the 3rd of May, 1872, I met Dr. Cooper, Dr. Marsh, and Mr. Webb—after I had described his symptoms and my treatment, Dr. Cooper said he thoroughly endorsed all I had done—it was ultimately proposed by Dr. Cooper and myself that the matter should be settled by an arbitrator, subject to the approbation of Mr. Webb, his solicitor—several months passed away without the negotiations for an arbitration coming to anything—I recollect meeting Dr. Cooper on the platform at Paddington, and having our usual friendly conversation—I said I was surprised to find that the Company had put in a plea that the prisoner was not in the train, and Dr. Cooper laughed in a good natured way and said "You know we do not admit anything, we dispute every<lb></lb>thing;" and then he laughingly said "He was in the train sure enough"—of course Dr. Cooper did not speak from his own knowledge—I happened to mention that circumstance to the prisoner, and hence it is that I am obliged to reveal it now, though it was said to me as one gentleman speaking to another—I find, upon looking at my notes, it was about nine weeks he was confined to his bed in Mawbey Street—during the trial at Westminster there was an accident in Court, some of the ceiling falling down, and the prisoner swooned and had to be taken out and laid upon the floor of Westminster Hall, and have stimulants and water thrown <hi rend="italic">over</hi> him—he certainly looked during his examination very ill—I cannot speak to the fact of his head being affected during the time he was under exami<lb></lb>nation, but he complained to me of his memory being affected—I cannot say whether he was in Court during any of the time <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Company's witnesses being examined, but I think it was whilst they were being examined that the glass fell down, at any rate it was at the commencement</p>

My office is at 159, Euston Road—I conducted the action brought by the prisoner against the Metropolitan Railway, and I undertook the case in the full belief it was a genuine one—the Com<lb></lb>pany sent a letter without prejudice offering him 501., which he declined to accept—there was a proposal that the matter should be settled by arbitration, but it fell through in consequence of the parties being unable to agree as to an umpire—I was present at a meeting with Dr. Cooper, and I understood him to indorse the opinion of Dr. Edgcumbe—I wrote to the prisoner instructing him to send me an account of all expenses he had been put to, and I have here the receipts—I wrote to the clergyman of the parish as to his character, prior to going on with the action—I have seen him once or twice at his house, and frequently at my office, and on no occasion have I seen any indication of intoxica tion—I was included in tine charge of conspiracy, which charge was subsequently withdrawn.</p>

I was in the habit of seeing the prisoner in Bennerley Road after the railway accident, and previously to 22nd March, I had seen him frequently at different places—before the 22nd March, in my opinion, he was a thoroughly healthy and active man in every respect—I never noticed anything in the shape of deformity about him—when I saw him after the accident, his appearance in every respect was greatly altered—he was not like the same man, and does not look tike the same man now—during my visits I did not see him out of bed at all, and I never sent word to say that I was coming—I have known him between four and five years, and I have never seen him intoxicated—I visited him in Mawbey Street after he came from the sea-side—that was a considerable time after February or March, in the following year—he was very bad then, and he told me he had had a relapse—I saw some of his water in a bottle, and it was very thick—he was suffering greatly at that time—I did not see him use a small vessel in bed there, but I saw him use a galley-pot in Bennerley Road—I did not know him when he kept a trap, but I had fre<lb></lb>quently heard <hi rend="italic">of</hi> his keeping one—I do not think it was possible from the state I saw him in, he could have gone into the garden as has been stated—he showed me bruises on his shoulders and legs on one occasion—before the accident his usual walking pace was over three miles an hour, and on</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I think I saw him on one or two occasions in 1872, before the accident—I believe twelve months before the accident I saw him on one, two, or it might be half a dozen occasions—I might have seen him more frequently.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's eldest sister, and wife of the last witness—I frequently visited him, both with and without my husband, after the accident on the 22nd of March, 1872—I had seen him several times in that year previously—I saw him oftener than my husband—when I came to see him, within a few weeks of his going to the sea-side, I saw him in bed, and I also saw him up in the easy chair; that was while the bed was being made—I never saw him the least intoxicated during any of my visits—it was about six weeks after the accident that I saw him first—I do not think it likely that he could then go about the garden for an hour at a time—he was very ill indeed; he was groaning, and could not turn round without difficulty and pain—previous to his accident he was, in every respect, an active healthy man—I am thirty-three years of age next birth<lb></lb>day—I have never known him to have any doctor or any medicine for any complaint whatever, and he was at home with me until I was married, eleven years ago—this accident has altered his appearance—it has altered him as regards his deformity—before the accident he was a little round-shouldered, but not to the extent he is now—he had never any accident to cause a deformity; he was not born with one—he was round-shouldered from grow<lb></lb>ing fast as a youth—I visited him several times when he had a relapse, in Mawbey Street—I found him very bad indeed; I did not think he would live—I have not seen him carry his child since the accident, either indoors or out—I used to go on week-days as well as Sundays—his wife has told me that she was with him both night and day, and she appeared thoroughly worn-out with nursing him—he was so bad that he could not walk; he could not come to see my child, who was ill—he has not been for years upon friendly terms with his sister Eliza, she has always been of a most violent temper, and from her childhood she has gone by the name of "Spit<lb></lb>fire"—he has told me that it was through Eliza that he left home—I do not think his mother was on friendly terms with him at the time of the accident—I have seen him use a walking-stick since the trial at Westminster—I believe he had a railway accident.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>. I was called as a witness in the Court of Common Pleas for him—I was not asked whether he had a lump on his back before the accident—I was asked whether he was deformed before the accident—I was not asked "Have you noticed an appearance on his back of nor did I say "No, never"—I have not noticed an appearance on his back, not as a lump—I was not asked that question—I was asked if he was a little stooping—I think I was asked whether he had a deformity on his back—I was asked whether I noticed that he had an appearance on his back and I did answer "No, never"—the counsel then said to me,</p>

               <p>"What, not now?" and I said "Yes, now there is, but not before the acci<lb></lb>dent"—the counsel then said "There is a lump on his back now," and I said "Yes"—the counsel then asked "Did you never observe it before the acci<lb></lb>dent?" and I answered "No, it was not there;" and I say now that lump was not on his back before the accident.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner for eleven or twelve years—I think I had not seen him for four or five years before the 22nd of March—I remember meeting him near Gower Street Station on the night of the 22nd of March—as far as my recollection goes, it was from 9 to 9.30—I saw no mark, cut, or scratch about his face or hands at that time—he was not drunk in the least—he told me he was going home to Clapham—I never saw any deformity in his back, except that he was a little round<lb></lb>shouldered—I have heard of his sister Eliza speaking about his back, and saying how ill he was—I have not heard her say <hi rend="smallCaps">SO</hi>—I saw him shortly before the accident, and he was not in the least intoxicated.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>. I was not called at Westminster Hall because they did not know my address—I had not seen the prisoner for five or six years before this night—it was Friday evening, as far as I remember—I remember that particular night, because I was going for two boxes that had come by train from Nottingham; that is how I remember—that was the first time I had seen him for the period I have mentioned.</p>

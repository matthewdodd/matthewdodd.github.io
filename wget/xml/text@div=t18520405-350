                  </hi>. I am a model-maker. I was on Tower-hill on 11th March, about twenty minutes after 12 o'clock at night—the prisoner came to me, and put her hand in my right hand coat pocket, and took a silk handkerchief which I had there—I turned round, and she tripped me up, and when I recovered myself I found that she had abstracted a leather bag from my trowsers pocket, containing thirty-eight or thirty-nine shillings—I laid hold of her, and kept her till the officer came up—I have not seen my hand<lb></lb>kerchief since—this is my bag—it was in my trowsers pocket.</p>

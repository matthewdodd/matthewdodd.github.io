I am foreman to Martha Phillips and another—the prisoner was in their service as porter—it was his duty to deliver goods and receive money, and pay it to me the following day—he did not account to me for these three sums—I called the names over to him the morning after the delivery of the goods, and he said on one occasion that Mrs. Galliford was out, and on another that he had lost the bill—I asked if they had paid, and he said no—when he was given into custody he said he had made use of some of the moneys and had lost the other.</p>

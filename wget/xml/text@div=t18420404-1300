                  </hi>. I am manager to William Consit Wright, a coal-merchant, at Ratcliff-wharf, Ratcliff-cross—he has stables in Narrow-street, Ratcliff—I live in a house adjoining the stables. On Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 20th of March, I left home about ten o'clock—I shut my door when I went out by pulling it to—it shuts by a latch—I came home about eleven o'clock—I found a large box in my bed-room disarranged, but missed nothing at that time—in the morning when the servant came I missed some shoes, which I had left in my sitting-room when I went out in the morning—the prisoner was afterwards brought to me, between six and seven o'clock in the evening of the Wednesday following—I did not know him—I told him to take his shoes off—he did so, and I recognised them as being mine, and those I had missed—I said they were mine, and I should send for a policeman—he said he had purchased them in Whitechapel—I sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody—I also missed part of a loaf of bread.</p>

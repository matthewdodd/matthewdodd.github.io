            . I am a journeyman to Mr. Price, in umbrella making. On the 23d of September, about seven in evening, or a little after, I was going up to Mr. Price's for work, and the prisoner was standing looking in at the window; the shopman was preparing to light the candles; when I got up to the shop door, he walked in before, he asked the shopman to look at an umbrella; another gentleman came in the shop; the umbrella was shewn him before the other gentleman came in; the gentleman bought an umbrella, and gave the shopman the money; he went back for change; I went backwards in the warehouse; the warehouse is beyond the shop, at the back of a parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the gentleman buy an umbrella - A. No, but the shopman came backwards for change of Mrs. Price, saying that the gentleman had bought an umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the prisoner at his going out - A. No; I came in the shop before the gentleman that had bought the umbrella had left it, when the shopman came forward with the change.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the shop then - A. No, he was gone; the gentleman was there that had bought the other umbrella; the gentleman asked if the prisoner came in with an umbrella in his hand; I knowing that he did not, I said no. Mrs. Price asked me to go after the prisoner. I went down Temple bar and through Fleet street; the gentleman said he went that way; and when I came to Water lane in Fleet street, I saw the prisoner going with an umbrella in his hand, he was walking; I stopped him, and told him he must come back along with me; he said I was mistaken in his person; when I told him where he had got the umbrella, he came with me back as far as Temple lane, and there he ran away from me; I followed him and catched him again; he had the umbrella with him when I caught him. I brought him back to the shop, he brought the umbrella in the shop and laid it on the back of the counter. Mr. Price took it up and the prisoner was secured; we called a coach and took him to Bow street directly.</p>
               <p>Q. to Price You have got an umbrella in your hand, were you in the shop when the prisoner was brought back - A. I was. When he came in he had this umbrella; I took him in the warehouse, he laid it down, I took it up, it has never been out of my possession since.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether that umbrella had been in the shop any part of that day - A. It had been in the shop window for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mix the umbrella which the prisoner brought in with the other umbrellas - A. No; it is a silk umbrella; I valued it at ten shillings; it is worth double. When the prisoner was brought in with the umbrella he begged for mercy, and wished to serve his majesty, which I was anxious he should, but the magistrate thought proper to bind me over.</p>
               <p>Q. to Smith. You are very sure that the man that you met with the umbrella was the man that came in the shop - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have known him had you overtaken him without an umbrella in his hand - A. I particularly observed him when I got up to him, before I went into the shop.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

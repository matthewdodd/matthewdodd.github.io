               <p>Q.Do you keep a house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any partner? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you the last person up on the 21st of March? - A. I was; I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you make fast your doors and windows? - A. Yes, I did: On Tuesday, the 22d, about six o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by a person who lodges in my house; I came down stairs, and found the two parlour-doors open, and the shopdoor, and the property taken out.</p>

               <p>Q.How came those doors open? - A.They were entered by means of some person or persons sealing the wall which has access to the parlourdoor; they broke open the parlour-door, which goes into the yard; they must have got over the wall in the yard, which is about ten feet high.</p>
               <p>Q.How was that door broke? - A. By taking away the grove which supports the shutter; that was knocked away, and the shutter fell down.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there no pin to fasten it? - A.No, I did not think it necessary, as there was such a high wall; it was a glass door, and the glass was broken, by which means they got in; then they had to break open an inner parlour-door, which was locked; I think I took the key of the shop up into the bed-room, but I may be mistaken in that; if I did, they must have gone up into the bed-room, and taken the key off the drawers; the shop-door was broke open by splitting the pannel of the door; I lost about twenty loaves of sugar, and at least twelve hundred weight of moist sugar, forty pounds weight of tea, five silver tea-spoons, one table-spoon, and two shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. The sugar, I suppose, was in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were the spoons? - A. In the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q.And the shirts? - A. In the parlour also.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your lodger here? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Have you more than one lodger? - A. Yes, three.</p>
               <p>Q.None of them are here? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. The key of the shop-door it was your habit to take up with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt that you took it up with you that night? - A. I came down stairs again for the key of my bed-room, which I had forgot, and I might have left the key of the shop-door.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not tell the Magistrate that you did take the key up, and put it by your bed-side? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.One should think it must be somebody pretty well acquainted with your house that had done this? - A.No, I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you think any stranger might have found it without any difficulty? - A.There might be persons out of the house as well acquainted with it as persons in the house.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean to say the two prisoners were acquainted with your house? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you find that your shop-door had been opened by a key? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200087"></xptr>Q. And that key was left in the lock inside? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this wall is ten feet high? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Not a very convenient wall for women to scale? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was awoke at six o'clock in the morning, it was light? - A. Yes, it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to John Evans, a wholesale cheese-monger, of High-street, Shoreditch. On the 27th of May, about half-past three o'clock, I was stopping at Brewer's-quay, Lower Thames-street, with his cart—I went into an ale-shop to have some beer, and left the cart facing the door—it contained a load of Dutch butter, the property of Mr. Evans—I saw the prisoner before I went in—I saw him draw another cart up the hill—her had been standing alongside me all day—when I came out I missed a small firkin of butter from the back part of my cart—the cart the prisoner had been driving stood close to my cart—I saw my firkin in</p>

               <p>his cart, partly covered with a great coat and a tarpaulin—he passed close by me, and went up the hill—I went after him, told him to stop, and said, "You have got something in your cart which you have no business at all with"—he said, "You are a b—liar"—I turned round, saw a police<lb></lb>man, and gave him into custody, with the firkin—this now produced is it.</p>

About half-past three o'clock on the afternoon of the 27th of May, White called me—I went to the pri<lb></lb>soner, and saw the firkin in the cart he was driving, covered up—I asked how he came by it—he said, "What the b—h—have you to do with it, it is in the City, you have nothing to do with it?"—he threatened me, and proceeded to go on with the cart—I stopped it—he then ran away into Lower Thames-street—I overtook him about 200 yards up Lower Thames-street—he turned round and struck me over the head with the butt end of a whip—I laid hold of him—he struggled a good deal, and kicked me very severely—if it had not been for the soldiers at the Tower, I could not have kept him in custody—I took the firkin of butter out of the cart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was at work for Mr. Owen, to go with the cart; I had it standing on Tower-hill; a man wanted ten sacks of flour taken; I went up as far as Mincing-lane, and this man came running after me, and said, "You have a cask of butter in your cart belonging to me;" I said I had not, and if it was there it was unknown to me; he called the policeman; I went down Thames-street, to see whether my master was gone home; the policeman ran after me and took me.</p>

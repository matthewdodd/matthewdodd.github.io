               <p>ELEANOR HERBERT. I am a widow. I am a <rs id="t18140112-95-viclabel493" type="occupation">laundress</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18140112-95-victim835 t18140112-95-viclabel493"></join>. I live in Lee's Mews, the top of North Audley-street, Grosvenor-square. I lost these things. On the 28th of December I was out. I went into a public-house. I fell in with the prisoner and another woman. One of the ladies gave me a glass of rum; then I called for a quartern, and we left the house. One of the ladies wished me to give her the bundle; I refused, and the prisoner took it from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your bundle contain - A. Four shirts, a jacket, two pair of stockings, and some handkerchiefs I had to wash. Mrs. Bailey took them, and took them into Mrs. Barclay's room. We all three went together to Mrs. Barclay's room, and when I came the next day to Mrs. Barclay, the bundle was gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the wine vaults, the corner of Compton-street. I there saw the prosecutrix; the prosecutrix, I and Mrs. Bailey, drank together. The prosecutrix called for a quartern of rum; we went to another public-house; we all got intoxicated. I took the bundle to Mrs. Barclay's, and there I left it with her. I was intoxicated almost as much as the prosecutrix.</p>

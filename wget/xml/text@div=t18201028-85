A crowd came up behind, they all hustled me, and snatched my watch from my fob. A person behind held my arms - the man who took it ran down Gun-street. I ran a few yards after them, and was knocked down or tripped up. I received a blow with a bludgeon on the back of my head, which deprived me of my senses. When I recovered myself Wells said he knew two or three of them, but I knew none of them myself.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, am fifteen years old, and live in Artillery-passage. On the 9th of October I was playing about, and saw a gang of fifteen or twenty parading up and down Union-street - they stopped at the corner of Gun-street. Mr. Morgan was walking rather slowly; two or three of them came in front of him - I then saw them all run down Gun-street; he followed them, was knocked down, and received a severe blow on the back of his head. As they ran away I saw the watch in Grew's hand by the gas-light. They all ran away, calling out,</p>

            . I saw Wells in Gun-street. Pinnock and Potts were with us playing at hoop. A mob surrounded a gentleman; I did not see the prisoners among them. At the time Morgan was knocked down Wells was at the corner of Steward-street with me, fifty yards off; I could see as much as him. As he returned from Worship-street that night he said he was promised 50 l. for every one he should hang, and 5 s. a day for attending the Old Bailey. I said</p>
               <p>"John, how could you swear to the two young men, when you was at the corner of Steward-street at the time?" He said,</p>
               <p>"Oh you fool! I shall have 50 l. for every one I hang - I will pick out two, and say they were them that robbed the man." Pinnock reckoned up 5 s. a day, and made 3 l. 10 s. for fourteen days. He said,</p>
               <p>"There is a fine speck!" Next day I met him with about twenty officers. I followed him through several streets, he then parted from them, and came to me and Pinnock. He called me aside, and said Morgan had promised him 2 s. 6 d. next morning. I met him on Saturday morning in Widegate-alley. He had seen Mr. Grew talking to me. He said,</p>
               <p>"Well, Ned, what did they get out of you yesterday?" I said,</p>
               <p>"John, they got nothing out of me but the truth. I hear you swore at Worship-street that you saw the men knock the gentleman down and rob him of his watch." He said,</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was Wells near you - A. No, he was at the corner of Steward-street. We went to Worship-street out of curiosity - Wells said he knew two of them, and as he returned he said,</p>

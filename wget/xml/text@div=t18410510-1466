                  </hi>. On the 25th of February, I was in the service of William Orr—the prisoner was occasionally in his employ as a labourer, for nearly twelve months—I was told to watch him, and about quarter after six o'clock that evening, he came to do up the horses as usual in the stable—he locked the door, and went away with a bundle under his arm—I said, "Lack, what have you got there?"—he said, "Why, don't make a noise, I can put them back"—I then said, "If you have got nothing you are ashamed or afraid of, come round with me to the governor? I have his orders to watch you, and have done so"—he said he would not go round, he should be obliged to see him in the morning—we walked down the yard together, and as he would not go with me, I took the parcel from him, and took it to Mr. Orr—I opened it in Mr. Orr's presence, it contained fifteen brushes—I left them at Mr. Orr's—I left the prisoner at the end of the gateway, talking to Perry the car<lb></lb>penter, and when I returned in a quarter of an hour he was gone.</p>

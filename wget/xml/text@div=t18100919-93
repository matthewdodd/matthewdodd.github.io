            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 28th of July I was on duty, the lady and gentleman were going along in a one horse chaise. A person hollowed out they would lose one of the straps, it was hanging behind the chaise, the lady looked over the back part of the chaise, she said the trunk was lost, I immediately ran across to Bowl-yard, and under the gateway I apprehended the prisoner with the trunk, he was carrying it.</p>

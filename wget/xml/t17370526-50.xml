               <p>It appeared that there was a Dispute between the Prisoner and his Wife, about keeping their Child, that she went away from their Lodging and left the Child for her Husband; he took it in his Arms, and went out to look for his Wife, but being very drunk, the Boys in the Street follow'd him, and teiz'd him; one of whom giving him a Blow on the Legs, he let the Child fall to, or put it down on the Ground (for in this Circumstance the Witnesses differ'd) that he might run after the Boy that had struck him. The Child was taken up, and carry'd into a House, but it dy'd some Hours after.</p>

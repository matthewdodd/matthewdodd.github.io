               <p>Q. Where was your property at the time that you went to bed - A. In my pocket book; it was all safe when I went to bed in my right hand breeches pocket, I put my breeches under my pillow, under my head. I staid there about an hour, and then I altered my mind and would not stay all night; she said, I could not go out without permission of the people of the house. She went out and came in again, and said, I might go; when I had put part of my clothes on, I found two one pound notes on the bed. I examined my pocket book, and missed seven one pound notes, and a two pound note; I called the watchman, he came and searched, he found nothing on the prisoner or in the room.</p>

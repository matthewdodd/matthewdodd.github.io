            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Allen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner come into your master's-shop, and when was it - A. On the 10th of December, about half past one, the prisoner came in with another, to buy a shawl. The prisoner had a child in her arms. The prisoner came in with her mother, as she called the other woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it asked for the shawls - A. The prisoner. I had three shawls on the counter. I opened three; they were all separate. She bought a red shawl, and paid ten shillings for it. She looked at two more, and took them to the door to see them by the light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she return them - A. No. She came back again and put them down. She then went out of the shop with her mother. I saw a shawl hanging from under her shawl. The shawl that she bought and paid for, she gave to her mother and when the prisoner went out of the door, I told my master that I thought she had got a shawl. My master told me to go and fetch her back. I pursued her, and fetched her back. I found the shawl that I missed underneath her shawl, and when I brought her into the shop I took it from her, and when I took it from her she wanted to pay for it. She was searched at Marlborough-street office; there was a five-pound note found upon her.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

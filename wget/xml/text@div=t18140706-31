            . On the 6th of June last, I lived <rs id="t18140706-31-deflabel182" type="occupation">servant</rs> with Captain M'Keller.</p>
               <p>Q. On Tuesday, the 7th of June, what time did you get up in the morning - A. Between three and four; as I went down stairs I struck a light on the top of the stairs; when I got down stairs, I saw the kitchen-door open, and when I saw the area-door open, I went up immediately to my master, and told him I thought somebody had broken into the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060018"></xptr>Q. Whose house is it - A. Mr. Rider's; she is the person that keeps the house. Mrs. Rider is not here. She is a married woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know her husband - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Captain M'Kellar lodge there - A. Yes; there are other lodgers in the house. Mrs. Rider lives in the house herself now. Mr. Rider does not. She lets lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up and told your master that the house had been broken open - A. Yes. He came down with a dressing-gown on, took a sword, and came down with me; he saw the kitchen door broken open, and the lock of the cupboard in the back kitchen, that was broken, and two silver teaspoons were taken out of the cupboard in the back kitchen; a pair of gaiters, and smallclothes, were taken off the line. I had washed them on the Monday. I had seen the spoons the night before; I had locked them up in the cupboard; they were missing when I came down in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it day light - A. Yes; it was as light as now. The spoons were Captain M'Kellar's; the gaiters, and smallclothes, likewise were his; I had seen them on the line in the kitchen in the evening. The boots were in the passage, outside of the door; they were hessian boots; they were gone, and two umbrellas, which hung up in the passage; they were gone; they were all Captain M'Kellar's. The kitchen door was wide open. The person that shut the kitchen-door is here. I lost a shawl out of the back kitchen.</p>

               <p>Q. How happens it that Mrs. Rider is not here - A. I do not know; I saw her last night. I went to bed about half after twelve. When I came down in the morning, I missed a gown, petticoat, a fur tippet, and a pair of half boots.</p>
               <p>JOHN M'KELLAR. I lodge in this house. I was there on the night of the 6th of June. The servant called me about half past three in the morning. When I came down stairs, I missed a pair of boots, a pair of breeches, a pair of gaiters, two silver spoons, and two silk umbrellas. I saw them afterwards at Hatton Garden police office; the articles that I saw, were the articles I lost out of this house.</p>
               <p>JOHN LIMBRICK. I am an officer. The two prisoners were brought to Hatton Garden office by Waller, a watchman, on Wednesday, the 8th. I searched them.

I found nothing upon Houston.</p>

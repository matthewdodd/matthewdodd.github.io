               <p>JOHN GWYNN. I live in Vernon-place, Old-street. On the 21st of June I had been knocked down, and was much injured - the prisoner came to my house, on the 22d, and said he heard I had had an accident; he said "I have a leech at home, and if you will come I will give it you;" I said "What can I do with my clothes;" he said "Take them with you," and he put them into his handkerchief; he employed his son to put on the leech, while he dried my clothes and brush-them, and, while my head was down, he took my clothes out and pawned them - I did not miss them for two or three days.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What was the cause of my coming to your house on that morning. A. I do not know; on the day before I took a watch away, belonging to Mr. Edwards, which you told me to pawn, I did not know but what it was yours, but it proved to be another person's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the 20th of June, at eleven o'clock, this man was sitting in company with me, at my door, taking some porter - two young men came by, and one asked me to let him drink - he would leave his watch with me, and I said he should have it when he called for it - the prosecutor called for it the next morning, with a young man, named Berridge, and said "Let me look at that watch," which I said they might - he then ran away with it.</p>
               <p>Witness. No - it was not the next morning - but he gave it me to pawn; I was going to Bow, and in going along I said "This cannot be the watch the young man left," but I took it to pawn - I saw Berridge that day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he complain of your taking the watch? A. No; I did not desire him to pawn my things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Have not you got the duplicate of these clothes? A. No, I gave it to the officer - they were pawned in the name of Wilmore - I never saw anything of the money - he did not give me the duplicate - I found it in his house - it was given me by his landlord, who said "If you will keep a secret I will give you the ticket."</p>

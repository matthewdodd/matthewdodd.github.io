                  </hi>. I live at 1, Wood Yard, and am servant to Mr. Godberry, whose father keeps a hair dresser's shop in Red Cross Street, Southwark—on 3rd August, about 8.30 p.m., I went home to feed my baby, leaving the shop door double locked and no one within—the windows were safe—I returned about 9.5 (I had taken the key with me, but Mr. Godberry</p>

               <p>jun., came to me for it; I gave it to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, and he afterwards returned it to me)—when I opened the door it was only single locked, and I found the prisoner standing in the shop with a candle in his hand looking under the sofa—I had left the candle in my room on the first floor—a pane of glass was broken in the window—the prisoner said "Don't be frightened, let me <hi rend="italic">get</hi> to the door"—I said "No; you must wait till William comes"—that is my young master—he put the candle on the table, and sat down till the prosecutor came—I did not know him before—he said that he came to see Mr. Currie, who is the master of the house—I noticed a mess in the fender which was not there when I went out.</p>

I assist my father, a hair dresser, of 24, Union Street—on the morning of 3rd August, I left the house at 7.45—Ellen Stephens left before me, and took the key with her—I went to her for the key, and afterwards took it back to her—when I left I double locked the door—no window was broken then—I saw no candle at all—a white handled knife was on the table—I was sent for about 9.20—I then returned to the house and found the prisoner in the shop with a candle in his hand, and the servant in front of him—the window was broken, and a person could put his arm in and open the door—I once saw the prisoner in the shop when he came to ask for a job—I asked the prisoner what he wanted, he said he saw the door open and a candle there, and he thought he would walk in to see Mr. Currie—I asked him what he broke the window for, if the door was open, he said that the window was broken as well—the candle was in a candlestick—there was no mess in the fender when I went out, but I noticed it on my return—I did not point it out to him only to the prosecutor—I gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When you came in, did not you say "It is all right, go on? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Yes; but the young woman said "No, lock him up, he did not come here for nothing"—no one else has a key—I positively swear that I left the door locked—you were under the influence of liquor, I could see it in your face—there was a little curtain to the window, but anybody passing could see in with the candle alight.</p>

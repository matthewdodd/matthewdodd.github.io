            . I am a pawnbroker. I produce the coat and waistcoat, which I took in of the prisoner on the 6th of September, for 1l. 8s., in the name of Mary Townsend; I live with Mr. Burton, in Princes-street, Leicester-square.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time were they pawned? A. As far as I can recollect, between twelve and one o'clock - I had not known the prisoner before - she gave the address, "No. 4, Market-street," which is near our shop.</p>

             (police-constable G 145). I went with my brother officer to take the prisoner; I found the duplicate of this coat and waistcoat in the cupboard of her lodging in Bear-lane, Southwark - we followed her husband home and found her.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutor's wife had sent her to pledge the goods, to redeem others which she had pawned for their support.</p>

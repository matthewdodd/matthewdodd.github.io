                  </hi>. I keep the Duchess of Brunswick public-house, at Deptford. On Sunday evening, 11th Aug., I was in my bar—the prisoner came in between four and five, and asked for a pot of porter—he was tipsy, and I think he had no money—I said "No, young man, if you had your pockets full of money, you would have no drink at present; recollect it is Sunday, if you will come to-morrow I will give you a pot or a pint, or what you like, but it does not look well to see a young man tipsy on Sunday afternoon—he began abusing me, and call me all manner of bad names—I never touched him—he went towards the door, turned short round, as much as to say, "you be d—d," and his foot caught the door, and he made a slight stumble, and the latch of the door caught his cheek and caused a slight scar; the blood came from it—I went behind the bar, wetted a towel, and went towards him to wipe his face—when I came within reach of him he kicked towards me, and the last time but one he kicked me in the bottom of the belly—I said, "You have hurt my stomach"—he then made another kick at me, and upset a form in front of the bar—I stooped to pick it up, and as I was rising he took the pipe out of his mouth, and whether he threw it at me or jobbed it in my eye, the pain was so great and it was done so quickly, I could not swear—I put my hand up to my eye, and said, "Oh dear, my eye is out!" and he said, "Now I have got my revenge on you"—I have been under medical treatment ever since—I never applied any contemptuous name to him, that I swear, nor laid my hand on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Butler's service. On 7th Aug., about half-past five o'clock, the prisoner came, went into the parlour to his father, came out, and asked Mr. Butler for some beer—he told him to go home, as he had been drinking, that it was Sunday, and he would give him a pint of porter to-morrow—the prisoner used very bad language—his foot caught by the door, as it was not level, and he fell—Mr. Butler had not been near him then—no one was near him—he was not pushed—his cheek bled—Mr. Butler went for a cloth to wipe it, and the prisoner attempted to kick him four times, but the fourth time he kicked the form in front of the bar—he then took the pipe out of his mouth, and my master cried out, "Oh, God, my eye is out!"—the prisoner said, "Now I have my revenge," or "recompense," I cannot swear which, it was one of them—I cannot say whether he threw the pipe, or poked it—he was near enough to poke it; master stood close to him—I said, "See what you have done"—he said he would serve me the same, and said it served the old soldier right, or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the prisoner's father in the parlour at the time he was going out at the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The father came out of the parlour before the prisoner left the bar, and he said, "Look at my face"—he did not say, "See how they are serving me"—my master drew back when the prisoner attempted to kick him, but I believe he kicked him on the shins.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. AARON</hi>. My husband is a labourer, of Deptford; we live near the Duchess of Brunswick. I was standing at my door about five o'clock, and saw the prisoner fall or pushed down, I cannot say which—I saw no one near him—the landlord helped him up, and set him on a form behind the door—he was bleeding from a little scratch near his eye—the landlord went to get a cloth to wipe his face—the prisoner got up and made a kick—he used a little abusive language, and then threw his pipe at Mr. Butler, and hit him in the eye—he did not poke it—I am quite sure it left his hand before it hit Mr. Butler—Mr. Butler called out, "My eye is out!"—the prisoner called out, "Now, where is your recompense?"—he came out two or three times, and went back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Deptford-bridge. I was called to Mr. Butler—he had a very extensive injury to the eye—a portion of the transparent part was torn away, and the iris displaced—there was extensive inflammation of the outer membranes—the sight is entirely destroyed—the lenses are torn out—the point or the bowl of a tobacco-pipe would cause all I saw.</p>

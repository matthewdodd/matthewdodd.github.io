               <p>I live at Shoreham, between Seven Oaks and Dartford, in the county of Kent; I heard from my shepherd on the 1st of September, that I had lost one score of sheep, and on Sunday morning the 4th, between ten and eleven I heard there was a man taken on suspicion of stealing some sheep, which was on the 1st of September.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of sheep were they? - There were nine lambs that were shorn, and among the nine one ram lamb was saved intended for a young ram for a breeder; and there were nine wether sheep and two ewe sheep; they were all south downers; the lambs were marked in the neck with oker, and the wether lambs marked separate across the loins with a thin streak of oker to distinguish them from the ewe lambs, the ewe lambs were not marked across the loins, the wether sheep were marked across the shoulders with a narrow stripe of oker at sheering time; as to the two ewes we were not certain whether they were both marked or not, if they were marked they were marked with a streak of oker down the rump; I never saw any of the sheep since, but I have seen the skins, they were laid all tumbled about together, and a many of them were cut and mangled, but amongst them there were several whole skins which were quite perfect, clear to be my mark; the skins began to smell very much, I found them at the public house, the sign of the Bear, just by Sir Sampson's office.</p>
               <p>Court. From the description you have given of the marks that you used, are they such as enable you positively to swear to your own skins: - Yes, they are very clear, and have the oker being marked in three different places, and the different wideness of the oker.</p>
               <p>Court. Do the other farmers in your neighbourhood use the same sort of mark? - Not that I know of, I believe there is no farmer in that neighbourhood that keeps south downers but myself; I am trying to recollect if there is one; no, I do not recollect any; the south downer sheep are short legged, close wool, and black faced, their legs and face are black and smutty, and they are fuller of wool than the other sheep, and the wool is a much finer wool.</p>

               <p>I am shepherd to the prosecutor, on the 1st of September he lost some sheep, near Shoreham, we missed a score of sheep, nine lambs, and nine wether sheep, and two ewes, they were south downers: they were marked down the neck, the wether lambs had a mark down the loins, and the sheep across the shoulders, and the ewes down the neck; I heard of them again on the Sunday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140010"></xptr> in the forenoon; I saw the skins afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Could you judge from the skins whether they had been lately killed? - Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. By the appearance of the skins it appeared as if they were killed about the time I lost them; I live about twenty miles from London.</p>

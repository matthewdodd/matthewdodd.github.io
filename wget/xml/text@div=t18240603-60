             and Thomas Redmayne. On the 24th of April, between four and five o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop with a basket, and asked to see some figured ribbons, which I showed her - she seemed to admire one very much, but said it was too high a price, and asked to see some plain ones. I went for some, leaving the drawer with her, and on returning missed the ribbon she had so much admired, and saw the end of it hanging out of her bundle. I let her take it up and go; and I then went out, brought her back, and took her bundle from her basket, and the ribbon was in it. She said she believed she had not got it - she had bought and paid for one yard of ribbon.</p>

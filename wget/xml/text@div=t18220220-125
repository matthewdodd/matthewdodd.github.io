             I bought this pamphlet at Carlile's shop, in Fleet-street, on the 29th of December, 1821, of the prisoner - I wrote on it before I parted with it, and find that writing on it now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and the prisoner when you bought it - A. Nothing at all. There were several placards of different description in the shop, one was about two shopmen being arrested from the shop, without their names being known, it was in the window, passengers could see it; there was a crowd collected round the window all day long. The words,</p>
               <p>"Temple of Reason" were written in large gilt letters at the back of the shop, and there was a bill in the window, about</p>
               <p>"the infamous sentence passed on Miss M. A. Carlile."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. By whom were you employed to purchase the pamphlet - A. By one Purton; I have received 1 l. for my attendance at different times, but not for buying this book. I did not describe myself as a yeoman at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the shop in the morning, I said I had not got a book then, and did you not say,</p>
               <p>"I hope you not going to be so stupied as to give over selling them" - A. I never said any thing of the sort - he did say he had not one. I lived in New Cutt, Lambeth, and have been a broker. I have now a little property, which with economy supports me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you first went, he had not got the book - A. No; he told me to call in the evening, and I should have it, I did so and got it.</p>

            . I am in the office of Mr. Murray, solicitor, John-street, Bedford-row. On the 28th of December, I saw Carlile's shop, and particularly noticed a bill in the window, written in a large hand,</p>
               <p>"Two shop-men arrested this afternoon, by the Bridge-street wretches without knowing their names - worse than the Inquisition, and one of the blessings of the late six acts - plenty of volunteers tocombat the vile crew, and the same obnoxious pamphlets may be had in spite of them. - It is a right noble cause, they shall not with all their combined attacks shut up the Temple of Reason. - Oh! thou base gang you will do our cause, no harm but good - this is the mart for sedition and blasphemy."</p>
               <p>"That part of the publication charged as libellous, was here read, it was characterized by the most revolting blasphemy, and certain expressions were contained in it, of the most seditious nature, reflecting in very insulting and degrading terms, on His Majesty and every other branch of the Constitution, and finally attempting to excite the people to acts of rebellion.</p>
               <p>The prisoner read an exceeding long defence; and read the whole of the pamphlet, from which the libellous matter was extracted - declared the whole to be his own sentiments, and attempted to justify every part.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Holmes, a plumber, at Turn<lb></lb>ham-green; the prisoner was my mother's servant. On the 1st of April she brought me a veil which I had left at my mother's on the previous even<lb></lb>ing and said she was going to her grandmother's—I told her to call for a parcel as she came back—after she was gone I put two sovereigns in a paper, put that into a piece of net, and inclosed the whole in a large sheet of paper, I put a pin at each end, and a pin in the middle—when she came back I gave it her, and told her to go straight to her mistress with it, and take care of it as there was something in it of consequence.</p>

I sent the prisoner to my daughter with a veil, and she came back in about two hours—she brought me this piece of paper, with two bits of lace in it, but no money—the paper was pinned up with three pins—it was not tied at all—she followed me into the dining-room, I spread it out on a table, and said, "Jane, look here"—she took one of the bits of net, shook it, and said, "Here is nothing," and there was nothing—she then said she must go away—she was to have gone in a week's time, but she then said she must go di<lb></lb>rectly, as her father was very bad—she left in leas than half an hour.</p>

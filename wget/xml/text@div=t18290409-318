            . I kept an eating-house in Crown-court, Temple-bar. Mr. Archibald discounted a bill for 21l. 13s. 9d. for me on the 14th of March; I was to take two dozen of sherry wine, at 40s. a dozen, in part of the cash: it was to have been delivered when I sent for it - I knew the prisoner for nine or ten weeks; I never authorized him to apply for the wine: I knew nothing of this till the 1st of April, when I sent to Archibald the billbroker for the wine (looking at the order); I never signed this, nor authorized any body to put my name to it.</p>

             re-examined. Mr. Whitaker was to send the wine to my house, and I found it there; I do not know where it came from - he ordered a person in London to send it; it stood in my hall in bottles, not in a hamper.</p>

When the 16l. was paid to Mrs. Fifield, did not you say you would give the balance, 5l. 13s. 9d. in wine, equal to that at 40s. a dozen from any winemerchant in London? A. No; I said the gentleman proposed to give two dozens at 40s.; I have no doubt it was worth that - I undertook that it should he; I have no doubt it was so from the respectability of my client - Mrs. Fifield endorsed the bill in my drawing-room; the bill is not in my possession; I do not know where it is.</p>
               <p>MRS. FIFIELD. The prisoner introduced me to Archibald - his brother is a baker, and had lived in Temple-street; I owed him 17s. 6d. and he called for it - the prisoner was with him, and this is the way I first knew him; he offered to sell me whiskey and different spirits; I owed a quarter's rent, and had a man in possession - the prisoner said if I had a good bill he could get it discounted, and introduced me to Archibald.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, Q. Did you endorse the bill in Archibald's presence? A. I endorsed it, but not in his presence - I did it at my brother's, in Red Lion-street, Holborn: Archibald was not there - my brother drew the bill by my authority, but I endorsed it; my brother is the acceptor - he was in my debt.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner apply to you about the wine? A. Never; I intended to dispose of it, and had a friend who would have taken it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his Defence, entered in'o a long account of his first acquaintance with the prosecutrix, and stated that she had desired him to dispose of the wine, and promised to give him 3l. for his trouble in introducing her to Archibald. That after she had received the money they went to a public-house in the Strand, where he wrote the order in question which the prosecutrix did not sign, (not being able to write.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Thomas Hall, 103, Bishops-gate-street. On the morning of the 16th of May, the prisoner and a young person came and asked to see some ribbons for neck-ties—I counted the number of rolls in the box—the prisoner bought and paid for one yard at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I missed a piece, and as they were going out they were charged with taking a roll of ribbon—both denied having it and said they were quite willing to be searched—we said we would search them if they walked back<lb></lb>ward—they had to pass through the counter, and as the prisoner passed through she dropped the ribbon—I am sure she dropped it—it appeared to fall from under her shawl—this is the roll—it has our shopmark on it and was never sold.</p>

I saw the ribbon fall—it might be five or six inches from the ground when I first saw it in the act of falling—I cannot say from whom it fell—I was behind the counter—they both had shawls on—I think there was not time for it to have fallen from the one in advance of the prisoner—they were about half a yard apart, I should say.</p>

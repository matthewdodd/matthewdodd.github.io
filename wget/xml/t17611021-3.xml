            . I live at Chertsey bridge; last Thursday morning the prisoner at the bar was driving a parcel of sheep; I take it there were about thirty of them; he had them in a meadow. I knew them to be Mr. Wood's property, by the brand-mark, T. Wood. The prisoner drove them over the bridge; I asked him where he was going with them? He said, he was going to put them to grass. He drove them almost to Littleton, and some men talked hard to him, and he drove them back again over the bridge; and the shepherd met him, and brought him to the house where I live.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the shepherd's name?</p>
               <p>Roppey. His name is

            . I am shepherd to esquire Wood, I put my sheep in the sold on Wednesday night; and when I came to the sold, on the Thursday morning, between seven and eight, there were 27 of them missing. I went to Chertsey-bridge, and met the prisoner on the road with them, bringing them back again. He said, he found them by Chertsey-pound, and found nobody belonged to them, so he was bringing them back again, and said, he hoped I would give him something, he had taken 32 of Mr. Goodwin's sheep. I said, go there, perhaps he will give you something. After we had talked to him some time at my master's (Mr. Wood) he owned he was very hard drove for money, and he thought to drive them across the country, and sell them, to put himself into ready money. Then he was committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I picked up the sheep by the side of the road in a green field, and drove them along, and thought it the best way to bring them back again, which I did.</p>

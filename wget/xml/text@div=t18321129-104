In October last I returned to town, after a short absence: soon after I returned I missed these articles - I sleep at my chambers; she came at her usual time to remove my breakfast things - after the arrival of an officer, I inquired of her first what had become of the plate, which I missed from my chambers; she said she had removed it to her house for safety - I asked what she did that for, as I had told her not; I then asked what she had done with the two coal-scuttles - she said they were at her house; I then asked for the sheets: she said she had taken them to be washed - I said she had no right to remove them, as I had given her express directions not to do so, and insisted upon her accompanying the officer to her house, and giving them up - she became alarmed, and begged I would give her two or three days time, and they should be returned; I said I would not - she then said she had pawned part of them; I said she should go to her house, give up the duplicates of what she had pawned, and give up the other things, and they left for that purpose - they returned, and said they had not been to her house; there were sixteen or seventeen duplicates produced to me of my property, and some other property - I then went to the pawnbroker's, and found some of these things, but most of the property has since been produced at my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Hayes. About eleven o'clock at night, on 21st Sept., I went to John Langton's house with the prisoner—we had some beer—I had six shillings, a half-crown, and a sixpence in my right-hand trowsers pocket—I sat down, and the prisoner sat next to me on that side—when I had been there half an hour, I fell off to sleep—I slept about two hours—when I awoke I missed my money—it had been in a purse—the purse was put into my left-hand pocket—the prisoner was there—I asked him about it—he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Langton. I remember the pri<lb></lb>soner and Small coming to my house—the prisoner sat on his right side, and put his hand across to his left-hand trowsers pocket, and took silver out—Small was asleep—it was between nine and ten o'clock, as near as I can tell—I had been in my own house all that evening—I went to bed that night, but I did not stop in bed—I stopped in the room after I had seen the prisoner take the money out of Small's pocket—I sat still, and said nothing—I told my father-in-law in the morning, but I said nothing at the time—directly Small awoke he missed it, and spoke about it—I told him what I had seen—the prisoner was within a yard or two of him—he did not say anything—all the rest that came to my house were in the room.</p>

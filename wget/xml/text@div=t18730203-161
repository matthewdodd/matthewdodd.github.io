                  </hi>. I am <hi rend="italic">agent</hi> to the Solicitor to the Treasury in Mint prosecutions—on Tuesday evening, 21st January, I went to Greek Street, Soho, with Inspectors Branmui, Kenwood, Hincs, and Other officers—I went into the George and Dragon public-house, and saw the prisoner there with another prisoner—Kenwood said to me "This man has put something from his hand into this female's cloak-pocket, and she has dropped it"—I said "Pick it up and pass it over," and he handed to me two paper packets, one of which I opened, and found ten counterfeit florins with printed paper between them in the way in which bad money is generally wrapped—I afterwards examined the other paper, which also contained money—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said to Lester "Well, <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, here we are again"—he made no reply—while I was addressing him, Rogers was fumbling at her right-hand dress pocket—I said to Kenwood "Has this woman been searched?"—Rogers said "I shall not be searched here, I shall be searched by a female"—I said "Turn your pockets inside out then"—she did so, and in pulling out her handkerchief, this small paper packet dropped on the floor; she put her left foot on it; I told her to remove her foot, and in doing so she pulled the packet with it—Kenwood removed her foot by force, and I picked it up—it contained three counterfeit florins with paper between them, and a bad shilling separately wrapped up.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LESTER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say on the first examination that you found twenty florins on the female, and three florins and two shillings under her feet? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.—I found nothing on her—I think I was the third officer to go in—I spoke to Robinson first—you were as close as you could stand to Rogers—I did not see you drop anything into her pocket.</p>

I stood with a sergeant in Greek Street, and at twenty-five minutes past 7 saw the prisoners and Robin<lb></lb>son walking together—I went to the George and Dragon, and gave a signal to Sergeant Brannan, who fetched the other officers—I looked through the door, and saw the prisoners standing in the George and Dragon—I was the first to go in, and saw Lester place a paper packet in Rogers' left-hand cloak pocket—I said "There is something put in the woman's pocket"—I caught hold of her, and she dropped a packet on the ground—I took another packet from her pocket—they each contained ten florins lapped in paper—I handed them to Mr. Brannan, who said they were bad—Robinson said that he only came in accidentally to have a glass of ale, and knew nothing of the others—I told him he did, for I saw them all come in together—the woman was very fidgetty, and Brannan asked her if she had been searched, and told her to take her pocket out; she did so, and a parcel dropped on the ground—she put her foot on it, and drew it away—I pulled her foot away, and Brannan picked up the packet, which contained silver coin—she had some shillings on her, one of which turned out to be bad.</p>

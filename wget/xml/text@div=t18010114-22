               <p>Q. Are you able to say what man that was? - A. That man was the prisoner Riley; he then appeared very differently to what he does now, he was dirty, and had a very different appearance.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. But notwithstanding the difference, are you able to say that he is the man? - A. I am sure that Riley opened the door first; before I had time to make any answer, the other door was opened by another man, which was this unfortunate man, Nutts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You are equally sure that it was Nutts who opened the second door? - A. Yes; the prisoner at the bar, Nutts, who also presented a pistol, he had a light-coloured great coat on.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What sort of light was it? - A. I should suppose it to be a very short time before the rising of the moon, which enabled me to see them so distinctly; Nutts was the man who came up first to the horses' heads; he then came and opened the other door of the chaise, as I have described: finding myself in this unpleasant situation, and having no weapon of defence, I thought it prudent to comply with their demands; I said, have patience, do not ill-treat or abuse me, and I will give you what money I have; I immediately put my hand to my pocket, and gave him my loose money, which was three seven-shilling pieces, a half guinea, a half-crown, and some silver, I cannot say how much; among the silver I gave him a shilling, upon which were letters stamped, which I had previously by accident taken notice of, I gave it to the prisoner Riley, who was on my right hand; Riley then demanded my pocket-book, I told him I had none; Nutts said, your Bank-notes; I answered, I had none; then putting his hand upon my thigh, and feeling some papers in my pocket, he said, what is this; I answered, only papers, of no consequence to you; he said, I must see, and, taking hold of the skirt of my coat, he said, turn round, I cannot get at your pocket, at the same time making use of some vulgar expressions, which are unnecessary to state; I said, stop, sir, let me out, and then I will give you leave to search me; at the same instant Riley demanded my watch; on refusing to give it to him, he immediately jumped into the chaise; Nutts got closer to me, and began to rifle my pockets, each of them were rifling my pockets at the same time, but Riley was entirely in the chaise; the third man at this time came to the door behind Riley, he having got into the chaise, and took out a bundle of wearing-apparel that I had on the chaise-seat by my side; Riley might have taken it out, I will not swear, but it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140023"></xptr>at that time taken out; Riley then cried out, take care of the post-boy; this third man, I believe, put his hand into my right hand breeches pocket, and took out several Bank-notes previous to his leaving the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know that man again? - A. No; being so occupied with Nutts and Riley, I should not know the other man, and he being behind Riley, I again desired they would let me out; one of them said, no, where is your pocket-book, and your watch; I told them I had neither one nor the other; they, however, continued searching me; I told them they had got every thing I had, and as they had got all my money, to go about their business quietly, and, after searching round the inside of the chaise, they got out; upon the first alarm, I had availed myself of that opportunity of taking out my watch, which I had an intention of concealing, together with the notes, which I had in my other pocket; but before I had time to do either, the doors were opened as I have described; I kept the watch in my hand the whole time; my watch, therefore was saved; when Nutts had got off the step, I observed a letter which he had taken out of my coat pocket; I recollected that, besides the money it contained, it was of the utmost importance, in my opinion, to be delivered to the person, a friend of mine, to whom it was addressed; I pressed him very much to return it to me; I assured him it was of no sort of consequence to him, but that it was very material to the nobleman to whom it was addressed, to have it that night by the mail, desiring, if he doubted what I said, he had only to look to the superscription of the letter, or open it, if he pleased, that he would then be convinced; he pulled it out of his bosom, drew back a little from the door of the chaise, and held it up, and, after satisfying himself, he returned it; I immediately turned round to the other two men, who, with the notes, had taken several papers out of my pocket, and having made much the same observations with respect to those papers, that they were of no use to them, and if they did not return them, they would probably suffer severely for it, one of them immediately came to the chaise, and, putting his hand under the seat, said, where is your portmanteau; I told him I had none; he then began to feel about the cushion, I pushed his hand away, and said, you have got my money, you have got all that I have, be gone about your business, unfortunate men, I do not with to hurt you, or to that effect; they then retired, and I went back to the Adam and Eve public-house, at Hayes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this transaction have consumed? - A. I should think not less than ten minutes, perhaps more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they make any attempt at all to conceal their faces? - A. No, they had handkerchiefs on, which were up to their chins, but Nutts, holding up the letter to look at it, I discovered his countenance perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the Adam and 
               <persName id="t18010114-22-person247">Eve</persName>
             that you were robbed? - A. From what I saw after, it must be but a very short distance, I did not notice the public-house as I passed it before, I endeavoured to get assistance; I got to the public-house within a quarter of an hour, and offered twenty guineas to persons that were there, to assist in apprehending the men; some little time passed in that way, and I went on to Uxbridge; some time elapsed there also with the same endeavours, in vain; I left Uxbridge about a mile and a half, when a boy came after me, in consequence of which I returned to the public-house, where I met a person of the name of Nibbs; the constable of the place; he took me into the tap-room, which at that time was very full; I asked were the robbers were; not being answered, I turned round, and looked at some persons that were sitting upon the circular bench near the fire; I looked round, and examined their countenances very minutely, and, fixing my eyes upon the prisoner Nutts, I said, as nearly as I can recollect, well, sir, what have you to say for yourself?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time recognize having seen him before? - A. I certainly did, as being one who stopped the carriage; he replied, say, sir, I did not speak; I said, no, sir, but I shall speak to you, you are the man who stopped the chaise, and came to me; immediately after he denied my ever having seen him before; I told him it was in vain for him to deny it, for I knew him perfectly, or words to that effect; Riley, I believe, had been smoking, or had a pipe in his hand at the time, and sat nearer the fire; he asked me if I knew him; I do not recollect that I had at that time spoke to him; I told him I knew him very well; he said, you are mistaken, sir, you never saw me in your life before, nor I never saw you; I then, to the best of my recollection, asked them what they had done with my notes and my money; they very resolutely denied knowing any thing about either one or the other, and said, they did not know what I meant; I was then brought into the adjoining room, I think, by the constable, who produced what had been taken from them, the pistols and money, and I recollected the shilling particularly; I said, this is the money I gave; I returned to the tap-room with the constable, after examining the pistols, the money, and the other things, and finding the constable had not possession of the notes, I asked the prisoners what they had done with the notes; I said, it is in vain for you to deny the charge, because I not only know you, but I can swear to the money, and the best thing you can do is to confess, and enable me to pursue the man that has got the Bank-notes, it being the only chance you can possibly have of being safe; they still denied knowing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140024"></xptr>any thing of the matter; I then pulled out the letter, and held it over to Nutts, and desired him to read the superscription of that letter, and said, now, sir, are you satisfied that I know you perfectly; I think he said he could not read, or he had never learned to read, or something of that sort; I then said, I am sorry you are so obstinate, and I left the room with the constable.</p>

               <p>Q. When you were shewn into the tap-room, were they sitting amongst the rest of the company without any thing that could lead you to suppose they were prisoners? - A. Without any thing that could possibly lead me to suppose they were prisoners; I should add, that during the time they were round the chaise, they neither behaved violently, nor ill-treated me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I shall ask you but one question, and that is, how you spell your name, whether it is O'Kelly, or O'Kelly? - A. O'Kelly.</p>
               <p>- NIBBS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const.</p>
               <p>I am a constable at Hayes: on the 3d of December, about eight o'clock, I left a friend's house, near the Adam and Eve, with intent to go on the road about three quarters of a mile towards Uxbridge; just as I stepped out of my friend's house, a chaise and pair were going past on the road for Uxbridge; I was going likewise the same way; it was moon-light, but rather dull; the road happened to be very free from any body going backwards and forwards at that time, but in walking after the chaise, I could observe some people on the foot-path; I could not distinguish how many; I could hear the grinding of the wheels very distinctly, and all at once I found that to cease; I looked up, and saw it standing still, and some people about it; I heard the expression, I will blow your brains out; I supposed it to be a robbery committed, and it struck me, that with help, it might be in my power to apprehend them; I immediately ran back to the Adam and Eve public-house, where there were a number of people assembled; I told them what had happened, and asked for assistance; four immediately ran out, and some others, whom I begged to assist, but they stood inactive; I then followed the four that were gone, as fast as I could; in running after them, to my surprize, I found the four men pursuing the robbers, and running towards me; I could not cleverly distinguish one from the other, but the leading man had got a bundle under his left arm; there is a lane that leads from that road to a field, called the Adam and Eve field, close by the public-house; they took down that lane; when I got into the field, they were at the small distance of about twenty yards; I saw two distinct slashes from, as I supposed, two pistols; I still kept running down to them, and found Nutts in the custody of two of the four persons that went out in pursuit; Riley, the others had just pulled down, and they were struggling with him upon the ground; I begged of them to hold his arms close, to get his pistols from him; while struggling, they took a pistol from him, and that pistol, with another, was given to me; we then took them to the Adam and Eve public-house; there I searched them, and found two pounds upon Riley, in gold and silver, and upon Nutts, three pounds and sixpence; I then handcuffed them together, and lest them in charge with a young man, and got a man to go with a horse after the colonel; I thought he might stop at the White Horse at Uxbridge, and therefore I sent there; after I got into the house, there was another brace of pistols delivered to me by one of the people, I cannot say which, (produces the money and the pistols;) the money taken from Riley, consists of a half-guinea, three seven-shilling pieces, a half-crown, five shillings, and two sixpences; the other is two guineas, on half-guinea, two half-crowns, one shillings, and two sixpences.</p>
               <p>Col. O'Kelly. This is the shilling that I spoke of.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you recollect whether this shilling was marked on one side, or both? - A. I observed but one side; I took it in change for a Banknote.</p>
               <p>Nibbs. I saw one of the pistols taken from Riley.</p>

               <p>Q. Thought Col. O'Kelly did not see it, they were handcuffed at the time that he came in? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. That shilling has a mark upon it, that is very common? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a butcher, servant to Mr. Nibbs: I went out with the rest; I saw the three men come down the path; the first of them had a bundle under his lest arm; I went by them quite quick; after I had got by them, I turned round, and then I saw them all three take to a run; before they came to the Adam and Eve, they turned down the turning which takes you into the common field; when they got into the common field, they turned round, and snick'd their pistols, but I connot say which of them it was; while they were taking Nutts, Riley was running very fast away; I ran after him, and caught him by the coat, and down I pulled him, and as he was struggling to get up, two of them came up directly, and assisted me; upon which, there was a pistol taken from Riley out of his breeches pocket, by Richard Walker; we then brought him up to the Adam and Eve.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where they got the other pistols? - A. One was picked up by a man of the name of Hinson.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the other came from? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I went out after these men; I saw the prisoners coming; we passed them, and then they took to a run, and we followed them; they ran towards the Adam and Eve; one of them said to the other, get on; then they turned down to the left-hand into the common field; we followed them through the gate, and then we were very close together; Nutts, turned round, and said I will shoot you, and the pistol snick'd, I received no fire from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see how he held it? - A. No; I did not then; I saw the pistol of Nutts fired by him, which flashed in the pan; I then rung the pistol out of his hand, and seeing him secure, and seeing the butcher running, I thought I should stand a good chance of getting the other, Riley, and I ran after him; the butcher had got hold of the lappet of his coat, pulling him down; I joined and helped to secure him; I took one pistol out of Riley's left-hand bhreeches pocket; I gave both the pistols to Mr. Nibbs; they were taken to the Adam and Eve; they were handcuffed, one's right arm to the other's left; they sat next to each other upon the settle, when the colonel saw them.</p>
               <p> - HINSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a sawyer at Hayes: I heard an alarm; I was at home; I went out afterwards, and saw two flashes from the pistols in the common field; I was not so near as the others were; Nutts was then taken, and they were struggling with Riley; I saw a pistol drop from Riley; I picked it up, and gave it to Mr. Nibbs; I did not see the other pistol taken from Riley.</p>
               <p>Riley's defence. I was not sworn to before the Justice at all.</p>
               <p>Col. O'Kelly. Certainly, before the Magistrate, I began with believing, but knowing I must speak the whole truth, I swore positively to both of them.</p>

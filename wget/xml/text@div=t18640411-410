                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 12, Vincent-street, St. Lukes—on the evening of 1st March, about half-past 12 o'clock, the prisoner and two others met me in the street and collared me—I halloed "Police" as well as I could, but they got me down, took my coat right off, and my waistcoat went to pieces—I missed seven pence from my waistcoat, and have seen nothing of it since—the police came, and collared the prisoner while I was lying in the mud—I did not offer to fight the prisoner, I never saw him till he got hold of me.</p>

On 1st March, I heard a cry of "Murder and police," and found the prosecutor lying on his back, and the prisoner holding his coat, with two others, trying to pull it away from him, and kicking and ill-using him—his waistcoat was off—I stopped them from taking the coat away, but saw nothing of the seven pence—there was a great crowd round when I got there—there are lots of thieves about there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Mullins Flory, he lives at Harmondsworth, and keeps a beer-shop. On Thursday, 17th April, the prisoner came there about seven o'clock in the morning—I knew him before—he remained there till between five and six at night—he had gone out in the meantime, between three and four, and was away about half an hour—he came back, and went away between five and six—I went to him at a quarter-past six, and saw him in bed at his mother-in-law's, where he lives—I went to him alone because I had missed my husband's watch from the ledge by the side of the staircase, in the bed-room, by the bed—I had seen it there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185105120006"></xptr>
               <p>about twenty minutes past three in the afternoon, and missed it about a quarter or twenty minutes after five, soon after the prisoner went away the second time—during the afternoon, the prisoner and Maizzilla Hare were in my house, and no one else, from twenty minutes before three till five—I saw Mrs. Hare and the prisoner go up-stairs between three and four; they were gone four or five minutes, or not so much—they came down again—the prisoner followed Mrs. Hare down—this is the watch—Hare lodged at my house—when I saw the prisoner in bed I asked him if he knew anything of my husband's watch, and he said, "No."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Hare. I was lodging at Mrs. Flory's. I recollect the prisoner coming there that day—when I came down-stairs, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, he was in the tap-room—I went up-stairs to work in my own room—when I came down once or twice I saw him there—I came down between three and four, and we drank together—he then began in rather an unfair way, and I ran up<lb></lb>stairs, to get out of his way—I ran into Mrs. Flory's bedroom, and he ran into the bed-room—I left the room in about a minute, and ran down first, and as I ran I saw the watch—I did not notice it when I ran up—the prisoner came down in about a minute after me—he went out at the back<lb></lb>door, and came in again at the tap-room door in about a minute—he staid a few minutes, and then he said he thought he should go and have some tea; and before we had done tea the prisoner came back—that might be in about twenty minutes—he brought some eggs—he took them out of his pocket and put them on a plate on the table—Mrs. Flory and I were sur<lb></lb>prised that he could go that distance in that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long was he gone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps twenty minutes; I knew the watch was kept in the bedroom before I went there—the prisoner did not come down-stairs with me—I passed him in the room, and I went into the tap-room—Mrs. Flory came in at the back-door at the time the prisoner came down-stairs—he followed me down-stairs, but not directly after me—I ran down as quickly as I could, to get out of his clutches—I had been drinking with him, but not <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> or playing—he had been taking liberties with me, and I ran up-stairs—I closed the cellar-door after me—I ran into the bedroom, which I thought was a very improper place for him to come to—there is no door to the bedroom—I believe I am married—I live anywhere that I can get a living—I have lived at Mr. Flory's since</p>

               <p>last Michaelmas—it is the sign of the Magpie—it is very near Harmondsworth—some call it Hounslow Heath—the last time I lived with my husband was in Egham parish—I remember Mrs. Flory going out that evening to the prisoner's house, and she came back—after that f went to the prisoner's house with Mr. White and Mr. Flory—when Mr. White went up-stairs Mr. Flory was with me, and when Mr. Flory went up-stairs Mr. White was with me—we returned together to Mr. Flory's—I do not remember any one leaving the house later that evening to go the prisoner's.</p>

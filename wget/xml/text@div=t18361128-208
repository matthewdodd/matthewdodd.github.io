                  </hi>. I am a seaman belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Glamorgan</hi> of Car<lb></lb>diff. The deceased, John Lott, was mate of the <hi rend="italic">Emerald Isle</hi>—on the night of last Sunday week I was on board the brig, near Pickle-herring tier—there was a vessel between the <hi rend="italic">Glamorgan</hi> and the brig—they were in the same tier—Lott, myself, and a witness, were going on board our own ves<lb></lb>sel—we had to cross the brig the prisoner was in to get to our vessel—I went on board my own vessel, and stood on the deck—I heard a dog bark, and Lott said if the dog would bite him he would kill it—it was on board the brig—I do not know who it belonged to—the prisoner said it he struck the dog he would strike him—they then began to curse each other, and the prisoner took off his jacket—I did not hear him say any thing then—I saw his arm up, he struck at Lott—I cannot say whe<lb></lb>ther the blow reached him, but the man fell overboard and was drowned—I had not seen any blows exchanged between them—Lott was a within about two feet and a half of the the gunwale—I ran to assist, to try to save him, but he fell between the two vessels—he did not appear very drunk—he walked steadily enough, and seemed collected and sensible—he appeared to have been been drinking—I think it must have been from the blow the he fell overboard—there was no gangway up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe whether he stepped back to avoid a blow, and might have fallen over before he was struck, or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not observe that—Lott's arms were down when Lewis's were up—I was sober my<lb></lb>self—I saw the prisoner next morning at Union Hall—he said it was a bad job, and he was very sorry for it, and he cried—he owned before the policeman that he was tipsy.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say before the Coroner that you did not know whether any blow had reached him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—It was a moonlight night—the bulwark was unshipped, and there was nothing to save him from falling—he stood sideways to the vessel, the prisoner was ahead—the deceased stood <hi rend="italic">abaft</hi> of him—I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the blow to have reached him, would he have fallen in the direction he did from the blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, as there was no<lb></lb>thing to prevent him—they were facing one another, and his side rather to the gunwale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Which way was the prisoner's left hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was up—if he struck the deceased with his left hand he would have struck him towards the gunwale—he stood on the larboard side of the vessel—I never saw the deceased strike him—I was not asked before the Coroner which hand the prisoner had up—I did not observe whether the deceased struck the dog or not—the prisoner went with others in a boat to try to save the man—I did not go into the boat myself—I said so before the Coroner—we had all been drinking—I think it was his left hand the prisoner struck with, because I do not think the man would have fallen overboard if he had struck with his right hand—he would have knocked him in another direction.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Emerald Isle.</hi> On the night in question I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Glamorgan</hi>—the prisoner and deceased were on the deck of the brig—I saw Lewis pull off his jacket, lift his arm up, and strike Lott—Lott had not raised his arm to strike</p>

               <p>him—Lott fell overboard—he was standing about two feet from the gun<lb></lb>wale—it only a single blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Which hand did he strike with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His right hand, I am sure of that—I cannot say whether the blow reached Lett—if it had, it would have struck him from the water—the blow was made at his head or shoulder—they were standing near each other—Lott was <hi rend="italic">abaft</hi>—I did not notice whether he staggered before he fell—his face was turned towards the head of the ship—I was about half tipsy—the party were all fresh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it not very easy, when a bulwark is unshipped, for the mere motion of a man's body to cause him to slip off vessel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—this was a frosty night—the decks were frosty and slippery—the vessel was lying quite still and quiet—there was no wind—I cannot undertake to say whether the man fell in consequence of a blow or push or not—I went to look for the body, and two or three more came after me in a boat—I cannot say who they were—I saw the body after it was found—it was the body of John Lott.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he appear very eager to save the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the decks were very slippery—the ship was down about eighteen inches, slant with her head—she was afloat, but he cargo laid forwards—the prisoner was very much affected at this—I have known him from a boy—I never saw him out of temper with any one—I never saw the de<lb></lb>ceased swim—the tide was very strong, and drew him under the vessel's bottom.</p>

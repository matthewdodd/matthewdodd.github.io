            . On the 13th of September, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was in Skinner-street - I saw the prisoner come out of this shop; he was running towards King-street, and Jones running after him - three more came out, and ran right before him. Jones fell down - I ran and caught the prisoner - we brought him back to Mr. Light's. Mrs. Light said, "That is the boy who took the watch out of the case."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not dark? A. There was plenty of gas-light. I found 2s. on him.</p>

I am a fishmonger, of 19, Peach-street, St. George's-in-the-East—on 19th December, about 11 at night, or it might be later, I was in Peach-street, where a club of our's is held—I had been drinking—the two female prisoners came up to me, and pulled me down, and the two male prisoners came in front of me—I had received 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the society—I had a tussle, and held one of the females by her shawl, which she left in my hand, and slipped away—two or three policemen came up while I was on the ground, and took a man and woman in custody.</p>

I heard a rattle springing about 1 o'clock in the morning—I ran to the spot, and saw Connell with her shawl disordered—I saw No. 157 holding Power, and Locker holding Lovell—the prosecutor walked behind, and we took them to the station—I afterwards went to a low coffee-house in Ratcliff, and found Francis there—I had a description of her—I told her I wanted her for being concerned, with three others, in robbing a man in High-street, Shadwell—she said that she had just come from home, and had been washing all day—it was then half-past 1 in the morning—I had seen her that night, wearing a similar shawl to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw her about 4 o'clock, with the other prisoners, in High-street, Shadwell—Power and Connell live in one house, the other two prisoners sleep anywhere.</p>

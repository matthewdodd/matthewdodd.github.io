               <p>Q. Had not you seen your hat all that time? - No, I never looked for it till the Sunday afternoon; on Monday morning I went to the pawnbroker's, and he shewed me the hat; and I said it was mine, and I swore to it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner at the bar came to this house after my master; I live with captain Donaldson; the first time he came on Saturday, he came down into the kitchen, he came for some time there, and then went up to the parlour, where the hat was, I went up and when I came down I saw that the door was shut, and when I got into the room I saw a bundle laid on the table which he was certainly at.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was there any thing taken out of the bundle? - No.</p>
               <p>JAMES - sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable, I belong to the Police office in Queen-square; I found him in the kitchen of this gentleman on Friday, I searched him and found the duplicate of the hat in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. By all means I had a right to have the duplicate of the hat I had bought in the Hay-market, after paying four shillings and six pence for it, because they had a suspicion of this hat they conceived it must be that gentleman's there; I never meddled with the hat, and they cannot say that I did, except they for swear themselves. I have a few words to say. I brought this hat of a jew in the Haymarket, and gave four shillings and sixpence for it, he had told me his name was Shepherd, and that he lived in Rosemary-lane; in the afternoon afterwards I pawned it for three shillings.</p>

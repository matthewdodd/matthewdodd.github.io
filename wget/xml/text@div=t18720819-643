                  </hi>. I am an officer employed by the Mint—I live at 39, Radnor Street, St. Luke's—about 9.15 on the evening of 29th July I met the prisoner in Lambeth Walk—I pointed him out to the officers who were with me, and they took him in custody—I told him who I was, and that I had a search warrant for him; that he was suspected of dealing with counterfeit coin—I said "Where do you live?"—he said "Up there"—I said "Where?"—he said "I have got no home"—I said "I will find one"—I took him to 3, China Walk—on entering the door he requested to go to the closet—I procured a light—I saw Inspector Hoskinson remove a loose board in the floor and take out this piece of paper, which he handed to me—before I opened it the prisoner said "I know nothing of that" or "them"—I found in it nine counterfeit half sovereigns, wrapped separately in paper, as they now appear—we took the prisoner up stairs to the second-door front room—I was present when Sergeant Kenwood took from the cupboard an iron saucepan containing white metal, which had been melted, a lid of a tin containing blacking, a piece of a brush, a file, and some copper wire, some of which had been dipped in solution—I afterwards received from Rodgent his galvanic battery (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and this piece of wire, which has been dipped in solution—the battery is complete—I also received two bottles, one containing cyanide of silver and the other nitric acid—all those implements are used for making and colouring counterfeit coin—I also found some plaster of Paris in powder, white sand, some rosin, and a piece of antimony, which is used to increase the weight of the coin, and to give it a clear ring—the following day I accompanied the officers back to the same room, and saw one of them find under an image on the mantel-shelf these two pieces of silver, which have been in acid, and almost reduced to nothing.</p>

I was with Brannan—I took the prisoner, searched him, and found some good money on him—I afterwards went to 3, China Walk—I handed the prisoner over to Sergeant Rodgent—I went into the closet, and found under the floor nine counterfeit half-sovereigns—the prisoner said he knew nothing of them—I saw Sergeant Kenwood find the articles mentioned by Brannan in the second floor front room—I saw two heavy deal boards which fitted between the bedstead and the door so as to make it impossible to open the door—it also formed a table—the room looked like a bedroom—I showed the things to the prisoner the next morning, and asked him whether he knew anything about them—he said "Yes, I know something about them, but I know nothing about the coins.</p>

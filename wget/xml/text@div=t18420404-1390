On the 25th of March I noticed some lead was taken off the roof of the water-closet of a house belonging to Mr. Strother, at Shooter's-hill—I examined the roof—the lead had been cut by some sharp instrument—I have com<lb></lb>pared some lead with what remained on the building, and am satisfied it is part of what had been on the premises—it fitted in every direction with what remained on the water-closet.</p>

On the 25th of March I saw the prisoner in the Bull public-house, at Shooter's-hill, between six and seven o'clock in the morning—I had seen him the night before on the lawn in front of the premises the lead was stolen from—there had been a sale there, and he assisted in moving articles from the sale.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 26, Upper Park-place, Marylebone—on Friday morning, the 14th of last month, I went into the Leaping Bar public-house in Old Street-road—I there saw the two prisoners with another man—I had a glass of porter—the men asked me to give them some tobacco; I offered them some out of this pocket, and they said they wanted some out of this; there was a screw in one and half an ounce in the other, and they wanted it from the one with the half-ounce—I then went out; they followed me out, touched me on the shoulder and asked me if I was going to give them some tobacco—Fiunity that put his arm round my waist—I threw my arms up, and then Lane caught hold of me; they threw open my waistcoats and coat—I had two waiftooats on at the time—they opened ny pockets and took out a half a crown, a two-shilling piece, two shillings, and three six-pences, a knife, and a key; one sixpence was left in my pocket—they then let me fall backwards, and my hat fell off, and I caught my head against the kerbstone, and I fell on this arm, which was very bad for two or three weeks—they then ran away—I endeavoured to catch them, but could not see them—I went back to the public-house and stated that I had been robbed, and then I went to the station-house and gave information—I there described the three men to a constable—I was taken to the police-station soon afterwards, on the same morning, and there saw Lane—on the Sunday night I saw Finnity—I was quite sober on the night I was robbed.</p>

Q.</hi> What time do you say I was in Mr. Short's public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps a quarter past 1—I was not drunk—there were several people in the public-house—you drank up part of my pint of beer, and I would not lake any more—there were some females there; I knew nothing about them—you followed me out directly—you put your hand in my pocket—Finnity put one arm round my neck.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Leaping Bar public-house in Old-street, St. Luke's—I remember the prosecutor being in my house about I in the morning of 14th March—the prisoners were also there; they were there nigh upon I—the prosecutor came back after he left.</p>

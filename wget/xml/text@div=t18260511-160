I lost this property on the 6th of May, between the Saturday night and Sunday morning; I had dined at the West end of the town, and got very much intoxicated; I took a coach to return, and stopped with it at the King's Arms, public-house, Holborn; they knew me there, and wanted me to stop all night, which I refused - I came out, and expect I must have been picked up by this woman, but I cannot tell; I found myself next morning in bed, in <placeName id="t18260511-160-crimeloc918">Wellington-court, Drury-lane</placeName>

I told her I had lost some money, but I did not say what, and my watch. I was for going out, but they persuaded me from it, and said I should get no assistance that night. I gave information next morning.</p>

            . I live in Wellington-court. On the 6th of May, about twelve o'clock in the evening, the prisoner, whom I had never seen before, brought the prosecutor there - he appeared sober, and asked for a lodging for the night; I shewed her the room up stairs, and she asked what was the price of it for the night; I said "Half-a-crown;" she asked the gentleman for it, and he gave it to her - she then called me up again, and said she was thirsty, and wished me to get a pot of beer - he gave her half-a-crown to get that - I got it, took her the change, and she gave me 6d.; she came down again and said she was poorly, and asked me where to go - I showed her; she came in again and said she was thirsty, and wanted some more porter - I said she could not want any more - I then went away; soon afterwards a woman went up stairs, and told me the door of their room was open; I went up and found the gentleman in bed with his clothes off - I asked if he had lost any thing - he searched his pockets, and said he had; I did not see the prisoner again till the Wednesday night, when I pointed her out to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110062"></xptr>officer; she told me, when she took the room, that she meant to stay all night.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday afternoon the prosecutor said he had been robbed of a great deal of property - he said he did not know the numbers of the notes, but I should find a name written over the number, some with pencil and some with ink; I made inquiry, and on the Wednesday I went with him and a brother officer to a house No. 14, Cold-bath-square, kept by Edward Hill; the prisoner came out at the back door, with a little boy, and a large bundle on his head; my brother officer stopped her, and took her into the parlour, but found nothing on her - Hill opened a bureau, and took out this 5l. note, and three sovereigns; I asked the prosecutor if that note was part of his property - he looked and said it was- we found some property which the prisoner had purchased.</p>

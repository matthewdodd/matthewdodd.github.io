               <p>Q. What time did you return. - A. I returned about five o'clock, I went into Mr. Walton's house, then they told me that I had been robbed and that my place was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. You found your place broken open. - A. Yes; the window was broken; he had got in by lifting up the sash; he broke the window all to pieces in getting out; it is a large sash; I found my door safe, the key was in my pocket. In the drawers there were a pair of sheets, five gowns, three petticoats, a shift, a pair of stockings, and a silk handkerchief, they were all taken out.</p>

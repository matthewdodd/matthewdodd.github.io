             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a private in the East London Militia: On the 19th of April, I went with Mr. Wightman, a constable, to the house where the prisoners lived, in<placeName id="t18000528-131-crimeloc760"> Cock-court, Snow-hill</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When Joyce was apprehended, there was a great deal of bad money found upon him? - A. No, it was all good.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present during this transaction? - A. Nobody but me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the whole rests upon you - what are you? - A. A soldier.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280114"></xptr>Q. Have you ever been a smasher before? - A. No, I can take my sacrament oath I never was.</p>
               <p>Q. You being a soldier, you thought it was your duty to protect the public, and therefore you went to buy this bad money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no acquaintance with the woman before you saw Coleman? - A. I had not; Mr. Coleman gave me the money to buy it; Tony, a soldier in the same regiment, directed me to the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. How often has he been prosecuted for smashing? - A. I don't know.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you expect for coming here to-day? - A. I do not expect any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Let that be taken down? - A. I don't know whether I shall have any thing or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have been attending here ever since the first day of the Sessions, and expect to have your expences paid? - A. Yes, I hope so.(John Coleman, and John Wightman, confirmed the evidence of the last witness).(Mr.

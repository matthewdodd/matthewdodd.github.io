                  </hi>. I reside at Surbiton, and have a shop at No. 416, Strand. On the night of 9th Oct. I left the shop, but did not see to the fastenings; I never do—there were in the shop India rubber coats, and so on—on my arrival, at about half past 10 o'clock on the following morning, my attention was called to the shop; it had been broken open—several drawers had been <hi rend="italic">prised</hi>, but not opened—the goods had been carried out across the leads, and down a staircase into the front passage—I missed twelve alpaca coats, fourteen India rubber coats, some railway wrappers and a strap—these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine—I saw them safe the night before—they are worth about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know this strap by the writing on it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector, E</hi>). On 19th Oct, at half past 11 o'clock, I went into Fox-court, Gray's-inn-lane, in plain clothes, and shortly afterwards Philby Fish came through the court—I took hold of him, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Phil, I</hi> want you for the robbery in the Strand"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "That will not do for me, I must search your lodging"—he walked on to No. 9, Holborn-buildings, and I by his side—he went up stairs, stopped at the back room on the first floor, knocked at the door three times, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Nell, Nell, Nell!</hi>"—no answer was returned, and he said to a woman who was lodging in the next room, "Lend me your key, will you?"—she said, "My key well not fit your room"—I directed sergeant Chown, who was with me, to break open the door—he did so—Fish went in and said, "This is my room, do what the b—h—you like"—Chown searched the room, and under the top covering of the bed he found these two rugs and strap—I then took him into custody, and when we got into Holborn, I was in the act of putting him into a cab, when six or seven thieves surrounded me, and the prisoner kicked me violently on the legs, and threw himself on the ground—I was obliged to take out my pistol before I could get clear of them—I searched him, and found 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—next morning I placed him between two or three other men, and M'Evoy picked him out, and he picked out the others in the same way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stone dresser, and live at No. 9, Husband-street, St. James's. On this morning, at 6 o'clock, I went to work in front of Mr. Edmiston's shop, and at about 10 minutes past 6 o'clock saw the pri<lb></lb>soners come out, Philby Fish first, Herbert next, and then Roberts, who carried a bundle—I had not known them before; I am sure they are the men—I identified them at the station from among a number of constables in plain clothes—they were not two yards from me—it was light.</p>

               <p>I could have apprehended them, but I thought they were some of the shop<lb></lb>men come out of the place, or some one belonging to the premises—what drew my attention to them was this: on the day before, when I wads dress<lb></lb>ing a stone, the shopboy came out and began to beat a mat close to my face, and I thought I was going to have the same again—I have only seen Checkley once since the prisoners were committed, nor yet any of the other officers.</p>

We went with him to his sister's room in Drury-Lane, there he took out the lock from a drawer and gave it to me, and it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I served that master ten years and three months, and I took this lock on purpose to learn my business.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you engage to teach him to make locks?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No: I did not, I make iron chests: locks is another branch: I do not make locks.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not you say you would forgive me, if I would tell you where the lock was?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Upon my oath I never told him any such thing. I said, I am sorry I am oblig'd to come after you in this manner: the less trouble you give me, the better it will be for you. He began to be in a passion, and gave me bad language, and said there where more locks in England than mine. At last, he told me he had taken it, and it was at his sister's room.</p>

                  </hi> I am warehouseman to William Cook and others. On the 11th of Oct. the prisoner brought this order for a piece of a silk, re<lb></lb>sembling the pattern that was enclosed—the order was not a very business like thing, and I had my doubts about its genuineness—I asked if he was known to any party in our establishment—he said, "No"—I then showed him a piece a silk, the nearest we had to this pattern, and asked if he thought it would do—he said if it was the nearest we had he would take it—I took him and the silk to the entering-room, gave the silk to the entering-clerk, and told him, if he thought the order was not right, he was to go to Mr. Cook, and ask his opinion—I stood by the prisoner while the entering-clerk asked him if he was known in the house—he said, "No"—it was then proposed that the silk should be sent over in the evening by our cart—the distance is about a mile and a quarter—the prisoner objected to that, and said he was to take it with him—I took the order to one of the firm, who</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184710250017"></xptr>
               <p>came and asked the prisoner the same question that I and the clerk had asked him—the entering-clerk proposed sending a man with him at once—he objected, and said he was himself to take the goods—we objected to let his have them—he wished to have the order and pattern back again; that was objected to, and he left—we detained the pattern and order—I took the silk to Mr. Bone, in the Borough, and made inquiries—the silk was worth nine guineas—(<hi rend="italic">order read</hi>—"Oct. 11, 1847.—Gentleman, Please send by bearer one piece of silk to match, as near as possible, this pattern.

                  </hi> I am in the employ of Cook, Sons and Co., of St. Paul's-churchyard. I have seen the prisoner twice, the first was on Saturday the 11th—he and Osborne came down from the silk-room into the entering-room—I saw the order in Osborne's hand, and also after he gave it up to one of the entering men—I did not read it; I should know it again—to the best of my knowledge this produced is it, and this is the piece of silk—I have no doubt of the prisoner being the man, he is differently dressed now.</p>

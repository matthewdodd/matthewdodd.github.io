                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable No</hi>, 425.) On the 22nd of Oct., I saw the prosecutor, and went with him to different places, and at last found the prisoner in a court in Aldersgate-street—he said, "I know no<lb></lb>thing about the man's watch; I have no watch of the man's; if you will go with me, I will soon satisfy you about it; the fellow wanted to swindle me out of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said. "I have two or three respectable witnesses"—I went with him to Shaftesbury-place, and found two young men and a woman there—the prisoner said, calling on the young man, "Does not this fellow owe us 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?" or words to that effect—I said, "We do not want any of this fuss or bother, come down to the station and settle it there"—they denied that they had the prosecutor's watch—the prisoner went on to say he was a respectable man—he defied me to take him, saying</p>

               <p>it was a charge that I had no business with—I went towards him and said, "Whether or not, you must go with me"—he opened a drawer and drew a watch out—I asked him to let me look at it—he said, "There is the watch; but no man shall have it till I have my 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him to give it me to look at, but he refused—I then took him to the station—he said on the way that he was a respectable watchmaker; that it was an affair I had nothing to do with, and he would get me discharged from the police—I told the inspector that he had the watch in his pocket, and he ordered him to give it up—he refused—the inspector ordered me to search him—I went towards him, and he drew it from his pocket and gave it me—I took him to Guildhall—the case was brought before Mr. Alderman Wood, and the watch was handed to the sergeant by some one from the bench—this is it—the prisoner said he had sold the prosecutor's watch to the mate or steward of a West Indiaman for three halfcrowns, and that it was a worthless thing—he repeatedly said that.</p>

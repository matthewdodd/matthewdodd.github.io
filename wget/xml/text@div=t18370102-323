               <p>Frodsham, in Gracechurch-street. The prisoner was in our service for a year and a half—we received some gold chains from Dugard and Son' of Clerkenwell—on the 22nd of November, I delivered to the prisoner five gold chains to be returned to Dugard and Sons, and I did not see him again till he was in custody—they had been sent to us on approbation—I be<lb></lb>lieve the prisoner has occasionally been with us since 1826—my father has known him about twenty-five years, he was a schoolmaster, and I was educated under him, but he was much reduced in circumstances, and my father took him into his employ—he has frequently been entrusted with considerable property.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long had this lad been employed in the office? A. I suppose from five to six months - he continued to come there after the property was lost, and was taken into custody on the Saturday, at his father's house; I think the iron safe belongs to the Company; the different clerks deposit money there - I did not collect this money as a clerk, but as an agent myself; I did not deposit it there on account of the Company - I pay it over perhaps five or six months after; the marked sovereigns had been there more than a month - nobody but myself took money from that box; I took the key of the box away in my pocket - Mr. Tolkein had the key of the safe; Tolkein put the box into the safe after I had locked it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the cash-box belong to the Company or yourself? A. It had been lent to me by the secretary; it belonged to the Company - I had not accounted to the secretary for the money in the box; the secretary deposits money in the safe.</p>

            . I am chief clerk at the Norwich Union office. I remember putting Mr. Boutillier's cash-box into the safe on the 13th of July - I locked it up with two boxes which I am in the habit of depositing there every evening; I believe the prisoner was there at the time - he was there till four o'clock; I left Mr. Boutillier, the prisoner, and another clerk in the office - Mr. Pleas, I believe, was likewise present; on the following morning, as soon as I put the key to the safe, the folding doors opened of themselves - I found it was unlocked; I sent for Mr. Marriott, who examined the lock in my presence - I found my two boxes there, but Mr. Boutillier's was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you locked the safe you put the key into your pocket? A. Yes - it was a small key, and had never been out of my possession; it was the key of the inner door - the outer doors were left open; the inside is fitted up with iron doors, and the upper part is fitted up for books: the junior clerks have access to the books, and we consider it not necessary to lock the outer doors - the key of the outer door is kept in a drawer; I believe Mr. Pleas had that key - I did not tell him he might have it; I believe the secretary had told him so - that key was deposited in a drawer next the iron safe; the secretary residing on the premises takes care of that key - the outer door was not locked before I left the office; I left Mr. Pleas there, and believe he had that key - my box remained.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was Mr. Boutillier's cash box locked up in the same place as yours? A. Yes, and the key of the inner door was never out of my possession; the cash boxes were locked up as safe as if there had been no outer door - the key of the outer door would not open the inner.</p>
               <p>MR. MARRIOTT. I am an ironmonger, and live in Fleet-street. I was sent for to the office immediately on this robbery being discovered; I examined the locks of the inner safe - the doors were put too, and I was asked to look at them to form an opinion by what means they had been opened - I examined with a candle, and said there were marks of some instrument I found they opened; I took the lock off, and found part of the lock broken off, and marks where an instrument had been employed - it could not have been done with the proper key.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The key of the outer door was left with you? A. Yes - the other clerks left at four o'clock; I went out for a short time, leaving the prisoner there - I believe he was at work at his books; I was certainly not out more than a quarter of an hour - I was waiting at the private door when I saw him, and we went in together; he went to copy a policy - I went away for a very short time again, and left him writing something in the office, and found him doing the same when I came back; I saw him out of the office when I left - he lives in Chenies-street, Tottenham-court-road; when I locked the outer doors of the safe the inner doors appeared locked.</p>

His sister did - I do not know whether she was there on the day this happened; I cannot say whether she was there while I was - if she had come to the place the safe was in, while I was in the office, I think I must have seen her; I was absent about ten minutes.</p>

            . I went with Mr. Cope and my brother to search this house in Chenies-street. I found twenty-nine sovereigns behind the skirting, on the stairs, and with a pitchfork, in the privy, I pulled up the bottom of the tin box, and then the top, but the interior was produced by another person - I apprehended the prisoner at Spittle's livery-stables, in Frances-street; he was standing there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That was very near where his father lived? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a performer at the theatre in Tottenham-street. I have a slight acquaintance with the prisoner - he overtook me in a gig at Pimlico, on the 13th of July, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; I got into the gig and rode with him to the Red House at Battersea, and while there he offered to lend me 5l. or 10l. - he pulled a handful of sovereigns out of his waistcoat-pocket; he seemed to have about fifteen, and he produced the interior part of a cashbox from under the seat of the gig - it fell from the seat as he was sitting on it; it was empty - I said, "What have you got that for;" he said, "I have been to buy it, but it won't answer the purpose I want it for - if it is of any service to you you may have it" - I said it would answer many purposes I could put it to; we took it to the Red House - we had some stout, and as I was returning I was carrying it under my arm; he said I need not carry it in such a public place - I said, "I am not ashamed of it;" I carried it to my house, and produced it before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he ever offer to lend you money before? A. Never - I had seen him but twice; I only intended to ride about one hundred yards with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100112"></xptr>him, but he got me to go over to the Red House - I did not take any money from him.</p>
               <p>MR. LE BOUTILLIER. I have examined this cash-box; it is exactly the same as mine - this interior part is exactly like the one I lost; there is no mark on it - here are eight of the sovereigns which I am certain are the same as were marked for me by Howell; this paper is my hand-writing, and is the same as I left in the cashbox - (reads) "Coach 3s. 6d. Pleas 8s. 6d."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell what is the mark on the sovereigns without looking at them? A. A dot made with this instrument.</p>
               <p>MR. HOWELL. These eight sovereigns are exactly like those I marked - I have no doubt about them myself; I identified them at Witt's house - at the time they were found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They have the same dot on them? A. Exactly the same - they could only be marked the same by the same description of instrument; it was a broken instrument.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you that broken instrument here? A. Yes, it corresponds; if one was marked now with it, it would be exactly the same.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Has that instrument been out of your possession since? A. Yes (here the witness marked a sovereign with it); I delivered to Mr. Boutillier the sovereigns I marked, and saw him put them in his box.</p>
               <p>MR. LE BOUTILLIER. I had to use the cash-box every day, and continually kept the sovereigns at the bottom of it - I am certain there were marked sovereigns at the bottom of the box; I had seen Mr. Howell mark them - they had been there from the time they were marked; the box was deposited in the safe every night.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you see them the day they were missed? A. Yes - I did not take them out, but saw they were there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This paper, which is said to have been found in a box in my bed-room, is said to have been in the cash-box at the time of the robbery; now there is a drawer in the office at the left side of Mr. Boutillier's desk, which contains waste-paper - it was put there for wastepaper a month or three weeks before the robbery; I took it out of the drawer: it was larger than it is now - I made a memorandum on it, tore it in two, took the piece I made the memorandum on, and put the other into my pocket, and at night I make it a rule to lock up every thing I have in my box - if I had committed the robbery, is it likely I should have returned every day to the office and be cross-examined as I was twice - I solemnly declare, before every body here, I am as innocent as you are yourselves.</p>
               <p>MR. LE BOUTILLIER. I am certain the memorandum was in the cash-box locked up with the cash at the time I put it in the safe on Monday evening; the memorandum was a recent thing - it might have been in existence about a fortnight before. I had a drawer in which I kept waste-paper about three months ago.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was not the paper on which you made the memorandum larger than it is now? A. How can I say that; it is the very same paper and is the same size as it was then, I think - I will not swear I did not make the memorandum on half a sheet of paper - How can I tell?</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is that paper in your hand writing? A. It is; the 3s. 6d. might have been laid out a fortnight before - Pleas had paid me some money and this was the balance; he had paid it me since Midsummer: it was about some rent - he might have paid it me a fortnight after Midsummer - I never wrote the memorandum on any other piece of paper, and it was in the box on the 13th of July; I used to keep my cash in the drawer near my seat, and from time to time I found a deficiency in that drawer - it was a drawer for general purposes and waste-paper; I never put the memorandum in that drawer - the drawer is there still.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the box regularly replaced in the safe every night, or left at Islington? A. It was always in the safe; I kept it there not at Islington.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. TOLKEIN. Q. When the office hours are over, is that part of the office appropriated to the business locked up so as to prevent Mr. Bunyon from going into it? A. No; it is accessible to him or any of his family.</p>
               <p>Eleven witnesses deposed to the prisoner's good character.</p>

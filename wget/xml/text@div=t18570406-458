                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Muncaster and Warre, pawnbrokers, Skinner Street, Snow Hill. On the evening of 20th March the prisoner came to our shop about a quarter past 6 o'clock, and offered a Bible in pledge—I asked him who it belonged to—he said it was his property—I asked if he dealt in Bibles or books—he said he did, he was a dealer in them—I then asked if he was a binder—he said, "Yes"—I said it was rather unusual for binders of books to deal in them, especially books of that kind, and I asked him whether it really did belong to him, or whether he was bringing it for some one else—he then asked me to give him the book again—I refused to do so—he said if I would give it him back, he would really feel thankful, that he had taken it from his master's stock, and he merely wished to raise a temporary loan upon it, and it was his intention to replace it in the stock again—I then said that I had seen him in the shop before, and asked if he had pledged any with us previously—he said he had, and that he had two in pledge—I asked him what they were in for, and I then told him that I felt it to be my duty to give him in charge to the police—I went to the door to look for a policeman—I was some little time in finding one, in the mean time the prisoner escaped from the side door—at that moment the policeman came up and took him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the Bible—I also produce a Prayer Book, pledged on 7th March, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a Church Service on the 12th, for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was what the prisoner asked upon them.</p>

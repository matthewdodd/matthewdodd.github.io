               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. You turned round and saw somebody near you? A. It was the prisoner; there might be one hundred or one hundred and fifty people in the booth, but nobody except the prisoner was near me, for I did not like to trust my children in the crowd, who were following the keeper, as he gave a description of the beast - I explained them to my children myself; the prisoner's hand was in my pocket - I felt it there; I did not see it in my pocket - I saw his face: I cannot say whether he went out of the booth, but he disappeared in an instant; I cannot say whether he ran, for the child, being on my shoulder, was a total eclipse to me. When I went to inquire at the door for an officer, the people said "People who come to the fair, must take care of themselves."</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son, and am eleven years old: my little brother was on my father's shoulder - the prisoner was talking to us, and telling us the nature of the wild beast - we were looking at the elephant and he was walking round us for a good bit; my father turned round and caught his hand pretty nearly close to his pocket - I am sure it was his hand, nobody else was near; the people were quite on the other side of the booth - I did not know the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many people's hands were pretty near your pockets that night? A. I saw none but the prisoner's - we were quite away from the crowd; the prisoner was on my father's left side, drawing his hand from his pocket - I saw that.</p>

            . Before I took him, I asked my son if he should know him; he said Yes, and as I came out of the booth, I felt a touch at my pocket; I turned round and seized the prisoner, and in about two minutes I was surrounded by eight or ten persons, and thought I should have been overpowered by them - he declared he was nothing but a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you to say, you should keep him, for the other you had lost? A. I said no such thing: immediately I seized him, he said "It was not me you have made some mistake, I am a gentleman;" I said I would keep him till I had proof that he was so, for he was the person whose hand was in my pocket - that was the second attempt.</p>

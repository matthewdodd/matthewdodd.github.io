            . I was going across the Ambury, Westminster, on Monday morning, the day after the robbery. The prisoner, and one Williamson, were in the watch-house. A man met me, and informed me there was a soldier had some seals of a watch, that a man had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130010"></xptr> robbed of in the Five Fields the night before. I asked him who the soldier was, and he shewed me the prisoner. I searched his pockets, and the lining of his coat, but could not find the seals. Then the man told me, he believed he had put them in his breeches. I searched his breeches, and found them.</p>

            . I am a watchman in St. James's-street, Westminster. About a quarter after four in the morning, the prosecutor, and one Williamson. came down the street together. The pursuer said, he had been robbed of a guinea; and he gave charge of Williamson as being in company with a soldier who had robbed him. His neckcloth and face were very bloody. I locked them both up in St. Margaret's watch-house.</p>

            . I keep the King's Head, the corner of the Five Fields, Chelsea. The prosecutor came to my house, and asked for a pint of beer. He seemed very sober, and well dressed. He said, he would not detain me; and, before the beer was drawn, he had a glass of peppermint. In the mean time, the prisoner and Williamson came in, and asked for a pint of beer. They pushed into the bar, and sat down. There the prosecutor took out a guinea, and some silver. He paid me for the pint of beer and glass of peppermint, and then put the money again into his pocket. This was before the robbery. I then advised him to go home, and told him, one Mrs. Becket and my maid should see him home; for, in my own mind, I did not like the looks of these two men, though I said nothing. He said, no, he would not have any women go home with him, and he went out. The prisoner went out after him, and the other man followed.</p>

The prosecutor was there. Foster and the prisoner talked of going further to have some more beer. The prosecutor went out first, and the prisoner followed him. They went towards Chelsea. I said, I would go no further, for there were no more houses open. I went out just after, and saw them down on the ground before me.</p>

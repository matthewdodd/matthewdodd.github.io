                  </hi>. I am a butcher, at 78, Minories. I had a hamper of champagne in my cellar, containing four dozen pints; and another in the counting-house, containing two dozen and two or three quarts, and about a dozen and nine pints—on Friday, 2nd July, I discovered the wicker of the hamper in the cellar was open—I put my hand in, and discovered it was</p>

               <p>empty, with the exception of five pints—the prisoner has been in my service four or five months—she came at 7 o'clock in the morning, and went when she had done her work—I put the five pints in, looked again on the following Sunday, and there were only four—on the Monday I found the hamper in the counting-house was nearly empty—I sent for a policeman, and in his presence charged the prisoner with the theft, and accused her of taking the one pint—she denied it—I told her to say if she had taken it, for the sake of the old gentleman, my clerk, who came there—she denied it most posi<lb></lb>tively; and said I had been so kind to her, I was the last man she would rob—I then gave her into custody—she asked me if I would accompany her through the streets to her lodging, in preference to the policeman—I did so, and found two empty champagne bottles, with the labels on them—it was worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a dozen.</p>

On 5th July I was called in by the prosecutor—he called the prisoner into the counting-house, said he had lost several dozens of wine, and no one had access to it except the little boy and the prisoner, and he felt persuaded the prisoner must have stolen it—she said she had not touched it—he told her he should have her locked up, and have her room searched—she begged of him not to have me to search the room, but to go himself—Mr. Hancock went with her to her house, and I followed—when Mr. Hancock came out again, he brought this bottle, and I took the prisoner to the station—she begged of Mr. Hancock not to lock her up; said she would pay for the wine, and said she drank it, thinking it was either pale ale or cider—I went to her room afterwards, and found this other bottle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

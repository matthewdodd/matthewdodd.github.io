             I am shopman to the prosecutor. I was in the shop on the 27th January, between eight and nine, with another person named Jenkins, and I saw a man come to the door, and put his arm in and snatch two waistcoats. He had on a sort of fustain or carpenter's jacket; and seeing him take the waistcoats, I called out, and a person followed him. I ran out immediately, and found the waistcoats in two several places. The farthest was not more than six yards from the door, and the nearest about four yards, or four and a half. I did nothing more, as there was nobody else to attend to the shop.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Moore's shop. I was conversing with the shopman, and he called out to me, "the waistcoats!" and I looked round, and saw the waistcoats moving. I only saw one man running. I went to the door immediately, and saw one waistcoat lie. and a man running. I saw another waistcoat drop from his person about six or seven yards from the shop. I pursued the man and took him. I took him almost immediately, for he stumbled over a step. He had not gone a dozen yards. It was the prisoner. I took him back to Mr. Moore's shop. (Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I am a basket-maker, of High Street, Romford—on 4th February, I had taken too much drink, and was in Whitechapel—I was knocked down about 12 o'clock at night, and lost a silver watch, a gold chain, about fourteen shillings in silver, and my hat—I saw the prisons next morning, but cannot say whether he was one of the persons—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have not seen my chain, hat, or money since.</p>

I saw Chapman in Whitechapel Road stupidly drunk and sitting on the kerb—I tried to help him up, and two young chaps liften him up, and told me that they would see him righted—the prisoner is one of them—I left him with them, and watched them, thinking they were one to no good—they walked 2 or 3 yards, knocked him down, got what they the wanted out of his pockets, and then left him—I called policeman 210, who chased them, but fell against the kerb, and hallooed "Stop thief!"—they ran as fast as they could up Mary Street, and I joined, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner taken—I fell down, and lost sight of him, but I got up again say and him caught by Policeman 176.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Four of these were for fringe, one for</hi> 28 <hi rend="italic">gross of buttons, and one for</hi> 100 <hi rend="italic">waterproof Ulsters.</hi>) All those goods were forfeited, and sold by us in 28 dajs—there was nothing to return to the defendant; we lost 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on all the transactions we had with him.</p>

I am appointed trustee of this estate, and produce the bankrupt's books—at page 28 of the sold ledger Messrai Coles and Co., of High Street, Cardiff, are debited with 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for goods supplied; 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth in March and 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 30th April, and by the books that amount appears to be still due—the entry is at the top of a page, and does not appear to be in the same writing as the other entries—on 30th March, 1878,1 find in the day-book an entry of 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., bat it is in the ledger of 30th March, 1879, entered at the bottom of a page, and at the end of the month in a blank space—the 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is entered in the day-book in 1878, at the end of a month, but it entered in the ledger of 1879—at page 54 of the sold ledger here is J. Wilkins, of Cardiff, 31st May, goods 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and June 6th, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., total 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that appears in the day-book on 31st May, 1878, the bottom item but one on a page, because after that comes Tilley, on 31st May—they tally so far—in the sold ledger is R. W, Tilley, May 31, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have realised nothing from the estate.</p>

I am warehouse boy in this office—I recollect a sewing-machine coming there, it went away on 1st March—I took it to Norman and Sons—the defendant told me to do so because the brokers were in the I house—I generally unpacked the cloth goods when they came; sometimes they were made up and taken away, and sometimes they were taken away to Norman and Sons before they were made up.</p>

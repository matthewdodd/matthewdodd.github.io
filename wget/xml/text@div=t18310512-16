             - he was walking along very slowly, with his hat in his hand; I saw three men approaching him behind- they were before me: when they approached Davies one of them, (I cannot swear which) put his hands on the back of his shoulders, and gave him a gentle push, so that he fell down on his face; he laid straight with his face on the pavement - when he was on the ground they all three, as with one accord, turned him over on his back - I then saw his pockets rifled, and some halfpence fell out, shattered on the pavement: the three men were close to him at the time, all round his person - I can swear to the two prisoners being two of the men that were round the prosecutor; the three men stooped to pick up the halfpence off the pavement - I saw no money except the halfpence; they then walked off, at least I do not know exactly whether they walked or ran - they did not go fast; a Policeman came across the road - I told him of it, and pointed out the three men; I never lost night of them from the time I saw them go from the prosecutor till I told the Policeman - he followed them, and I went with him; I saw him take the two prisoners - I had not lost sight of them; a watchman came up after the Policeman seized the prisoners, and he assisted in taking them to the station - the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120025"></xptr>third man ran away down Plough-yard; I saw the prisoners searched, and some halfpence and other money was taken from one or both of them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is the length of the street in which you saw this transaction? A. It was in Shoreditch, which is a long street; it was not near the end - the prisoners did not turn any corners before they were taken - I do not know why I did not cry Police! or Watch! it was no amusement to me - I was sober; Harknett did not go without my resistance - he did not attempt to ill - use any one, but he made use of very threatening language to me; he said in the morning that he would serve me out; the prosecutor fell down in his way to the station, and I helped him up - I did not see Harknett help him up; I think he could not have assisted him up without my seeing him; I would not swear it did not happen, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. How came you out at that time? A. A lady came to see my grandfather, who was very ill, and is since dead; I went to see her home - the prosecutor was pushed down; but he fell of his own accord, when he got very near the station; Williams went very quietly, for what I saw - I did not see the Policeman till he crossed; he came over very soon after the men had gone on.</p>

            . I now live in Rose-lane, but I lived on Saffron-hill at that time. A month ago to-day I was on my way home, in Shoreditch - I had gone a few yards past Plough-yard; there were three men, who let me just pass them, and in the course of two or three minutes I was pushed down right upon my face, and it grazed all the side of my face upon the pavement - they rifled my pockets of an ounce of tobacco, within a couple of pipes, two shillings, and 6d. or 9d. in halfpence; I know there were two shillings, which I had had given me, and which I had never touched - the tobacco was in one waistcoat pocket, the silver in the other, and the halfpence were in my breeches pocket - I identified the prisoners the next morning, and said, "You are the two gentlemen;" I did not particularly observe either of the men who were about me- there was one on one side, and the other on the other; that is all I can say, and I felt them riffing - I had a glimpse of their faces; I could swear to them as soon as I saw them the next morning - the prisoners are the two men; I never said to the contrary, and if it was wrong I would not say it - I was groaming, and the Policemen came up before ever they could make their exit - they caught two of them; as soon as I got up there was a tall Policeman there; I felt my pockets the moment I got up, and said, "My money is all gone;" I had not a sixpence or a halfpenny left.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite correct about that - did not you afterwards find some of your halfpence in your pocket? A. No, I was fairly cleaned out; I did not find 2d. or more, to my knowledge, and I never related any such thing before the magistrate - I might say so, but I am sure I cannot remember it, in my florry; I was stunned - my tobacco was in whitey-brown paper, which will be produced; the prisoners are dressed in a different kind of way now, so that I cannot exactly recognize them, as I could on the first examination; one of them had a fustian jacket on, neither of them have it now, but to the best of my belief, it was Williams; I am a Welchman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Shoreditch is a long way from Saffron-hill? A.Very good Sir, we know it is - I cannot say what distance it is; I suppose it is about two miles - it was rather a late hour for me to be out; I had been in company and had had a drop, but I knew what I was about - I was not exactly compus menlis; I was what we call rather fresh - less, perhaps, would have been better- I had a very slight glimpse of them; I was frightened- it was enough to frighten any man; I was hurt, and my face was grazed - there was a watchman and two Policemen, or three, about me when I got up - I think there were three Policeman, to the best of my knowledge; they were dressed in their uniform - I could not mistake a gentleman for one of them; I did not see any gentleman there - I might fall down in going to the station, but I have no recollection of falling and being assisted up by one of the prisoners - my memory is not good enough to tell you; I will not pretend to say - I am sure I do not know that I swore before the Magistrate that I found 2d. in my pocket - I do not remember it; I went before the Magistrate the next day, and I was sober then - what I swore was read over to me; I did not find 2d. in my pockets, to my knowledge - if I swore the next morning that I did, it was not true - I have a great bore, and that is a bad memory; I had drank two or three pints of beer and half a quartern of gin, and it made me a little lively.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Perhaps the beer was good strong Welch ale? A. That is very good, Sir- I will not swear I had not had four pints.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable, (No. 181 H.) I was on duty in Shoreditch on the night of the 20th of April - my attention was drawn to the opposite side of the way, by hearing a person moaning - I looked towards the spot, and saw, apparently to me, three or four men on the pavement, on the ground - on going over I saw one man raise himself up, and run off or go off at a quickish pace; Williams then raised himself up and went after him, and Harknett was the last man who left; they rather ran at first, but after they had got a little way they stopped a little, and went on at a walk - I saw Davies laying on the ground, and blood on his face; Mr. Allport spoke to me, and said, "Those three fellows have been rifling this man's pockets," and I ran after them - the third man, who is not here, turned round, saw me coming, and gave Harknett, who was nearest to him, a nudge with his hand, and he started off as fast as he could - I sprang forward, caught the two prisoners, turned them round, and told them they had been robbing the old man; a private-watchman came up at the time, and I told him to take care of Williams - another officer came up, and assisted is taking them down to the station-house; I searched Harknest, and found on him 1s. in silver, 8d. in copper, and a knife, which has not been claimed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. By your account it was your own observation that directed you to this poor man? A. It was the morning - I was not directed to him by any one; I have stated all that happened in my presence - I have measured the distance from where the prosecutor laid to where the prisoners were taken; it is between sixty and seventy yards - there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120026"></xptr>was no turning till you come to Plough-yard, where the third man shot up; I followed the prisoners, and the private watchman and Crawley came up afterwards - the prosecutor was walking fast to the station; be stumbled, and fell - Harknett assisted him - I believe Mr. Allport went to the station, but he went rather first.</p>

            . I was at that time a Police-constable. I was in Shoreditch on the night of the 20th of April - I went to the assistance of McWilliams; I searched the prisoner Williams at the station-house - I found on him two half-crowns, three shillings, and one farthing; I asked him afterwards whether he had not some tobacco - he said No, he had none; he then put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, pulled out a piece of leaf-tobacco, and said that was all he had; I afterwards made a further search, and found some tobacco rolled up in whitybrown paper, in his inside coat pocket - I had seen it before, but I did not meddle with it, because I did not then know that the prosecutor had lost any, but he described the paper it was in, and said he had lost some.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Williams did not make the least resistance to your searching him? A. No- when I asked for tobacco, he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out a piece of leaf-tobacco, and I afterwards found this other; I think here is more than a pennyworth of tobacco, and this is a common sort of paper to put tobacco in.</p>

             re-examined. Q.Look at that tobacco and the paper, was your tobacco wrapped up in that way? A. Yes, my Lord, and I firmly believe this to be the parcel I had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. You have bought hundreds of ounces in your time? A. I cannot say I have not, but this I did not buy, it was given me - it is common shag tobacco, which I always have.</p>
               <p>Harknett's Defence. I am quite innocent - one shilling which I had in my pocket I got of my master when I left work at night, and I had one shilling of him at dinner time, which I had changed.</p>
               <p>Williams' Defence. When the prosecutor was examined at the office, he swore he had 2 1/2d. in his pocket; I bought I oz. of this tobacco at the first tobacconist's past Plough-yard.</p>

               <p>Mr. Mirsin deposed, that the Prisoner came into his Shop, where there were some clear Lawns upon the Counter, and when she was gone he missed a piece; that he accidentally met her in the Street , and dogged her to Mr. Mcculloch's Shop, charged her with it, and that she promised to pay for it, but desired that he would not let her Husband know any Thing of it, for it was a Smuggling Affair, and pressed him to take a Note, that the Prisoner's Husband said he might do what he would with his Wife, if he did not hurt his Character; that he went the next Morning to get a Warrant to take her up, and was prevailed upon to take a Note for his Lawn, and Mcculloch's piece of Cambrick; that the Day following a Person came to pay the Money and take up the Note, and then he said he did not know that Mr. Goodman owed him any Thing, and refused the Money, because he did not know what the Effects of it might be, and then concluded to take her up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 3rd of May, I was on duty, about ten minutes before nine o'clock at night, near Shoreditch church—I saw the prisoner with another named Marshall—I saw Marshall put his hand into the gentleman's coat-pocket, take something out, and give it to the prisoner, who was close to him—I could not see what it was he took—the prisoner put it into his breeches pocket—Marshall ran away—a young man in my company secured the prisoner—I came up immediately</p>

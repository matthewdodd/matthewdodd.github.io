At half-past seven o'clock, on the morning of the 8th of July, I was sweeping the door, a stranger came and spoke to me, and while I was talking with him I saw the prisoner coming out of my master's shop with a hat; I stopped him, and he asked me whether it was a 16s. or an 18s. hat, but before that he said, "Let me go! let me go!" I called my master, and a constable was sent for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say this man had ever left the shop? A. No - he was coming out of it; he was coming towards me, and I took hold of him - my master was three or four minutes coming down; I took the hat in my hand - I had shut the door, and locked it; he did not attempt to get away - he could if he had liked.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How near the door was he when you stopped him? A. Near the step - I was by the curb-stone.</p>
               <p>ISAAC HILL. I keep this shop - I was called down and sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any concealment of the hat? A. No; he did not say he came to ask the price of it - there was no one else in the shop.</p>

               <p>COURT to JOHN COLE. Q. What questions were put to you by the other man? A. He asked me the way to Southampton-street - the name of that street is written up; he was on the curb-stone - the prisoner was coming out of the shop, about one yard from us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near was the prisoner to you when you put your hand on him? A. I went to the step- he could certainly have overcome me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I entered the shop with no other intention than that of becoming a purchaser of a hat; I had 4s. 6d. which was taken from me by Hill or by the constable - I meant to have left that, and paid for the hat on Saturday night.</p>

             lived in the two pair front - Hagerty is a bricklayer, and lived in the front parlour,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200017"></xptr>with his wife; two young women lived in the front room, first floor, whose names I do not know; I lived in the two pair back room with the prisoners. I am an unfortunate woman; Burrell is a pensioner. On this night, I met Thayers in Holborn, opposite Southampton-buildings; he spoke to me, he appeared tipsy - I went with him to my lodging; we had drank one glass of liquor each; we reached my room about half-past ten o'clock; he went into the house willingly with me; I took him to the two pair back room, I saw nobody in our way up stairs; when we got into the room, he asked me to cook him some steaks, and gave me sixpence and three halfpence to get them; I went and brought them to him, I was not gone long; when I returned, he was sitting by the fire, in the same room, he asked if I had any bread, I said No, and he gave me half-a-crown to fetch some; I went down stairs, and then saw Burrell in the passage, leading into the street - I asked if he would fetch me some bread, he said, Yes; I gave him the half-crown, and returned to Thayers, he was then sitting in the same place, by the fire; Burrell brought the loaf up, knocked at the door, and gave me the loaf and no change, he could not see who was in the room; he knew I had somebody with me, because I had told him so, when I asked him to fetch it; I then sent Burrell again to fetch a halfpenny worth of salt, he did not bring it - Thayer was sensible enough to know what he was about; in five minutes after, as Burrell did not bring the salt, I went down stairs across to Mr. Ellliot's, where I had sent him for it, and found him there; I told him not to wait for the salt for the man was out of his mind.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you say so - A. Because Thayer began swearing about his change. Burrell came over into the parlour with me, and gave me the change. Mr. and Mrs. Hagerty and

             were then in the parlour; Burrell had a white jacket on - Hagerty was undressed in bed; I asked Angel if she would take the change up to the man, as I told her I was afraid he would strike me, she went up with it, and came down almost directly, and said the man had struck her, and she had not given him the change, she gave it to Mrs. Hagerty; Burrell was present, he said nothing; then Mrs. Hagerty went up with the change, and returned, saying, she had given the man his change, and that he was going to strike her - Burrell then went up, Hagerty still remained in bed; I do not know whether he was awake, he did not stir. Burrell asked what business the man had to strike Angel, he seemed angry, and went up stairs - I then heard a noise proceeding from the two pair back room, as if they were fighting; I heard the cry of Murder! and heard them scuffling, I cannot say who it was that called Murder! I was still in the parlour with Mrs. Hagerty and Angel, Hagerty was still in bed; Mrs. Hagerty told me to go for the watch, as she was afraid there would be a piece of work; I went, and first met Birke the watchman, and came back to the house; I had been absent five or six minutes, and before I entered the house, I saw Thayer fall from the two pair of stairs window, I saw him as he came down; he fell on his face flat - I stopped to look at him for about three minutes before I went into the parlour; there was a great crowd, and I could not get in; he remained on the ground till he was taken up - I did not see him move or hear him groan. I went into the front parlour, and found Burrell, Angel, and Mrs. Hagerty there - I did not notice the bed; I saw two children in bed by themselves; Hagerty could not have been in bed then without my seeing him, he was not there; I did not notice whether his clothes were there. I asked Burrell how the man got into the two pair front room, he said he (Burrell) had struck the man because he had struck his girl (Angel) and that the man burst the door open, and threw himself out of window; he said nothing more, Angel said nothing. I remained in the parlour about ten minutes, till Furzman took me away to the watch-house. Burrell was sitting on the table very quiet he had his white jacket on, as before. I saw no more of him or Hagerty.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, BURRELL. Q. Was Mrs. Hagerty with you when you returned with the watchman - A. No; she and Burrell were in the parlour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does the door of the front room come into the staircase - A. Yes, just by our room. The noise of the scuffle appeared to come from the back room; I heard no noise on the stairs. I heard the cry of Murder! but once, and then went for the watchman. I only saw Thayer falling - I did not see him come out of window.</p>

            . In September last, I lived at No. 48, Charles-street, in the two pair front room. I left home about a quarter before nine o'clock on that evening, I have only one window to my room, and that I left open - I had no lock to my door, but tied the asp to the staple, with a piece of ribbon. The hinges were sound when I left the room, it had been unnailed before, but was mended by the landlord. I left about half a tub of water under the foot of my bed, quite under the bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. If any people had been scuffling in the room, could they have overturned it with moving the bed - A. No. Mine was a turn-up bedstead, but it was down. I returned soon after eleven o'clock, my bed was in the same place as I had left it. Before I got to the house, I had heard something at the end of Charles-street, and on getting up to the house, I found a great number of people round the door; I went into the parlour, which was Hagerty's room; I saw Mrs. Hagerty and the two prisoners in the parlour, Hagerty was not in bed - I said I heard some man had been thrown out of window, Mrs. Hagerty said,</p>
               <p>"Oh my G - d, I am an undone woman, my husband has ran away half undressed, at the alarm of a man being thrown from your window;" I then accused Angel of having opened my door, and taken the man into my room; I said,</p>
               <p>"You have taken the man into my room, I suppose on purpose that it should be laid to me;" I said I did not know what I should do, but I thought I had better go down to Furzman, because they might think I knew something about it, and I would go to him to know whether they had told him I was not at home; Burrell said,</p>
               <p>"It is nonsense Maria and you having and words; the man ran from Maria's room, burst open your door, and threw himself out of window" - I went to the street door, and then returned to the parlour; the prisoners and Mrs. Hagerty were still there; I said</p>
               <p>"They say the man is dead," Burrell said,</p>
               <p>"Dead!" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, so they say,"<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200018"></xptr>Burrell seemed greatly agitated, but said nothing more, he left the room; he had a light jacket on, I had seen him in that dress before; I do not know which part of the house he went to, but I saw him come down stairs into the passage in two or three minutes; he then had a blue close coat, and his hat on, his coat was buttoned up - I cannot say whether he had the jacket on, it was not a working jacket, it was a linen waistcoat with sleeves, a coat might be put over it; his hat was not on when he went up stairs. I went out and never saw the deceased; I returned about a quarter before two o'clock, got a light, and went to my room, and found the door forced from the bottom hinge, the hinge was broken, and the door forced back, part of the wood work was broken, it opens inward, the staple and asp were as I had left it. The water tub was behind the door; there had been a great many people in the room before me. I saw several spots of blood about the room, some by the side of the window ledge, and two or three spots on the ledge - I saw the print of finger marks of blood three steps down the staircase from my door. The water in the tub was dirty dish water, it was empty, and turned up behind the door, about three yards from the bed. I never saw Burrell go out in the street in the light jacket. I am an unfortunate woman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know the room Pethick slept in - A. Yes; there is a window to it which leads into the yard; I do not know whether it was open; nobody could get into the yard without going through the passage of the house. There is no carpet to my room - I observed no scratches on the floor. The water was all thrown out of the tub over the floor. I found the bed in the same place as I left it - somebody must have taken the tub from under it, for scuffling about would not overturn it. I did not go to Furzman.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Giles's. About half-past ten o'clock, on the night of the 24th of September, I saw Pethick speaking to Birke the watchman. I followed her down to Charles-street, and Birke went down at a quick pace; in a minute or two, I heard a rattle spring, I went down the street, and found the deceased lying with his head in the kennel; I snatched a candle out of somebody's hand, went up stairs, and on the first floor landing, I saw Bartlett pick up the hat, and on the same landing there were spots of blood from there, up to the two pair of stairs front room window, there was also a mark of blood in the hat, quite fresh - I found the door of the room broken off the hinge, it hung by the top hinge, and pushed inward into the room; the asp was open - I did not notice the wood work. In the centre of the room, between the bedstead and the wainscot, a tub stood with some water in it and some was spilt about a yard from the bed - it struck me there had been some rough work there; I found blood on the cill of the window; I went into the back room on that floor, and found some meat which appeared to have been lately dressed, and a loaf torn all to pieces, the place was in great confusion; I then called out of window to them to take care of the deceased. I searched every room in the house, and did not find a soul; I immediately came down and asked who had brought the man into the house, Pethick was delivered to me. I went to the hospital with the man, returned, and found Furzman there, he took Angel and Mrs. Hagerty into custody. I took Angel to the watch-house, and asked her how she could use the man in that manner, she said she went up to the man for money for the room, that the man went to hit her, and her young man struck him. The spots of blood were quite fresh on the floor, window cill, stairs, and hat. I did not go into the parlour before I went up stairs.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How high is the window from the floor - A. About three feet, and about twenty-one from the ground - there are no area rails. I think the back room window was shut; I could not get to the window without turning round the end of the bed; it comes down nearly to the window. There are about sixteen stairs in the second flight.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Charles-street, on this night. A woman about the size of Pethick, called Watch! I went to a house in Charles-street, and just as I got to the door the man fell from the window on the pavement, on his face and hands. I sprang my rattle, turned the man over, and saw water on his face, and water came from his nose; I saw the two pair front window open; I remained with the man till Clark came and went in - there was a good many people collected in the street; I cannot say that I saw anybody come out of the house as I went up, I saw blood on the stairs; I saw no blood on the first landing, but on about three steps from the second flight, I saw no more blood till I came to the cill of the window; the room door was open - I saw the hat found. The water was spilt about the room.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of Drury-lane. Clark called me - I went to the house, and saw a woman named Fox, standing at the door with a candle in her hand, Clark took the candle from her, and went up stairs, I followed him; I had seen the deceased laying on his face, in the street; as we went up, I observed spots of blood on the one pair staircase, four or five steps up, and by the door of the front room, of the one pair landing - I picked up the hat produced, I saw a spot or two of blood inside it, and spots of blood on the second flight of stairs; it was fresh then, no person had been up except us; I traced the blood into the middle of the two pair front room, it was in different parts of the room, not in a regular trace. I went to the window after taking the man to the hospital, and saw blood on the cill. A tub of water had been upset, and the room was in great confusion. I went into the back room, there had been some beef steaks cooked, and ready on the table; I noticed nothing more there. We searched the house all over, and could find no person up stairs; on coming down, I saw Mrs. Hagerty at the door, Angel was present, I said,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Hagerty, I insist on your telling me who was the person that brought the man home," she said it was Pethick, who was brought forward, and taken into custody. I took the deceased to the hospital. The table was upset, and the chairs about.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the night of the 24th of September, in consequence of information, I went to No. 48, Charles-street, and found Thayer laying on his back; Clark gave Pethick into my custody - I went to the hospital with the man, and after taking Pethick to the watch-house, returned, went into the parlour, and saw Mrs. Hagerty, Angel, and a man sitting on the table. I cannot say who he was, or how he was dressed - I asked Mrs. Hagerty where her husband was, she said,</p>
               <p>"Gone to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200019"></xptr>the hospital with the man." I told her to come up stairs with me; I examined the place, and saw several marks of blood on the stairs, I cannot say whether there was any blood in the two pair back, but there was in the two pair front room, which was in great confusion; the door was off the hinges, and there was a tub in the middle of the room, which appeared to have been upset, and water spilt - some chairs and a table stood in the room. I went to the window ledge, the window was open and a spot or two of blood on it. Mrs. Hagerty afterwards said, in Angel's presence, that Angel had been up stairs with the change to the man, and that he struck her. I then took Mrs. Hagerty and Angel to the watch-house - Angel said she had been up stairs with the change which Pethick gave her, that the man had struck her, and had also attempted to strike Mrs. Hagerty - I have made a diligent search for Hagerty, and travelled many miles, but cannot find him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the blood in different places, or a regular tract - A. It was in broken patches.</p>

            . I am a police officer. I took Burrell into custody, on the 4th of October, at Chelsea College, in the pay-office, in consequence of information I received. I told him I took him on a serious charge, for heaving a man out of window, in Charles-street, Drury-lane. He seemed very much agitated - I think he had a blue coat and yellow buttons on; he said he was innocent of any charge. I said he must go with me, he came along very quietly, and on going up George-street, Chelsea, he said again he was innocent; I said,</p>
               <p>"Then why did you abscond, if you are innocent;" he said, his mother wished him, for fear he should be taken. He said he had been in Union-street, Borough, I think he said Star-court. His right eye was tied up with a handkerchief, I said,</p>
               <p>"What is the matter with your eye," he said he had some sand thrown into it. I asked him why he should disguise himself; he said, because he should receive his pension unnoticed, he used some other expression, which I do not recollect. I had not handcuffed him at that time, he took the handkerchief off his eye himself, and said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, I will tell the Magistrate all about it" - there was nothing the matter with his eye, I took him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am the house-surgeon at the Middlesex hospital. Thayer was brought in on the 24th of September, about eleven or twelve o'clock at night. I saw him immediately, he was insensible; he had an extensive wound on the right hand side of his forehead, by contusion; it would happen by a blow from a blunt instrument, or by a fall - he partly recovered his senses on the following day, when I saw him, at ten o'clock in the morning, but not sufficiently to give me an account of the accident. On the second day, I questioned him; I cannot say whether he apprehended death to be near, he complained of a pain in his head, nothing else at that time - he afterwards complained of a pain in his right hip, and down the thigh. I examined him, and found bruises on the hind and fore part of the thigh, but no wound - the bruises on his hip were treated as slight bruises, the pain in his head subsided in a few days, and when that had almost subsided, he had an attack of the St. Anthony's fire, in his face, that very commonly follows a wound on the head. This went off very soon, returned in about two days, and subsided again. He had an attack shortly afterwards, of an inflamation in his right lung; he had then been in the hospital about ten days, and two or three days after, this was followed by an inflamation in the bowels. St. Anthony's fire naturally follows a wound in the head, and on dissection, the inflamation of the bowels was accounted for, by a fractured bone; the inflamation of the lung, I cannot distinctly relate to the accident; it might be produced by other causes. After being in the hospital three months, he left, was out of the hospital three weeks, and then returned; he was then too far gone to make any complaints, he was sinking under his disorder, and died in a few days. I opened his body, in the presence of Mr. Ogle - I first opened the head; the only diseased appearance there, was an unusual collection of water in the cavities of the brain; there was evidence of the inflamation of the right lung, and there was a scrofulous disease extending through both lungs, and marks of inflamation having existed in the bowels some time before; the right haunch-bone was broken across, the fracture extended across the hip joint, and a sharp piece of the broken bone extended into the cavity of the abdomen; and from this projecting piece, an abscess, containing about a pint of matter, extended six or eight inches along the spine - the hip joint itself was sound, this was the only diseased appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. From your knowledge of all his symptoms, to what do you ascribe his death - A. To the fever produced by this abscess, which was occasioned by the confusion of the of the pointed bone projecting out.</p>
               <p>Q. He never ceased complaining from the first - A. He was never able to walk without crutches, and then with a great deal of pain - a fall from a two pair of stairs window might occasion the fracture.</p>
               <p>MR. OGLE. I am a surgeon. I attended the dissection of the deceased's body, with the last witness; I saw him a few days after his discharge from the hospital, in the parochial infirmary, he always complained of the same injury; Mr. Sweatman's account is very correct. I have nothing to add, except that the proximate cause of the man's death, arose from the quantity of water in the cavity of the brain; inflamation often follows a blow or fall, and the water, I think was produced by inflamation, that is the common case. The blood vessels of the head were fuller than ordinary.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Sweatman says the abscess might cause his death - A. It assisted, certainly, death was occasioned by the effect of the abscess and water on the head jointly. The blow on the head would produce inflamation, which terminated in an abscess. I have no doubt but the fall from the window produced his death.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the prisoner. - A. Yes, it was between eleven and twelve, I saw him go in and from the appearance of him, and coming out again with two rolls of flannel in half a minute, I suspected him, he carried them in his arms before him, I immediately went into the shop, there was nobody in the shop, the door between the shop and parlour was shut, and a thin silk blind up at the door window, I went into the parlour, there was a young woman there, the young woman came out of the shop, and said somebody has stolen two rolls of flannel, I ran directly after the man, he had got about five or six doors, I laid hold of his collar, and brought him back with the flannel in his arms into the shop, when I took the prisoner I said, young man you must bring this back, he said nothing, and when I brought him in the shop, I said lay the flannel down, he laid it down, Mrs. Webb said you villain I suppose you are the same fellow that stole the callico off the same shelf about a fortnight ago, he said he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the young woman in the shop when you brought him back. - A. There were two women sculking about, I brought them in, I asked the prisoner if he was married, he said no, he knew nothing of the women, I let them go, I took the prisoner and the flannel to Marybone watchhouse.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH WEBB. I am a single woman, I keep a haberdasher's shop in Cleveland Street.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew nothing of this business until the last witness into the shop. - A. No, I was called down by a young person that I left below to mind the shop, I had not left the shop five minutes, I saw Mr. Paine bring the prisoner in at the door, I came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the prisoner at all I suppose. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any thing with him in his hands. - A. Two rolls of flannel, the flannels were laid on the counter. I was so flurried I could say nothing, I left it all to Mr. Paine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the flannel in your shop a short time before. - A. Yes, I was the last person in the shop, it laid on a shelf where I always kept it.</p>

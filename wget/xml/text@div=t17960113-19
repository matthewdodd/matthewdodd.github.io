               <p>I live at No. 47, Upper Rathbone-place: I worked for Mr. Wells, the time the prisoner took those planks, as a sawyer: On the 28th of December, me and my partner, that worked with me, were left in the yard by our ownselves.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your partner's name? - A. Thomas Burton; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the day was it? - A. About eleven o'clock in the morning; as we were coming out, I saw the prisoner go past the yard end, in Charles-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your partner with you? - A. Yes; me and my partner stopped at the end of Charles-street; he went down a passage that leads to Brownlow-street; he stopped there about five minutes, or rather better.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay and watch him all the time? - A. Yes; I saw him all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and your partner stay together? - A. Yes; in the course of five minutes he came up, and went into Mr. Wells's yard.</p>

            Could you see Mr. Wells's yard where you were standing? - A. I could see the end of it, the gates; I saw him go through the gateway into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the gates open? - A. Yes; we had left them open.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left the yard, who was left behind in it? - A. Only the mistress and maid, up in the room; there were no workmen left in it; Mr. Wells gave us leave to get some beer, the others were gone; my partner and I staid longer behind, and were going to them; he stopped in the yard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130035"></xptr>seven or eight minutes, we staid in the same place; he came out without any thing, and came up the street towards the Acre, where we were standing, about ten or fifteen yards, and turned back again, and went into the yard again.</p>
               <p>Q. What prevented his seeing you, when he came that way? - A. He did not see us, as I know of; and in the course of a minute or two, he brought a clapboard plank out; as soon as he got about ten or fifteen yards from the gateway, toward where we were, as soon as he saw us, he turned into a court.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to see you? - A. We made to him as fast as we could; he perceived us coming, and made away directly, and let the clapboard-plank fall; he was carrying it under his arm, my partner hollowed out, stop thief, and ran after him; I took care that the plank was secured; that he took through Middlesex-court, that leads into Drury-lane, and my partner followed him; when I had secured the plank, I went to my partner's assistance, and my partner had got him in Drury-lane; another young man stopped him before my partner took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that young man here? - A. Yes; then we brought him back to Mr. Wells's yard: we pulled Mr. Wells's bell, and called the maid down, and sent for Mr. Wells; he came in the course of ten minutes, and took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a plank was it? - A. An inch and a quarter thick in some places; it was an outside plank, and was irregular, it was seven foot long; we took the plank to Bow-street, and Mr. Wells took it in his possession; Mr. Wells took a constable from Bow-street, to search his premisses; I did not go with him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at No. 3, West-street: On the 28th of December, as I was going by Drury-lane, a little after eleven in the morning, I heard the cry of stop thief; I looked round, and saw the prisoner come out of Middlesex-court; I ran after him just as he crossed Drury-lane; I stopped him, and a person who was in pursuit of him came up to my assistance; I went with the prisoner to Mr. Wells's yard, and from there to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Parkinson? - A. Yes; he came up about a minute after we stopped the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know the person that was in pursuit of him? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Parkinson.) Is that last witness the person you found with your partner Burton and the the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the plank was in Mr. Wells's yard? - A. No; I don't remember seeing it, only seeing him come out of the yard with it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wells. When I went to Bow-street, I asked for an officer to search his shop; I went with the officer, and saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think they were stolen at the same time? - A. No; they were in his shop. (The wainscot plank was produced in Court). The length of it is about seven foot; it is what we call an inch and a quarter thick.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to that being your property, and being in your yard? - A. Yes; it had been cut about a twelvemonth; I had seen it in the yard that very morning, on the right-hand side just by the gate-way, this stood in the front; there were four or five more behind it, I marked it before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any marks upon it by which you know it to be your property? - A. I am certain of it, there is no particular mark upon it; it is a year and a half ago since it was cut out of the log.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to swear that it is your plank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was not in the habit of coming to take the wood, and to pay you afterwards? - A. No such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Parkinson.) When you saw the prisoner going to Mr. Wells's gate, had he any plank under his arm? - A. No; he had not, only a three foot rule in his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought this plank, it came to 3s. 8d. I paid him 3s. and he denied I had given him any money for it, and would not give it me; I bought two of these, and paid all but 8d. I happened to be in trouble, and confined in Newgate; I sent my wife for them, he would not give them to her, and said I had given him no money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wals. About four months ago, he came in and asked the price of some planks; I said they were 3s. 8d. I would not let him have them without he paid for them; it was not this plank.</p>

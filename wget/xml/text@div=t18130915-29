The wife of the prisoner has had the care of that house for the last two years. The house is mine. I pay the prisoner's wife for taking care of the house, and allow her part of the house to live in, and during the period of two years it has been repeatedly robbed, and for the last three weeks I have not been able to trace it to anybody but the prisoner. I lost a pair of new boots and thirty-five yards of black superfine cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the prisoner kept company with his wife - A. He resided with her; he was allowed to be with her. How I came to discover the prisoner was the thief some duplicates were brought to me by the prisoner's master; he is an attorney, in Holborn-court.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. He is a <rs id="t18130915-29-deflabel166" type="occupation">writer</rs>

            . I am a pawnbroker; I live at No. 70, London Wall. On the 4th of June I took in these boots of the prisoner; I lent him twelve shillings upon them, and on the 21st of May a remnant of broad cloth for ten shillings, and on the 11th of August another remnant of broad cloth, ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was the cloth - A. Black. I took them in of the prisoner, I am sure of that. These are the boots, and this is the cloth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am first officer of the <hi rend="italic">William Penn</hi>—I have served on board her three or four months—she is a new ship and sailed under British colours—her owners are Malkinson Brothers—they are British owners—the prisoner was an able seaman on the last voyage to New York—Waring was the third officer of the ship—between nine and twelve o'clock on 22nd June we were off the banks of Newfoundland—the helm was relieved at ten o'clock, and the prisoner and a man named Doughty went on—at ten minutes or a quarter past ten I found by watching the compass on the saloon deck that the ship went several points off her course—there were from 600 to 700 people on the ship—I gave charge of the ship to the third officer and Waring, and went to the wheel-house to ascertain the cause—I found Doughty there, but Allen was absent—he came into the wheel-house in about three minutes and took hold of the wheel—he was what I should term half drunk, and Doughty was slightly the worse for liquor—I said that it was requisite to have them relieved, and went and told the captain, who had just left the deck and was undressing—I received directions and went to the wheel-house and had them relieved by two of the watch—one man went away</p>

               <p>quietly, but the prisoner held on to the wheel and would not suffer the ship to be steered—I reasoned with him, but it was of no use—a vessel was reported on the port bow, and I put my hand in a persuasive manner on his right shoulder, and he dealt me a blow in the face as hard as he could—a struggle ensued, and I eventually got him towards where the captain was, who assisted me—we all three struggled, and eventually the captain sent me below for a pair of handcuffs which I had in my cabin—I returned with them, but the captain said that we should be in port in a few days, and no doubt he would run away—he promised to behave himself, and was not handcuffed—I then went on the saloon deck and took charge of the ship—Waring was there—that is a part where seamen are not allowed to be—Waring was pacing across the deck, and I had paced a few yards on the starboard side, when I turned round and saw the prisoner in the act of striking me from behind—his hand was at my side with something in it, I could not make out what—(this was three-quarters of an hour after I had brought the handcuffs)—I sprang back and partially fell on my back—he jumped towards me—I jumped up and he made a blow at me—I dealt him a blow with the handcuffs, which I had in my pocket, and Waring called out, "He has got a knife in his hand"—I saw the knife before I struck him—the chief engineer got behind him and secured his hands round his waist—he tried to throw the knife away and it fell about a foot from his feet—he was secured—the captain was sent for and he was put in irons—he broke two pair of irons that night, and the third he picked in some way with a piece of string—they were two handcuffs with a chain between them—he was put down the steerage—the blow he struck me at the wheel-house took effect on the lower part of my nose—it hurt me, and made me all over blood—my nose has only just recovered—it knocked me against the wheel-house three feet from where I stood—this is not an ordinary English knife—sailors are not allowed to use them, and in American ships they take a pair of pincers and break the point off the knives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have not you seen him with that knife in his possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till this evening—there were I believe several American seamen on board—I have not seen them with such knives as this—the prisoner was half drunk at the wheel—I cannot say how he got liquor—the men have an allowance, and are not allowed to bring spirits on board—I have never seen sailors' chests examined when they come on board—I had never seen the prisoner drunk before, or the other man—we had a light in the binnacle—I was three or three and a half feet from it when I was struck—there was also a light on the saloon deck and a compass—I did not strike the prisoner with the handcuffs till he struck at me with the knife—I had not got them in my hand till then—I swear I did not push him in the wheel-house—I only put my hand on his shoulder—I think I struck him twice with the handcuffs—he was confined in a bath-room for the rest of the voyage.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it the prisoner's duty to steer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We have two men at the wheel—they both steer, and four men when we are going into harbour—there is not a captain of the wheel—if the ship is out of her course we speak to both men—they are both responsible—they both get the course—we have no ordinary seamen—they are all A.B's.</p>

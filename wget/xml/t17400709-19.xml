             the Constable went after the Prisoner Thomas, and she was tax'd with receiving the Quilts, knowing them to be stole. Then I came Home to Miles, who was detain'd in my House, and says I to him,- You're a pretty Fellow, to wrong me in this Manner,- I have found 3 Quilts; have you robb'd me of any more? He told me, he believed he had taken 5. The Prisoner Thomas, when she was going before my Lord Mayor, own'd she had receiv'd 2 Quilts, and if I would be quiet, and easy with her, I should have them again, for they were at the Pawnbroker's. I carry'd Miles and Thomas before my Lord Mayor; and he would have committed them to Newgate, but I desired they might be sent to the Counter; and as we were carrying them thither I desired the Constable to take Thomas to the Alehouse, to see if he could get out of her, where the Quilts were; he carry'd her into a House, and in about 2 Hours Tim, the Quilts were brought to me, by a Man, she (Thomas) told me she had sent for them to the Pawnbroker's, and that they were the same Quilts my Servant Miles had brought to her House. This Quilt I can't swear to; the other 4 I can. My Son is in Partnership with me, and the Goods are mine and his.</p>

I went to the Prosecutor, and he got a Warrant against the 3 Persons. We charged Miles first: then we took Morgan, and she confessed 3 Quilts, and I went with her to the Places where they had been disposed of. Then he went to Mrs Thomas's; and she own'd she had had 2 Quilts from Miles, and Miles confessed he had carried 2 to her. These are the 2 Quilts: They are sealed, that we might know them again. When my Lord-Mayor committed them, Thomas made a great Outcry, upon which Mr Watson desired they might only be committed to the Counter, because it would be easier for him to have Access to them there, than in Newgate. While we were going from my Lord-Mayor's, Thomas desired Mr Watson would be easy, and she would send for the 2 Quilts. Accordingly, we went into the Golden Fleece, and she sent a Man for them, and I saw them delivered to Mr Watson</p>

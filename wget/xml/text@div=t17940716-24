               <p>I am the wife of Mr. Isaac Hawley; I was at the far end of the shop; I did not take notice of her taking any thing, I see her both come in and go out; I heard her ask the young man to shew her some lawn bordered handkerchiefs; I found she was not going to buy, and finding she had been troublesome in the shop before, I walked towards the doors, and when she went out Mr. Mason went out into the street after her, and brought her back, when she was brought into the shop, she dropped these nine handkerchiefs from under her left arm, I see her drop them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the nine handkerchiefs? Who picked them up? - I believe Mr. Mason did; they were afterwards taken down to the police office, and then brought back; I know this is the same from the pattern and the shop mark.</p>

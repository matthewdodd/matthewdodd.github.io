            . I live in Phoenix-street, Somer's-town, and am a broker. On the 27th of December the prisoner came to my shop, and offered me a lock for sale - having heard some inquiry about it, I said I should send for an officer; he ran off - I pursued, but could not stop him: but I saw this pair of bellows taken from under his arm - they were taken to my shop, and I gave them and the lock to the officer; he told me where he lived, and we found him behind a palliasse at his father's - his father denied his being at home.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was never in his shop - my brother picked up the lock, and asked me to sell it; I went with it, and met a boy who I knew, who asked me to sell the bellows, and he would give me 2d. or 3d. - I went to sell the lock and could not; I ran off, and a man took the bellows from under my arm.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COX. When I found the prisoner concealed, as has been stated, I said I wanted him concerning a lock he said, "My father gave me the lock;" but his father who was there, said he knew nothing about it - I then asked the prisoner if he had offered a pair of bellows - he said he knew nothing about them; but afterwards he said, "Be as favourable as you can to me, I will tell you the truth," and he showed me the shop where he offered them.</p>

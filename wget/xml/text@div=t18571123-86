On Tuesday, 3rd Nov., I was in the market between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner at my stand—I had seen him two or three times before in the market—he came to my stand, and bought two bushels of apples—I asked him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a bushel—he offered me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the two—I said I could not take it—we agreed that he should have them for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me two half crowns and a shilling—I could not swear to the shilling, but I could to the two half crowns—I placed the money in my left hand trousers pocket, where I had something like 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver, but all shillings, sixpences, and fourpenny pieces—I had no other half crown—in two or three minutes afterwards I found the two half crowns were bad—I had not taken any other money—I also found I had a bad shilling in my pocket—on the following Saturday, 7th Nov., I saw the prisoner again coming from York Street to the first passage in the market—he met me and passed me, and I turned and followed him—I said, "You are the</p>

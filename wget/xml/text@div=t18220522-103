On the 20th of May, about ten o'clock at night, I was coming down the City-road, and by St. Luke's workhouse a man made a violent and sudden snatch at my seals, and got them. My son had hold of my arm, I called out - he pursued - and the prisoner was brought back in three or four minutes; and from the observation I made of him I believe him to be the man.</p>

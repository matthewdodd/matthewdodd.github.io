                  </hi>. I am a butcher, at Cross-street, Hoxton. The prisoner Robert was in my service, and I have known William a long while, he lived next door but one—in consequence of information, on Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing, 10th Nov., a little after seven, I watched and saw Robert take some meat from the shop into a back yard, and throw it over the wall into the yard of Mr. Letsam, the baker, which communicates with the premises next door but one, where the prisoner William lives—I saw him throw something over the wall in a cloth—I went about ten minutes after to my back window, and saw William pick it up, and take it into the bakehouse—I then went to the baker's shop, and saw William and Mr. Letsam—I walked into the kitchen and told Mr. Letsam there was something I wanted to see —we went through the bakehouse into the yard, and I said it was not there—we then found about 51bs. of shoulder of mutton in a cupboard in the bakehouse—there was a skewer in it which I had put in the night before—it was mine—I went to the station, and as I came back I saw a policeman, and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

On the 20th of July, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon; these hats were on a side counter in the shop; I was sitting in the parlour, behind the shop, reading, when Moore came into the shop - I went to him; he asked the way to Castle-street, St. Martin's-le-Grand; I directed him to Castle-street, Falcon-square - while I was speaking to him, Tyrrell brought in Smith with two hats, which I claimed; Tyrrell immediately said to Moore, "Stop! I have seen you before" - he took them both into custody.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Post-office. On the 20th of July I was on duty in front of the Postoffice, and saw the two prisoners, and another, in company, walking up and down on the opposite side several times; I observed them look into Mr. Payne's shop, and watched them - the one not in custody went into Mr. Payne's shop, and brought out two hats - the prisoners were outside, and could see him come out: he ran across the road, and went in at the south gate of the Post-Office - I went through the principal entrance, and met Smith at the back of the office; I took the two hats from him - I asked him where he was going with them; he said some boy had given them to him to carry - I took him into Mr. Payne's shop; I saw Moore there, and asked what he had been inquiring for - I took them both, having seen them all three together in company.</p>
               <p>Moore. Q. Where was I when the man brought the hats out? A. You stood at a post about two doors from the shop.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I was walking down the back of the Post-office; a lad came and asked me to direct him to Moorfields, and asked me to hold the hats, while he tied his shoe - directly I got them, an officer came up.</p>
               <p>Moore's Defence. I was going to meet a young man, named Hendon; I did not exactly know Castle-street, where I was to meet him - I met two young men in St. Martin's-le-Grand, and asked them to direct me; they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060029"></xptr>said they did not know it - I went into this shop, and the officer detained me.</p>

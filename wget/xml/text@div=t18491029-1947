                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SAMUEL PHIPPS</hi>. I am a butcher, of 36, Lower Belgrave-street, Pimlico. Drake and Hobbs have been in my service—on Saturday, 6th Oct., I was in the parlour at the back of my shop, at a little past one o'clock, and looked through a small orifice in the partition which divides the parlour rom the shop; it covered the whole of the doorway and the greater part of the shop—I saw a woman come into the shop—Hobbs advanced towards her, and, instead of serving her, passed her, and went out at the door—just outside the door he gave his head a swing, turned short round into the shop again, and went in; he spoke to the woman, and immediately on that Hammond came up—Hobbs moved his head in the direction in which Hammond came—Hammond came about three yards into the shop, with a bag in his hand—Drake had got a leg of mutton which had been moved from the other side of the shop, in hit hand, and he put it into Hammond's bag—Hammond had not had time to speak to Drake—Drake had the mutton in his hand before Hammond came in—Hammond doubled it up, and walked off directly—I went out of the parlour as quickly as I could—Drake rather intercepted my passing, I do not know whether it was designedly or not—I got past, ran after Hammond, and caught him with the mutton, about thirty yards from the door—he said what he had got he had paid for—I can positively swear no money had passed between them—I gave Hammond into custody, and in the bag a leg and part of a loin of mutton were found—I did not see the loin put in, but I have no doubt it was my property—I cannot say whether it was put in when Hammond came into the shop—they may both have been put in together—I made the hole on the Friday night, with a gimlet, through a partition not more than three-eighths of an inch thick—the hole was hot more than a quarter of an inch in diameter—the leg of mutton was worth about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the hole direct you towards some glass? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but I did not have to look through it, as the window was up as high as my head—Hobbs was speaking to a customer when the leg of mutton was put into the bag—he had nothing to do with it.</p>

               <p>they were in the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sixteen or seventeen feet—I had one eye to the hole when I saw Hobbs go out—I should not have seen the loin if it had been put in at the end of the leg; it would then appear like one joint—I should have seen Hammond's lips move if he had spoken—when Hammond was taken, he said he would pay for it—they took money in the shop when I was away, and the housekeeper also away—she was at another hole on the opposite side which commanded a view of the part of the shop where the meat hung—she is not here—the meat could not have been taken from there without her seeing it—when Drake was taken he had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on him—he had no half-crowns, I believe—(<hi rend="italic">the money found and the purse, was here produced by Rope</hi>)—there are some half-crowns here.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whose possession has the purse been in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The policeman's; I have not seen it—half-a-crown would not be a fair price for the mutton—I did not weigh it, but I could tell by looking at it that it was more than 9lbs.—the loin weighed 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2lbs. or 3lbs.—Hobbs was foreman—he had been with me fifteen months, and the other nine months.</p>

About one o'clock I was in my employer's shop, Mr. Hall, 25, Lower Belgrave-street, and saw Hammond standing outside an oil-shop, next door to Mr. Phipps's, with something under his arm—I cannot say what it was—a little after one I saw Mr. Phipps give him in charge, and saw the constable take the meat out of his bag.

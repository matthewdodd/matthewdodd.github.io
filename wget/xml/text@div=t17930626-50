             sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner at the bar was brought to the watch-house, seemingly very much in liquor, about half after four on Thursday morning, it was when the Wednesday night was over; the man has made mistake as to the day; there was nothing brought with him but this tinder box; he was brought into the watch-house assisted by two or three watchmen, there was nothing against him at that time; he remained in the watch-house till about four o'clock, our watch was very near coming in then; we told him to withdraw, we thought he might be tolerably sober by that time; I went out to see after the watchmen whether they were doing their duty, and I met the prisoner coming up Bedford-row with the saddle on his back, I went up to him, and I said to him, my friend what do you do with that saddle on your back? how came you by it? says he, what is that to you? I said, it is to me; says I, how did you come by it? says he, you may take the saddle; says I, I shall take the saddle and you too; with that I took him to the watch-house, both him and saddle, and I sent to Mrs. Steele's yard, who keeps a livery stable the top of Bedford-row, and the last witness came and said it was the property of Mrs. Steele; he came much about five o'clock. I have had it in my possession ever since. The hostler brought it here this morning; I gave it him this morning, but I kept it till then. (The saddle produced and deposed to by Hind.)</p>
               <p>Hind. I know it is Mrs. Steele's property; I know it by the button of the saddle, it is a very broad large button; we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260075"></xptr>have had it about a year and half; I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>Court. When you went back did you find such a saddle was missing before you was sent for? - I found this saddle was missing before I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. What is you mistress's christian name? - Mary. It was taken out of the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the yard or any part broke? - It was open that time of the morning; there were carriages come in just before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The thing was, I was very much tipsey that night; I saw that saddle lay down by the wall, and I took it up, and I did intend to carry it to the watch-house, but before that, this man met me, and I thought as he had took care of me he might take care of the saddle. As to that thing the tinder box, he need not have brought it, that I had for the convenience of getting a light.</p>
               <p>Court to Spriggs. Was he drunk when you met him? - He was very much drunk at half past twelve, but he was sober then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account but what you have mentioned? - No, he told me I might take the saddle; I told him I should take the saddle and him.</p>

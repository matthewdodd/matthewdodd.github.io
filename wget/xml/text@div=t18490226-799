                  </hi>. I am a beer retailer at Vauxhall. On 17th Feb., Wyatt came and asked for a pint and a half of ale—I asked whether she was going to take the pots home as she had no jug—she said yes, she was going to Smith's, of Vauxhall-wharf—she took it away in two quart pewter pots—my son told me something—I went to George-street, Vauxhall, three or four hundred yards off, I saw my son with one of the pots—I asked Wyatt, who was in the house, for the other—she said it was not empty, and then that she had sent it back—I got a constable, went to the back room first floor, and took both prisoners.</p>

I live in George-street, The prisoners occupied my back room first floor—after Wyatt was taken by the police, Mortishead came into the back yard three times—the third time, he came out of the water-closet at the bottom of the yard, it was between three and four o'clock—I went there directly he left and found this iron saucepan—I took it out and put it on the dust—afterwards not knowing what to do with it, I threw it back again—I afterwards saw it given to the constable.</p>

I went to 5, George-street, and received this saucepan—here is white metal sticking to the sides of it—I went into the prisoner's room and found some small pieces of white metal of the same sort about the fire-place—Mortishead came in while I was there—I said to him, "You must go with me to the station on account of the pots"—he said, "I did not know but what my wife had given them to the boy"—this piece of metal was afterwards found in the next garden—it exactly fits into the saucepan.</p>

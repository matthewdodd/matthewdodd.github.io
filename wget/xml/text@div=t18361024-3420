                  </hi>, I am a publican, and live in Great Wild-street. On Tuesday morning, the 27th of September about a quarter before eight o'clock, the prisoner Hall came into my house before the bar, and called for half a pint of beer—I drew it—he drank it, and threw a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., down—I did not look at it, but threw it into the till—the beer came to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I had two shilling in the till, but no sixpence—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—Collins came in and spoke to me, and I took the sixpence out—Docking came in in about a quarter of an hour or ten minutes, and called for half a pint of beer—he threw down sixpence—I looked at it, and found it was bad—I said, "You have passed a had sixpence on me, "and detained him—I kept it in my hand till policeman and Collins brought Hall back—I then gave Wilson the same sixpence, and the one I first, took, to Colline—I said to Docking, "You own me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and he said, "I have only got 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket"—I did not give Docking change—I marked the sixpence he gave me, and gave it to Wilson.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hall.</hi> I did not go into the shop at all; when the policeman fetched me back he did not know me, and asked where the man was who had offered him the counterfeit 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He stood behind the policeman and I did not see him at first—I said, "He is the name person."</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Beckman, On the 22nd of September I was cleaning the brass-plant at the door—the prisoner Hall came and looked into the shop, then passed by me and went in—I thought I heard a sixpence jink on the counter—directly the prisoner was gone my master showed me a bad sixpence—I went after Hall, and saw him about two doors from my master's—he went up to the top of the, street and joined Docking—they spoke together and walked down Drury-lane to Prince's-court, within two doors of my master's house—they then walked to the end of court—Hall stopped at the top, and Docking went down the court—I waited till a policeman came up—I told him, and gave Hall into his custody—I had sixpence in my hand at the time, and gave it to the policeman—I marked it first—I went to my master's shop, and he was there with Docking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hall.</hi> It was not marked till it went through four or five policeman's hands at the station-house. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I swear it was marked when I gave it into the hands of a policeman—I hid myself in a doorway, and when the policeman came by I gave him into custody.</p>

On the 19th of November he came home at twelve o'clock at night, and I went to make his bed in the upper room; I had the articles stated in a cupboard in that room - I saw them all safe then - I came down, and went to bed in the lower room; there was only my husband, me, my children, and the prisoner in the house that night. At six o'clock the next morning I heard the street door unlocked and unbolted - I asked who was there; the prisoner answered, "It is me;" I asked what time it was, and he said half-past seven o'clock- it was rather dark, and I said, "I think you are a liar." As soon as he had banged the door to I got up, and went into his room - I missed all the articles - I have not seen any of them since.</p>

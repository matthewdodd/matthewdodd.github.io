               <p>THOMAS LITTLEWOOD sworn. - I am a farmer. I live at Hendon: On Monday the 27th of April, as I was crossing a field belonging to Mr. Humphreys, a pointer dog, which was with me, found some sheep's entrails in a ditch; I looked in the ditch, and there I found three lamb's skins, about two hundred yards from Mr. Sargeant's field, they were quite fresh killed; on the Wednesday we heard of the carcasses of some lambs being stopped upon two men in St. Giles's; we went to Bow-street and compared the skins; the carcasses were one large one, and three smaller ones; the three small carcasses fitted the three skins that I found in the field, I saw them fitted; they appeared to me to belong to those carcasses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing from which you concluded the skins came from Mr. Sargeant's field? - A. They appeared to come from that way, by the wool that had been dropped; upon examining the skins, we found they were one ewe lamb, and two wether lambs, and so were the carcasses also.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the patrols belonging to Bow-street: On Sunday morning, the 26th of April, I observed the two prisoners at the bottom of Tottenham-court-road, they crossed over towards St. Giles's; I got before them, and they followed me past St. Giles's church, they had two sacks, one on each shoulder; I let them go on till I met two men coming, whom I got to assist me in securing them; I asked Whitton where he got the two sacks from; he said he found them; I took them to the watch-house, and on searching Whitton, in his left-hand coat-pocket I found this knife; and in his left-hand jacket pocket I found this rag-stone, and this piece of cord; he had a jacket under his coat; and in his right-hand coat-pocket I found this steel; upon Pavely I found three or four duplicates, and some money; on the Tuesday following I went into the Hay-market, with the two sacks, and there I heard that three lamb's skins had been found by Mr. Littlewood; the next day, Wednesday, I went to Hendon, and Mr. Littlewood came to town, and saw the three lamb's skins fitted to the three carcasses that I found in the sacks; the prisoners said, they had been out in the morning, and they had found them, but could not tell where, nor any place that it was nigh; I have found the owner of one of the sacks, Mr. Burgess, in Horley-down-lane; Mr. Burgess is not here.</p>

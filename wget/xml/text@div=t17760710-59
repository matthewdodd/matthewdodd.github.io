Elliot and the butler sat down to drafts, and I sat down with them; at this time Read was missing; I left them at drafts, and went to a relation's in Whitechapel to drink tea, and from there I came to my lodgings in James-street, Gold-square, and there I saw Read fast asleep; I waked him, and bid him go home; he said, by G - d, he had taken French leave, and never would go home any more; he said, he had a suit of his master's cloaths on, and that he had broken open drawers, and taken away cloaths to the amount of 20 l. and he would go off for France; I desired him to meet me at the Coach and Horses next morning, and a relation of mine went with me to tell the butler what Read had done: I rang the bell; the butler called to know who was there? I said, my name was Chester, and I came to tell him what Read had done; the butler, when I began to tell him, called two watchmen and seized me.</p>

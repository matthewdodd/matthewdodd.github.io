               <p>JAMES ATTKINS sworn. - On the 1st of Octo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270062"></xptr>ber, I took a walk with Charles Hawkins; we went to the Strand, to a private house, and from there we went to a wine-vaults, in Drury-lane, and there we met with Mackenzie, Thompson, and two others.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you were acquainted with them? - A. No, I knew Hawkins.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you join company with them? - A. Yes; Charles Hawkins spoke to them; we came out of the wine-vaults, and then we all went together to the <placeName id="t18021027-98-crimeloc542">Turk's Head, in Dyot-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Were you sober at that time? - A. I was as sober as a Judge.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been drinking at the winevaults? - A. We only drank a glass a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Dyot-street, what happened to you? - A. We called for a pot of ale.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you and Hawkins to treat? - A. I paid for every thing they had the whole day; I said, who is to pay for that; Hawkins said, you pay for it, and I will pay you another time; after I had paid for it, Hawkins took his handkerchief off his neck, and gave it to me; he wanted me to take it till he had money to pay me; I gave him his handkerchief back, and told him I did not want his handkerchief, he might make it up to me another time; when the ale was almost out, I went out to see a bit of a row in the street; I saw a young fellow, whom I treated with a glass of peppermint; in this house I changed half-a-crown to pay for it, and put the change in my jacket pocket; as I was standing at the corner, Hawkins put his hand in my pocket, took out the change, and handed it over to the other parties.</p>
               <p>Q. Hawkins and you were alone then? - A. No, all these jockies were out; I said, I think it is time to be off; upon that Hawkins and the rest of them laid hold of me, and dragged me into the house; then Hawkins said to the other, stand by; Thompson, Mackenzie, and the others said, "all ready, hurroo, hurroo, draw him, tingle, tingle;" Charles Hawkins was knocking me about at the time Thompson and Mackenzie were robbing me; they got me down, and ill-used me, and knocked me about.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they rob you? - A. They broke the chain of the watch; the chain was drawn through my button-hole; they broke the chain in three pieces; I had these trowsers on at the time (producing them), and they tore the pocket right out as you see it, and in the same pocket where the watch was there was a 5l. Bank-note, which they took; there were two half guineas, and nineteen shillings in silver in my waistcoat pocket, which they tore out likewise; I got hold of Thompson's hand, and said, I don't care, I will lose my life before I let you go, and I kept hold of his hand while the others were knocking me about; I cried out murder almost all the time from the first beginning of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come to your assistance? - A. Yes, a soldier came in, and then they all bolted out; I held fast hold of Thompson, the man that took the watch out of my pocket and the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Thompson taken upon the spot? - A. Yes, he was taken directly; Mackenzie then came up directly, and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after the soldier came in? - A. Yes; Mackenzie knocked me down while the soldier was after Thompson; Mackenzie said to Thompson, "you b - r, don't go up that street; if you do, you will be caught."</p>
               <p>Q. What street was that? - A. I don't know the name of the street; I never was in the place before in all my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mackenzie caught? - A. He was caught about an our afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Thompson was taken immediately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mackenzie make his escape? - A. While we were taking Thompson to the watch-house, I had hold of one side of him, and the officer on the other; Hawkins came up to me again, and knocked me down; I had hold of one side of him; I got up and caught hold of him directly, and gave him in charge to the officer; Mackenzie made off with the property; he took it out of Thompson's hands.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him take the property from Thompson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peat. Q. You joined Hawkins at the public-house? - A. Yes, and he said he would take a walk with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking a good deal? - A. No I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking at the wine-vaults? - A. No, I did not; I only treated them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many public-houses were you at in St. Giles's? - A. Only the Turk's head.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself; were not you among some women at another house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You paid, I believe, for Hawkins the whole of the day? - A. I paid for every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. And you offered to lend Hawkins money several times? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did you offer? - A. When I caught his hand in my pocket, I said, Charles, you don't behave like a shipmate, and he immediately handed the money away to some of the rest of them; and I said, if you had not done that, I would have lent you half a guinea, or a guinea, if you wanted it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have disagreed with him so much; you had some kind of quarrel with him, and struck him, I believe? - A. No, I did not quarrel with him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. After drinking all this while, you take upon you to say you were quite sober? - A. I was as sober as any person could be.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you think you had drank in the course of the whole day? - A. I had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270063"></xptr>drank more than six glasses, and twice that would not make me drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mackenzie take any thing from your person? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to say Mackenzie struck you? - A. He knocked me down in the street several times, not in the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Thompson. Q. I wish to ask him if I was out of his sight from the time he says he was robbed till I went to the watch-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not stand by at the watch-house, and see me searched? - A. I don't know whether you were searched there; if you were, it were more than I know.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you recollect there is a reward; have you ever been told there is a reward? - A. No, I have not; I never was before a Justice in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not the officers given you money since you have been here, and tampered with you, and even given you victuals and drink? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not received any emolument, nor have been told there is a reward? - A. No; they have not told me of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Q. Did you from any person hear that you were to have a reward if any of these persons are convicted? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you imagine or conceive in any way that you are to be benesited if these persons are convicted? - A. No.</p>

             came out after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Attkins appear to you to be drunk or sober? - A. He was no more in liquor than I am now; then I saw Mackenzie come out after him; Thompson ran round the corner of Church-lane, and Attkins ran after him; then Mackenzie came close after him, and just as Attkins got to the corner, Mackenzie knocked him down; Mackenzie cried out to Thompson, that if he ran that way he would be caught.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What do you know of this matter? - A. On the 1st of October, between five and six o'clock, I was standing where I lodge, No. 27, Dyot-street, St. Giles's; I heard a cry of, stop thief, over and over; upon hearing the alarm, I proceeded to the spot, and saw the prisoner Thompson rush out of the door at the Turk's Head public-house, and the young man Attkins pursuing him; Attkins was bleeding very much at the mouth or nose, I could not say which; I immediately collared Thompson, when the prisoner Mackenzie rushed out immediately after the prosecutor, and made a bolt right against my arm, and rescued Thompson; immediately after he was rescued, Thompson returned into the house again, Mackenzie following him; I pursued him, and in the tap-room there is a door that leads back towards the vault in the yard, and Thompson attempted to bolt through towards the yard; there I saw Thompson give Mackenzie something that appeared to be a small thing, imitating a purse, or something of that description; he twisted the mouth of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270064"></xptr>it round, and put it into the fore part of his breeches; then Thompson bolted out again at the bar-door throught the house; I pursued him and collared him again a second time; Mackenzie said,"bolt, you b - r, bolt," and up with his first, compelling Thompson to run, as if he was going to strike him; Thompson ran up the street, and I followed him; he was soon taken by the assistance of me and the mob which was collected.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peat. Q. You don't know what it was that Thompson gave Mackenzie? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Thompson. Q. Did you go to the watchhouse with me? - A. I went to the watch-house; the prisoner was taken in, but the watchman shut the door slap to, and I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not at the first examination? - A. No; and the second examination I was sent for by Mr. Bond; he sent a note to the commanding officer, requesting that I might attend as an evidence against Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever in this Court before. - A. Never.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the patrols belonging to the Office, in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You know no more than the apprehending? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Hawkins's defence. This sailor asked me to go with him and take a walk, between one and two o'clock; I told him I had no money; he said he would treat me, as I was a shipmate; we went to Drury-lane, to the wine-vaults, and had a glass of gin a-piece; then we went to a private house with some lewd women; he was up there some time; I staid below; then we went down into the street, and had some ale; then we went home, and he said, "come with me, and I will shew you a shipmate of ours;" he took me to Dyot-street, where we had some ale; he asked me to pay for it; I told him I had no money; he made a grumbling, and I offered him my handkerchief, and then there was a piece of work among them, and I went away. This is all I now about it.</p>
               <p>Thompson's defence. As for insinuating, as the prosecutor does, that I was in the company of the others, it is not true; I did not associate with them; there was a very great alarm in the house; the house was full of people; I was very much alarmed, and left the house.</p>
               <p>Mackenzie's defence. I have nothing to say.</p>

               <p>Kitchener's defence. I am entirely innocent of the charge; I never saw any watch at all.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Attkins.) Q. Were you in any private house? - A. Not with any of them, but Charles Hawkins.</p>
               <p>Q. He says you were at a house with some loose women? - A. I changed a 7s. piece in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Ann Morris.) What is the name of the man who keeps the house? - A. I cannot say; he was a Frenchman.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Crocker.) Do you know what is the name of the man who keeps the house? - A. His name is

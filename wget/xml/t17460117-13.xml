            . Upon the 19th of December I was going into the Stable to look for a Shovel; I saw the two Prisoner at the Bar in Mr. Smith's House in Paulin-Yard, Tyburn-Road, take a Pair of Harnes s out of a Brewing-Vessel. I asked them no Questions how they came by this Harness. Eyres (the Prisoner) had a Pair of Harness belonging to the King upon the Horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when you saw Eyres?</p>
               <p>Roberts. I saw him come out of Paulin-Yard, where he put his Harness at Night.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Thing more?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Says Eyres, you cannot take off the Harness of the Horse, as you did out of the Brewhouse Yesterday. So, says I, is not your Horse blind? So I went and told my Master, for I was afraid of my Life: But as I was going down, I saw the very same Horse with this Harness.</p>

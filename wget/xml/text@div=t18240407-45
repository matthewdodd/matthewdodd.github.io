               <p>COURT. Q. I suppose you struggled to hold your bundle - A. Yes, my Lord; he pulled me down as I resisted to keep it. I held the bundle to keep it, and he pulled me down. There was another person standing on the other side, but he took no notice. I jumped up and followed him all through the lane, calling, Stop thief! There were plenty of people who could have stopped him, but nobody interfered. It was nearly such a person as the prisoner, but I cannot swear to him; he is about the height and figure of the person. I found three of the articles at Queen-square on the Thursday. The man was dressed in a fustian jacket, like a stableman; a jacket was produced at the office which seemed to answer to that the man wore.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 18th of February I apprehended the prisoner, but found nothing on him relative to this business; I asked where he lived; he said over the water. I asked where there, he said he did not know the name of the street, he had only lived there a week. I asked where he lived before that; he said at Westminster, but could not tell me where there. I said I should go and find out. Next morning, as I was taking him from the watchhouse I had a bundle under my arm and told him I had soon found out where he lived; he said I was lucky; I said</p>
               <p>"This bundle came from there" - he said there was nothing there but what was his own. I do not know that he could tell what was in the bundle, but he could see the yellow handkerchief it was wrapped in. Pace and I had found it in the back parlour, next door to the One Tun public-house, Perkin's-rents, Westminster, having been informed that he lodged there. I directed his attention to the bundle at the time, he said there was nothing there but what was his own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The bundle was tied up - A. Yes, he could not see the contents; he saw nothing but the handkerchief it was in - I did not tell him the place I found it at, but said at his lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in reference to the bundle, and not to his lodging, that he said there was nothing there but what belonged to him - No, I pointed to the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not his answer follow immediately after you said you had found where he lodged - A. Yes; but he looked at the bundle and nodded at it, and gave that answer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you find at that lodging - A. I found a silk-handkerchief hanging on a line to dry, a waistcoat and shirt in the drawer, rolled up damp; two picklock-keys, a crow-bar, and two padlocks.</p>

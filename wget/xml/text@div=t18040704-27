             sworn. - On Sunday evening I had been in Westminster, and near eleven o'clock at night I was returning from there to my lodgings, in King-street, Golden-square; coming through <placeName id="t18040704-27-crimeloc145">Whitcomb-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18040704-27-crimeloc145" type="placeName" value="Whitcomb-street"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had drank at many public-houses in the course of that day - were you sober? - A. I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - A. I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen her before? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in company with any other girl before? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear that you were not in company with any other girl? - A. The girls will come in company of men, whether they like it or no.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a stout fellow, you are able to put a girl away if you like - did you drink with her? - A. I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you were sober? - A. I had drank two pints of beer in the course of the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stopped in the street, do you mean to say that you were only talking to her? - A. Nothing further passed than conversation.</p>
               <p>- DONALDSON sworn. - I was constable of the night; the prisoner was brought to me at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the man - did he seem intoxicated? - A. He seemed as if he had been drinking, but was quite sensible of what he was about; the note was not found upon the girl, it was found in the street, as I understood.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am an unfortunate girl; I happened to go into a public-house, the corner of Panton-street, and that gentleman was drinking a pint of ale with a young woman; I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) What sort of a purse was it? - A. (Shews the purse.) This is the purse, and the note was dropped in the scuffle.</p>

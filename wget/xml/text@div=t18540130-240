                  </hi>. I am a dealer in building materials, and reside in St. George's-road, Southwark; my place of business is in Park-place, Walworth. On Monday, 2nd Jan., I went to Meeting-house Yard, Houndsditch—I had bought some houses there to pull down—I bought them of Mr. Freeman, of Montague-street, Russell-square—I went there first about half past 7 o'clock in the morning—I had eight or ten of my men with me—I did not see the prisoner there then—I saw him about half past 12 o'clock, when the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was—I saw a brother of the prisoner there in the morning, the first thing—at half pest 7 o'clock we took off a few tiles—I left the job then—I did not mean to pull the houses down—I saw there was likely to be a breach of the peace, so I left off, and would not go on with it—I went away, and several of my men also—I left some of the men in charge of the premises that had been pulled down—there was a threat of disturbance in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185401300011"></xptr>
               <p>morning; the prisoner's brothers threatened there would be—when I went back, at half past 12 o'clock, I took Sullivan and his two brothers, and two men named Williams and Burns—Mr. Harwood was with me—I took <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Sullivan down to look at the job, to see what he would pull down the three houses for—he usually works for me by the job—I left the five men outside while I went into the buildings, the houses we had partly pulled down, and when I came out again, I saw the wall surrounded by a mob of people, fighting—I should think there were 150 people there at the first commencement, but before it was finished I should think there were 600—my men were completely wedged up; they could not move—the people were striking them in all directions—there were women with brickbats, and pokers, and tongs, and shutter bars, shovels, and all manner of things—I saw the prisoner there—I saw him strike John Sullivan on the head, but what it was with I could not say—he was about ten yards from me—he came from the corner house; a woman gave him something, I could not see what it was; I fancied it was a bit of gas pipe, but I could not swear positively whether it was a gas pipe or a poker; we were all in such a hurry at the time—he struck John Sullivan on the head, and Sullivan dropped just as if he was dead—I was getting out of the mob in the best way I could—I had a shovel—several of them cut at me—one woman cut at me with a poker; I warded it off with the shovel in the best way I could—I got out of the crowd as soon as I could, and went after the police—I went round, and came to Houndsditch again, and saw <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> and John Sullivan—John was bleeding dreadfully—the blood came from the top of his head, and <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> was holding him up, and he was just as if he was fainting—that was about eight or ten minutes after the blow had been given—I believe he was taken to the hospital, I went to the station house—neither I nor my men had given any provocation before we were attacked in this way—they were standing with their hands in their pockets, quite unprepared—they did not anticipate such a thing—I have a written authority from Mr. Freeman (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I did not go back to the premises again—I found two of my men at the station, charged by some of the Jews for assaulting the Jews, and both of them were streaming with blood—one of them, Burns, had his skull fractured, and five of his ribs broken—there were fourteen or fifteen of my men there altogether—before the job was finished, I think I should not exaggerate if I said there were 1,000 people there.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What house was it that you went to first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first house I went to was No. 3, I think—that was the first thing in the morning—it was occupied by tenants—they had had notice to quit—there were tenants to each house—I do not know how many—I went about 7 o'clock in the morning to un roof the houses where the tenants were—it is not the first time we have done it—we do not study their comfort much—snow does not interfere with our work—we do not do it without a notice—I am a building material dealer—I buy houses to pull down, and keep the materials.</p>

On 2nd Jan., I went to the houses in Meeting-house Yard with Mr. Tatum and three or four more, about 12 o'clock—we stood in front of the houses looking at them, to see what the job was worth; while We were there, a noise came to the door, what it was I could not say, and some bricks came towards my legs; a woman came out with a broom</p>

               <p>handle, and a man came out stripped to fight; a mob came round us, and Mr. Tatum said, "You had better go for a policeman, to see whether we are right or wrong, and know what we are to do"—while he was gone a fight commenced in Meeting-house Yard, and I got hit on the head with a poker, and knocked down; who did it I cannot say—I did not see the prisoner there, to my remembrance—I went to the hospital and got my head strapped up; it bled—when I got up, I met a man I knew, and he took me to the hospital—I only remained there while it was dressed; it might be half an hour—I went to the hospital every second day for a fortnight, to get it dressed; it got well then, and I have never felt any effects of it since—I beg for mercy for the prisoner, as I never saw him there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On the 31st of August, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was going up the court; there was a crowd at the bottom of the court; I asked what was the matter; the people said the prisoner was beating his daughter. I said he ought to be ashamed of himself, and returned to my own door. Soon after I heard the women say, he would murder her. I went and stood there some time. The prisoner came out. I was standing in the next yard, which is separated by open palings. He did not speak. I stood there, talking to the women, and saying he ought to be ashamed of himself for using his daughter so, as she had got a young child with her. He said I had no business to trouble my head about it. He went to his gate, held it in his hand, and said to me, 'Come here; I am your man; I will do your business for you." I remained in the next yard. Several words passed between us. I stood within two feet and a half of the rails, in the next yard. He got a cutlass, and made a stab at me through the rails, which entered my thigh about three-quarters of an inch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you strike at him - A. No; I immediately jumped over the rails, he then made another cut at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing when he stabbed you - A. Only that he would do my business for me; a man behind prevented the second stab from touching me, by striking his hand with a stick, I caught hold of the cutlass, we struggled together and both fell down. I got it from him, went into the yard, and the watchman took me into custody, seeing the cutlass in my hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The prisoner was in his own house - A. Yes; I was in the next garden, several people were round. I was sober enough to know what I was about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say let us go and pull the old fellow's tongue out - A. No; I never attempted to go into his yard before he stabbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the magistrate and complained of an assault - A. Yes; I did not feel the stab at the moment.</p>

He said he would go and get half a pint of beer, and forced himself from me and his wife who were holding him. He went into the next yard and said he was determined to pull my father out of his house, and called him bad names. My brother begged of him to go home; my father said if any man entered his premises he would knock him down. Black immediately jumped over the pails and collared my father, my father had not made a blow at him till then; he then made two blows at him with the cutlass, which struck the stones, and pushed him off. Black ran up and struggled with him again, Athel knocked my father down. Black got the sword from him; in the struggle, I got cut, I felt it immediately.</p>

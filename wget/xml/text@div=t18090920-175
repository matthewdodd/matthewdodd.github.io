On the 9th of August I had occasion to go up stairs, I left the shop in the care of Mrs. Leadbetter; when I came down she informed me there were some girls loitering about, she did not like the look of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that they were all four near your shop - A. Yes; there were five, but these four prisoners were four out of the five.

             was nearest the window; I lifted up my finger and said my girl, if you do not go away I will have you taken up; upon which I looked round to a frame of beads in the front of the shop, I perceived that several were taken away; they were hung in a glass frame, enclosed in wood; I had put them up there within an hour. I pursued the prisoners, I overtook them at the distance of about fifty or sixty yards; they were walking along as it in company together.</p>
               <p>Q. How could any person outside of the shop come at these beads - A. They were in a frame hanging upon brass wire; they were locked on the brass rod.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the row of beads appear to have been broken - A. No; the beads were unlocked in their snaps; there were two rows which had not snaps attached to them, they were tied on with blue galloon, they were gone also. Four rows were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell what passed when you overtook them - A. I seized hold of Clancy and Powell and said where are these beads that you have stolen, upon which they said the other girls have got your necklace, pointing to these that ran off; I then left them and pursued Hyams down Little Furnstile, into the passage of Mrs. Skeppington, a chandler's shop; I seized hold of her arm, I said where are the beads you have been stealing, she said she had not stole any thing; Mrs. Skeppington said whatever she has stolen from you she has dropped by her side; on my looking down I found a row of beads by her side, they are necklace beads; I knew them to be mine, they are the beads that I had in my shop, they are worth sixteen pence. I found nothing more upon her; I gave her into the charge of

From her information we went after the others in Newtoner's-lane, they were standing by the side of a passage; upon the prisoner Clancy we found this bracelet, this was the same that we lost from our shop. We took them to the watchhouse; the prisoner Clancy said if you will forgive me, and go along with me, I will find you more. We went to her mother's house in a court in Newtoners-lane and found two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180909200079"></xptr>other rows, they are my property also.</p>

               <p>MRS. SKEPPINGTON. Q. Did you see this girl come into the passage of your shop - A. Yes; Mr. Powell asked her what she had got, she said nothing; I heard something fall, I told him whatever she had I believed she had dropped. The beads were found in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hodge's. Do you live in this neighbourhood - A. I live in Holborn; I had seen Welling about for half an hour, I saw them altogether, I cautioned them.</p>
               <p>Hyams and Clancy said nothing in their defence.</p>
               <p>Powell's Defence. I am quite innocent of it; I met the girls coming down Holborn, I was going of an errand for my mother.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Uxbridge. In consequence of in<lb></lb>formation which I received of the loss of the tea-trays, I went lo the pri<lb></lb>soner's house on Uxbridge-moor on Monday the 19th of January, about six o'clock in the evening—I found him at home—I asked if he had bought any tea-trays since Christmas—he said "No"—I asked him if he had found any—he said, "No," what tea-trays he had got, he had bought of a man named Greenwell, on the Moor—I was in his house at this time, and saw two waiters and a small tray on the mantel-piece—I asked him to allow me to look at one of those on the mantel-piece—he said, "Yes'—I took it in my hand and said it answered the description of the trays stolen from Grainge's—he said, "Well, I will tell you the truth; I found them under some stuff that covers my charcoal in the yard"—he brought me another tray from the corner of the room, or from a cupboard in the same room—I afterwards showed them to Rogers, who identified them—I did not take him into custody till next day—he came up with me that night into Uxbridge of his own accord, he followed me—I showed them to Rogers in his presence—the Moor is nearly half a mile from the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's—I took the trays to my own house till next morning, and he went</p>

               <p>home again—next morning I went before the magistrate and got a search-warrant, but found nothing more—I communicated this to the magistrate in the prisoner's presence—he was remanded till the next day; and while he was in custody, he was in the parlour at the Chequers, (he was ordered to be there all night by the magistrate), he told me that on the Saturday after Christmas-day a person named William Newman, with Gowlett and Robinson, brought a bundle of trays to a public-house on the Moor, where he was having a pint of beer—I know the parties he named, they live with girls who keep them—they go about the country—they are generally at lodging-houses up the Chequers'-yard—he said they came with a bundle of trays tied up in a large shawl-handkerchief, and asked him if he would buy them—he said, no, he would have nothing to do with them—he said his brother-in-law, William Smith, bought them for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and took them to his (the prisoner's) house—there he untied them, and there might be twenty or twenty-one little ones—he could not exactly say how many large ones—that Smith took them and hid them under some stuff which covered his charcoal, and next day, or the day after, Smith took them out from under the stuff, and untied them, and he bought four trays and a gun of Smith—that Smith himself and a person named Mayden went to Colebrook—he said Smith hired a cart at the public-house to take the trays, and said he was going to Redburn fair, instead of which he drove towards Watford—that he told him he sold some at Marple fair—that he returned in two days afterwards, and he and Smith went to Colebrook and sold two waiters for sixpence and a glass of gin and water to Neal, who keeps the Red Lion at Colebrook, and I should find them there—I went and found them—I produce the four trays found at the prisoner's house—Ewer was asked before the ma<lb></lb>gistrate if he had any thing to say—he made a statement, and signed it—I saw him sign it, and saw the magistrate put his name to it—I heard it read to him before he put his name to it, and next day he made another statement—some part of that was taken down—Mr. Dagnall was the ma<lb></lb>gistrate—I was in the room while the magistrate wrote—I did not look over it to know whether it was read correctly to the prisoner—Mr. Bowers, the clerk, is here.</p>

               <p>—he was not bailed the next day, for I brought him to prison, and he was never admitted to bail—he was sent for to the police-office, and came—I did not hold out any threat or inducement to him to confess any thing—I did not say he had better at once say he knew Smith had stolen them—I cautioned him not to say any thing that he would not wish should be named to the magistrate the next day.</p>

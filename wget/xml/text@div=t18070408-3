            . On Thursday the 12th of March I left my house at eight o'clock; I double locked the door when I went out; I returned at half past eight the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080004"></xptr> same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark when you went out. - A. It was dark, but a fine night.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the door when you came home. - A. I found it open; immediately when I got inside of the door, a man rushed out of the parlour. I heard another at the handles of my drawers, which were in the parlour; I heard the drawers open and shut; I only heard the noise; I did not then see the men. I immediately took hold of the man that rushed out of the parlour. I struggled with the man a little; by the time I was got to the cill of the door, I asked him what business he had in my house, he said it is me to be sure, and he ran from me through a court that is facing my house. I had fallen down. Immediately another man rushed out of my parlour, and stepped upon me in getting out; that is all I know of the man; at that time when I went into the parlour, I missed a pair of silver table spoons, which were in the corner of the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you them here. - A. No, I have not recovered any part of the property; I gave the discription of the prisoner to Mr. Clitherow; he asked me if I should know him again, he told me that a little after the time a man came that answered the description I gave him, came into the public house where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that man afterwards. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That man that you saw afterwards is he the prisoner at the bar. - A. He is very much altered, he is not as he was then; he is like him; I should be very sorry to swear to him. I believe him to be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that these things were left in the drawer when you went out. - A. They were; I had seen the spoons in the drawer before I went out; when I was looking for my gloves, the other things I had not seen for many days, they were in he same drawer.</p>

               <p>- KENNEDY. I am an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the prisoner. - A. Yes; I and the prosecutrix went to the Two Brewers public house in Shoreditch; there were about fourteen persons in the tap room. The prosecutrix pointed out the prisoner at the bar, and said he was very much like the man that she had hold off in her house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. She did not say he was the man, but he was like the man. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called no witnesses to character.</p>

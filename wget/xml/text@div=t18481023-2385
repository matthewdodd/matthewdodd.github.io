                  </hi>. I am a book-binder, of Little Queen-street, Holborn—the prisoner was my shopman—it was part of his duty to receive money for me, and to account daily, and pay it over to me. On 18th Oct. I sent him to Mr. Gladwell, of Gracechurch-street, to receive 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went there next day, and Mrs. Gladwell gave me this receipt in the prisoner's writing—he never paid it me, or accounted for it—on 9th Aug. I sent him to Mr. Davey, of Newman-street, for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he brought me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, and entered it in the book.</p>

               <p>Mr. M'Dougal coming to ask repayment of the prisoner of some small sum—he said, "I am surprised that you should be unable to pay me so small a sum, being a partner in a concern which seems prosperous"—I contradicted it, and he insulted me—I doubt whether the business has amounted to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. since June—he had not the entire management of it—his salary was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and his board—he was not engaged at the Eastern Counties Railway all day on 16th Oct.—I have got on without him for a fortnight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother—in Feb. last, Bowden kept a book stall in the Waterloo-road, and from that time down to June, I called on him several times about my brother joining him in the artist's colour trade—he produced two or three lists—one was of Reeve's colours, and said my brother could get them on credit, and he should be very much obliged if I could find out a shop for him which my brother and he were to carry on together—I saw one likely to suit in Little Queen-street, and went with him and my brother to see it—my brother and he agreed to do the repairs, and my brother promised him to obtain credit of gas-fitters, painters, and glaziers—I know that my brother ordered them to do the work, and the plumber's bill was made out in his name—it was agreed that in three or four months, if my brother could get a connection together, his name was to be put up—my brother said it should be Bowden and Robinson—Mr. Bowden said it should be Bowden and Co., as my brother's name was not to appear till they ascertained that the business answered, and, if it did not, Bowden was to carry on his bookbinding in the shop—my brother has been working from seven o'clock in the morning till eleven at night to get a connexion together—there was no appearance of his being a shopman—I never heard the word till I was at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">M'DOUGAL</hi>. The prisoner lodged at my house six months—he was in my debt, and I called on him and said in Bowden's hearing, I was surprised that he, a partner in a successful business, should not be able to pay so small a sum—he said they were new beginners, and were short of money—I believe they both said so.</p>

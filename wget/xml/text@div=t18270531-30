               <p>FRANCES WALLIS. I am a widow, and live in Great Russell-street. On the 20th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Charlotte-street, crossing to go into <placeName id="t18270531-30-crimeloc158">Holborn</placeName>

            . I am beadle of Bloomsbury. On the 20th of April, about half - past two or three o'clock in the afternoon, Mrs. Wallis made a communication to me, and by her description I apprehended the prisoner coming down Church-street, St. Giles - I had another beadle with me - when he saw me, he ran down into a cellar in the street - I went down and secured him - I took him to the watch-house, and then to Marlborough-street, where Mrs. Wallis came and identified him immediately.</p>

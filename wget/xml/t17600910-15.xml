When he was gone, I told the man of it, and order'd him to go and bring him back; he went, and came back again, and told me he had overtaken him, but he had ran away from him, instead of coming with him to me; when my husband came home I told him of the affair; he went to my Lord Mayor and got a warrant; this was on the saturday, and on the sunday he came in the afternoon, and asked my husband to forgive him; my husband told him he would not. The prisoner said he never did such a thing before; he own'd he had taken the cups and saucers, and said he would give my husband half a guinea, if he would not expose him: we executed the warrant, and took him to the poultry counter.</p>

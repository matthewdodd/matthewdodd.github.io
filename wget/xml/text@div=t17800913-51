               <p>The prosecutor came to the justice and got a warrant; I went on board the ship and took the prisoner; after I had taken him the steward and I went into the cabbin together. He told me he took the money out of his master's breeches pocket while he was asleep in the cabbin.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him to induce him to confess? - I only said, what have you done boy with your master's money.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him it would be better to confess? - No, I did not; I asked him what he had done with it? He said, he went ashore that same night, between eleven and twelve o'clock; that he met with two girls in the street; he said he talked to them some considerable time up an alley, and that he gave them two guineas. I asked him whether he went to any house to sleep with them? He said no, he did not; he came on board again at five in the morning; after that he said he went on shore on Saturday and spent a guinea, He made confession before the justice, which I saw him sign. (The confession was read in court.)</p>

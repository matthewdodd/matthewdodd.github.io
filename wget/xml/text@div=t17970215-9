             sworn. - My husband's name is James Callighan; I live in Sun-yard, Nightingale-lane, East Smithfield: On the 17th of January I was in <placeName id="t17970215-9-crimeloc45">Newgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. You lived then where you do now? - A. Yes; he said he was going up to Ely-Place, and I, having an absent bond, that sailors leave with persons to receive six months wages, to leave at captain Manning's, at Ely-place; he asked me, would I go with him, and two other men who were in company with him, to Ely-place, and I went with them; I had called two or three times before at captain Manning's, but he was not at home; the prisoner and one of the men went over to another house, and I and the other man waited till they came out; I did not call at captain Manning's then, I thought it was too late, it was between five and six in the evening; when they came out, they were going my way, and the prisoner missing one of the men in the street, they went into the Magpie again to wait for him, and called for a pot of beer, or two-penny, I cannot tell which; they asked me to drink with them; the man did not come, and when they had drank the beer, we came out and were going towards Nightingale-lane; when we got near the Minories, the other man asked the prisoner to his lodgings; I wished them a good night, and said, I shall be going home; the prisoner said, it was but a little way off where they were going, you may as well come, and I will go with you and see you safe home to your own door; I said, it was getting rather late, and I could not stop, and the prisoner persuaded me, and said, he would not stop many minutes, and away I went to the man's lodging in Petticoat-lane; when I went in, there was a woman and five or six fellows sitting in the room, they had a pot of beer or two-penny, they drank it among them, I don't know whether I drank any or no; as soon as they had drank it, the prisoner and I came away; the prisoner then wanted to go into a public house, the Blue Anchor, in Rosemary-lane; I told him I would not go in, but he prevailed with me, and I went in, and I met with a woman there I knew, and we had a pint of two-penny together; the prisoner wanted me to have something to drink,I refused, and came out by myself, and he followed me out immediately; I went down White's-yard, and he came down after me, and told me to take care, I should fall, the place being a very stony place; when we were about half down that street, he came over to me, and laid hold of both my shoulders, and asked me to kiss him; I put out my hand in this manner, and asked him if that was the friendship he was shewing me all night; with that he broke the string of my cloak, and ran away with it; I screamed out, and cried stop thief; a man and woman came out of their houses, and told me not to go up the back alley after him; I turned back, and went into the next public-house, and delivered the watch and money I had in my bosom to them; I was in the public-house some time before I could tell them what had happened to me, and then they sent somebody home with me; the next morning I took a woman with me and went to the public-house, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150026"></xptr>they delivered me my watch and money; then she went with me to the Blue Anchor, and the prisoner was sitting in the tap-room when we went in, that was between nine and ten o'clock; I called him over, and told him to deliver the cloak to me that he ran away with the last night, and that if he did not I would send out for a runner for him; he said, that he had pawned it in Nightingale-lane; I went there and enquired, but did not find it; meanwhile, as we were talking, the other woman went out for the runner, and he ran away from me while the woman was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to the woman before him about going for the runners? - A. Yes; I told her to go for the runners; I ran after him as fast as I could, and called to every one to stop him; he ran round by Wellclose-square, and a mob gathering round him he stopped, and came from the mob back to Rosemary-lane, and I followed him; I was crying; a woman came up and asked me what was the matter; I told her, and she went up to him, and he agreed with me and the woman to deliver the cloak if we would not raise a mob about him; and the prisoner and I went with the woman into her house in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her name? - A. Deveral; he said, the cloak was in pawn for four shillings, and he had not the money; he wanted me to go with him where he could raise the money; I told him I would not go out of the room, and if he did not send somebody for it I would send for the officers; he then went out, and I followed him; I lost sight of him near the pawnbroker's in Rosemary-lane; he returned back to me in the street, and brought a duplicate with him, which he delivered me, and promised faithfully, before the man and his wife, to bring the money at eight o'clock at night to this man's room; I saw no more of him till he was taken the day following, at the office in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the duplicate lead you to the shop where the cloak was? - A. Yes; in Rosemary-lane, the pawnbroker is here; I delivered the duplicate to the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The night she was in my company, ask her why she would go with me to captain Mackey's, in Ely-place? She forced herself into my company.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you force yourself into his company? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you offer to go to the captain's with him? - A. No; he asked me.</p>

I keep the Prince Albert public house, St. Martin's Lane, three doors from Aldridge's—on the night of 2nd November my potman fastened up the house before going to bed, and before going to bed I saw that everything was fast—the door was bolted top and bottom, and the shutters up—when I came down in the morning, about 3 o'clock, I law three constables in the house, the door was open, and I found a sack con<lb></lb>taining 10 1/2 lbs. of cigars, two bottles of brandy, and sixty-three half-ounces of tobacco, done up in separate packets; they had been removed from the place where they had been—the value of the property all together was about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the sack was not mine.</p>

On the 2nd November, about 12.45 in the morning, I was on duty in Great St Andrew's Street, about 100 yards from Aldridge's—I noticed three men loitering about—one of them went into a doorway at the corner of Tower Street—I went towards him—he left there, and went towards two men who were standing against the prosecutor's house—I went up to them—I heard one of them say, "Is it all right?" twice—I asked what they were loitering about there for—they went away—I think the prisoner came out of the Prince Albert public-house, and looked round very cautiously—he saw me and Campbell, another constable, who had come up, and immediately ran away up West Street—I pursued him up West Street, down Litchfield Street, up Princes Court, into Princes Row; and when I got up to him there, he was right bang on the top of police-constable 180, who was lying on the flat of his back, struggling with the prisoner—I pulled him off, and we brought him back to the public-house—while we were ringing the landlord up, another man ran out of the door of the public-house—two constables went after him, but did not catch him—when I got into the house I saw this sack in front of the bar, containing this property.</p>

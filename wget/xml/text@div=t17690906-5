            . I sell fruit about the streets. I have known Dean about three or four months, and Caton about three or four years. I was at the Running-horse one Saturday night, July 7, at St. Giles's, between eleven and twelve o'clock, when the prosecutor came in: I never saw him before. There were the two prisoners, and

            . The prosecutor called for a pint of beer. Murry said to me, This old man has got a great deal of money: he never comes this way, but he takes five or six guineas. He sat down, and wanted change for a guinea. The landlord could not give it him. He said he was belated, and would give any thing to lie down till morning. Murry said to me, You fool, if you don't take him to your room, you are to blame. I took a candle, and he went with me, with a pint of beer in his hand, to my lodging in <placeName id="t17690906-5-crimeloc28">Maynard-street</placeName>

I was pulling off my gown. He got into bed. I said I was very sick, and wanted a dram: he desired I would not go yet. I had taken two guineas and a half out of his breeches pocket, and had it in my hand: the breeches lay in a chair. Immediately up came Murry, and the two prisoners. The prosecutor was then going to get up. They rushed in, and took the money out of my hand, and his watch out of his breeches, and broke the string in getting it out. The man said, For God's sake don't use me ill. They went off, and bid me come along. Murry sold the watch.</p>

As soon as she went out of the room, three men came in, and one stood over me while the others rifled my pockets. I can't say I know any of them, it was dark, and I was very much in liquor, but I might as well have ventured my life to have gone home, as to go to lie there.</p>

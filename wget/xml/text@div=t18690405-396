I live at 60, Bancroft Road, Mile End—on 6th March, about 6 o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by the police, and found my clock was gone from the dining room shelf, worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen it since—I also missed three coats—I saw them all safe the night before—the parlour window had been unfastened, and had been closed again—I had fastened it the night before—one of the coats (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine, and the others belong to my son-in-law.</p>

About 11 o'clock, on 6th March, I saw the prisoner with another man in the Stepney Road—the prisoner was carrying a hamper on his head, up side down, as if it was empty—I went up to him and said, "What have you got there?"—he said, "Nothing—I took the hamper from him, and found a pair of gloves, a clock, two coats, and a duster—the other man ran away immediately—the prisoner struggled to get away, but I held him—he said he met the man by Stepney Green, and he asked him to carry the hamper to Whitechapel Church for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he did not say he met the man at the Earl Grey.</p>

I live at 2, Edward Street, Stepney, and am a labourer—about 5.50, on the 6th March, I passed the prosecutor's house, in the Bancroft Road—I saw the prisoner standing in front of the parlour window—he had a brown parcel in his right hand—he had a brown coat, and a high hat on—I saw another man get out of the window on to the step, and he tamed round and put the window down—he then jumped down from the window, came out of the gate, and both went away—I afterwards picked the prisoner out of six persons at the Court—I am quite sure he is the man I saw at the window—I saw his face plainly.</p>

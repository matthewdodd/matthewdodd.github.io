            . I live at Hoxton; my husband is a cotton manufacturer. Mrs. Ronalds left two boxes in my care; they were both locked; when brought one of them fell down, and the lock burst. On the 30th of June I saw several articles behind a bag of wood in our house. I looked at it, and found it belong to these boxes left under my care. I informed my husband of it. They were afterwards removed by the prisoner. There was no other person had access to the place besides our own family. The prisoner was a <rs id="t18130714-94-deflabel548" type="occupation">porter</rs>

They were placed between the cotton bags, and were taken away at different times. I informed my husband of it; he had an officer. The prisoner was taken up, and searched in my presence, and a towel was found about him that belonged to Mr. Ronalds; it was marked with her name.</p>

            . On the 30th of June, I was informed by my wife of the things being concealed in the warehouse. The prisoner had access to that warehouse; none of my other workmen had. In the evening I went into the warehouse; I found several things concealed under a wood bag, and on the Saturday the officer apprehended him as he was going home, brought him back, and searched him, and a towel of Mrs. Ronalds' was found on him. I had no reason to suspect the prisoner until this unfortunate affair.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street office. On Friday the 2nd of July, in the evening, I went to Mr. Claxton's house; Mr. Claxton informed me that he had suspicion of the prisoner taking some things that were under his care. At eight o'clock at night I saw the prisoner going out; I did not conceive that he had got any thing upon him; I would not interrupt him, and stop him. On Saturday I attended again at one o'clock at noon; the prisoner went out to his dinner. Mrs. Claxton went into the warehouse, and informed me that the towel was gone, which she had seen there a few minutes before. I then immediately went after the prisoner, and apprehended him within two doors of his own house; I told him his master wanted to speak to him. I took him into his master's parlour, and searched him; I found two candles in his jacket pocket; they are the property of his master; they are not in the indictment. He took his hat off, and in the hat I found this towell marked I R. I searched him. I searched his lodging; his wife was in the room. I told her I had apprehended her husband; I was come to search the lodging; in the drawers, and upon the top of the drawers I found all the things in the indictment.</p>

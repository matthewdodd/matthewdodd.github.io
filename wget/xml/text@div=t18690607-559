               <p>Thursday night I went to bed about 1 o'clock, and left every<lb></lb>thing safe—next morning, at 5.40, I found the doors and windows open, and found no clothes to put on, I had to borrow some of my neighbour's—I mined a great quantity of clothing, value 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money—I gave information—I saw the prisoner at 12 o'clock, and accused him of it—he said, "Well, lock me up, and do your best"—another person was with him—he had been about the neighbourhood for some time, and had threatened to rob me—this silk, collars, tobacco, and other articles are mine (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I examined the prosecutrix's place, and found that the door of No. 10, next door, had been left open, and some-one had gone through and got over a low wail at the back of the prosecutrix's house, which had been entered from the rear—I found the goods the same evening, at 8, Paternoster Row, Spitalfields—the prisoner occupies a back room there on the ground floor, where there are some boards, which can be taken up, and goods could be dropped through into a cellar where I found them—he was taken the same evening—I burst the cellar door open, and found a cigar box lying there, and a bundle—I entered the prisoner's room by the back window, as the door was padlocked, and found some cigars and tobacco, and this piece of silk—the cellar door was nailed up.</p>

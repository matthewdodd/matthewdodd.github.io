                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Bailey, of 6, Kingston. Terrace, Charlton, a naval officer—I have known the prisoner between five and six years—when I first knew him we were living at Portsmouth, and he was apprenticed to a chemist there—I have three, daughters, Mary Ann, the eldest, was then in a situation at Southsea, but living at home with the others—she was very little acquainted with the prisoner then that I knew of—about December, 1875, we moved to Charlton, and the prisoner came to lodge with us—he was out of a situation a fortnight after he came—my daughters were all living with me there—on Monday afternoon, 4th December, I had some words with him, about being about the house, and my daughter took it up—I told him that unless he got more energy about him he should never have a daughter of mine—I had not noticed that he had</p>

               <p>been paying attention to her; I said that because he was at all times very indolent; he would go out with her when he had a chance—he had not made any proposal to marry her to my knowledge—about 9 o'clock that evening, I was having my supper in the back kitchen with my three daughters, a younger boy, and the prisoner—about 9.20, I heard the postman's knock—I had part of a glass of beer on the table; I went to the door, and took in two letters—I left the prisoner in the kitchen, nobody else; the others had gone upstairs before me—I took the letters upstairs to my daughter's—one of them was in the front parlour; I gave one of the letters to her, I had to go up to the second flight of stairs to the eldest, and I gave it her there; the third daughter was in bed; after giving them the letters, I came down towards the kitchen; as I was descending, I met the prisoner by the side of his room door, ascending; he slept on the second-floor—I wished him good night—I then went into the yard, and on returning, I was in the act of going down the kitchen stairs, when I met my second daughter, Elizabeth; she gave me the glass of beer in my hand that I had left half finished—she gave it me at the top of the first flight of stairs—I had not asked her to fetch it for me; she had brought it for me before, if I left my beer—I took it out of her hand, and went downstairs—I smelt it, or rather I was going to put it to my mouth on the stairs—I noticed that it had a very peculiar smell, it was so overpowering that I stood it down on the table and drew back for a second and smelt it, and said "Some one has been putting something in my beer"—it had a sort of almond smell—I took the glass, and threw the contents into a glass dish with some pickling vinegar in it, which had come from some pickled cabbage—I put the glass back on the kitchen table—I then closed the door, and went upstairs to my bed room; that was about 9.55—I slept in the second-floor front room, the prisoner slept underneath in the first-floor back—my daughter, Mary Ann, was in the habit of sleeping with me—we both went to bed together that night about 10.15, we read till about 12 o'clock, and then went to sleep—I was awoke by a man's hand on my throat, pressing heavily on my throat, and I could feel the mouth of a bottle at my lips; the stuff, whatever it was, was over my face—I struggled violently, and in the struggle, I awoke my daughter—the liquid smelt like the beer—ray lips were in a terrible state for about a fortnight—I bled from the mouth—I rubbed my mouth violently with my night gown—I could not see the face of the person who was thus attacking me—I could swear to him by his back, I saw his back—after he released me I fell off the bed, the window was exactly opposite the, door, and I saw him distinctly go down the stairs leading to his bed-room—there was no candle in my room, it was moon-light—he had no coat on, he was in his shirt sleeves—it was the prisoner's habit to hang his coat in the kitchen—my daughter screamed when I awoke her, and we both went into another room, and gave an alarm—I saw nothing more of the prisoner—he had not given me any intimation of his intention to leave—I was got out of the house that night, and went next day on board ship with my husband—I afterwards saw some handkerchiefs given to the police, one knotted and the others folded.</p>

                  </hi> I reside at 79, Great Tower Street, City, and am a Fellow of the Chemical Society and of the Society of Analysts—on Monday, 11th December, I received from constable Morgan this small phial, tied over with a piece of wash leather secured with red tape and bearing the seal of the Woolwich station—I also received this larger bottle with the contents said to be ale and vinegar; also the night dress and three hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs; those are the thing upon which I formed an analysis—the smaller phial contained, as it came to me, two or at most three drops of a liquid—on removing the cork there was a very perceptible smell of prussic acid, or some substance resembling prussic acid—I tested it in five different ways and I found prussic acid and nothing else, and if the cork is removed now there is still a sufficient quantity adhering to the sides of the bottle to give a very perceptible smell—the larger bottle contained 5 1/2 fluid ounces of a liquid; that is it was nearly two-thirds full; that liquid had a peculiar smell of beer, pickles, and prussic acid mixed—I tested it in altogether seven different ways, and 1 found prussic acid present by each of those processes—I took another portion and estimated as accurately as it was possible to do so the amount of prussic acid and it was a trifle under a quarter of a grain of actual dry prussic acid—it is an extremely volatile acid, there<lb></lb>fore the amount found in the liquid would not represent the amount which was in it before it was exposed in the basin for some hours—I therefore made an experiment with a liquid of the same kind, beer and vinegar, putting into it four times the quantity of prussic acid that I found in this bottle, and at the end of six hours I found seven-eighths of what was originally present had evaporated and only one eighth was left,; therefore if that calculation was fairly applicable, this liquid would have originally contained eight times this quantity, or two entire grains, which would be nearly double a fatal dose, nearly two fatal doses—I then examined the handkerchiefs—these two were knotted together, I untied them and cut them in numerous places and took out from each place a small piece and tested it, and it contained minute traces of prussic acid—in that portion that was tied together the whole of the handkerchief had evidently been saturated in some way with prussic acid, and wherever I applied the tests I had the reaction—I cut the other handkerchief also in the same way in eight or ten different parts and wherever I cut it I found an approximately equal amount, as if it had been saddened by being dipped in or sprinkled with the acid, and then squeezed—I have taken off the breast of the nightdress and cut several pieces in the same way—there are distinct spots of somewhat large size which have been moistened with prussic acid and which show the reaction—I also found on the breast, in a position that would perhaps correspond with that, some very minute lines, which I have microscopically examined and found to be blood, and round those lines there was a distinct stain of prussic acid, as if the lip or hand from which the blood had come had at the time bees moistened with the acid—there were some four or five of those minute lines in the immediate neighbourhood of the blood stains, so that the poison and the blood might have been wiped away together—I searched for other poisons and found none.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. How long had you been up stairs before you came down? A. Five minutes - he had cut three or four pieces of bread and butter, and he had the tea-pot in his hand and poured out the tea - I hardly know whether he had commenced eating - I believe I had made the tea before I left the kitchen - I do not recollect whether he eat several pieces of bread and butter, but he was not there five minutes after I came down - the street door was shut to, not locked - it it always shut - I believe it was shut - I did not take particular notice of it - it might have been open, for what I know - the area gate was shut with a spring lock - a catch which draws back inside - a person could not open it outside - there is no handle outside - a person might get over the area rails - the door leading from the area into the house was fastened, so that nobody could get in - it was fastened by the catch - the area gate was locked, and the key hung up - I asked him to go out and get me some pump water - he had to go down into a street below us, and he told me to leave the gate open, and he could come in; but I did not, I locked it and unlocked it to let him in when he came - I stopped down stairs in my pantry, the whole of the time till he came back - I then went to the gate, and saw him coming up Wellington-street - I have known him four years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. While you were up stairs was anybody down stairs but him? A. Nobody, I am positive - I saw the cook up stairs, and there was nobody down stairs but him.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Crucifix, as cook - I saw the prisoner there on that morning - I did not sit down to breakfast with him - I remember the footman carrying the breakfast things up stairs - I was in the front parlour at that time - after he had gone up I came down stairs and saw the prisoner in the pantry - he was brushing his hat, and came out of the pantry into the kitchen - he seemed rather confused, but I took no notice of that - he went out of the kitchen into another place, and came into the kitchen again - I said, "You had better get your breakfast, and I will send the footman down" - I did so - I went up stairs and sent the footman down, and he went down, and they had their breakfast - I did not have mine - I did not see the prisoner again till he was gone, when I went up stairs to send the footman down - I left nobody down stairs but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The footman and you were both away from the kitchen together at first? A. Yes; I came down and found the prisoner in the pantry - I went into the kitchen, and he followed me, and he when I left him the last time he was getting his breakfast - I might be absent one minute, when I went to send the footman down - a person could not open the doors, because the gate was locked, and the key was inside the house - there is a key-hole outside the door, but the key was in the lock, inside - nobody could have put a key into that key-hole.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the footman went up with the breakfast thing you were in the parlour? A. Yes; I was not two minutes before I came down, and found him in the pantry - I had been cleaning the parlour.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Crucifix, as housemaid - I saw the prisoner there that night and next morning - he stayed all night - next morning, after he was gone, I missed two gold watch keys, and a steel watch chain off the kitchen dresser - I had seen them safe the night before, about ten o'clock, on the 22nd of January - I missed them about twenty minutes after he was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They belong to you? A. They do - I know the door leading into the area, and know that the key was in the door - my fellow-servant forgot to say the key-hole has a brass plate on it outside - it has been so ever since we have been in the house - there is no possibility of opening the door outside - Dr. Crucifix had not given him leave to sleep in the house - it was not known to me untill the morning - I left the kitchen about ten minutes after ten o'clock, and left the prisoner sitting on a chair - I know he was there then, but did not know he slept there till towards morning - he has slept there before, not repeatedly - it might be two or three times - Dr. Crucifix never knew of it - he has gone to the theatre, and come home with the footman, and slept there always without Dr. Crucifix's knowledge - no other person slept in the house - I saw the prisoner before I went to bed - I did not know of his sleeping there - there was no other young man there that I knew of - I slept with the cook - there are three servants, the cook, housemaid, and footman.</p>

            . I am groom to Mr. Powell, at Muswell-hill. About half-past five o'clock, on the 14th of April, I heard a noise at our bell - I went up to the gate, and saw the prisoner and another young man with him; the prisoner had an apron - I saw them open the apron, and put a bell in it - I went up to them, and they both ran away; I pursued, and never lost sight of them - the prisoner threw himself into a hedge; there were six bells in the apron - Mr. Sander claimed one of them; I missed our bell when I went up to the gate.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was getting up that morning, the 14th of April; I looked out of the window, and saw the prisoner and another standing on the top of the hill, facing Mr. Norris' gates - they came about half way down the hill, and crossed the road; that was about half a mile from Mr. Sander's - I then saw them in the field, and found two of the clappers of the bells near where they had been standing.</p>

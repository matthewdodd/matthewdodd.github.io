Last Friday week, a little after nine o'clock in the evening, there came a knock or a ring at the door; I opened the door, the prisoner asked me was the doctor at home; I said at this moment he is just gone out, but I expect he will be in soon; he said have you any body in the house that can give me an answer to this letter; I told him yes, if you walk in possibly they can; he gave me a letter into my hand, I told him to walk into the hall; this is the letter: he came into the hall, and I shut the door; I left him in the hall and was going up to my mistress in the drawing room with the letter, I heard the street door open when I was half way going up; I saw the prisoner lay hold of the blue great coat, he let it go and took this one; there were two great coats hanging up in the hall when he took this one; he got towards the door, I jumped down after him; when he saw me he went to shut the door; I got my knee against the door and kept it open; I went to lay hold of him, he let the great coat fall off his arm, made a swing, and got away from me. I picked up the great coat.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time you picked up the great coat was it without the street door - A. Yes; he ran towards James street; I pursued him; the watchman sprang his rattle, he turned down King's road, I was as near him as possible; I saw a man lay hold of him, he was never out of my sight.

            . Q. Do you remember on Friday sennight hearing the cry of stop thief - A. Yes; I was just below Mr. Garrow's door in Bedford row; I saw the prisoner running and several others after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that servant, the black man - A. Yes; the prisoner turned towards King's road; I stopped him; the servant came up, we took him back to Dr. Temple's house, and from there to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I will endeavour to occupy the time of the court as little as possibly I can. I have been in the habit of teaching privately; from the unexpected loss of several scholars, I was a long time almost without employment, with a family of six children; I was obliged to let my rent run very much behind; the consequence was I was not able to pay the debt, for which I happened to be arrested; and having spent all the money I could raise by my clothes to support myself and family while I was in prison; I got released by a lady who was my scholar; I then had a situation to go into the country, but unfortunately my wife was taken in labour six weeks before she expected. I have since got some little employment by writing. I have now another child; the youngest is five months, and the second not twenty months, driven to the utmost distress; hearing my little children crying for bread, and I had none for them, on my coming by Dr. Temple's house the coat struck me - I had not strength to resist the temptation, but yielded to the weakness of my nature.</p>

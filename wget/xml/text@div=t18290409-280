In Barbican; I bought them between eleven and twelve o'clock, and he met me about one - I had seen Payson the day before in Petticoat-lane, where I stand every afternoon to sell goods; he asked me if I would buy some blue muffin-plates, and told me he lived at No. 3, Three Tun-court, Redcross-street - I offered him a 5l. note; there was some difficulty about changing it, and I went to Mr. Mansfield for change as I deal there - I told him I should go there; he made no objection - I returned in about two hours, and he was still there.</p>

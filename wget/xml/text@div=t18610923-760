On 11th September, I was called to the shop and the prisoner was given into my charge—she said, "Do not you touch me, I live in a policeman's house, and I am respectable"—she put her right hand to her mouth—I laid hold of her by the neck, before and behind, and she threw herself on the ground—I kept hold of her throat, had she endeavoured to gulp something down—I felt something pass down her throat, I then let go of her—I asked her for the bad money she had—she said she had none, she had only a good half-crown—I found on her a good half-crown and a farthing—I asked her where she lived, she said, Tichfield-street, Soho, the first floor back room—I took her to the station, and then went to her address, saw Mrs. Dickens, the landlady, who took me to the back room first floor, where I found the male prisoner—I asked him his name—he said, "Parr"—I told him his wife was in custody for passing had money, and asked him whether he had any bad money in the room—he said that he had not—I searched the room, and found in a washhand-stand drawer, wrapped up in a piece of paper, these nine bad half-crowns (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took him in custody, and found on him three shillings and three half-pence—I saw the landlady next morning, she gave me these three bad half-sovereigns (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

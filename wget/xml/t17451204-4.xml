I saw him at work about a Quarter of an Hour, and I went home that Night. He came Home very much wounded, and I asked him how it happen'd; and he said two Men came into the Shop ( the Prisoners at the Bar) and they threatned his Life. The Wound, I believe, was an Inch and a Quarter broad and long; he bled very much; I got him a Pennyworth of Diaculum, and scraped some Lint, and made a Plaister, and put it on, and put him to Bed; and I put a Sheet under his Leg: He bled very much, and had no Sleep that Night, but was Light-headed. There was among the Wheelwrights a Confederacy, or a Combination; and these were those that threatned both Master and Man; and they said that they would do it for them, and they doubled their Fists; and

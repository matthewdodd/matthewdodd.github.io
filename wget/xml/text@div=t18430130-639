                  </hi>. I am a general salesman, in Upper St. Martin's-lane. I have a brother a partner, named David Thompson—he is married—the pri-soner was in our service about ten months—I mused some coats—she was spoken to about them, but she was not suspected of theft at all then—on Wednesday, the 18th of Jan., my sister happened to let down the prisoner's bedstead, and found a pair of trowsers—she called her into the parlour and said to me,"Charles, do you know anything about these trowsers?"—I said, "No, I do not"—I said, "Mary, this looks very black indeed; you kiow well we have lost coats, and two other coats on another occasion, we cannot find out where they are gone to"—she said, "O master Charles, I have dose nothing wrong at all"—I went and told my brother, who came over immediately, and charged her with having some knowledge of the coats, and she seid she had not, neither had she taken anything at all belonging to us, we were quite wel<lb></lb>come to search her boxes—ray brother said, "You have no occasion to be quite so fast, we shall certainly do that; perhape you will have no ebjection to let Mrs. Thompson look at your box"—the prisoner took her keys, and went and opened a box—I saw this guard—I said, "Where did you get this?"—she said, "It is mine"—she afterwards admitted taking it—it belongs to other guards in the shop—we called in a policeman, aid found a prayer book, a printed book, three handkerchiefs, a piece of calico, a watch guard, six seals, two keys, a head ornament, and a buckle—the value of the whole of this is about 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know these articles—here is my mark in the prayer book and Bible—here is written, "Steal not this book, far fear of shame, for here you see the owner's name. A present to Mary Riley from her father"—this book has my private mark in one corner, and was in my possession while the prisoner was our servant, and this ether book I can prove was lost last May—she has written in this, "A gift Mary Ann Riley by her mother, Aug. 31st, 1832," and it was not published till 1839—this book and brush have my marks on them—we cannot find the coats—the buckle, and head ornament I can swear to having seen in the stock—they had no mark on them—they are our property—she had no right to them—she acknowledged to taking these, bat not any wearing apparel whatever—here is a handkerchief edged with lace—it belongs to us—I know it by the edging—she denied that it was ours—it has been washed, and the mark is very illegible to any person not acquainted with it, but I can swear to it as being my mark.</p>

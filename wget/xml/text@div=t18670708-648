               <p>going down the street with a girl—two or three minutes afterwards I saw him in Cartwright Street tussling with two or three men and a woman—I went up to him, two of the men and the woman went away, and he had hold of Driscoll; he held him fast till I got to him—he showed me his trousers, the pocket was torn from them—he said he had been robbed—I laid hold of Driscoll—shortly after Crawley came back and tried to get Driscoll from me, and asked me not to lock him up—the girl also came back and gave the prosecutor his handkerchief, and said there were his things and begged me not to lock Driscoll up; Driscoll handed back this knife to the prosecutor, and said that was his knife—I drove Crawley away and told Badfield to take him.</p>

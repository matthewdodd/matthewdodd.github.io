This chain was handed to me by the prisoner, about one o'clock, on the 24th of March—he asked me if it was gold—I said it was—he said he picked it up in the kennel, in Compton-street, that he dropped some halfpence, and he picked the chain up with them—I detained him.</p>

The prisoner was my errand-boy on the 23rd of March—this chain is gold, and is mine—I had seen it safe on the evening of the 23rd of March—it was kept in the counting-house, but that evening I had used more aquafortis on it than I wished, and I put it in water to counteract it, and put it in my parlour—the prisoner left me about ten o'clock that night, and returned in the morning—I am sure it is my chain—a part of my label was on it when I saw it at the pawnbroker's—it is worth 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I think the servant took it away in the water, and threw it in the dust; and the next morning the prisoner was set to look in the dust for a ring that I had lost, and I think he found this chain there—I asked if he had seen it—he said he had not—that was between nine and eleven o'clock, and he did not leave my house till half-past twelve—he was rather later than usual.</p>

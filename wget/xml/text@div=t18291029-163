            . I am a watchman at Hoxton. On the 8th of October, from a quarter to half-past five o'clock, I was finishing my round, and saw the prisoner and three witnesses removing a piece of timber - they then removed three other pieces; I said nothing to them, but when I went off duty I informed the prosecutor, who identified the wood - we got an officer, and took the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the watch. I went to the sewer and took the three witnesses, and by direction of the Magistrate I took the prisoner at his own house - in going to the office he asked if he could not see the prosecutor, and beg his pardon, or arrange it with him, and said he would take the timber to where he took it from.</p>

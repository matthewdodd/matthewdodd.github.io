                  </hi>. I know M'Kenna—I have no knowledge of Ryan—when M'Kenna was apprehended, I was sitting on the stairs with him—I had been in his company from six to twelve o'clock—at five minutes to twelve we left the public-house, and were going in next door, to No. 2, and met the police<lb></lb>man on the beat—he spoke something to M'Kenna which I could not under<lb></lb>stand, seemingly a little in liquor—I and M'Kenna stayed there some time, till the family thought proper to go to bed—M'Kenna was a little the worse for liquor—we stood in the passage, and then sat on the stairs, till the policeman came and took M'Kenna—he had not been outside the door since twelve, and I had not left his company.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you married? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am single—I am a servant out of a situation at present, and live in lodgings—on 6th Jan. I lodged at No. 5 in the same court—I did not go home, because I did not like to leave this man, because he was intoxicated, and not able to take care of himself—he was not very drunk—we sat at No. 2 till it may be past one o'clock—then they went to bed, and we were obliged to turn out—I met with M'Kenna at six o'clock, and he never was out of my com<lb></lb>pany for a moment—I am on my oath—we stood outside the door, just about twelve o'clock, and Notley came up and muttered something—he was so much the worse for liquor that he muttered his words, and staggered like wise, I have not much acquaintance with drunken people—I had no bonnet on that night; I came out in my dress, without bonnet or shawl—I did not wear a bonnet any part of the evening—I stood in the court without bonnet or shawl—it was a very few minutes—I know nothing of this bonnet—it certainly is not mine; it never was mine; I never saw it before—it has been on my head; it was put on in the station-house by a policeman—I do not know how it fitted me, because it was not mine—I have not had the bonnet I have now got on, long; it is not mine—this is the first day I have worn it, and yesterday, I borrowed it to look smart to come here—I was here yester<lb></lb>day, but not in Court—my own bonnet is at borne—it is a Tuscan bonnet, I mean straw, trimmed with green ribbons—the lady who lent me this bonnet is not here; it was my landlady's daughter—I last lived at Mr. Wiltshire's, the City Dining-rooms, 58, Cheapside, as kitchen-maid—I lived there six months—it was a pretty good place—I left because we disagreed about wages, and have never been in a situation since.</p>

               <p>Russell has stated that he saw M'Kenna and Ryan together after twelve o'clock that night—is it true or false? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—Ryan was not in M'Kenna's company during any part of the time I was with him—I live at No. 5—the Catherine Wheel is No. 3—to go there for any errand I should not put on my bonnet or shawl—I never had my bonnet on from six—I do not know where M'Kenna lives—he does not live in the alley—I know he lives at some distance, and would have had to have gone home through the street—I know nothing about touching the policeman—I never saw him after twelve, and I had not seen him before, for I was in doors—I did not see him in the Catherine Wheel—M'Kenna was fiddling—I believe he gets his living so—I am sure I did not see Russell that night before M'Kenna was taken—Ryan was not in M'Kenna's company—I was not with them at any time that evening—a policeman could not have turned his light on us all three, and seen us altogether—if any policeman has sworn it, it is false.</p>
